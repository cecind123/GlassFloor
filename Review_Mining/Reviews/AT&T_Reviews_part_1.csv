rating,review
bad,"Hands down worst place to work if you have any kind of life out side of work, they have horrible days off poor insurance and there run their help like rented mules.. att only cares about profit margin, that's it"
bad,working in at&t operator services was pure  torture. very hostile work environment.every location i worked in was shut down. management was very hostile towards occupational employees
bad,"In order to truly succeed in this line of work you must be very outgoing and personable. If you are timid or shy you wont make it in this field. Door to door sales isn't for everyone but it can be very rewarding in terms of pay if you put in the effort and know how to engage in conversation with complete strangers. Its different then most other sales related jobs because as a door to door rep you are going on their property so most people will feel like you are trying to scam them so its your job to let them know why you are there, what company you represent , and why they should use your service."
bad,"Dtv does mot work well, the reception is not working well . Customer are upset with long holds with customer service. "
bad,They made me travel 109 miles everyday when they had a store just opened and couldn’t move me there poor customer service too. Everyone there was dead
bad,"AT&T doesn't care about its employees. They ONLY care about profits. There is no opportunity for advancement, no matter what anyone tells you. Unless you are a brown nose, don't expect to make a career here."
bad,"Very little in the way of assistance or teamwork, the platforms are very very old, broken most of the time. I had 5 managers three of which i never met face to face? Maybe in place of buying media companies, they should focus on building a strong networking company?? and really taking care of all the people that work there."
bad,"Poor field managers."
bad,"This place is a life sucking company. The store I worked at was lucky for volume where we could hit the outrageous goals set. There is a store 15 minutes away where they won't hit goals 8/12 months, so they get paid $0 in commission. Oh, not to mention if they fire you or you leave for whatever reason, they don't have to pay you any commission you earned, at all. This place will cause you to hate sales. Stay away"
bad,Workers got in trouble because their children would get sick. If a customer got hostile with you the management left you alone then proceeded to get onto you for not making a sale. There was no winning  the money was good but the management made nothing worth having
bad,Very fast paced and unattainable goals. Leadership is not very helpful. Very high turn over rate. Zero work life balance. If your looking for a career this is not the place.
bad,"Company facilitated HIPAA/ privacy etc violations of customers and also participates in illegal retaliation with employees and discrimination. Poor workig conditions and management (regional, even executive level) is poor and do nothing for regular employees"
bad,This company only cares about sales. Do not care about the employee at all. As long as you lie and sell them you’ll get recognized but if you’re an honest seller then you will get in trouble. The manager micro manages a lot and she will follow you to the back or the bathroom to ask questions about your customer. Do not work here. Even the new people hate it.
bad,Not enough training from the support teams. Better knowledge of how people learn would of be great. Helping tounderstand technical aspects of the job and support functions.
bad,"This company treats employees and customers like badly.  They only care about money, how to make more money and all the different ways to lie to the customer to wrangle more money out of them."
bad,"Take it if you need it. Good pay, politics are garbage . The supervisors act like they are your buddy but lol for any reason to write you up. Dont ever call out sick."
bad,"Don't work here unless you need a job. They screwed me out if a job. They screwed me out of a schedule after working for them for 3 years. Also, no raises."
bad,I asked to go from full time to part because I had recently started school and my district manager told me no because out of the six people in the store only me and one other guy was full time. That doesn’t have anything to do with me. I’m always going to pick education over a dead end sales job.
bad,"Retail side of AT&T is an absolute Joke! They don't care for employees at all! They treat you like a nobody. Always telling you that ""you are replaceable""  They don't care about existing customers only New ones. As a former employee being a Sales rep was one of the most difficult jobs. Because higher ups want you to only focus on NEW customers. They don""t care for existing. When you upgrade a customer you get yelled at and put down. Compensation is a joke. "
bad,Empresa que presume no discriminar a sus empleado y me lleve muy mal sabor de boca.
bad,This was the most ghetto place I've ever worked at. People would be getting high at their desks! Management would be doing drugs with them too! I wouldn't recommend it.
bad,This company does not care about there employees. The work schedule is terrible you have to bid on a schedule every 3 months.if you're sick and go to the doctor don't worry about getting a doctor's note because it's still an occurrence.
bad,Company is completely crooked and will snake you every chance they get. This is by far the most conniving company I've ever been employed for. Oh and the Union is garbage. Complete garbage.
bad,It’s ok. But at times its ruff. The environment has left the company and in the process from the employees also. There is many thinks it needs to work on for the employees.
bad,"I am a DIRECTV legacy employee.  After AT&T merged, they quickly went through and took away a lot of employee perks we used to have.  It brought down morale and lots of my former coworkers left because of it."
bad,The most greedy company ever. Doesn’t care about employees at all. You will HATE working there. They treat employees like dirt. The absolute worst company I’ve ever worked for.
bad,not enough hours to work for. low pay and also the benefits is not that good. plus no advancement is avaible at the company unless 30 yrs of work there.
bad,"I don't have anything to say. There is really nothing that I have to say about ATT. I worked there. I no longer work there. I have moved on. The place is not a place that I would recommend anyone get comfortable at. It is a business. They expect loyalty from you but they have no loyalty to you. Like I said, I don't have anything to say."
bad,"N/A - long hours, low pay and absolutely no chance for advancement. Leadership is on drugs and running the company into the ground. The company is in bad financial shape and can no longer compete in the marketplace."
bad,"could careless about employees  its all about numbers. you are not a person but only a number to the death star of att, managers are minions for the company and don't care about the people tat make the wheels turn"
bad,"Terrible customer base and very pushy, inflexible management. Shifts and salaries promised were not fulfilled.  Required to be at work 15 minutes early to open systems and prepare for shift but not paid for this time."
bad,"Management encourages to sell faulty products to customers. Management is also sexist. Male employees receive a starting pay of $10.00/ hr .. compared to women starting out with a pay of $12.00/hr "
bad,No recomiendo trabajar en este lugar definitivamente al momento de que te dan tu retiro te das cuenta de que nunca fue bueno trabajar ahí
bad,"Don’t work for this company always has layoffs. The longer you work here the more your just a number. AT&T doesn’t know what business they want to be in."
bad,This job started off great until management switched over. The current district manager is biased and based his choices on how you look rather than your consistent numbers and hard work.
bad,I had an African American  boss who was looking to get rid of me because I was a white male also I was taken advantage of all the time I had 35 years of perfect Attendence
bad,Ni los mismos supervisores y coordinadores resuelven los problemas de los clientes
bad,I dont recommend this company. After they took over DirecTV they slowly forced all the employees to take a 1/2 salary pay cut or leave. Management was literally horrible and very unprofessional
bad,"It’s an environment that dismiss success and rewards favoritism. Management is military - style. Empowerment, trust and problem - solving are not prioritized. Rank and reporting structure is valued over innovation. Many policies and requirements that are typically CYA for management."
bad,"No job security. Management is interested mostly in keeping the head count. Your person interest, goals or respect is not encouraged. The culture from the top down is that your are expendable."
bad,No recomiendo trabajar en esta empresa ya que no es suficiente el sueldo por todo el trabajo que se lleva acabo
bad,I really enjoyed working for At&t. I was planning on making a career out of the opportunity. Until they laid me off. Since then my life has been one struggle after the next.
bad,Hostile work environment in which management did nothing to address it  - management played favorites - they claim to have a support line but it was useless
bad,"En mi caso me quitaban mis comisiones si un cliente no pagaba , cuando ya había hecho mi trabajo de buscar al cliente , andar en la calle a buscar gente no es sencillo y luego culpan por malas prácticas cuando buscas la manera de lograr tus metas sin malicia."
bad,"Toxic work environment, micro management, upper management out of touch, can’t trust anyone, two faced people will throw you under the bus, pushy and slimy sales tactics... stay away.  Far away.  So glad I left."
bad,Working there feels like daycare. Managers micro manage and ask why you left your desk (bathroom break or phone call) you can't have your phone on you at work. And if you have kids you have to hope the school or doctor calls on your break or lunch. Work is easy if they would allow you to do what's best interest of the  customer.
bad,Managers would do anything to get a sale . When hired was based on customer services within months customer service was no longer a priority. To many people were worried about there job if they did not make sales.
bad,Horrible company! Micro management to the fullest! Force sells!!! Very stressful!! No union so they fire you for every simple thing no warnings. Very dangerous situations happen & no one says anything! Random mandatory late night or early morning calls and meetings! Management act like your friend but really only care about sales. They give u company car but track EVERYTHING don’t dare use it for quick store run or anything they will fire u. No loyalty no matter how many years u have with company.
bad,Never had a worst experience   Just simply sad they only care about the sales numbers   Managers are not inspired or inspiring at all    They care little about success
bad,Mala relación laboral los jefes acosan ala empleadas y nunca te ponen en un solo lugar siempre te están moviendo mucho de tiendas ay mucho favoritismo
bad,Not a great place to work. Lots of demands and to many bosses . Low pay with no sense of security. Company laid of lots of employees and the union did nothing to help.
bad,Just another number the manager didn't care nor did upper leadership about the customer. I was told to do anything at all cost to sell more to the customer. Even when i didn't feel it was correct or a good idea.
bad,I hated working there more than anything. The manager didn't know how to manage the store. My coworkers were racist. I was the only one of my race working there. The sales were horrible. You could never meet your quotas
bad,"PROS: ""You must have been out of luck."""
bad,"Was promised promotions and then never received them, we have went through 2 managers and a sales girl in 2 months  the assistant manager is a joke  she is constantly on a power trip.soon as she thinks she can get a power trip over other people she does  it kinda sucks because it a good company to work for . But unfortunately the assistant manager makes you not want to work there at all  she’s racist and won’t help anyone that doesn’t speak English  she runs the store how she wants doesn’t care how the district manager tells her toothe assistant manager changes your hours the day before hand"
bad,"This was years back at convergys. The company paid good money for a while and then started cutting pay and people, so I had to find a job before they told us to hit the hay"
bad,"After 5 years of employment and working hard every day, the company started layoffs and i was one of the unfortunate.  This comoany has no resoect for their employees and would do anything to make a profit!"
bad,Expect to work 2 weeks in training and get fired immediately. Understaffed also the people who are supposed to teach you dont teach you. It results in your termination for not knowing because you were never taught. Work for verizon.
bad,Your health will decline working for AT&T. If your not already in some type of drug treatment program you will be after working for this company. That really know how to make you feel like a number and that you are replaceable.
bad,"They don’t pay a fair wage case in point the southeast’s labor force is currently on strike.. just like most major companys,  micro managed to the teeth . Your manager doesn’t know how to do your job but he’s qualified to lead you? Working here constantly had me scratching my head saying do what over the bs they passed down the chain of command"
bad,Do not work here.  Unless you are in the group and are willing to brown nose you will be unhappy.  The raise that we received was 3 cents an hour.  More worried about number then customers
bad,Management could have been more attentive an union Stuarts could have given better advise. CWA union is terrible and only want your money. Had a “COPE” charge They refused to remove.
bad,Poor place to work mangers won’t help you out when needed they blame you for mistakes they promised to customer . No work balance when you start to work they promise you weekends then you take it away from you after training remember this if you are young and have a nice life don’t apply for this job you would regret it
bad,Terrible company to work for. Management is terrible... They have no sympathy or care for their employees just there paycheck. Just a terrible place to be employed.
bad,ATT does very little to include the Southeast region employees in any company advancement opportunities.  Company advancement is normally mentioned once they have had in other regions  for at least 2 years.
bad,"Limited advancement opportunities. With a company as large as AT&T, the opportunity for growth is limited unless you relocate. It does not fit to relocate my family at the moment."
bad,"AT&T is the worst place I have ever worked, and I have worked for several companies. You are simply a number. I have seen them lay off employees with 15-20 years experience with the company without a second thought. There is absolutely zero work life balance. I saw an employee get wrote up because his Grandmother was dying and he left before providing the proper paperwork. I cannot say enough to try and prevent someone from making the choice to work at this greedy corporate monster. I can go on and on but I will leave it at that."
bad,"Do not consider as an EMPLOYER "
bad,"I spent over 17 years here doing anything I could to help the company grow and prosper.  Layoffs in IT started very early on and were a constant threat I faced.  I was laid off under the guise of workforce reduction but in truth, my new manager who I never met actually wanted to replace seasoned workers with new hires.  All attempts to find another position within the company I cared so much about were futile as the company is so segmented within itself that different orgs would only consider candidates from within their own org.  This place is broken inside with regards to IT.  It was shameful the way they treated us as they ushered us out the door.  My last boss should feel shameful for the way we were treated and the fact that she created a new job posting for my job before I was even gone."
bad,Management felt it was necessary to threaten you daily with your job. They don’t care about family as long as your at work 6-7 days a week. My wife got deathly ill and they didn’t care. Refused to let me off and use vacation time. I had to go behind my managers back and get FMLA approved.
bad,12+ hours on some days and only 2 hours on others. Unstable working environment: quotas are always raised higher and higher if you meet them or not. Quotas are unrealistic.
bad,"I was always contracted to work for the AT&T projects i was assigned to. I never felt I had a real authority even as an escalations supervisor, who was advised to advise the customers that I was the ""end of the line"" for manager calls, yet the company never allowed me to make ""executive decisions"" without calling a manager out of office for permission."
bad,"Over worked, underpaid, under appreciated. You are expected to work ANY time just to make sales and numbers or look for another job. NO work life balance at all. SO much micro-managing its unreal. Even when you are off, expect a text or call to pick up work."
bad,My manager was horrible. I was bullied and belittled on a daily basis. I reached out to his general manager and was never contacted back. I have never felt so horrible at a job in my entire working career. He threatened me and never allowed me to say anything he didn't like. He threatened to fire me everyday and is a liar.
bad,"it doesn't matter if you meet or exceed your goal with this company, no matter what you do it is never good enough. Constantly being told to do more, be better, to tweak myself and my personality, all while losing things that matter to me. you"
bad,To many politics to move up. Moving up wasn’t based upon work ethic or your ethics. It was based upon who you know and were you their buddy. Would never recommend this company
bad,"I rather not. The company in whole was ok to work for, however it just wasn’t a fit for me. I’m glad I had the opportunity to take advantage of the experience."
bad,This company was really horrible to work for  they had to many workers and not enough business  impossible to make money like that made us always work holidays and the manager would always be the one off as well she would go run errands during company time saying she was going to the post office
bad,I received my work day on a company phone. My work day started at 8am and usually ended at 6pm. I trouble shooting system and installed new system. I also explained how to work the system with new customer and explain and fixed what I found wrong with existing customer
bad,"The company did not share much of care for me as an employee or anyone’s well being. However, that was 3 years ago, so things could have certainly changed and I hope for that."
bad,"They do not care about your personal life.  If you are salary they intentionally schedule meetings after 5 and tell you that you are salary and you have to come in regardless of how much you worked.  The vacation time is good and the insurance and benefits are good, but the management could care less about you."
bad,I would give this company zero stars if possible. I would never work there again. They fired a guy because he had a massive heart attack at the call center and maxed out his points.
bad,"No les interesa en lo mas minimo que te sientas comodo aun cuando cumples funciones de gerencia sin pedir nada a cambio, no te pagan las comisiones de tus ventas."
bad,"Company does not care about employees, poor schedules only good thing was benefits .I would not recommend this company to anyone also has bad business ethics"
bad,When I first started working there it was a pleasure. As time went on it started going down hill then in 2015 when the surplusing started hitting heavy it became nerve racking not knowing from one day to the next if you would still have a job. I received the call that I was being laid off 10 months before reaching 20 years and retirement.
bad,I worked here for 3 years. This is an absolute horrid place to work. They have no care in the world about their employees or customers. They are all about making the site at all costs.
bad,Did not like at the end.  They made life unbearable at times.  I am glad I was let go.  The money was good.  That is why I stayed as long as I did.  I would not recommend.
bad,It will cost you your health. Just read the reviews on any website. You’ll be made to sell to people who are calling in to leave the company after their bills skyrocketed without their consent and if you don’t you’re nothing. Upper management is brutal. You’re put in constant fear of losing your job. If you have a family. Don’t work there. It isn’t at all what it used to be. You’ll notice almost every job has been outsourced. The only people who can stay have FMLA and don’t show up anyways.
bad,"Picking"
bad,One of the worst jobs I ever had as a wire technician if you love your wife and family don't apply for this job no future and they will work you to death
bad,Worst leadership produces the worst agents. It was so busy that you don't have work and life balance then you are underpaid. You are well maximized as an agent
bad,"From my original hiring job. I took on other PM positions, tasks, responsibilities to the point I was working 60 weeks, paid for only 40.  They loved it, then let me go with no notice.  My overall manager had told me all along I was doing an amazing job, never had such quality and that was in my review.   ATT does not like hard workers. They are bean counters only."
bad,The amount of rules we broke in order to keep our sales numbers high was beyond what I think anyone would believe. From calling as the customer to cancel sales to having customers personal info such as socials and credit card numbers in the open and used without consent.
bad,Keep away from at&t. They do not care about customers or employees. Trust me I worked for them for 6 years. I have seen wayyyy to many people surplused and fired throughout my years of working.
bad,"They don't treat employees as human but as a tool.  Lot of training on scruples  but don't follow there own rules.  This is not a long term career, they only want CSR for two years, don't want employees vested."
bad,"Probably the worst job I have ever had. The work wasn't terrible but the company culture is. Between the overly sensative employees who complain about absolutely anything they can find, to the crooked union representative who had absolutely no ethical issues with being on both the company and the union payrolls. Talk about a conflict of interest! If you are a young person, a millennial, this is the place for you."
bad,The enjoyment of the job is in the customers and new technology you interact with. The job does not allow for work life balance. The upper management send one message in training then in person another.
bad,"Poor Managment in the workplace....does notmpay enough for the type of you do ...The Union was not supportive, poor training not enough information given to do the job, you do not get promoted on performance but if they like you."
bad,"Management is bad you'll literally con people for a living, they will find ways to take u on commission, more u sell the less u seem to make, unprofessional as can be ran, prime communications is God awful, corporate is hard and very sneaky. Home office is annoying as can be they don't give a care about you. "
bad,"This is a highly stressfull and thankless position.  You are not paid for what you collect on at all, but you are expected and forced to collect money as soon as you can get people to pay. Most times you just setting arrangements for people who will always extend to last day possible then not pay but the company holds your meterics to the collections."
bad,Upper management past store managers are crooked and will throw you under the bus. Worst upper management I have ever worked. 15 workers got terminated from my store alone and nation wide it was many more.
bad,"not only is this company terrible, but they treat their employees terribly, and their customers, but everyone already knew that the latter. They make you unethical things to meet quotas. your hire ups and upper managements' positions are constantly threatened and the pressure trickles down to the retail team. The worst company to work for ever."
bad,Not a good place to work..they need better mangment.Thee pay isn't good..Not a good place to work if your looking to advance in a company.i would never work there again
bad,Do not recommend. Was awful managment treated you like a child. Policies changed every other day. Lots of favoritism. Hated going to work every day. Threatened with job every single day in the 2 and half years worked there.
bad,"training horrible, managers all horrible, pay awful and the hours even worse. Nothing about working for At&t was enjoyable. All they care about is you  being on site at 0800."
bad,"While working there, I was subject to daily Stress. If it wasn’t work stress, it was the daily stress of working for managers who were not prepared to fulfill their role. Managers were appointed based on ‘connections” they had with upper management. When not prepared for their management roles, they transferred that stress to their employees. In addition, there were fears of head count cuts. I recall sitting in my managers office and having the “yes”/“no you will be/not be staying” conversation. That happened only once, but nonetheless it was harmful to one’s work environment. From that time on, cuts happened to entire departments without the ‘conversation” and colleagues were just cut and missing from daily interactions. In addition, when budgets were tight, we were not permitted to travel to the worksites we managed. Management had to happen through phone conversations and this presented a host of additional issues for which we were graded and held responsible for without valuable personal interaction. STRESS...BE PREPARED]."
bad,"A typical workday I would answer 30-50 calls. I learned nothing during my time working from home. The system would always be down, it was difficult to get support from IT department. I have nothing positive to say. The hardest part of the job was working from home with no support."
bad,Horrible experience told to do one thing and no backing advancement is non existent unless your part of the good ole boys and when the heat is turned up your boss flakes out and blames you
bad,Its not what you know there its who you know so people dont get equal opportunities and the managers treat you terrible. They dont care about the fact that people have families outside of the job.
bad,Absolutely the worst company I have ever worked for. I would not recommend this company to no one. Management is awful the pay is awful and if you take a sick day that you get 5 a year if you use one of the sick days you still get wrote up for it
bad,"I worked as an In Home Expert for 9 months. Communication is extremely poor, not a good place to work period. They tell you to do something, then they try and write you up. My immediate supervisor up and left because of upper management, people plan more to be on LOA than to put actual time in the field. I would rather fast food than ATT."
bad,A typical day at work will be dead no customers come in they make you sell direct tv if not you will get fired save your time and don't work here worst experience ever!
bad,If you read this far turn around and keep looking for a better job. Att is the worst place you could ever imagine working the flat out just don’t care about the employees or the customers
bad,Desconheço a empresa para poder fazer uma avaliação.
bad,Terrible dnt waste your time they have no sympathy for those who deal with rude ungrateful customers everyday. Try to write you up for everything took away people bonus because of jealousy and stupidity.
bad,Everyone has an attitude because they are stressed out and severely underpaid. Not a good environment to be in. The raises are a joke. Everything is about numbers. Which I actually had the top numbers in the center for 5 years straight. But I felt like I was just working for nothing. In the beginning I loved it but with new management and mergers it became toxic.
bad,I was the top seller. I fell at work due to the neglect of a manager putting a broken chair BACK on the floor after knowing the chair was broken. I was on workers comp. My daughter gave me the day off and I was fired when I returned to work.
bad,This was the worst experience ever. Management treats you so bad and forget upper management and union. You basically have no family w this job. If you dont sell or lie to customers your on the list. Never again...
bad,Paid for my bachelor's degree then laid me off while others with lesser education continue to work. Applied for 25 plus jobs never to get an interview to much politics and you have to know someone to move anywhere in the company.
bad,Working for AT&T you will have no family life nor will you be fairly compensated for the work duties you perform daily. You will be working every weekend
bad,there's no management structure here at att. They over work their employees with a little bit of pay and expect the employee to go above and beyond for that company.
bad,You can't miss a day or be 1 second for at least 1 year! Impossible if you have kids or get sick in this germ factory-which you will! I worked for over 4 months with bronchitis and couldn't take time off to go to the doctor. Stressful to a point you can't possibly fathom. Mental health leave is essential if you want to spend your working life on this plantation. Awful! They either make you quit and lie telling you they will rehire your or fire you and deem you ineligible for rehire. Slavery.
bad,"Working for an authorized retailer, instead of a corporate store is a joke. You can't provide excellent customer service in the store, you have to call AT&T Customer service line, and assist the customer on a three-way call. The monthly sales quota was beyond ridiculous, our store location was new and we didn't have much traffic coming in, so it was nearly impossible for all the employees to reach their goal. When promoting a new product there wasn't any help, or clear instructions on what to do, just had to figure it out on your own and hope for the best. And on top of that we had to make up a reason, and lie to our customer why our phones cost 29.99 more than the phones at the corporate location. I don't suggest working for any authorized retailer location."
bad,"If you want to get get in a relationship with your coworkers or just mess around iqor is the place for you , if you want to know anything about everyone business and nothing about your job iqor is the place for you , it pays well don’t get me wrong but the things you have to put up with and no one knowing what to do yea visit iqor"
bad,doesn't put the right people in management positions which create a bad working environment. no coaching directive and was impossible to feel like I had any say in my development.
bad,No one could pay me enough to ever go back to working for this company! Most of the management don't care about the employees or customers! You get PTO but still get penalized in using it if you have to use it for calling in sick. What's the use of having it if you get penalized if you use it!
bad,"Managers act like high school kids, and performance does not matter the job is based on likes! The schedule changes often there is no work life balance. You have 99 job duties, and very little pay for agents."
bad,"This is the worst company I had ever work at. Employees are jurased, talk at like they are second class. Managers are scared of loosing their job. Forced to work 58 hrs per week in 100 degree. No sick days. A total lack of respect. Constant lies and scare tactics."
bad,"Company is a sinking ship, due to current leadership. The company lays off employees every quarter, and this will continue for the ongoing years ahead."
bad,La peor empresa en la que puedas trabajar. Aparte que  su proceso de selección es demasiado complicada para pagarte una miseria al mes ya adentro es tienen trabas para todo.
bad,"This is not a great company to work for, the management is no consistent. They promotions are based off of favortism, and there is no opportunity for advancement no matter how great you are at your job."
bad,This companies policies and practices need to be investigated. From HR to managers are a complete joke and they don’t care they hire based on what you look like and how well you will blend with the “team”
bad,AT&T is a service company but it tries to rank its employees on a production basis.  Technicians performance grades are affected drastically by things that are out of the technicians control.  Customers change their minds or there is a cable trouble that causes a service disruption goes against the technicians performance numbers.  Company says they will pay for your education but they will not accomodate any technician schedule to actually attend college classes. Poor management at highest levels.
bad,"Poor management. Employees are being forced to exaggerate the promotion to get the sales, and to avoid being written up. Home services take days to reach customers."
bad,"Traveled a lot and had the hotels payed for and travel payed for but the job had an awful management staff and the pay was extremely low, they made big promises"
bad,"I worked long hours for low pay and never got a raise for years.  Management is choppy - some are good and some are out for themselves.  The morale was poor due to frequent layoffs.  I had to work 16 hour days, including weekends and nights.  My peers were nice people but very stressed."
bad,"no ping pong balls, no sofas to sit on while on break, just filling this information so I can get past to the next section of this, why would indeed ask this of people."
bad,"No communication whatsoever when job titles are  changing , management is horrible when it comes to transparency. Micromanaging everyone who works there. Don’t do it"
bad,if you want to be treated like nothing you should work here. The management sucks. Itf you want alot of hours and don't want to see your friends and family this is the place for you.
bad,"Prime- Authorized Retailer for AT&T"
bad,"Harsh hours, pretty good pay. Awful schedule. Customers may drive you insane. Would not recommend working the call center. They literally drive people to the crazy house."
bad,"Telecommunications used to be a great profession but att is determined to do away with all employees in the field. Performance is based solely on quantity and not quality."
bad,"Te rehusan tus bonos si llegas a usar el medico o si tienes incapacidad,  te dan media hora de comida sin disponibilidad de nada, esta mal organizado . Te lo pintan como una empresa humanitaria que se preocupa por sus asociados pero en realidad ya luego te muestran el colmillo"
bad,Poor management. No time for anything not work related. Long tedious hours. Unrealistic sales goals. Company as a whole was unprofessional. Would not recommend to anyone.
bad,"Stressful work place, messy and undeveloped management, area managers doesn't know how to use systems and force agents to sell direct tv even when customers does not want the service."
bad,Due to outsourcing every day is more difficult than the next. Industry as a whole is in a race to zero.  No support or spend on tech development. Must sell 3rd party services to be able to achieve sales goals.
bad,"Typical day at work is very stressful, mass volume of incoming calls. I learned and trained while employed through the temp agency. The hardest part of the job was the irate customers."
bad,"Layed off, The company has many great attributes but developing their employees is not on of them. It seems that the higher you go on salary grid the g greater are your chances of loosing your job unless you are in the executive track."
bad,"very stressful, lots of favoritism, constantly trying to get more out of us for less. lack of tools, have to take responsibility for things not my fault, got punished for things out of my control such as customers not being home, constantly had to pick up others slack.never knew what time i was getting off work, poor management and very unorganized."
bad,"setting goals that are unobtainable - too many responsibilities - DirecTV acquisition made everything fall apart - you're not only a sales rep or a manager, you're also a firstnet rep, business rep, directv rep"
bad,"Horrible management! Micro management and unprofessional. Supervisor interrupting mid calls, coaching you to do what you had already done then calls you stupid. Filed formal HR complaint. Director of call center does absolutely nothing to help or ensure we’re coached properly! Total chaos!"
bad,"nefasto lugar para trabajar"
bad,You're a number. That's it. Nobody cares about your success. You're expected to make it with horrible training. Worst job I have ever had. Would not recommend this job to my worst enemy.
bad,They move you around whenever they want or you lose your job. The environment there is like a rollercoaster you never know what you are walking into. They help with tuition though
bad,"Peor empresa para trabajar. Sin oportunidades de crecimiento reales. Gerencia detiene oportunidades para no perder “top performance”. La unión CWA es la peor unión en los Estados Unidos. Sus reclamos son completamente insostenibles. Pero si la unión es mala, AT&T es el peor negociador en la historia. Aun con los descuentos de empleados para la factura celular salía más económico moverse a T-mobile. Trabajando en servicio al cliente en call center pude ser testigo de la mediocridad del sistema de facturación y la falta de compromiso real hacia unas expectativas reales y transparentes para los clientes. AT&T roba día a día y nadie dice o hace nada. Lamentable. Fue humillante trabajar en un lugar donde el cliente no es importante."
bad,"No pay raises. No overtime pay but you work over everyday. Management is more worried about their looks than running a store. I was once told that 'This is a mans world', i am a female. I was told this because i was trying so hard to move into management after already working their for 2 years, needless to say i never got promoted. i wouldn't recommend this place to anyone"
bad,they do not care about the employee only the revenue they bring in. if you do not perform to their liking they force you to resign or threaten to fire you. they are also a union which they do not tell you the full benefit of that.
bad,"Overall my Manager was not trained to do the job he\was getting paid to do. He had no clue how talk to his employees, he made constant rookie mistakes, and was wat to cocky. I enjoyed working at ATT prior to my manager. My whole team quit because of him. I wish the higher ups would have taken us employees complaints more serious. Although ATT is a great company I can not say I had a pleasure of knowing such things to be true. Our schedule was never right hours were always wrong. We did double the work for what seemed to be pennies for pay. We were high in theft and fraud with no security and always understaffed."
bad,"I have worked for AT&T for 13 years. Hired when i was 18. now im 31. built and developed my manager who was from Colombia get promoted to Store Manager. She grew, i helped her. she would promote me within her circle so i could always work for her.... because i made her #1.  Retail Store Manager, Area Retail Store Manager and In Home Expert Manager. "
bad,"I had no generator or ATS experience when I started. Didn't have much more knowledge when I left. Everything is mobile, so no ATS work. AT&T managers are notorious for being hard to work with and for being total bell ends. Better off not working for them."
bad,"During my time at AT&T, I suffered a lot with poor management. My manager did not listen to my (or my coworkers) concerns and ideas to help improve the store. He also would harass (sexually, verbally, etc) some of the employees as well."
bad,This is the worst place I have ever worked. The management is downright cruel and business practices are shady at best. They really don't care about their employees in the slightest.
bad,It was horrible.  They constantly threaten to replace you. The unions are no help. I you value your quality of life I would not go there. There are other jobs
bad,co was a poor company & treated you like a number.  went to work for the paycheck and nothing more.  i don't know why I have to fill this out.  didn't like the nob.
bad,Bad place to work stressful environment always pushed on you. They always push metrics on you and always change them. When you do a good job no one really tells you they just look at metrics and tell you you need and can do better. When a new procedure comes out don’t really get trained on it they give you a paper and tell you to read it and do it.
bad,Working for At&t people where awesome but  management Was the worse. They don’t train management like they used to. They don’t have Empathy. They need to have at least 5 years+ in experience with At&t before coming a manger for At&t.
bad,They treat employees as numbers not a person they will put you down and they let mangers harasse you and stalk you they will lue to you it is not a great company to work for
bad,"Worst management I have ever seen, the company does not set you up for success in this role, stay away if you want to keep your sanity...micromanaging is u godly here for things out of your control."
bad,Would not recommend anyone to work here. The company does not care about it's employees let alone their customers. They do not follow the rules they have. They fail to inform you of policies and then punish you when you don't follow those policies. The time off is a joke.
bad,"Dealing with a lot of angry customers, although it was nice to be able to have them happy by the end of the call at times. Commission was almost next to impossible to hit due to all the metrics that you must hit in order to get paid out for your sales."
bad,"Forced 60 hours a week for 8 months consecutive.  All while having to make unrealistic numbers.  For every job completed ""earned hours"" were awarded.  At the end of the day, an employee's complete jobs must be 120% hours worked.  a technician may have to wait on a lineman for several hours and may not be able to complete the work due to repairs needing to be complete by the line prior.  So a technician may spend 5 hours at a job and get 0 earned.  No considerations are made by management."
bad,Horrible  horrible really horrible do not work here it is stressful if you have to go to the store. Working in the store is completely different the call center was horrible
bad,"just not a good place to work or company to work for. the union doesn't really fight for work life balance , the hours are way to much and the management doesn't work with you"
bad,They had lack of management and did not train well for the work requirements proper training prevents poor performance and I feel I was never properly trained to do a sales job but originally upon hire I under the impression I was hired for customer service not sales after being trained for customer service only. Sales were introduced im not a salesman asked for help on several occasions it was just to stressful to keep going through so needed a career change.
bad,at&t is a bad place to work bad management make you do what they want they don't understand that people get sick they say if your not here your getting fired I hate that place
bad,"Terrible job, laid off 1000s of employees as part of takeover of DirecTV. Talked big, then suddenly, layoffs. Pay was mediocre, they tried to take care of employees, but only as much as was inexpensive to them."
bad,"Worked my way up into management by having great metrics. Everything at AT&T is measured in metrics by the way! Started out as a wire tech and done it for 3 years and had great metrics month in and month out and then got in to management for 3 1/2 years had great metrics from the start and out of the blue I got picked to be surplused out of 10 managers 3 got hacked. Ok let me set the picture, of the 3 managers I ranked #2 in the DMA out of 10. In the organization I ranked #13 out of almost 300 managers and I got picked and they kept some managers that had terrible numbers. It’s a very political place to work the good old buddy system it’s not about who does a good job. Worst place in the world to work. They build you up only to cut your legs out from underneath you if your not the type that likes to keep your bosses number on speed dial and chat everyday to him about your peers. Then the only job they offer you to stay has a $15 hourly pay cut and your  on the sales floor of a store doing something that was not what you originally signed up for. No careers at AT&T!!!"
bad,working here as a u verse tech i felt like the management was looking for reasons to write up or even suspend technicians. I personally never was suspended or written up but was constantly worried about this for little things like keeping a bottle of water in my truck and things that dont affect my work as a technician
bad,"Rate of pay, lack of consistency in seating, terrible customers that reacted like brats when they were told something they didn't like, and horrid company policies lead to my departure."
bad,"Surplus employee after 20 years of service, without reasons why. Stress levels were terrible. Hours working vs personal life was very unbalanced. Pay raises were less than 1% even if you met objectives. Company was very discriminatory towards white males aged from 30-40 years old, this group was the majority of surplus employees first quarter of 2019."
bad,"This company will work you to death. Literally. People have died in my side of work at this company because they try to cut out safety to get their numbers higher. This is not a joke. I was working 16 hours a day. Sure the money is decent, but you never have time to spend it. You work every day. No weekends off. Every now and then they give you a Sunday off and they act like they are doing you this huge favor for doing so. There are plenty of other jobs out there that pay the same, if not better than at&t. You know when a job is so stressful when they offer free counseling. Do yourselves a favor and find a different company to work for."
bad,"POOR management, they lie cheat and steal, POOR Union they are in cohoots with the management. To many job responsibilities and lack of compensation. A lot of infighting and gossip. I could go in and on how terrible this company is. It is only good if you got in 20 years ago. No pension, no job security, no advancement opportunities etc, etc... work in deplorable Conditions, ie drug houses, mold, dangerous neighborhoods, on poles, electrical hazards, over grown trees, bugs, vicious animals. This place will take everything from and and expect more. They will lie and make everything your fault, they will never pat you on the back for anything good. They are all trying to save they’re own jobs and have no morals or values whatsoever. Greedy company who takes advantage of the elderly customers and its workers"
bad,The company is garbage... Start working there and you will see for yourself. Managers will Micromanage without having know how themselves. The systems and processes are garbage
bad,"This is a contractor job for AT&T. The job has extremely poor wages, not even enough to have a decent apartment rental and car note.  Pays close to minimum wages."
bad,It used to be a good place to work but now with all the layoffs and the lack of being able to be hired on. it makes no sense to try to work there. go somewhere else if you can.
bad,Hated going into drug houses I felt very unsafe. Not what was promised to me when I left I store. Very poor management. Was sent into very poor neighborhoods.
bad,"You stay in your position for too long. I was looking to get promoted and I was at the top of the performance charts, but I wasn't ever approached. I wouldn't recommend it."
bad,I won’t work for this company anymore due to the the I was treated. It seems AT&T does not cakes how employees are treated. I moving to GA and Ibwill need a job but due to the negative treatment I won’t even look that way.
bad,Stressful environment with no real room for advancement. Poor pay and it’s a union job. Mandatory overtime if the site doesn’t meet goals for the month. Metrics change monthly making it overwhelming to achieve incentive.
bad,Not bad its a good company except that I’ve never gotten my full 40 hours in a week. But over all its a great place to work for the mean time if you need it
bad,"Worst job possible to have don’t waste your time at all!!!!!"
bad,Wouldn't recommend working here to anyone no room to advance and employees are only a number. Empty promises and employees are just employees. I worked as a janitor and many times the client thought they were better than me.
bad,"They lie, and steal money from employees and threaten if the do not force customers to sign up for protection plan they'll get wrote up and possibly lose their job"
bad,The management made it feel unpleasant at times. The employees made it worth coming to work. You really had to love what you were doing to go everyday.
bad,"Typical day of work consisted of getting my schedule via app. Go to appointment. 1 out of 10 customers would be happy that I was there to do work. The other 9 would be upset at customer service, or did not order service, or was promised more than what the job would allow. Scheduling with customers was always a problem customer service never got it right.  All aspects of management were so compartmentalized that no one could ever give a straight answer when it came to customer account help and service. Impossible to help a customer when everyone passes the buck and takes no responsibility when your there to help."
bad,This job was so stressful.  Had to be at work too early in my opinion.  Installing cable services where I was required to run wiring and cables to satisfy customer requests and deliver the best television experience for the consumer.  The hours were terribly long and typically only had one off day throughout the week.  I leaned things about wiring and face plates and how to navigate through different computer setting to resolve an issue.
bad,"Middle Management are too full of their egos to do what is right, while forcing old school ideology through HR. 60 hr weeks are expected with no mercy"
bad,This company gobbles everything up and destroys small business.  U are a number and they do not care about you as a person.  Immense pressure to increase goals that are not realistic
bad,"I didn't work for AT&T directly. I worked in a call center that AT&T used for labor. The call center was just awful. They had unrealistic expectations for the agents. I actually like AT&T as a whole. I even have my cell service through them, but working for them through a 3rd party company is never a good idea"
bad,save your time.. they will mess up your check. they lie... the training is horrible... its a hot mess there.. they have been sued and had to pay former employees... don't waste your time with this place...
bad,"I am so glad ATT laid me off after 19 years. They shipped 111 jobs overseas but mind you they got Trump’s tax break then we got late off shortly after that. You are just a number and not a person to ATT. They treat you like your a slave.;You do everyone ‘s job but don’t get the pay. Managers don’t care and don’t help you. Basically, you will be so stressed out with customers issues that no one knows how to solve. Training are a joke. Terrible place to work, you work for the devil."
bad,"Tough job, even tougher when they cut your pay in half. Basically going out of town to do tough jobs in random people's home can get stressful when you're not fairly compensated and it has nothing to do with production."
bad,"Would not recommend to anyone, stressful environment. High paced. Competitive....you have to attempt to make a sale on every call, even calls concerning a deceased account."
bad,My location resembles that of a high school computer lab. The job and/or employees are not at all influential or positive.The rules have been changed so much thru time and the place being a revolving door or applicants.
bad,"Find a better place less stressful and better culture. Will be required to work weekends and overtime............................"
bad,AT&T is a good company to work for especially if you’re sales driven only in certain markets. Management and Executives need to value the employee and give an equal opportunity to everyone who want to advance.
bad,No matter how good you were if you made 1 small mistake they fired you pretty quickly. the compensation was good but the stress of how the customers treated you and management showed lack of consideration was making it an overwhelming job to work at.
bad,"I was not happy with the company. The pay was not equal or fair to the amount of work that had to be done. Training was extremely poor, staff was unprofessional. incentives were horrible."
bad,"There is no leadership"
bad,Best advice I can give someone is just stay away.  The company is to unsecure and does not know which direction it is going.  It has spent to much money buying other companies and they think cutting employees is the was to get it back...  Don't expect for promotions unless you know someone who knows someone.  I just watched some of the top managers get cut.
bad,The worst place I’ve ever worked cross your fingers no one in your family dies because you will get fired for greieving. Stores have clicks and groups and if you don’t fit in the job becomes very boring managers act like they’re in high school
bad,AT&T could care less about people.  They are only in business for their bottom line and stockholders.  Very bad working conditions.  No work life balance.  I wouldn't wish that company on my worse enemy.
bad,Worked long hours doing extremely physically demanding work. Management was aloof. Hardest part of the job was the job itself. Workplace culture was deplorable.
bad,"manager didn't care about anything, didn't want to help. co workers were great, helped with anything you needed. They worked you to death and didn't pay very well."
bad,"This place was very unprofessional. The type of people they hired were not self-driven or respectful. They often portrayed attitude toward customers over the phone and a disregard for management. A typical day at work would consist of high volume, low management or assistance, a lot of irate callers and lack of breaks."
bad,"This is the worst job ive had in 25 years. First the recruiter will LIE to get you to take the job telling you it is customer service and it is really RETENTION which means after the customer has been angered by a few people in a call center in the Phillipines, they then get transferred to you! They also lie about the hours you will be working, you will not get out of a 12-9 shift including both weekend nights for many years and they will put mandatory overtime on top of that. You are measured on metrics which are impossible to attain. Angry customers are transferred to you when they request to cancel, and most of them have called to cancel previously on more than one occasion but the agents tell them they are canceled without actually canceling them because that would hurt their metrics. You are supposed to convince them not to cancel and then sell them direct tv on top of that! And it doesnt matter if someone died, you are still supposed to convince them to not only keep the line but also change to a higher priced plan and then sell them direct tv I guess so they and the good Lord can enjoy some phones they were price gouged on while watching satellite tv from heaven.You are made to work up to 4 hours at a time without a break not being able to leave your desk with back to back phone calls with angry customers cussing you out. The managers also are rude and demeaning and cuss you out. You will come in to see an email from the guy that runs the place every morning telling you what a rotten _____ you all are. Your training will consist of 3 weeks sitting in a classroom with"
bad,"Me condicionaron el pago de mi sueldo, pues mintieron al momento de la contratacion con un sueldo base que no era el prometido"
bad,job sucked wasn't taught anything sometime would be left alone to do things wasn't capable of doing so had to figure it out ourselves. Did not get allowed to really do sales
bad,There is no work life balance and the pay is not worth the stress of the job. Management cooperates with tou on issues that arise and on a daily basis there is suport
bad,Not much more to say other than if you want to work where they are completely unrealistic and dont care about you as a person... work for AT&T. Would never work for them again and wont even have the service in my home.
bad,"I was one of hundreds of techs, supervisors, and call center techs around the country that got layed off during the buyout. AT&T sucks!! I was a field tech for three years with Directv livin the dream before these union turkeys took over."
bad,"well the first thing you have to do when you get this is log onto your computer and clock in but the computers are entirely too slow which makes you late clocking in so be prepared to be there about 20 minutes early, no joke, to let you computer turn on and boot up. even then, sometimes the website to clock in with is down. i learn that the supervisors make us treat the customer horrible and then let us get yelled at for 30+ because they simply didn't want to help. better suck up to all the higher ups there or you won't go anywhere in AT&T. the one that get promoted aren't the ones that are qualified but the ones that kiss up. also, they force you to get their health insurance even if you have health insurance through someone else which is TERRIBLE and ridiculously overpriced so be prepared to only bring home less than 800 dollars a month after they take out your union dues and health insurance. also, apparently no one that works there knows how to shower and everyone smells like an ash tray. "
bad,"I worked at the AT&T Call Center for mobile phones in Ocala, Fl. for 4 years. It was a horrible place to be. As a Floor manager I was expected to spend my shift on my feet walking around micro-managing every word that came out of my rep's mouths. Then once my shift was done, I was supposed to use my personal time to do my paperwork and assessments. I worked in excess of 60 hours every week with little to no consensus among my supervisors as to what the goals were or how to achieve them. My direct supervisor would give me a direction, then another supervisor would tell me to ignore that and do something else, then their supervisor would contradict both of them. Often I would then be held accountable for all 3 actions simultaneously. This happened constantly with all 30+ Floor Managers being basically harassed and harangued by 4 Region Managers and the Operations Manager anytime you crossed their path."
bad,It was a horrible part time job. that did not last long enough for benefits. They need to hire people permanently. I was happy to leave the place as soon as I could.
bad,"You will be overworked, under paid and constantly criticized for your job performance. They constantly require installers to work long hours, with no hope of extra compensation."
bad,"Toxic environment. Saw too many families go through divorce because of the stresses of the job. I saw too many men go to the bottle for support as a result of the emotional, physical, and mental stress and abuse from this job. Because AT&T Lobbies the heck out of government they are able to get away with abusing its employees and causing a lot of harm to the quality of life for hundreds of thousands of families across the country."
bad,"Working in the company I learned more from my co-workers than from the company itself, in a company that big you end up being a number more than a person... Poor benefits, no holidays, no hiring after 3 years of freelancing and then they decided not to hire... People have a  really big miss-conception about this company, they only care about numbers not human quality..."
bad,"Used workers for nporfit. There was nothing good about working for this company."
bad,"You might think that trying to cultivate a happy workforce as an elusive, time-consuming waste of important resources, but studies show that the opposite is true.  Creating a positive company culture begins with fostering happy employees."
bad,"Oh lord I don't even know where to begin. The training is sales based.. it's all about SALES....of Directv, Uverse, and last is the wireless service.. then customer service..3 wks of paid training with crammed info to learn .. which is the equivalent of a yr's worth of college work packed into 3 weeks...."
bad,I would not recommend working for this company. The pay is very bad for the amount of hours worked and management is poor. Was just a waste of time for me and many others.
bad,I use to love At&t as a sales manager rep but because of the ceo’s Ridiculous drive toward tv services most of the retail stores are closing forcing you to into positions that force you to drive everyday and go to customers hone where you get treated like scum. So happy I left.
bad,This company cares about profit and NOTHING else. They do not care about their employees at all. This was the most miserable job I have ever had. It is not worth the money.
bad,High turn over of management and supervisors. Continual changes to the procedures and day to day operation. Serious lack of quality training. Overall the job was not a bad place to work at first. Once the company switched from Asurion to IQOR things went downhill quickly.
bad,This company was very hard to work for  at the time I was employed there were no sick days given the job was  stressful there were several times that the ambulance came up to pick up several employees most of my teammates were out on stress leave
bad,Never worked with me schedule wise and always worked mainly weekends and no one else worked every weekend. I was not treated right when i told them I was pregnant. So I left for a different job
bad,As long as you are selling they don’t care what your customer service is like. I regret working there. 3 months of my life wasted. The training does not actually prepare you for anything. The managers are ridiculous. Absolutely absurd. If you can sell and do call center work. Have at it but it’s not a good job. Regret it to the fullest extent. The managers DO NOT care about you. You are a number to them. Screw AT&T.
bad,"This is not the best p;ace to work, it was a shift work with micromanagement and pretty much a job for students. Calls were back to back with no incentives"
bad,"AT&T is focused on hiring cheap labor.  When you get to a certain age they will push you out.  They are also hiring offshore and laying off American workers."
bad,If your reading this do not work here it was one of the most toxic work environments I have ever been in. The management are slave drivers. They yell at their workers like they are children. No respect for workers life-work balance.no respect for the workers period. You pay union dues and get 0 real representation the union is a parasitic bunch of goldbrickers that take your money for dues and give nothing back. The best part of this Job was leaving at the end of the very long work day. The worst part was having to go back to it. So glad that I am done with this company. I would not recommend working here to my worst enemy.
bad,"Be prepared to work with no real world training in the field. Lack of support as well as lack of tools and equipment. Everything that is detrimental to your performance is your fault regardless of circumstances.If there is inclement weather that delays how efficient you are in completing repair or install its your fault. If customer is not home for install its your fault and is reflected in your metrics. In addition, managers will use intimidation tactics to improve your metrics and if no improvements are made then you will be reprimanded."
bad,"If you're in Retail you'll never get out of it. You're stuck in retail! unless you know the right people. "
bad,"They bought a well run company and did everything they could to push out well paid talent. In the 2 years working under them, nearly all the a game players left, including myself."
bad,"Everyone has their own opinion about jobs."
bad,"A partir de que entro at&t han cambiado las cosas solo se dedican a correr gente por cualquier cosa para disminuir costos de mano de obra y no te dan liquidación de ley te dan cualquier cosa, la contratacion es vía agencia y es muy difícil que den las plantas actualmente. Los jefes dan preferencias a sus amigos para el crecimiento interno.Cambiaron las jornadas de trabajo antes eran de 6 horas para atención telefónica y ahora son de 10.5 Horas. El nuevo sistema de computo azul de at&t tiene muchas fallas por lo que dificulta el trabajo los clientes llaman molestos por la larga espera , muchas fallas a nivel nacional sin tiempo de respuesta."
bad,"This is not a great place to work"
bad,"Pushed to lie to customers- No time off without repercussions.  Management are hypocrites who are not above the maturity level of high school kids, who will not filter their conversation in front of customers."
bad,The company was going in the route of scripts and robots working and it took away from the personal element of conversation and you had to say it or you get punished and find yourself with no bonus and on written for not following verbatim scripts word for word.
bad,"Horrible Place to work, micromanagement, terrible managers, they are out to get prem techs, they hate military personnel. I can go on and on about how terrible they are"
bad,Don't work here unless you want your info leaked and Them do nothing about the situation pay for all your tools you need use your own had no reimbursement program
bad,The company culture is awful. They have no interest in customer service and the field tech's were just as unhappy. The support reps in other departments were clearly untrained and did not care.
bad,"I worked at a dealer store for AT&T, and it was completely a waste of time. Very high turnover rate, they didn't offer any training, so you were just thrown to the wolves and had to learn on your own. The only thing that this job taught me was time management. Since nobody took any ownership, I was the one in charge to make all the decisions and make sure things were done in a timely manner."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone, unless they like working outside and they like working for no reward.  your bosses don't care about you and you are just another number to AT&T."
bad,Elementary school with the management being the biggest upperclass bullies. Management has a power struggle and they treat workers like numbers. No family life ever.
bad,this job just isn't for some people. Prime cuts corners and tries its best to make sure they benefit more than you do. no care for the worker or their life just always how can you force more on people without their knowledge.
bad,"This isn't a horrible company to work for, as long as you don't get sick with an illness then they are not likely to work with you regarding surgeries and time off needed for recovery. I was told I had cancer and needed to have an operation to remove it. I gave ample time regarding time off needed and even met with HR to ensure that everything was approved. Up until this point I really enjoyed my position. Once I had the surgery and returned to work, everything was fine until 3 weeks later and they let me go because my time off for my surgery had been denied. In conclusion, as long as you are perfectly healthy they are a great place to work."
bad,Pay is bad. Can't make leaving with amount of money paid. company has a lot of favoritism and promote within. This company does not care about turn around and has bad management.
bad,"Poor management, nobody seems to know what is going on. Management shows you how to cheat this system to just get by and keep them out of trouble with the even higher management.  Occasionally you will get assigned special projects such as reporting and documenting who you think might be here illegally from jobs you are assigned. Why? Not sure if management is just messing with you or if they are serious. Overall poor management that does not know what they are doing. It is rewarding between you and the customer depending on what type of work ethic and job you do."
bad,This place just was not all they hyped it up to be. The money was not there at all and when a customer returns everything all your money is gone. Doesn't matter when they return it. Your money could be in the negative which means you were working for free until it was fixed. You made no money here.
bad,"If you want a job...something to pay the bills...here you go."
bad,"Management doesn't care about the individual.  I had been placed with a team lead I did not get alone with after being moved to another team because I complained about her.  There were 32 team leads and I had been with the same one for 2 years and liked that team lead very much, he was very professional. Then placed back with the team lead I complained about."
bad,I did not enjoy working for AT&T because there was no help from management. I don’t feel like I was trained correctly. There was no team building. I would not recommend AT&T to anyone.
bad,Too focused on numbers and not focused enough on the customer or employee.  Unethical practices were used by other managers and employees to keep their jobs.
bad,"Worst management!! The commissions are always lower and the sales increase! This company has a Revolving door ! Can’t keep reps Because of unfair practices! The Management is a joke. They lie and will Target you if you are unliked by Management! They want you to lie to sell  Ditectv services! They will do anything for a sale ! You will have to work holidays ! Open to close , you are not valued expect to kiss butt  If you don’t your fired ! Racist to people of color including customers ."
bad,"There is no where to advance in this company anymore. The manager micro manage and treat you like kindergartners. I would like to go to work, and work in a non stress free enviorment."
bad,training was okay depending on who trained you and the breaks and lunches were okay as well but the management their was not all on the same page training was quick but this workplace acted like no one had a liufe outside of work for example if you were sick or something happened they were not very understandable and not willing to work with you at all.
bad,"bad place to work, they do not tell you the truth about your hours or job expectations until you finish the training,  I was making 5.00 or less per hour because it was piece rate and at Directv you need to lie to customers to upsell to make any money."
bad,"Sales focused as opposed to customer Service focused."
bad,"As a Wire Tech, we're treated unfairly, never given any definite answers. Always treated like we're less then anyone else. Schedules change constantly with no real concern of your everyday life. No care for your mental health, or families. Just a stressful job that no one is happy at."
bad,"You are set up for failure from day one.  Management is racist, sexist, and egomaniacal in the extreme.  You are mocked, belittled, condescended to, and insulted nearly daily.  The company treats its employees as if they were kindergarten children.  Even when your metrics are the top in the company, you are still treated like you are scum, probably a felon, and a terrible person.  The call center is one of the worst places I have ever had the misfortune to work at and I would honestly rather be homeless and jobless than ever set foot back in that place.  I watched them fire a newer employee because he got pneumonia and was in the hospital!  He came back to work against medical advice, relapsed, and they FIRED HIM.  The managers walked around sick for months and spread the pneumonia around, but the non-management employees were the ones punished for getting ill."
bad,"The worst work culture that I ever worked!!"
bad,"horribly stressful, they hired a woman beater and allowed him to be promoted and be alone with women.Terrible work environment where they care more about numbers than people."
bad,The company had us doing technical support for DSL which was being phased out. We were required to upscale clients to Uverse even when the clients explicitly said they didn’t want it. They were cutting off DSL and then forcing client to switch to the new service. Team members were rated on how many client they got to switch. The call
bad,"Very Stressful, the employees were always worried about losing their job.  The bosses did not help grow their team to advance.  When it came time for training, there weren't enough work hours in the day to complete."
bad,"Not a good place to work, the culture there is toxic. Everyone is out for ones self. If you plan on being a yes person then AT*T is the place for you."
bad,This company needs some major HR training & coaching. The lack of professionalism is abhorrent. The leaders were not very knowledgeable which is a definite issue and it made it difficult to hear others
bad,"Used to work at DirecTV, when ATT bought them the culture became horrible. "
bad,"I worked in East Hartford. They were very bad management and bad supervisors. It was heavy rain. I had to climb to the second floor my supervisor was sitting in the van looking at me how I do my job!  never helped me it was hard work and they didn't pay hourly, they paid by piece, almost I spent my time with nothing. If you went for 2 or 3 hours driving and you didn't see the customer at his house they don't pay for you."
bad,The answer for this and most of the companies is the same. I do not remember much about the job only that it didn't stand out as being exceptional or memorable.
bad,"A.t.t.actully hates its customers and their employees 30 year employee, is a computerized only company treat experiance technican like ....... Management take no responsibility for decision"
bad,"They don't care about the employee. you are just a number. its not a bad company for a young person, but once you are 25+ years old, it is very difficult to sustain a good work/life balance"
bad,"If you want to be depressed and on anxiety meds, then this is the place for you! They don’t care as long as you sell! Sell, sell, sell! I used to love it, when it was customer service. Have no dignity, just sell all the things!"
bad,I came from the east coast to South Texas market. Was told Yankiees are not welcome here. Management over looks you and its still the good ol buddy system not what you know its who you know at AT&T
bad,This place was not to bad. It seemed cold and not full of activities. Who ever was running the place sure a hack did not care about the happiness of there employees.
bad,This is from a call center sales perspective which run my opinion is the worst area for this company. 8-5 back to back calls and managed closely on sales with extreme pressure to make numbers by any mens necessary.
bad,This company lies to its customers and employees and is currently targeting white males to remove from the company. This company often lies to its customers with promises of promotions that do not exist and are never honored.
bad,It mad me depressed and i hate my job. It caused great strain on my family and me. I had to take anti-depressants just to make it through the day. It mad me unable to enjoy the simple things in life.
bad,"you'll make good money but you can say goodbye to your personal life. They have no regard for your personal well being. I couldn't call out sick, I didn't get paid. My child was sick and I was at the store pass 11pm doing store fixtures."
bad,"Long hours to meet sales quotas, no solid training program. Management not on same page as employees. The hardest part of job is maintaining quotas in areas without traffic."
bad,"no care about employees only money lack of communication to customers , will straight out lie to customers to win them over "
bad,"Ethics are terrible here.  No accountability is held.  The training here is horrible but, it could be much better if time were taken to grow new hires."
bad,Starting in January of 2017 AT&T policies and procedures changed and it was an interesting work environment. All of our managers either were fired or left our department.
bad,AT&T is one of the few employers that I would never consider going back to. It was an okay company until AT&T took over and then it was downhill from there. Cares very little about current employees.
bad,"choose not to say how i feel about them, would not recommend them to any one was not happy with the way they ran there business, or the hours and how you had to sell direct tv"
bad,"terrible leadership culture,  Total lack of leadership at all levels through director level.  Unrealistic expectations and required work hours.  Poor pay and benefits"
bad,I am medically diagnosed chronic migraine due to the stress that I endured there.  I wouldn't let my children work there.  The place is not very friendly and does not support employees
bad,Att has no care for former employees and their family. I loved working for DIrectv and will give them 5 stars hands down! Miss my job terribly. I wish ATT would not have bought DIRECTV.
bad,Sucked horribly. Hours constantly changed as well as best business practices. You never knew what new rules you were gonna come into each day. It was not easy ti balance life and with with the constant changes
bad,"buen ambiente de trabajo, convivencia laboral excelente"
bad,"Working for Employers Options on temp assignments is a great way to get your foot in the door at a business. A lot of the jobs will hire you on full-time if you prove yourself an asset, which then gives you the potential to work your way from the bottom up inside that company."
bad,I enjoy working with technology. My current position allows me to work with up to date technology while at the same time coach others on various aspects of our business
bad,No job security in IT field with AT&T. Extreme micro management. A very noisy environment. Lack of upward mobility on call center side. On the job training is poor.
bad,Although the rate of growth for this company is very weak and compensation is based almost entirely on sales; working in a call center for AT&T or one of its authorized retail companies provides a friendly environment for bettering ones computer and data analytic skills.
bad,"Each month your requirements are raised and each quarter your pay struture is reduced so you make less. They ""coach"" you if you dont make your goals. I never had that issue but the ammount of stress it put on my coworkers to pressure sales upset slot of customers."
bad,"bad company to work for, horrible management practices... people have no idea what they are doing and they treat you like you arent part of leadership."
bad,"I moved over 700 miles with my children to start a job with this awful company. They offered me a job as an assistant manager, which they never gave me. They told me I'd work 47.5 hours a week and then said they cant give me overtime after I'd moved here already. They didnt even place me in the busy store they had offered me, and started me as ENTRY level making 11/hr after they promised me $15/hr plus commission and overtime. They also paid me $300 in commission after I earned a $1000 check."
bad,They could careless about their employees. The layoffs are constant all year long year after year. They layoff in small groups so it doesn't hit the press in my opinion. Already about 17% layoffs in IT this year.
bad,Culture changed for the worst acquiring of numerous company mergers and cutting commission sales to pay for these failures like T-mobile client told me once any business that can loose those kinds of funds at the table an still survive theres gotta be something fishy going on. I love the company back when it was Cingular winning multiple trips to summit those where the good old days but back then you had maybe 6 things to sell and they worked. This was back in 2006 you could make 65k or more. The company today does not care for you making anything close to this and if you do the comp plan is recalculated not to your advantage. For example today its all about DirecTv sales. Service is not the best with this system your forced to force it on everyone even customers that have had poor prior experience and if you sell it managers will leave you alone for a day. What changed was the integrity of sales within the company sale it we don't care how tell them its rated number 1 jdpower. They will try to force you into deceptive selling lie do whatever you need to do to get the sale but don't get caught! If you have integrity and blessed with care your clients you won't last here. Getting that DirecTv sale is have the mission because the installers are outsourced and may not be competent and you find that client calling you stating the installer was there when we had breakfast and lunch he's confused. Managers are the biggest issue just too immature for my taste. Managers will tell customers to schedule install dates to get additional thins in the store for simply making and appointment
bad,They treated me poorly and overworked me. It would have been different but our manager was a raging cocaine addict. He was eventually removed but too much damage had been done by then
bad,"Laid off over 20,000 employees during the last year I worked there. Played to the stock market on a monthly basis. Layoff announcements every quarter. Finally got bought by Southwest Bell. The whole telecommunications industry is disgusting."
bad,"I should have known what was to come when  I received an e-mail that I wasn't hired....BEFORE I even made the testing session.  HR recruiter passed it off as a ' system glitch'.  I aced the testing and the interview and was notified that I was hired.  I was told by e-mail to report for work at 8:00 am on a Monday...only to find out that after arriving that they wanted us there at 7:30 am.  What followed was six weeks of 'new style training', followed by two weeks on the floor actually taking calls followed by two more weeks in the classroom, followed by what was termed 'nesting' ( the schedule of which actually prompted a union grievance by the existing reps!)  To this day, I am unsure as to why they needed to hire new employees, since every day I saw e-mails asking reps to take unpaid time off due to lack of call volume.  Very poor scheduling management, to say the least."
bad,"They take advantage of employees and threaten jobs on a daily basis. Upper management has absolutely no idea what they are doing or how to do the job they expect us to do, yet they try to manage by those standards that could run the program into the ground."
bad,"Will pay you less to train new hires that make more then you because they need more bodies and you were to stupid to demand more up front and then told to bad you agreed to your pay...didn't agree to train someone else for less. Morons!"
bad,Not appreciated bad leadership not much to tell i worked until the company outsourced found replacements so im looking for new employment locally. Using the skill and knowledge i have
bad,Didn't have good management and was very stressful. The hardest part was interacting with management. The most enjoyable part of the job was going home.
bad,"not a good company to work for, they are out for themselves and do not care about the employee. No matter if you were at fault or not, you are at fault."
bad,"Management is not your friend and they do not care about you or whether or not you make money. You are penalized for sick days and even doctors notes do not save you from getting ""points""."
bad,"I think the review summary says it all.  AT&T only cares about one thing, and one thing only, their money.  If you're not making money for them, they're not happy with you.  If you're not trying to swindle money out of their customers, they're not happy with you."
bad,never in my life would I work for them again in that capacity.  threatened with termination on a daily basis to increase job performance.  mandatory 60 hour work weeks.
bad,"not a career here,look somewhere else, i did not find much opportunity for growth and they do not pay anyone anything but peanuts. "
bad,"No"
bad,I didn't learn a lot. I was working with DIRECTV and AT&T was just joining with DIRECTV. I put my two weeks in because my schedule was switching to something i could not work.
bad,the whole 3D team was a joke. I recommend working for the actual Company and not authorized retail dealer. More money there and advancement . The favoritism there was out of sight. No one stays there now.
bad,"They make you work like slaves and won't give you enough pay to supportyourself, then close your center down so your left high and dry anyhow. Overall bad"
bad,New ideas are not welcomed. Work environment is very toxic. No career advancement. Constant treats about job security and sales goals. Pay plans change by the minute and never to benefit the salesperson.
bad,"Management is poorly trained, directives from corporate poorly communicated, metrics too highly stressed, we're always told that quality of work counts more than quantity of work but corporate and management always pushing employees to do more and more and more"
bad,poor management and ugly parking. worst managers. no help. the managers don't help. bad schedule. they don't provide you with incentives. no room to move up.
bad,"Management is not to par and they promote people with extensive criminal records to store managers. not a good company, again management sucks all the way to district manager and above. do not waste your time working for this company,"
bad,"My last eight years there, it seemed like there were annual layoffs; upper management seemed to change out every two years. How can a company succeed with such little continuity? Eventually ""merged"" with, I think, SWB ... no longer a ""Ma Bell"" to speak off."
bad,"job was the worst job i have ever had, treated like a number, pay was insulting, turnover rate was insane, supervision changed weekly, new techs weekly."
bad,"I was with AT&T for nine years in a call center. My official title was customer assistant. The fact that what I actually did was T1, and T2 tech support was irrelevant. AT&T would not change our job title because they could pay us much less as CA's. "
bad,The store I worked for was a slave driver that treated employees horribly. My heart started to palpitate on my days off when I heard my phone notify me of a new text due to the likenesses that it was my boss.
bad,"-A typical day working for at&t is very difficult"
bad,"Constant daily rotating shifts, no employees routine. Elderly & Mentally challenged, neglected, DUE to time limits employees are FORCED to maintain. It just sucks to work under this condition."
bad,"No follow through on anything. strict, daunting reviews constant scrutiny. Numbers driven only.  In the last days of ATT before it closed our offices, goal that could never be met. Calls that could never be sold on and even if you did, there were no credits for that as nearly all the calls were Telco calls."
bad,Horrible company to work for.  Horrible pay for the amount of work you do.  I would not recommend working here.  Little room for promotion when you're a premises technician
bad,1099 was the worst way to go with AT&T and the hardest part about the job was convincing to get something they didn't need/want. Plus I was away from my family a lot.
bad,"full of old slow workers waiting for retirement. very political. not high tech at all. unqualified managers and directors. terrible office, provides nothing, not even water. avoid at all cost."
bad,"Management there is horrible they don't know what they're doing, don't take any suggestions and work the same people over and over to death. they tend to like to pick and choose insignificant things to micro manage instead of worrying about managing what they are supposed to the production. too much micromanaging going on to the point where even for talking to your neighbor they give you the stare of death. Will never work for them again."
bad,Negative work atmosphere. Horrific co-workers who are their to collect a check and complete the least amount of work as possible. Avoid this place at all costs.
bad,"if your from the ghetto NYC you'll be at home, if your an older person past 27 years of age youll be lucky if they hire you, if you have medical problems they wont hire you , your harassed all day long and when you excel in one area they will harass you about something else."
bad,"the working environment was rough. Every day was another hard day of back-breaking labor in the snow, sun rain and every other working condition you could think of."
bad,"Call center so it was extremely loud. They didn't care about the customers, only if your handle time was under ten minutes. If the problem could not be solved in ten minutes, then you had to tell the customer to call back."
bad,I worked there 10 years every year it got worse... the health benefits are great pay is okay but still not enough in my area living paycheck-to-paycheck waking up every day and wishing you would be anywhere besides that place unreasonable goals they expect you to meet horrible managers that don't do their job select favorites no room to move up in the company unless you're hooking up with a manager really a disgusting place to work didn't used to be this way but unfortunately they just went downhill they give you tiny little annual raises but took away all the bonuses I literally was making more money at the beginning of my career with that company I'm sad that I wasted so much time there and they had so much promise but turned out to be a waste of time caused me a lot of illness because of the stress finally decided to just quit and be happy if you want to be miserable you should work there
bad,"Company is not what it used to be, they hired over 14,000 new employees just to have half of them get laid off that is ridiculous. Also management was very poor"
bad,"When I started there it was good, I worked with a great team and learned alot of new things. My manager left due to not getting paid for running two stores full time and after he left it sort of fell apart. Everyone was dropping like flies! We had 5 managers in the area quite within a month. They worked us from 9-8 regularly and wanted us to be there even when hazerdous weather shut every other business down. They sometimes forgot to pay my commission and other employees didn't always get paid their full hourly or PTO. I've honestly never been so stressed at one job. Do Not work here!"
bad,"Hours are awful, upper management is even worse. No work/life balance and a very cut-throat environment. Work every weekend as the new guy and no matter how good you're doing, even if you lead your store, you will be asked to do more."
bad,"Turn over is very high and now I know why. That's all I'm going to say, plus I'm moving out of town.  My L1 supervisor was new to the company and she did whatever she had to do to make herself look good to her peers."
bad,I'll keep it simple. They told me to add insurance to everyone customers plan even if they denied it.  Then they wrote me up afterwards for not complying with team objectives.  Hmmm ok
bad,bad place to work this was probably the worst work environment that I have ever come across.  the management did not belong in their positions and they did not care about their employees
bad,Management wants to micro manage everything you do. From how your work looks to your clothing. they say its all about the customer but its no. nothing is about the customer. its all about the managers getting there numbers up and looking good on paper.
bad,"Cingular was a great company to work for.  However, when AT&T purchased Cingular, compensation and benefits were restructured resulting in significantly lower quality of life."
bad,I used to be a telemarketer and AT&T is worse than that.  They do not care about the safety of their employees only to not get fined by OSHA standards.  Management makes up rules as they go along which contradict the union contract which is a joke.  It is everyone for themselves.
bad,This is a stupid company who will eat your soul and not let you have a life outside of work di\o not work for them at any cost I m telling you now do not work there
bad,Una empresa donde no se preocupan por sus empleados su método es causar miedo a empleados para lograr objetivos siempre hay aclaraciones en tu sueldo las cuales jamás son resueltas y muchísimo favoritismo además de que hay gente que está en puestos importantes sin tener ética profesional ni conocímiento ni la experiencia suficiente para resolver dudas de empleados y clientes además de que el área de recursos humanos es súper deficiente ya que nunca logran resolver una duda y cada que vas a pedir alguna carta te hacen malas caras o simplemente te ignoran.
bad,"Tech support training was a joke. Support team members were lazy and egotistic. The only way to survive here, is to quit. A multi-billion dollar company pays its employees pennies. People here are only looking out for themselves. Lack of teamwork."
bad,Favoritism they do not apreciate long term employees
bad,every year it seemed the company would cut jobs and find ways to pay people less on commission earnings. Mangers are all horrible and the company puts a lot of stress on people.
bad,taking inbound calls from customers that own the products that are on the ATT network for their cellular service.  Inbound calls and fix issues that are not working correctly with the customers products or service.
bad,This was a horrible place to work. The training was rushed and wasteful. Too much time spent on explaining how the product is ran to the home and not enough training on the systems themselves. There was never any help when needed and customers would become irrate due to being on hold for so long while trying to find someone to help. So a simple call would turn into a nightmare for all involved!
bad,Management was rude and unhelpful.There is a lot that is expected of you and no one is willing to help you meet the companies goals. Very unprofessional environment. Don't do this to yourself. Flee.
bad,"unions is a joke, lost job because of lazy union giving jobs to low paid contractors. union will fight to keep lazy workers and let good ones go.  fight the union.  CWA 4034 is a JOKE!!!"
bad,All i got to say is all you bums working as door to door salesman. LOL can't even make a sale you biscuit heads you get so mad when you get turned down at the door
bad,"Working at AT&T was one of the worse job experiences of my life, The only pro was the mandatory raises due to the union but there is a cap on how much you'll make throughout your career in a specific position."
bad,company merged/horrible management/always looking for sale/benefits were you paid $10 for all the cable channels/not allowed to provide feedback/retaliations
bad,we were not trained properly to do the job at the call center. no training on how to handle hostile customer interactions. this job was not a good fit for me.
bad,"The posted position was for Customer Service, however, upon training I discovered the position was actually Sales.  As a Customer Service Representative you answer the phone and provide assistance to the customer (taking payments, processing orders, changing packages, etc.).  You are required to make a sales pitch on every call...even if someone is calling to delete a cell phone number from their account due to a death.  If on this type of call you do not make a sales pitch, and happen to me monitored, you get written up. Real horrible company policy!!!"
bad,Work life balance off. Mandatory OT. Not structured. Picky about reading exactly what the script says. Hard to advance within company. Bonus mixups. Hard to get a good bonus. Raises were delayed. Training not accurate to real phone experience with people regarding internal problems. Hard to get customer surveys because business is scamming clients making them pay insane fees and charges.......just to name a few :)
bad,"stats stats stats.. then stats wouldn't matter, but then they did. continuous switching of management opinion and rules. ATT is one of the worst companies ever."
bad,"I had been working for at&t and directv and there is no time off, no sick time, no vacation, no paid raise, no health insurance, no 401k, and the list goes on..."
bad,"Major disconnect between upper management and your assistant manager. When something goes wrong, everyone just wipes their hands and blame someone else."
bad,"Steals from customers on a regular basis.  Nothing but the worst service available at the highest cost, and its always a battle. No one deserves to be treated like that."
bad,"review title says it all. your work will be appreciated elsewhere, most sales people are contracted by a never-ending pyramid of salespeople, once you can sell direct tv for a year then they give you your own office and let you hire a dozen guys to start a sales team."
bad,"Poor management.  Horrible place for women.  Old white guys running the show like it's 1950!"
bad,The company forces workers to do a lot and essentially become pushy salesmen. They want to you to constantly bundle things rather than right fitting customers.
bad,"As a contractor in the IT field, I have never experienced anything like how AT&T treats us. They expect more than 40 hours to be worked, they do not pay overtime to contractors though."
bad,The pay was good I love working with customers communicating with others in the building team player I love my hours in the location love working with the people for over 18 years
bad,"was flexible i enjoyed working there most of the time , the job site closed down and i was left unemployed with not even a months notice. the job was unperfessional"
bad,I worked for Directv before they were bought out by At%t as a independent contractor. Very bad company to work for this way. If you want to work there make sure it is in house.
bad,"The turn over was over 90 percent, and after one week I could see why. People are treated like tools and just put out there saying good luck. I would never want to have to do anything like this job every again."
bad,The left hand doesnt know what the right hand is doing. Unrealistic goals to be meet. Little to no job security. This is the worst place I ever worked for in my life.
bad,Job was ok they need better communication between customer service and the actual direct tv office other then that the job is actual decent also as well they need to give employees holidays off instead of making them work on those actual days
bad,"Would not recommend this company for employment, the company doesn't care about its employees at all. They will find any reason to right you up and the union doesn't do any thing to help."
bad,once direct tv was bought technicians hours went from over 40 to not even getting 32 hours a week got to the point that they would send home the senior techs and keep the junior techs working when the work got super slow
bad,"Would not recommend this job to anyone, it was a bad experience.  The manager was awful and very lazy. Dealt with many rude customers, very low pay. Do not work here."
bad,Terrible stressful place to work manger was horrible to work for because he had a bad temper all the time everyday was stressful if you didn't make a sale
bad,"the work at AT&T was a stressful, call center position in customer service.  the shift/day was spent listening to customer complaints and trying to resolve their issues within a specified time limit to complete and adhere to company policies."
bad,"I LOVED working for DIRECTV, but once AT&T took over, it didn't like my job at all. As soon as the job protection DIRECTV secured once AT&T bought them out, they laid off 100's of employees."
bad,It is a very hard place to work.  You never know if you will have a job at the end of the month and they never have anything positive to say about you.  Very negative atmosphere
bad,"I didn't like this job at all. At&T is a bad compamy to work for I would not recomend it to anyone.The benefits were bad, they have PTO with amounts to less than 9 days off per year including sick time"
bad,Management was the worse the training was extremely long. A typical day at work was taking inbound calls and assisting customers. The most enjoyable is the friends I met.
bad,"There was no morals used when dealing with technicians. I feel that you need to take care of the technicians that work for you, The customers will be taken care of better when the technicians want to work for you."
bad,"working for AT&T was very ruff. I did not enjoy the management, nor the culture that at&t provided us as employees. I would not recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"A typical day may include a conversation with your supervisor if they happen to work that same day telling you that you are not working hard enough. Oftentimes there is one or more days where you have no support available from your Manager as their schedule won't match yours. It is frustrating and if you seek help from another Manager they will act put out."
bad,"treat all the technicians like slaves. too much overtime with no notice, horrible services and terrible customer service. very greedy company that scams it's customer's with sales."
bad,managers will pressure you to make sure you arent canceling orders because coporate hammers on them about it. as well as they will harrass you and the union does nothing about it
bad,"Horrible culture, not an environment that has realistic expectations of employees.  Often the management could make people uncomfortable for things that were out of employees control"
bad,You're sold a story where you dictate how much you'll make based on your job completions. What they don't tell you is after you finish your jobs you will be sent to help other people on their jobs. There is zero incentive to work hard and finish because you won't pick up an extra paying job. You'll just pick up someone else's slack.
bad,Very top level heavy. Read online reviews on Glassdoor for yourself to see the reviews on working here. I've been here over 10 years now and have tried applying internally for years and have gotten nowhere. You have to know people to move up.
bad,"The training is unrealistic and does not truly give you a clear picture of your job duties and responsibilities.  Management is not all on the same page and with constant moving around, it is difficult ."
bad,"The company doesn't care about its customers or employees, they charge per repair and install visit, and they don't care about their workers either. The tax reform gave AT&T massive kick backs and this company went on record bragging about how many new jobs they will now create and it is the complete opposite effect. We are laying off and firing by the thousands because of higher ups poor decisions. They are drowning so bad that now a sub par customer service company is going to cash grab at whatever they can to bleed faithful customers dry."
bad,"Great way to meet new interesting people daily. Stressful not having support to handle clients needs: Outsourcing retention calls out of US to individuals you can barely understand holding 45 min-1:45 hours items, missing sales because items are never in stock, poor upper management and marketing culture that have no clue of there customer base: Just bad ideas for products. Never listening to client needs. Culture typically promotes individuals who do exactly what told without question."
bad,Worked there for. 8 years. Was let go like yesterdays trash. Without reason or cause. No benefits offered.  Unreliable employment . Somedays you work some days you dont and you have no say in that.
bad,"Management puts undo stress on you to surpass your quota and make money for them."
bad,"Legit the absolute most terrible Job I have ever had"
bad,"This job will prepare you for corruption at its best. There is a true saying here. It just gets worst and worst. 71percent commision cuts across the board and now required to sell 5 times as much product. If you excel in metrics they will just adjust them some you're not excelling. In 2003 working here I made 13k more than I have made last year alone 2017, and back then I made $4 less hourly.  High school behaviour type management. Older vets know how to deal with this incompetence, but new hires burn out quick and don't even bother giving notice. Once the 71 percent commission cuts hit I left. Just wish I had left sooner."
bad,"They are terrible company that took over Directv and turned it into a an inefficient and slow paced mess.  I am glad I left when I did, they got rid of the extremely talented people that I enjoyed working with."
bad,"it was a job, not a career, poor benifits and lots of multimanging, union never stood for the their peers, just collected their due and when it was time to fight we never had a good fight"
bad,You work independently having to do jobs outside your scope. Every job has to be done by a certain predetermined time or your numbers are hit. If your numbers do not stay above certain criteria you are disciplined. If you make your numbers and a great employee managers will find a way to discipline you to force you to stay in that roll for extra time before you can advance which essentially means you will never advance. Hours are long starts at 8am may get off at 8pm or 11pm.
bad,they have high expectations of their management which is to be expected but they are worked more and harder due to them being salary and under paid for commission. Sales reps make more than managers.
bad,I learned some things and really was not used to my fullest capacity. I This was a great job while i had it because i learned more than any other job i have had in the past.
bad,Didn’t work for corporate store. Advanced communications was a terrible company. Left us without a manager for months. Worked us long hours. Gave position to a thief.
bad,The training is not adequate to applying to in the field operations. The company does not allow for a medical leave while you are in training. I had to quit or be terminated because of this.
bad,Bad management treated like a number not paid enough days off are horrible don't have family time at all.........................................................
bad,The company overall cares more about making money than their employees and their customers. That is evident when reaching out to upper management with concerns.
bad,"If you like High school and drama then this is the place for you. If you like to sell additional products and services with generic training then this is the job for you. If you like to be micromanaged and told how to sell from managers who have NEVER sold DirecTv/U-verse then this is the job for you. If you care about selling more than resolving your customers issues, then this is the job for you. If you like a stressful environment with frequent anxiety attacks then this is definitely the job for you. If you want a union that doesn't really do a thing for you, then by all means work here. If you want to fit in go and tell on everyone."
bad,"Not a good job to work, the people were good but the management was bad. My manager Noe was a type of guy who would tell you whatever just so you can get out of his office. He wont help you on any jobs and he lies right in your face."
bad,I was a U-Verse Technician. Someone was considered to be a senior member of the team with only one year of experience which goes to show the turnover rate. It was terribly managed.
bad,"answering customers calls for troubleshooting phones or billing concerns they may have when they called into at&t. "
bad,"Spring Mobile at South Park Mall in San Antonio, an Authorized Retailer for AT&T, have no care to who they employ; I had a poor manager and store manager. They don't care what happens to you, you have to be responsible for what happened to you. If you don't want a pig for a manager, don't work here. Low on customers so low commissions and higher goals to make."
bad,"I dont recommend working here, its just not a good place at all or company to work for. This is one of the reasons why Im on here looking for better employment."
bad,"Great pay, bad work environment. There are some good people working there. The push sales, which you get commission off of. If you can get past the bad work environment it usually has, then you are good, I meant it does have a great pay. In my training class there were about 20 people, after 4 months only 3 people work there still that was from the training class, including me."
bad,"Managers are in place with no real experience on how to manage. They promote their friends, a real kiss up job if you want to be successful. All about who you know...not what you know,"
bad,This is one of the worst companies I've ever worked for they are cut throat and the managers used scare tactics that kept employees unnecessarily stressed.  Things could of been way smoother but upper management cared more about how much more money they could get rather than their rapport with their frontline employees. If a cellphone was returned they would take an employees entire commission check with no explanation. It always felt that there was a battle between the managers and the reps that should have never existed.
bad,"I was prem tech I was fired and believe me im not upset about that was weight lifted off my shoulders Union cwa out of  flint mi such a joke these guys wont even call you  in fact our stewards go to the bars with the managers. the union never put my best interest out there. they work with company to get rid of squeaky wheels. I was one of them. Everything I felt about the union proved to be right."
bad,"very stressful, the call volume is large"
bad,"They do not care about your advancement only lining the pockets of investors. Was there for four years and had over 10 different managers. No one can stay because the motto is do it or your fired, even if the task is impossible."
bad,"Virtual call center agent. Was taught computer programs, but not content regarding product. Some customers knew more than I did. Logging into system went to pot when switching from training through wfr agency to AT&T"
bad,"Working at AT&T would have been much better had a worked for a Core store rather than an authorized retailer. Management was horrible, failed to adhere to company policies most of the time, and compensation for almost 24/7 work commitments was horrible. I would work for a sales position again, just not for AT&T under Premier Technologies."
bad,A typical day is researching missing payments and calling banks to apply funds to the correct account. Management was very helpful. The hardest part was making sure every account was coded correctly. The most enjoyable part was having coworkers that was willing to help out if needed
bad,poor management no experience cut throat. stressful environment I would cry daily. Management wasn't fair at all. unhealthy atmosphere. felt like I had to lie to customers and deceive them.
bad,ATT used to be a great place to work. They would treat the employees and customers wonderful.  Now it is only about the money they make. No concern for customers or employees at all. I will never work there again after many great years the job affected my health and well being to much. I was to sell sell sell no matter who the customer was. Example sell direct tv highest cost television package to a 90 year old blind woman and you must push it or else.
bad,"Cut throat Corporate mentality. Only cares about $$$, not employees or customers. Company wants to automate as much as possible, which will cut more staff. Company doesn't care about quality."
bad,"consistently exceeded management sales quotas. Worked well during heavy seasonal traffic, was excellent representative for high quality store. Was asked to analyzed competitor products and provide report. I was also responsible for maintaining store appearance, store opening, and closing procedures. Overall I gained a diverse experience in customer relations."
bad,i dont know what you want me to say i did not enhoy this job it is a bad produbt and i felt bad for selling it to people and was not shown any remorse by employers
bad,"Pretty much everything you would think an evil corporation would do in a movie, they did.  They even stopped buying coffee for the office!  The Union is a joke, they have no power, and will sell you out in a heart beat"
bad,Not Good I worked outdoors and In doors I went door to door and It was very unsafe they would send me Into really unsafe neighborhoods which made me feel uncomfortable.
bad,the work place was very stressful and very unorganized. Policies would constantly change making it confusing of how to go about the daily load. My manager was one of the most inexperienced person in the department. I could not ask a question without him not knowing the answer or the proper procedures of handling different situations.
bad,Very cut throat environment. Expected to work 24/7/365 even when on vacation. The environment is also very accusatory. Leaders are always looking to blame someone and not focused on finding a resolution.
bad,"This is the worst run cooperation. They do not care about the customer or employee. They are old and tired, they do not bring anything new to the industry, just poorly imitate what real innovative companies are doing."
bad,"Not a good company to work for. If you like a cut throat culture than this could be a good job!"
bad,"No chance at advancement, or pay increase. Told daily that no one was putting a gun to my head to make me show up to this job. Show up and shut up. Shotgun management is what we called it."
bad,"Day persists of pulling job, greeting customer, trying to undo all the lies they were told when services were ordered, going to xbox that looks like a blind man wired, driving back to house to find service lines bad but unable to get help due to them trying to do away with lineman jobs so you spend hours trying to repair something your not suppose to be working on, when you finally get job completed you repeat process then get reprimanded for spending to much time on a job."
bad,"AT&T was the worst job ever, if your looking for lack of leadership and professionalism than this is the place for you. The entire company was a big scam. They trick their customers into buying TV & internet service and would often lie about free products. There are no morals when it comes to AT&T."
bad,Very clicky atmosphere.  Management  is lazy and absent. No real advancement opportunities. Stressful. No good hours. Pay is okay but not compared to what  you deal  with.
bad,The company doesn't care about its employees.  Upper leadership is dishonest and manipulative.  Sales targets are misleading and unrealistic.  The politics played by upper leadership are impossible to navigate and employees are treated like they are nothing more than expendable.
bad,This place was horrible.  I got laid off right after I got a big raise along with everyone else in my department and management is from a remote site.  What a joke of a company.
bad,"This is where mediocrity goes to work.  If you are a hard working self motivated person, this is not the place for you.  You are a number to them and constantly reminded that you have no job security beyond the next surplus which happens every quarter.  If you like worrying about getting laid off even if you perform at a high level then by all means sign up! Worst company I've ever worked for.  Products are poor, director level and above is incompetent, and they do not care about customer experience. Work anywhere else if you value yourself and your sanity. Life is too short."
bad,"a franchise att owned by people who have very poor management skills.  treat staff like garbage and are very condescending to others. have absolutely no respect towards any employee.. "
bad,"Old culture, old habits, and oddities abound here!  I was a contractor with them and it's a futile effort dealing with this company.  They don't want to change."
bad,"* A typical day at work consisted of my phone ringing almost non stop even before I stepped foot into my location. Several conference calls with leadership. Coaching and developing my team members constantly. Wearing several hats to maintain the flow of my business. "
bad,"they are not conducive to anyone with integrity nor honesty. I would NOT recommend this company or its products to anyone whom I care about."
bad,I worked here when it was Direct TV. Your'e answering a lot of calls and up selling products as your reading them their bill or helping them fix their system.
bad,"If you’re not a white male you don’t stand a chance in the "
bad,A typical can go good or bad on any job most day are okay. I make the best of every day I go to work on any job and get the job done unless there are technical difficulties with equipment.
bad,"culture very rigid not flexible, required more responsibilities with no more compensation. limited advancement opportunities, restrictions on advancement"
bad,"I have nothing good to say about att ,very bad people to work for, managment is trouble .No commmuncation lack of concern for their employes .Would not work  there again"
bad,"taking calls was easy. I loved helping help. I understand people do not like being on the phone for a long time. I was was and really unwanted to help.but would ""take too long on my phone calls"""
bad,I worked at convergys doing customer service for directv and the project was pulled. When convergys had the project employees who wanted it could work as much overtime as they wanted and agents who could sell made a lot of money.
bad,"The company is not a good one to work for. They only care about making money and they don't care how the sales consultants feel ever!! Worst job I have worked for! Since i have worked for the company my pay has gone down, and it keeps going down. As a consumer the products are good but that is it."
bad,"La Gerente Gisleym Ruiz, pésima, sin ética profesional y robándole dinero a al empresa, pésima líder,  apoya cuando le conviene y es muy deshonesta"
bad,I would never recommend this place at least as a sales associate. Managers cuss at you and yell at you in front of other employees. I never received proper training and I got depressed having to go into work. never again. Wish I never started.
bad,"Horrible environment, no support provided to employees when personal issues arise. No room for promotion unless willing to trample on others in the process."
bad,I worked for directv. Installed satellite  TV systems in residential  homes and dealt with a lot of different people .. drove a company van and  worked in many weather conditions.
bad,The only good thing about working here is the monthly bonus checks. They talk a good game in meetings but when you need one on one help management passes you off to someone else. Training is horrible and they know it but no one is doing anything to make it better. You don't even get insurance until after 6 months. There is no sick time.
bad,"monitor your phone calls to customer and then bring you into the room and reprimand you every week and then decide to put you on probation"
bad,It was extremely difficult to try to persuade somebody into keeping programming that they never watch or have no idea about or did not like. If we removed what they were asking us to remove it went against us in a negative way for our bonus.
bad,To much favoritism from upper management. Company that terminates senior employee to hire new employees to pay them less and eliminating benefits. Supervisors don’t care about what goes on in the store
bad,Working as a assistant manager at a call center takes a very patient kind of person.  Managing employees is the easy part but handling mad customers all day is what is the hardest.
bad,"AT&T call center is a very balanced place to work until you become sick and have FMLA leave then they will find every excuse to fire you,along with using points against you when you are out on medical leave"
bad,"Unfair to employees, biased towards friends, over worked, underpaid. I would never ever recommend anyone to ever work for Prime Communications. Absolutely the worst."
bad,Work life balance is null. Not a good place for contractors. No flexibility for contractors. Treated like dirt by AT&T full timers. Made  to stay long hours for no reason.
bad,"AT&T is constant cut throat company, they make huge mistake at the top, and cut jobs at the lower level. The management team are bully. If you don't agree with them they will get rid of you."
bad,"Would not recommend - post acquisition, the corporate culture at DirecTV was exceptional, now it's sub par. No room for advancement in the new regime. The company is too big."
bad,did not enjoy my time with company. managers are cut-throat/heartless. hours were extreme. metrics are almost impossible to satisfy. very stressful environment
bad,"There hours & days were changed weekly, never consistent. When asked to accommodate, they did not want to bother. They had young teenagers as supervisor position who were very immature & irresponsible to talk too. I did very well in sales & they gave you a quota on how many TV,phone internet to sell. They would keep raising it every month just so you had to work even more harder & under pressure to succeed."
bad,embarrassing to call at&t a flagship fortune 5 USA company. They cut healthcare and union benefits at every turn and will not hesitate to outsource even the most critical parts of the customer experience to overseas contractors who do the work for pennies on the dollar
bad,I did not mean to put AT&T but the company was Ibex Global who was a call center for at&t. It was horrible from management to customers. Highest turn over rate ever. Now its shut down at my location in Hamptn Va. Everybody had to find new jobs.
bad,The internal culture was very disappointing and net work at the time was very minimal when it worked it was great but it was easy to  loose signal back then
bad,"Would not recommend anyone to work here, they don't treat you like humans, very bad culture, no work life balance, they don't care if your family is at risk, micro manages their employees"
bad,Worked for 14 yrs 11months 2 days and was release after being sick. no package or compensation for all the years of loyal service. No compassion for loyal employees. Worked 8+ hours a day. But overall stressful environment.
bad,I will not be posting a review about jobs I am no longer with. If this is confidential and no one sees this then cut this out because it is not helping!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,Would not recommend as a place to work stress full company treats employees like tools and not people and place no value to them long hours dangerous eorl and under paid
bad,Expect you to work very long hours for little pay. You will have no home life. you spend 90% of your day working long hours. supervisors have no care for their employees. with this being a Union Company they will fire you quickly for the smallest things.
bad,"AT&T, it is a great company to work for, l learned a lot of staff in terms of experiencing and working with great people. It is a place for all kind of all culture background."
bad,The main thig i can say is that the owner of the stores i worked at is he doesn't kinow how to run a business. he moved us around to 4 different stores every other day. Because you were the only one scheduled in the store all day you couldn't take any brakes. He didnt even make a weekly schedule it was day by day so you couldnt make any plans absolutely ridculous/
bad,Hands down the worst place I have ever worked. Management runs things by the spreadsheet and posts your numbers daily for everyone to review. Taking the time to fix a customers issue will results in bad numbers causing good technicians to speed through and only temporarily fix issues.
bad,"AT&T may carry a huge name, however, just as many companies of this size tend to do, they simply do not care about the employees, especially about the ones that work to maintain and grow their existing wire infrastructure. Very low pay, very hazardous, brutal management tactics, threats of losing the position due to company changes, managers are never there, and when they are, they show that they do not care about the quality of life of their employees, or teams. They are consumed with making money for themselves, and could care less if we are trained well. The training is the worst I have ever seen from any company in my 22 years of employment. If you want to work for this company, make sure it is in management from day one, and make sure it is an office job, not an outdoor technician environment."
bad,This company is one of the worst I have worked for. Low quality of life when it comes to work home balance. Very devious and questionable actions. Would not recommend working for them
bad,After the AT&T buyout of DirecTV they cut my pay by two-thirds. Took away our pension program. They do not allow us to sell DirecTV services with any compensation.
bad,If you like the verbal abuse and physical abuse from people then this is the job for you. The rewards to not balance the amount of stress and anxiety you'll get from this job.
bad,"I hated this Job with a passion, I was a wonderful employ, and they did not try to help me advance,or care about my career goals. I did not feel they valued me a human being, they thought , I was a number, even though I worked harder then anyone, and they did not care."
bad,"They hired you for customer service but in reality they want you to be a sales person. You get quotas if you don't meet them they don't like you if you do they love you, but its an up and down job one month is good the next one can be bad. no room to growth in this company and they don't give you health care insurance coverage"
bad,Not enough hours and not enough pay for the work that you do. You work weird hours and with weird lunch breaks. Phone never stops being on que. Manager is a ways hovering.
bad,I did not like this company one bit i was in charge of customers account to help fix there problems not to up sell the on plans they dont need just so they can make a buck.
bad,"they continued changing our job duties as sales reps, never gave us more money. didnt treat us fairly. kept increasing commision goals which made it harder to hit those goals, and made our goal pay out lower."
bad,"Lack of effective communication of expectations:  Never had a clear picture of success for myself."
bad,going from door to door selling uverse packages to people . very expensive packages .get ready to walk a lot and denied most of the time because not everyone is friendly
bad,They have lost a direction and the employees are paying for the lack of upper management.  The coaching methods that once allowed for growth are now used to build a case to fire employee.
bad,As this is a union job the management is very tough to deal with on a day to day basis. Employees are constantly made to work odd shifts and to put their families by the wayside for the company.
bad,Not so much attention to the reason the customer called in. Required to rush the resolution of the call and move immediately to selling additional services.
bad,They hired a center manager that had no sales skills and didn't know how to sell the benefits of our program to the client. They then promoted a someone to manager who made inappropriate advances towards me and I was fired days later after 8 years of being one of their top performers.
bad,I loved working on the river walk but this job was very stressful. customers would call and complain at you because the service was so terrible. the pay was decent but the job was too stressful and not worth it.
bad,Always playing catch up to Verizon and has a theory anyone can be plugged into any level of management and it just works due to leadership never being exposed to a job in the ranks of non-mgmt. and protected until they get three or four stripes.
bad,You don't want to work for AT&T. The company cares little for its employees and most of the management i have dealt with are grossly under qualified for their job
bad,Enjoyed working when first started but new company direction made it absolutely dreadful. Pay went down as amount of work increased. Become burnt out very quickly. Management only worried about making numbers look good
bad,"Stressful & Too Big To fix any real problems.. Extremely political, unwilling to accept change even when directed.. Cradle to grave...Do not waste your career here.."
bad,"awful company to work for since att has taken over. management is awful, they set unrealist goals, and will take your well earned bonus from you if you miss more than 1 day a month"
bad,At&t only hires temporary positions and nothing permanent.  They are ok if you don;t mind having you monitored and having you always being monitored and watched by supervisors. They do not listen to employees if they have a way to fix issues. Strictly by the book and management is rude to customers.
bad,Apply only if you have to.  Not the best place to work. Retail stores are closing soon. Stay away. Make this your last option ATT is not the best place to work.
bad,"The manager knew absolutely nothing on a daily basics, not even the direct manager. It was never an easy going work environment. It was always uneasy and unpleasent."
bad,"The people, and I mean only your immediate coworkers, are the real part of the job that is fulfilling. Upper management is a group of people looking at spreadsheets and numbers, and never concerning themselves with real life. If you don't meet sales numbers, or even if you do a lot of the time, they just tell you to do it better but don't offer any real help to do so BECAUSE NO UPPER MANAGEMENT KNOWS HOW TO SELL. "
bad,"This is an organization that doesn't embody that which they sell or protray themseleves to be.  Furthest thing from a best place to work, diverse, or employee centric employer."
bad,"At&t is a very stressful place to work. The managers are impatient and lack leadership skills. The company does not place an emphasis on developing the leadership side in their managers because they typically promote high performers into management, (which typically takes years by the way). It seems as though the C-level executives do not care for their people which is probably why their customer service is so horrible. The company does not compensate their individuals well, the benefits are subpar, and they do a poor job of recognizing their talent."
bad,"it wass through a staffing agency randstad, im quite sure they have improved in the last 8 years, there was no structure or balance at the time. the turnover rate was high we refilled pre paid phones"
bad,"The company I worked for contracted with AT&T.  As that company has folded due to fraud and the ineptitude of an uneducated pure salesman owner, there is no sense in reviewing this company"
bad,constant fear of job security and layoffs. long hours. under paid. No training. Full of stress. No chance of career promotion. Limited career choices.
bad,I have never been treated so poorly at a job in my life. I was promised upon being hired an 8-5 schedule to coinside with my daycare hours for my son. They asked for extensive paper work to prove that's what I needed and then never gave me the schedule I was promised. I ended up working a 4 pm to 1 am schedule. Which does not work for a single mom. The overall just don't care Amir their employees in the slightest. Unless you want to hate your life don't work here
bad,"The only thing they care about is their money. I would never recommend anyone to work here. Only the most desperate need apply. The force you to do sales on every call, even if you were hired for customer service. Horrible place to work"
bad,its been a while since i worked here and indeed requires a summary of jobs where you worked. AT&T is a great start to technology and well known name give it a go.
bad,no experiences I achieve here to report. Full time employees are egoistic to report contractor. something not like laid off contractor. Job level unsecure for contractor even good experiences in work field.
bad,Hard to move around or up in the company. Its all about who you know not what you know. A lot of favoritism! I been here for 16 years and I hate to say it but it does feel like a complete waist of time. Wish they can take care of me like I take care of the company! So sad it doesn't work that way.
bad,Dishonesty is what you are going to be called up to be if you take this job.  You will be asked to force products down the throats of people who dont want or need them.
bad,Directv and at&t were not really that bad. the unions that come in and destroy everything you have worked for and take away your pay and all other compensations you receive is what makes me want to tell everyone i know do not work here!
bad,I didn't like working for Att because they were comission based and they didn't pay you your Comission on time. So I had to leave the company because I wasn't getting paid. Plus it was extra ghetto.
bad,buen trabajador responsable y puntual hay mal sistema no tienen buena corbetura y pocos megas
bad,"want a company that lays off hundreds of people then pass then work onto sales consultants with no extra pay then by all means apply at AT&T. Hard work isn't rewarded here at all. Just more, more, and more."
bad,"The pay was good, I didn't like the employees. The management was rude. On the bright side, If you are trying to find a fast job , then you should go here."
bad,Now owned by at&t employees are just a number and turn over is higher than ever.  Trying to get a hold of anyone for information about benefits whine on a medical leave is a nightmare.
bad,"Education at Work                                                                                                   Norwood, OH."
bad,I was a corporate sale rep. Sold advertising in the phone book. The phone book has become a dinosaur and so have the jobs that were associated with it.
bad,"Unproductive and Horrible Management.  Lack of Pay, benefits and growth.Unproductive and Horrible Management.  They are very unprofessional, often times managers know less than employees."
bad,I would not recommend you working for this company. They hours are long. They move leads to management and it sucks. No respect lots of party. if they
bad,Trabajo con mucha área de oportunidad en todos los departamentos.
bad,This was a very good company to work for the staff was very nice and friendly. The was wasn't great but there was an opportunity for advancement. Nice place
bad,They are awful to their employees. Don't bother trying to get a job there. You would probably be laid off. They don't care about their employees. The pay is what keeps you but I promise theres more options out there.
bad,Micro management at its finest! It wouldn't be that bad if the management team was professional and knowledgeable of the job. The pay is not at all reflective of your talent or experience.  The commission structure continues to change which does not allow you to live a stable life.  They speak about work/life balance...ha!... They have a point system and they adhere to it. You have to take vacation time to get days off......
bad,"At&t is one of the worse places you can work, you are strictly a number and they do not care at all for you and your family. If you want to feel valued and respected stay away from this awful company."
bad,I work as a customer representative for this company many years ago and as i learned a lot about treating customer the work environment is bad . wages are low and management are not too good at their jobs. As this could have improved but still see high volume turn around with this company and these call centers. Their is always this long training classes.
bad,"This company will pay you less than a Walmart cashier, they do not consider employees art all. weather conditions and other life incidents do not matter to this company. you could have a heart attack and if you are out of points, regardless of the reason you will be fired. you can do your job perfectly and that still is not good enough. the managers a rude and do not care about their agents."
bad,"what a horrible place to work!  90% of the IT staff are hourly contractors who are under qualified and won't put in any extra effort, they also hire the lowest cost contractors."
bad,This is horrible company to work for.  They have no regard for the employees although they have a public view of being a good company.  The pay is good but the constraints are as bad as possible.
bad,"•	I work closely with the manager to make sure the company remains within appointed budgets and meets targets as planned. "
bad,"Was part of the last group of personnel hired for Premises Technician positions.  Following 12 weeks of training I was placed in a location where I was given little or no work.  We were entitled to at least 32 hours a week; however, I was receiving less than 20.  I resigned this position to look for better hours."
bad,"Pushing to Direct tv, I would not recommend trying to get a job here, even if hired there is no work.  There is no where to move to in the company, once a great company has now failed."
bad,cons: forced overtime .no life balance at all.  you are just a number and if your efficiency is low sometimes they will fire you.  they try to show you that they are fair but the truth is  they don't care about you .they will fire you for any reason. managers are so bully they will try to stress you over and over. some customers will make you so mad and you have to suck it up..... find you a better job this was a big mistake for me.
bad,"they suck the soul out of you and throw you away."
bad,"Stability and Training are great. Culture is one that sees everyone as a number and sees you as replaceable, however if you continue to improve you will definitely be able to keep your job."
bad,"Thanks not again!"
bad,This company walks on its employees. It brags about increased profits yet will not provide a fair wage or benefits to the employees that it credits with those profits.
bad,I quit due issues with coworkers that I went to management and HR multiple times over the course of my employment. I would not recommend. Poorly managed.
bad,"It was chaotic the whole time I worked here.  Bonuses were not consistently paid out out, policies change day to day. You could be written up for a new policy that the manager writing you up can not explain."
bad,"too far of a drive for me "
bad,"Ambiente de trabajo viciado y típico de call centers. Amenazas de término de empleo, palancas y abuso de los empleados."
bad,"Always looking for a way to pay less. Management really poor "
bad,"awful place to work, full of rotund mouth breathers, and i'm now writing characters to meet the minimum number required because tehy aren't worth the breath ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
bad,"A typical workday was very out of order, management and above did not care about the work that was performed by the representative nothing was never good enough"
bad,"When I first started this company was great!  We switched to a new manager my last three months, she made everything go downhill at our local office.  The company got way bigger really fast and has lost touch with its valuable customers and are only chasing a dollar figure.  I would go into work at 8am and never know when you will get to go home, sometimes 5pm sometimes 9 or 10pm.  constantly asking you to work your off days to meet commitments to people that aren't plausible just to increase the profit margins"
bad,awful work life balance and poor management. Heavier work load and less pay. Not the employee friendly company they once were.Does place value on their employee only on what should or can be done .
bad,i would never wish anyone to work here. they run the employees in the ground just to make a buck they do not care about the techs they see you as an expendable resource and will dispose of you faster than they hired you
bad,They don't and will not value you. Ever. Not after 3 years not after 12. They just want to take money out of your pocket while expected you to make them millions.
bad,"I worked for a third party and it was very unorganized, low pay, goals impossible to reach and if u do reach bonus u may not see bonus on check, managers are ghetto and not piers not willing to help"
bad,"Sale Associate with over 3 years of experience in retail, and corporate environments."
bad,"Every few months it seems a different department is being hit with a ""surplus"" (AT&T speak for layoff.)  It is difficult to concentrate on your job when you are worried about still having one.  This is just for the management side of the house, the union side of the house may be a completely different story... although it seems we (management employees) are constantly training for possible strikes on the union side during labor negotiations.   The company is also moving towards utilizing more off shore assets which is part of the reason for the constant layoffs for those of us on the technical side of the house."
bad,This job was soul sucking. The management was terrible. They do not train people on EEO standards. You barely get any breaks. My store did not even have a proper break room.
bad,Poor management and leadership on the corporate owned store side. Company drives results out of fear. Very political when trying to  move up. Politics over merit.
bad,i hated this job no so much for my coworkers but my manager was horrible at his job.It is very competitive and the meetgs are long.
bad,Pay is not compensated enough. DirecTV was a wonderful company to work for until it was bought out by AT&T. Worked in a very hostile environment after AT&T took over.
bad,"Not family oriented at all, Management is not helpful, and knowledgeable of the job that is required from CSR. Since there are no longer Customer Service, all they want you to do is sale regardless, and be very demanding in getting sales no matter what it takes just as long as sales is received. Typical day at work is very, very stressful, they have a very high turn over and don't care about nothing but AT&T."
bad,I have never worked at this company ever and never will due to the fact I don't get hired by telephone companies so I'm not worried about what people say about this company
bad,"not the best working environment, they never took you seriously if you wanted too move up in the company and alot of the times they held you back too better their own careers."
bad,"This company would terminate you without warning, if you dont sell the products they are focusing on. Every month you worked in fear of losing your job."
bad,"horrible, this job is for true sellers its not for everyone at all...i dint enjoy the way they forced us to sell even when families couldnt afford"
bad,"When I started working for this company it was known as BellSouth. Bellsouth was a company that cared about its employees."
bad,Don't do it worst job I ever had manager never did door door does not know how to teach you to do door-to-door they expect a whole lot of sales with very little territory
bad,"This was an amazing opportunity that led to a lot of professional and helped me become successul at my new job, i would recommend this job to anyone looking to get into sales."
bad,"No chance of  advancing, nepotism and favortism at its best. I hated being there every single day!! Stay away if possible."
bad,"working for Directv was great, when At&t bought out Directv what a horrible experience it was. Pay was slashed by about 40%, a military style of management begun, stress levels went up, you could never be good enough you were always harass by management.  At&t is a very disrespectful company to work for there is a real attitude problem up at corporate that bleeds down to local office. Strong recommendation never to work for At&t."
bad,"No veo nada mas diferente que el logo, deficiente en todos los sentidos internos."
bad,the company does not care about you. the health benefits barely pays for anything and they take advantage of you and calls you in to work whenever they are short on staff.
bad,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY."
bad,"Whatever you do stay away from this company. I used to work at DirecTV and when ATT took over it was the worst possible thing to ever happen to DirecTV. The call center does not work with your schedule, they don't care about what is going on in your life they just want you to take phone call after phone call for the cheapest wage. All of the management at DirecTV/ATT are buying into all of the bs ATT and the new union is giving them and it is incredibly frustrating. Not only do they not care about what is going on in your personal life, most of the management are just clueless and do the bare minimum every single day. You can tell most of them are incompetent by the way they talk and operate this business, it's actually mind boggling. It's astounding ATT can still run as a company with how openly disgusting their business practices are towards their customers and employees."
bad,if you like being away from home this was the place for you. after so long I got home sick and needed to be around my family more often.
bad,"After two months of negotiations, AT&T reneged on a contract offer after I had quit my other job.  I am not impressed with their ethics in their dealings."
bad,"Answer phone calls, questions, review clients bill make adjustments. "
bad,"the worst company you can ever work for. They lie, they steal the don't care about family problems you may have. The wright you up for every little thing. They mess up your checks all the time, they never give you the rightful amount of bonus. The management is poorly ran, and they training is completely not worth anything. I do not under any circumstances for anybody to work for Ibex Global. they do nothing but set you up for failure. And to them they are never wrong, they don't go by the employee handbook, they just make up rules as they go along"
bad,"Just an awful place to work. The management did not care about its employees and would fire them left and right. The stress levels were out the roof and you would be publicly shamed if you made a mistake. Furthermore, there was so much red tape that getting anything done required pulling teeth. Also the customers would berate you and management would take there side when it was there rules that made it so you couldn't help the customer. I implore anyone thinking of working at the AT&T call centers to find something else. Especially the one in Pueblo, Colorado. Don't put yourself through that torture."
bad,"The company bought a new company and is now way over staffed and is starting to lay off a lot of their senior technicians and bringing in these other technicians for less pay.  The senior techs like myself that have fiber optic training, satellite training and know uverse are being pushed out and not being payed what we are currently trained for."
bad,"More. More. More!"
bad,"If your looking for close minded management, Stiffled innovation, disgusting bathrooms and to be treated with a high level of disrespect on a daily basis look no further."
bad,"good for job search"
bad,A great place to gain experience and learn new skills.  Management open to suggestions and willing to offer help when needed. great place to work
bad,"Trashy company, trashy management, no opportunity to advance. Compensation was atrocious for the amount of work put in. Never held any fun events, work environment was miserable."
bad,"I didn't work through AT&T directly, I worked through West Inc., which treated all of the employees like slaves with their mundane requirements to even use the restroom. I was a top performer in the camp site and still was getting critiqued about not following the script they made us read from, instead of being a genuine human being."
bad,"Used to be a good job where a person could earn a good living.  "
bad,If you don't mind working for the sociopaths promoted to middle management then this is the place for you. The pay potential is decent but can you put a price on your soul? If you answered yes then sign right up because they'll gladly vacuum it out of you and throw some money at you. Hooray greed!
bad,This particular was  Very unprofessional. On a typical day managers fired hard working people for false accusations. The managers their self were stealing time but we had meetings every week about staying on task.  The managers always talked about unnecessary topics that did not pertain to the work environment.There wasn't any personal or Professional  gain.The work environment was dangerous and everyday there was chaos. Managers fighting on workers. I learned how to stay to myself and work alone that was the only way to keep my job. The AT&T  Union workers Belittled everyone and anyone that worked their. I didn't feel welcomed. My Co-workers were the only thing that made my day go a little easier.
bad,"While I enjoy having earned a set schedule, I feel that it is almost impossible to advance at this specific location unless you are in a certain clique with upper management."
bad,"company was more concerned with getting people off the phone than solving root cause of issues, Company omitted payments for time without service when  customers legitimately were not getting service and service would not be restored for some time."
bad,Management could improve. Seems like they do not keep in touch with the reality of day to day operations and the technicalities of the job
bad,I really do not have a comment about working here because it would be totally personal but i do not advise you to take a premises technician job if you value getting treated like a human being and you're against favoritism...
bad,"Not a fan of this place. The management was terrible and unprofessional, though i was at an authorized retailer so that probably had something to do with it. Dishonest, told me 10$ an hour plus commission, then when i showed up the first day of work they told me only during training was it 10$, then it jumped down to minimum wage once I completed training, i should have left that day. They force you to use tactics to trick customers into buying stuff they don't need, then punish you if you don't. I'm sure any corporate store is fine but stay away from any AT&T authorized retailer in the Topeka, Lawrence area, terrible management, terrible pay, and barely any new customers on a daily basis due to the Authorized Retailers lackluster store locations and designs compared to corporate stores."
bad,"I was always afraid to be fired from this job every morning before going into work. I worked there for 2 years before I decided to quit. I had to lose the stress of being afraid of my job. The management was great until ATT took over Directv. It became a Micromanaged company. I couldn't find any happiness with in the building, and even in my own time, all i could do was talk about how much i hated it."
bad,Typical day at AT&T is communicating and fact finding with customers to provide excellent customer services. Sales would be my primary activities daily.
bad,"Management is not good. They do not work around your schedule for anything. They cut my commission, how they treat there customers is horrible."
bad,I would not recommend this as a great place to work. Job security is slim unless you are part of the bargained workforce. Not a positive culture.
bad,It was not with AT&T itsself. It was with a company called T.L Marketing. It was comissioned based job and the hours where very long
bad,"The AT&T customers are nasty, spoiled people. All you do is get cursed out. And then you're insulted with the pay. Also the management sucks! They play favoritism"
bad,"I worked here through Manpower staffing. This was a very cool pace to work, mostly temporary people are sent to this company."
bad,Never again would i work for a company thats treats employees like numbers. I was given poor intruction and was expected to perform at a high level.
bad,"Coworkers are the only good thing about this place. They do not provide proper training but expect you to know everything, especially when management doesn't have a clue themselves but cant fathom why you don't"
bad,"Worse place ive ever worked. I had one boss who bent me over a table and asked to have intercourse with me (which nothing was done but them sending me to another store where one of his bestfriends was the manager) Then the rayville manager liked to cuss you and yell at you basically trying to humiliate you in front of the customers. Also he thought it was funny to tell me he was gonna fire me which would have me in tears half the time.  I don't think prime communication will ever be truly as successful as they should be. Managers take advantage of you, people lie/steal and they will do whatever it takes to hide it. The ONLY good person I have met there is Amire. If this happens to reach anyone ""important"" my word might not mean anything to you but when I say this company has some evil people in it, it does. Also amire if this gets to you - thank you. thank you for always being fair and honest."
bad,"i learned how to stay seated for 12hrs / i was told when i was allowed to use the restroom/i was told when to eat/ i was chained to a headpieces ,i enjoyed clocking out"
bad,Every phone call is timed and you have to make sure that you take care of the customer's needs within a certain time frame. If you don't then they counsel you and tell you to cut it short isn't that rude?
bad,Wouldnt work there ever again. I was hired with fine print as a contractor and to my surprise 6 mos. later was let go. The pay was good. But the people working there were unproffessional and lazy.
bad,Assisting customers with their needs for example bill payments also with any phone malfunctions. I will sell products that we have from AT&T so i can use for their upgrades or new lines.
bad,"Negotiate with clients the payment of owed amounts."
bad,"some 401k and health benefits, some work benefits such as getting hands on experience and a chance to learn things. But management is terrible. Threatening culture, no proper culture of coaching and developing"
bad,"This was the absolute worst company that I have ever worked for. As a sales associate, I had outlasted 4 store managers, 2 district manager and approx 30 sales associates. The pay structure is extremely weak and change the commissions on a regular basis, including right before the holidays in order for them not having to pay you what you worth and your sales numbers reflect. Today is 2/14/16  and they still have not offered ANY Health insurance to their Full Time employees and management. I was approached several times by mall management inquiring about the company NOT paying their rent to the mall and most recently a EMPLOYMENT TAX AUDITOR from the state of KY asking to speak to the owner of the company after several attempts of not being able to reach them by phone!"
bad,"Review customers accounts, answered questions, upgraded customers on their accounts.  Would help customers with internet services."
bad,"Too much politics, back stabbing, and finger pointing.  A very negative environment where team work is not promoted.  They need to dump the current management team from directors and above.  Need new management who knows how to run a company.  There is too much inefficiency."
bad,the job was ok it was very stressful and there was not any room for advancement. the customers were rude and out of order..
bad,Poor workplace and pay scale always changes.  A lot of bickering and unnecessary bickering among employees. i did not enjoy waking up and going to work every day.
bad,"I worked there as a female in my 20s and they would force me to wear leggings that were so tight I could barely breathe. they forced us to stay after hours off the clock up to 2 In the morning, and if you got off at 8:00 you were forced to stay for ""make-up"" time in the false suggestion of excelling for obedience. the managers are a joke. honestly very flighty, rude and do not keep good relationships. ""customer is always right"" does not apply to this awful corporation. Ultimately I was fired because I was forced to go in inventory(even though apparel associates are not merited there) to get down a kayak. the ladder I was given was broken and I fell 10 feet onto the ground. when I told my store manager about this, requesting workmenscomp, I was denied and told I was terminated for ""not regulating safety code"" are you kidding me?! he was the one who told me to go in the first place. awful man, awful management, awful customers, awful cowrkers, all in all I wish there was a 0 rating because this place deserves to be shut down for secu@l h@rasment, abus3 to employee, theft, and trackicking!!!!"
bad,Always busy with inventory coming in on trucks and shipping out inventory.  Moving items with the forklift or handlift.  Counting inventory.  This made for a busy and enjoyable day.
bad,"i open and close everyday. i learned how to be a great sells person. I understand being a manger is not telling what to do, its honestly about having a great team and teaching."
bad,"Was hired. Hiring process was fine, but started working at new job, for one week, the two managers were there, then they were there only half the time, because they were both interviewing for new jobs that they pretty much knew they were getting in a different town. The training process in store was terrible. Went to the training facility, which was OK, but the hotel they put us in was 10 or more miles away form the training facility in a bad part of town, bad accommodations. One of the training days, the regular trainer was not in, had a fill in, and told us that there would be some minimal road traffic and closed roads due to a marathon downtown that morning. It took most of the class almost an hour or more to get down there, the fill in trainer was late. it was a mess. he did not apologize, and the whole day was ruined. I left the company."
bad,"This company is poorly managed. Hired me for one town, placed me over an hour away. Hired myself and a girl and placed each of us in stores closer to the other person."
bad,"HEY! do you like working for a company that doesn't give two s hits about you? what about working from 8am all the way to 9pm, 10pm, or 11pm and sometimes even as late as 12 in the morning and not have anything to show for it on your paycheck cause you're not getting paid by the hour but by the job? And all the empty promises of these so called ""advancement opportunites"" that the supervisors and the general manager try to sell to you? Well if this is you then by god Directv is the place to be!!! Absolutely no organization in the company whatsoever, the pay is horrendous as a technician so the only way that you're gonna make any money is if you're high up in the company, ridiculously long a ss working hours. Im sorry but if I had a choice of spreading honey on my ball sack and letting loose a swarm of killer bees or going to work for these clowns again, I wouldnt do neither cause I couldnt figure out which one's worse."
bad,"Very corporate environment, and very strict. It is very hard to advance. Schedules are based on length of service, not performance. You can bust your butt and still have an awful schedule with out consecutive days off. "
bad,"You spend a lot of time and money that you cannot profit from. Work a 6-7 work week throughout the year. You are misclassified as an independent contractor. You do not have the option to to chose your work schedule (when and where you work). The warehouse gives you barely enough gear (receivers, and sometimes mounting equipment) to complete your jobs through the week. You will have to rebuild old jobs (upgrades that other technicians did) and whether they were just done out of code or they are old (usually anything over 10 years) you have to spend time and invest money (new cable, new fittings, grounding supplies) to rework the job. Upgrades pay out $30 a piece. Then you are still expected to finish the rest of the jobs you have for the day within the two, four hour windows of appointment times because the company also has an On-Time Guarantee. Lastly, you will be charged back for jobs you have done when a customer has an issue with something and does not want to pay the service call charge. The company just throws you under the bus for instance; a receiver is swapped out as a defective one, Hardware on the dish goes out, replacing a cable, replacing a fitting, reprogramming a remote, swapping out any A/V cabling. Its very frustrating and will pay the bills but you will have no personal life. There is also no benefits what so ever. I have never seen a dime of overtime or any type of medical compensation."
bad,to many changes at once and restructures not a safe place to be if you want a future here. i really wish this company steps it up because the only reason im still there is the co workers
bad,"Management preferences, lack of support, terrible atmosphere."
bad,Att treats contractors as sub-human by excluding and not sharing information to do the task. Basically setting them up for failure
bad,company doesn't stick to what they say about growth. When hired they are drilling in your head there is no where to go but up. I was top 10 percent of sales in the company for a year and never was given the opportunity to move up.
bad,I had to call the customers to make sure there sistem was working and make sure they didnt had any problem. I learn quick and I like to learn new stuff. I had to call the technicians to make sure there were at there job and make sure everything was great and i had  to be watching the computer. make sure all the paperworks was completed and fill out correct. the only thing i didnt like was that i will work on Monday thru friday at 8:30 to 2:30 without a break and Saturdays work 8 hrs and no lunch. My manager was very rude to me and to the customers and he like to lie alot. We never worked as a team. And the workers was always complaining.
bad,They are not a good company to work for. They promise a lot of things during the interview but then once they have you hired they don't deliver on the things that they promised. The pay is piece rate (which nobody explains what this is during the interview). The management team is unreal. None of the office managers know what their field supervisors are doing out in the field. I didn't have any enjoyable parts of the job.
bad,"I have not worked with AT&T but I've applied for the Sale Rep job and was advised that I did not pass the required test that in the beginning stated there are no Right Or Wrong answers?"
bad,"Nothing but favoritism, which dictated your sales, which doesn't work well if you work on commission. Average of only 3 female employees through out 50 locations in the area!"
bad,n/a. i didn't like working here very much. not that fun. always speak to customers that are really mad that there tv dose not work as there are soooo many issues with directv equipment.
bad,"The employees had low self esteem, the company forced me to work in a department I had not applied for.  I had to go into a department that I was not averse.  Other wise I would loose my job."
bad,"Los Horarios un poco Nocturnos, Con solo 1 hora de comer si vives cerca, trabajo de L-S con poco descanso y jornadas largas y seguidas"
bad,"I used to work their and now i don't, AT&T is not exempt from the same flaws that plague every other call center has. Personally it just was not the right job for me, i mean it paid well but that is about it"
bad,Its always that one person that's out too get you. No matter how hard you work and the distances you drive. Not a company that looks out for the employees.
bad,"Consultative sales skills and highly experience in customer service."
bad,a lot of hard work. this is a place where you are just another number. they constantly cut benefits. have high turn over rates. job never felt secured
bad,"the work place was very loud and ghetto, the managers never tried to help you succeed if you weren't on their team."
bad,"best company to work .every day learn new thing with new experience ,good team player ."
bad,The company Vetconnexx contracts with AT&T and they being Vetconnexx decreased the pay so I had to leave. Vetconnexx is a veteran owned company who hires vets and veteran spouses. 98% of the company is veterans. There was a recent pay decrease.
bad,"I usually don't say anything bad about work but this one was by far the worst job ever. I worked there for a year with minimum wage, the manager was awful, and I was harassed and i told the manager to move me scheduled and she said no that we didn't have people to move around. I quit with out telling her because I couldn't take the  harassment."
bad,This job was a contract job. They do not offer benefits.The pay was not very good based off of each installation. This company did not follow the directv regulations.
bad,"I have never worked for a company that was so cheap to its employees."
bad,"Answer calls all day long, management was bad, the job completely sucked, their managers are sexist. I HATE AT&T, I HATE AT&T, I HATE AT&T"
bad,"The job definitely wasn't what you expected. The so called ""competitive pay"" is all off of commission which is awful if you are trying to make a living."
bad,Not enough training to give representatives information need to help customers on devices or plans and help with promoting agents
bad,It's a horrible place to work.  The money is good but the atmosphere is the worst.  It's also a lot of micromanaging.  It's nothing but stress.  I would never recommend it to anyone.
bad,"At&t has poor management and they do not care about their employees"" wellbeing, safety, or morale, They just want work done at any cost"
bad,"A great place to work is one in which you trust the people you work for, have pride in what you do, and enjoy the people you work with.”"
bad,"Time spent at At&T was not a great experience.  The pay was low, the workload was extremely high and the management did not have compassion for the employees.  There was no growth potential or development opportunities."
bad,This place was very unorganized and I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone. Not as an employee or customer. Especially if much hasn't changed since I've worked there.
bad,"A lot of pressure to perform, always telling you about how easy it is to get fired, based off an approval system from customers which relied on them answering questionnaire phone calls.12+ hour days for four day weeks on minimum wage with few breaks."
bad,"7 1/2 years spent there. Exceeded every goal put in front of me. Never got paid what I was truly owed. Metrics totally inaccurate month after month. Constant confusion, a real shame. Left do to many dishonest practices. If you want a career with a honest and well managed company you wont find it here."
bad,Great benifit package the.  Mandatory weekends and most holidays your schedule can change at any time. Managment was flexiable it was a comfortable work enviornment.
bad,anyone even thinking of working for AT&T Mobility turn around and run the other way. One of the worst employers I have ever worked for. No work/family balance. The worst and most aggressive attendance policy I have ever seen. I could fill pages with negative stuff
bad,"Good job with slightly low pay. unstable job and can be let go for any reason. When your contract ends, they offer no feedback, positive or negative."
bad,With the recent changed to the attendance policies it makes it insanely difficult hard to remain employed at this job with a good home to work life balance. The attendance team is out of touch with peoples personal life and are very unforgiving.
bad,"I wokred there only 4 months because there was no help, training, and the past was horrible for all they want their employees to work and they don't want to pay OT. Because of them I will never work for an employee agency again."
bad,I really enjoyed working at AT&T. I got to gain good amount of hand on experience at AT&T. It has a great management. Everyone is very friendly and supportive.
bad,"It lack professionalism, managers would tell workers they would work through lunch without asking if they were ok with that or not. They would bribe us with pizza to work 12 - and sometimes 17 hour shifts. We were treated like children and  were told the job was more important than our own families and children."
bad,the most horrible job ever/pay is not good/a typical day is going to jobs routed and installing/i learned that this company is a horrible employer to work for/management are tyrants/my coworkers were great/hardest part explaining the mistakes that customer service makes when setting up installs/most enjoyable were my days off away from the company
bad,I was ordered to go into work with psoriasis on the bottom of my foot.  I could hardly walk and could hardly get my feet into my shoes.  I had a stress fracture in my knee and was on crutches.  My knee was swollen and had to be tapped several times.  Others were being permitted to work from  home.  I felt I was being harassed by my supervisor.  I worked with these employees for many years and always had outstanding appraisals.
bad,"This company is reactive rather than proactive. There is no process or structure in place. Its very unprofessional especially if you are coming from a place where it is professional. Management only cares when clients are in the building.The hardest part of the job is staying positive when there is so much negativity and they don't value their employees.The management focuses on discipline vs. self-development.I love being a trainer. However, it was very difficult when dealing with people who discriminated because of gender."
bad,"The goals set for us reps were unrealistic. Less than 10% of my co-workers were actually meeting all their stats. There was a high churn rate. Our call center closed its doors down because no would show up for work, they all hated their job. ATT doesn't care about its employee's. They only care about how the company can make more money."
bad,"AT&T is a wonderful company, great benefits. the management on the other hand is unprofessional. I would love to stay at AT&T but I need stability."
bad,If you enjoy micro management that changes daily. If you like your pay scale to be decreased as soon as you meet goal expectations. If you don't mind being cursed at and belittled daily. Then you may enjoy working for DirecTV. Otherwise avoid this company like a plague!
bad,"management is very negative, a lot of nepotism. you are looked downapon if you give excellent customer service. Managment is more in to collecting money and taking advantage of the customer weather it be business service or consumer."
bad,Too much micromanagement. Does not listen to employee concerns and definitely does not understand common sense. Leave it.
bad,this is a solid company but the authorized retailers only bring so much to the overall company maybe all the AT&T stores should be corporate stores just my thoughts the corporate seemed to be better trainer & have more products
bad,"My experience at AT&T has been frustrating at best. My job has changed overnight twice with no warning. Internal training is severely lacking and employees are heavily discouraged from external training. The pay is very poor. My manager showed me the salaries of everyone on my team and I was $20,000 lower than the next lowest paid employee despite having better reviews and accomplishing more. When I asked what I could do to increase my salary, I was told there was nothing that could be done."
bad,was given a truck computer and keys to the place. was not given enough time to complete the job correctly. I would recommend to new hires to get gps.
bad,AT&T treats its employees like slaves. The union make it even harder to succeed with the company. I do not work there anymore because I felt like collaterel between corporate and the union.
bad,I really cannot say too much that is positive about AT&T. The salary is good and the benefits are good but the culture is caustic.
bad,"This company standards are hard to fill. Long hours and unreasonable sales goals. Management is inconsistent. Scheduling is also hard, no work/ home balance."
bad,Very good account and flexible.can learn new things.good management.most enjoyable work place.can work with clients directly.can be more aggressive.can use more tools
bad,"Horrible standards, horrible management, horrible everything. I regret working here and wish i had looked up the company first"
bad,"I understand having a G.P.S. that is able to track what techs do throughout the day since the managers don't show up on jobs that you dispatch to, or do they? The computer system that they use to dispatch is called W.F..E, or Work Flow Engine. This system walks you though everything about your job, safety, how to greet the customer, how to do everything about your job. Maybe good for someone who just started, except for the fact its super confusing and controlling. The steps are also not in the correct order running tests at all the wrong times. Don't do anything they don't want you to do. They will look up all of your phone records, your G.P.S. records, and even suspend you for trying to look up company policies. Its a real bad place to work. The pay is good, the health care is good, and brand new vehicles don't hurt. You will also not have to buy any of your own tools as they do not allow you to bring your own tools to work. However, the bad far outweighs the good."
bad,I did door to door sales of att uverse with bad sales leads. They would not let you find your own potential customers friends neighbors etc.
bad,"You can probably find any better company than AT&T.  This company only believes about the bottom dollar.  Say goodbye to any chance of being a person.  Get used to being ab1234, because you are only a number and gear in the AT&T machine."
bad,The pay was competitive but the job was micro managed and very stressful. The training was not very good either. The managers seemed to be after personal gain and against the technicians.
bad,"I was put on an emotional roller coaster ride, prior to being hired. I answered questions truthfully and was called a fraud and a liar. Then I was offered a salary three dollars less an hour than what I was making when I was employed before. My first day of work, the trainer, Arlene Orozco, singled me out and made it her goal to get me out of her class. She humiliated me not once but twice in front of the entire class. When I went to talk to somebody in management they were all out of their office. I finally just dropped off my badge and left. The company is not the same as it was when I was there in 2003. Avoid this company. The management in Austin Texas, the Lamar Avenue location are lousy, they care nothing for the little people that do the grunt work, only about the fact that they can walk away from the office they occupy and not worry about anything beneath them ."
bad,"Low Moral, no consideration for employees and families, too many layoffs.  "
bad,The parent company is ok but 2wire the place I worked we one of the most disgusting call centers I have ever had the misfortune to step through the threshold.
bad,bad managment didnt connect with workers. Need to treat people like humans instead of robots. that main reason turn over is so high.
bad,"Typical work day is driving out of your way to set up, and try to sell someone something that they don't care for. I learned how to make sales. But you end up working with people who steal from you. They take credit for your sales. Management is terrible. Some co-workers were okay. They weren't great people. Hardest part of this job was working all day on your feet. Giving it your all and then not getting paid at the end of the day. This job had no enjoyable moments."
bad,Not a good experience. Management had foul language and horrible coaching skills. No room for advancement. No one was on the same page. They fired people everyday over the littlest things. No compassion for employees at all.
bad,day to day operations of store and selling phones the store had low revenue and was not in a good location would not go back to this job ever
bad,Very demanding but highly rewarding with great perks.  Very physical work and very little down time.  Working with At and T had its perks and a chance to work in a different environment each day.
bad,"Self-serving culture with no support or leadership from upper management.  No collaboration within teams or departments, and favoritism of employees who lack basic skills and knowledge."
bad,Its really not a great environment.  You stay stressed out all the time.  You consistently have to call the union.  Thank goodness for the union!!
bad,i do not wish to write a review on this company. i'm leaving for a reason even with a pay cut. i do not have anything else to say
bad,Was a subcontractor job  under directv spent hours out the day going door to door selling directive packages to people. I never received a paystub from employee.
bad,wasnt fun working here many fee's after fees before even getting your first pay. easy hours flexible good pay but very long days too
bad,This store is terrible and if you plan on working here be prepared to be lied to about when the store closes and managers that arent willing to work with you for emergencies and its all about how the managers can better themselves and how the employees are never preforming up to par.
bad,My manager was scared of my co-workers and rather than stand up and take his position as store manager he allowed himself to be pushed and dictated by my co-workers.
bad,"Was a good opportunity to get a job right after college, but wasn't at all related to the IT field what so ever. No real sense of purpose there. Just a number."
bad,"No job security. No advancement especially if you are a female, they do not promote you unless you relocate to another state. Upper management change frequently and you are told that you are easily replaceable. Commission structure change monthly which usually means a pay decreased."
bad,They lie about the whole job. Extreme long hours and pressure to make sales. You average about 60 hours a week with only one day off. No benefits.
bad,This store is no longer open. This was the best place to work. Amazing co-workers who worked as a team and knew how to have a good time
bad,"This office was shut down shortly after I quit due to never receiving payment. Overall a horrible experience for me. Although this was not DirecTV directly, but a sub office I would never work for them again."
bad,"I started as a kid there. Was a wonderful place to work. The people were great and everyone worked together to achieve the companies goals."
bad,•	Strive for quick complaint resolution; commended by supervisor for the ability to resolve problems on the first call and avoid escalation of issues
bad,"I interviewed for a customer service position, was told light sales. turns out to be a complete sales job, and if your not good at sales, will get fired within a couple of months. So if you want to go on unemployement after 4-6 months of being there, this is the place for you...if you want a sales position apply."
bad,This company treated people like animals.  The atandence policy was horrible.  I had a life threating illness and was terminated.
bad,"The place is a disaster, poor training, tools not available to use, no logins to the needed tools, no access to metrics"
bad,"This was by far the worst place I have ever worked for. It's not AT&T, it's the call center itself. It was customer service and not peddling sales for their horrible Uverae services. The management lied to customers during call take overs. They seemed more inclined to sell and didn't realize they were selling to cancel. The charge backs affected the rep that sold it and didn't affect the managers. Doesn't count as a chargeback to them, it still shows as they had x amount of units sold. The area managers were all rude. Some of the team managers were great, but most of them were rude and would make snide remarks. This job is more for callous people that don't mind peddling an inferior product to the masses. If it was just selling cellular it would have been ok."
bad,"Job duties include; providing customers with a great customer experience upon entering store, setting up sales for reps as well as floor managing each representative.  Making weekly reports of store number and creating plans of action to boost sales percentages.  Make sure store is in compliance with COBC, closing store every night, doing monthly CFC checks. Inventory management (store count, phone count, sim count) preparing store for any audits that may arise."
bad,"The company has changed over the years the expectations are horrible, its a very stressful environment.  You're encouraged to rely on tools to get the job done; however, the tools are horrible and you sound robotic (scripted). Management is stressed so its passed on to the employee's.  Good benefits and medical (trust me you will need it). What was once a well respected place to work and no transformed into a sweatshop."
bad,"Buen trabajo, la gente sabia como ayudarme a crecer. Buena onda de la gente que queria que yo la asesoraba"
bad,I provided customer service to customers as it related to their home telephone services. I assisted customers with billing questions.
bad,cool co workers students real helpful all jobs was easy easy work day nice play for no work..
bad,ok it was alright and it wasn't that bad but it id have some other difficulties kith the hiring nd everything else
bad,"Sitting at a computer doing absolutely nothing!!"
bad,"No Benefits, no proposed raises/advancement, no incentives for job performance, disrespectful and insulting management. Job culture is hostile. job expects employees to hold their end of employment bargain but often tries to renegotiate it's term to benefit certain persons in the company (CEO and COO) thus harming the employees."
bad,Good for someone whom is looking for a foot in the technical/telecommunications door but definitely not for a mature professional looking to progress in their career.
bad,"This place was a dump. Horrible working conditions, and horrible management staff. It would be better if they had better management."
bad,Very stressfull. Your feel you are working around the clock. Have to wake up at 7 am to be on conference calls.
bad,"Bosses will love you to your face, and hate you behind your back. Shady business tactics and will force you to use same shady tactics to boost upper management's numbers. Don't ever ask for any time off of work."
bad,"Did not like it. At the time that I was working I had a lot going on in my life. the job was a good job, but not right for me at the time"
bad,"Call center- so don't expect much at all....Management was cool, but wasn't moving to give promotions, its all about politics"
bad,they don't give you a chance and they stay ontop of you at all times like you are a child
bad,The people there are the best when is comes to helping to improve other skills. The high leveler people are always available to help
bad,"long hours, every weekend work, after training, you are on your own, no wone to help you"
bad,"A challenging work place with physical and technological challenges to be completed with in a specific time period.      "
bad,When I started with Directone and Direct4Biz they were start up companies offering the ability to run my own business. I felt it was a great opportunity at the time but eventually I found that only if you were an owner of the retail you make money
bad,This company is ok the provide you with a training and the tools to work. However their management ways  make it hard to do that job.
bad,Mistreat employees.  Errors in their statistics and won't fix.  Goes against employee.
bad,"Over charges customers, under pays employees, tight tight tight."
bad,"I started in a training class of 20 and after 6 months it is down to 8, and this is typical. out of a building full of management at least 20 there is three that i would say is good. There is a lot of situations like a supervisor with a best friend on the same team who they supervise and the union is absolutely worthless"
bad,"it was good experience working at AT&T"
bad,"AT&T is an incredible company to work for, driving their employees to improve daily towards a common goal"
bad,"This was a commission based job. It was very difficult to exceed in this business. Their was no structure in the business. On a daily basis we would call small businesses that had services with At&t and offer them discounts on there accounts. Multitasking was a skill we used daily. We also used email, excel, and Microsoft office. While working there I learned that a commission based job is not an ideal way for me to make money. Management would hire anyone that could use a computer and the other co workers were not very friendly and would gossip constantly. The hardest part of the job was working hard but having nothing to show for it because everyone thought what we were doing was a scam so no one would buy from us which means I had little to no income. I did however enjoy the office/call center environment."
bad,Door to door sales. they put an ad on the paper and then they fool you to go with them on a days work which is door to door sales on selling uverse.
bad,Great company to advancement for  good management great communication.
bad,"a typical day at work"
bad,Management does not care for its employers who are the face of the company and the main ones dealing with the customers face to face.  The company will work you for how ever long they want to not considerate of anyone else family time or overall well being.  I highly recommend any one to stay away from working with AT&T
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to choose the days or hours of the week that would fit our schedule. The downfall of the job was being paid on a piece rate basis & the need to use our own vehicle, tools & pay for all expenses out of our own pocket. Job cancellations were very common working as a Satellite TV Sub-Contractor / Installer. The rate of employee turnover was very high as a result of not having a consistent income."
bad,"There is no job stability at Innovative, and the moment you think you are doing a great job it is a known fact that they will discontinue your job. Love to let you know that this is a work at will state."
bad,This was the worst company I worked for they lied about the overall compensation and when I started the job it was nothing what we discussed.
bad,I don't like the way they run things. it is a bad place to work. you are always worried about if you are going to get fired
bad,Horrible place life has to be dedicated to your job. Not family friendly
bad,Didn't enjoy working there.  Never reprimanded a coworker who was bullying me.  Very unprofessional.
bad,no room for advancement or growth within the company. very poor career opportunity
bad,AT&T will nickel and dime you every time . do not trust management for anything
bad,"If you don't want to be home during the summer, or only work 15 hours a week during the winter, this is the job for you. The management is picked by favorites and not by qualifications. Management also does not care about employees. Management is very sly when it comes to getting what it wants and is quick to destroy, which seems like the best word, an employee. The benefits are ok if you do not have to ever see a doctor for any reason, most places will not accept the insurance. Once again as noted before job security is not something you should expect to have when entering this job, because there is nothing that you can do once you have the job to comply with the metrics that are expected of you. There is no such thing as a job advancement unless you 'get to know' the bosses. There is nothing remotely good about the job except training, in which they will make sure they tell you how great the job is, and not much else. Most 1st level management can barely speak with out lying about something."
bad,Does not pay a hourly wage. No room fro opportunity. I got payed piece work
bad,"Good company to work for, if  you are hired. I f you are a contractor, conditions change: no vacations, no days paid-off, no bonuses,no chance iof being hired, unless you have connections in AT&T."
bad,The company was in the middle of a buy out that was going to clear out all existing employees.
bad,"This is company that will feed you a line of garbage that there is room for advancement and your career ""will boom"" in the field of retention.  "
bad,"We should show up at 8 am for our meeting. This would take 10-20 minutes. We would then load up any equipment that we had ordered from the day before, get our first assignment, call the customer, and head out on the road. We would spend the entire day doing installations or repairs, depending on what came up in the queue. Our shift technically ended at 4:45, but I never got off before 5:30. It was usually more like 7:00."
bad,They pay good when they need you and get rid of you when they find it cheaper. They also task life insurance out on you because its cheap and they can
bad,it had an  great staff bu the i found the customers to be the hardest part. Very fast pace place.
bad,Don't apply here and do not pay for their services. If they do not like you they will find a way to get rid of you and fast.
bad,"Greeted customers who called for service and ascertained what each customer wanted or needed."
bad,"I liked the job but they wanted for every call to try to sell them something, even when the bill was late or they wanted help with payments"
bad,I worked in the retail store and there is a systemic culture of cheating the customer.  The market has reached its maturity phase and it's difficult to sale customers on products that are already free.  The company has lost connection with it's front line employees.
bad,Your job is not stable and they make you do to much for very little money
bad,"alot of training, but no advancement. Hours are all over the place."
bad,"250+ calls in queue no break"
bad,"I hated the 70 hours a week, and being lied to about advancement"
bad,Getting people to change from they existing carrier to at&t . for local and long distance service . work was slow customers didn't want to change from they existing carrier to at&t
bad,"They find reasons to with hold  your pay check, they are rude, they do not employee women, if you are a girl working there the boss is probably sleeping with you.  Overall they are very unprofessional and make you sell people terrible service.  Do not work for Direct/ Elite Mobility they are terrible people that do not know what is going on."
bad,The place was awful. No job security. No real structure.It's a free for all
bad,Great place to work . I had just put my in a 2 weeks notice because of personal reason .
bad,Hertz is a very fast paced and exciting job. It's face to face customer service. The pay was decent. You do receive bonuses for the products you sell. The people there are awesome to work with and to work for.
bad,"AT&T is a great company to work foe. The benefits are god and the pay is great. It is probably one of the few companies you can work at without a college degree and still make 60 to 70,000 a year. The only downfall is that it thrown in your face constantly that you are paid well and are expendable"
bad,"Learning never stops at at&t, thats it in a pinch. i have been able to learn all facets of the telcom industry, from the simplest circuit to the most critical circuits that run are infastructure."
bad,"High pressure, rapid turnovers proprietary systems training lacks, rigid, every step of your job is dependent on someone else response to deliver and they were usually slow which affects productivity, they use antiquated processing systems that were ridiculously slow. Hated the environment but it was an ""IT experience"" nonetheless"
bad,"es una buena empresa de television satelital buenas promociones por meses,mejor tecnologia y buena atencion al usuario ademas nos brinda un buen beneficio de señal."
bad,made you sell door to door in the heat with very little compensation
bad,"Overbearing, oppressive, demeaning, no customer focus, places their bureaucracy above the customer."
bad,"Calling customer all day 50 to 55 calls"
bad,I do not have much to say about this company.  I would not refer anyone to work for this company.
bad,"This job was a scam!!!"
bad,Very bad work place environment.  Management is very unprofessional.
bad,"Training is nice so you are prepared for anything when you finally go on the phones. However, your schedule is not consistent, you are monitored way too much which makes a person nervous. You don't get a chance to get to know your coworkers because there is such a high turnover rate"
bad,You pretty much just get yelled at by customers nonstop every day. Not much good to say about this job
bad,it was a contracted job I didn't really like it that's why I left
bad,"After 15 years and two hostile mergers the culture devolved to one where customer service is now viewed as merely a cost or necessary ""evil"" to be reduced and controlled by unparalleled micromanagement.  Arrogant, condescending middle managers, lacking any integrity. Over 90 percent of workforce pulled from the most crime ridden ares... Leading to a hostile environment where the subculture intimidates those with stronger work ethics. Racial politics, gender politics, religious politics, transgender politics... A more diverse group of intolerance would be hard to find. The glass ceiling is limo-tinted."
bad,I worked hard day in and day out but never received recognition for any of my long hours and hard work. Enjoyed being able to interact with people.
bad,It takes a VP approval to order business cards and approve customer travel.  The internal pricing committee is disconnected from the account executives and therefore their customers.
bad,"at&t was a great job, sometime u have to move on from a company when its your time, I served mu purpose and it was time to move on to other opportunities. "
bad,"Typical day answered 40 to  60  calls from customers whom either wanted new service or whom were upset about there account. what I learned is each customer is very valuable and unique in each situation, the people I work with are very supportive and helpful and have become like family, the hardest part of my Job was having to shut a customer phone off for non payment, the most enjoyable part of my Job was KNOWING I did my best on each and every call"
bad,This is not a company you can grow with in the tech support dept.
bad,"Directv  is a OK job, but only if you are planning to stay there for short term( while getting college degree or using it as a stepping stool until you get a better job) i don't recommend this job, since their is no room for growth."
bad,"It works for some people but its a sales position with a draw against commission. I hated it. Very unprofessional but again, to each his own."
bad,"-Every year job was at risk of being laid off or I was transfered. "
bad,The job was fun at first glance but office life was beyond stressful
bad,"Lack of management control, no idea how to train, has no idea how to run a business. if youre not managment, you live to work not work to live. worst place i have ever worked for, period!"
bad,"llamar a gente para vender el servicio poder contarle los beneficios etc"
bad,"Loved learning the ins and out of how celluar companies work, and how to communicate and fix problems for customers"
bad,"If you enjoy management by fear of losing your job than this is the place for you. This company has a revolving door at the front of its building for a reason and that reason is because employees are constantly fired. Horrible team leads that dont know how to train their employees and dont know how to lead by example. If you are qualified to advance dont bother unless you are in the managements click. They dont like regular employees to give feedback on how to retain employees or improve the company. This company prefers to beat you down and cut you down. Save yourself and dont bother with this company. Horrible leadership all the way from the top down. If you are in the military on reserve duty expect them to ask for your commanding officers phone and email as a letter from your commanding officer will not be good enough, and if you dont they will give you a final written warning once you miss your weekend shift due to military service. "
bad, company is very unorganized. The management team does not follow management procedures. 
bad,Direct Tv foucs only on Sales. A typical day there is that you meet with your mananger and he/she would push you to make atleast 10 sales a day so they can meet there maerk and get the bouns check
bad,It's all about the money.  They don't care about their employees at all.  
bad,I was hired to work part time and at one location and the second day of my job I started traveling from McDonough all the way up into midtown and brookhaven Atlanta. My checks were not ever right. 
bad,"If you have a family or other interest outside of work, then you don't want to work for AT&T as a Wire Technician. I average 11 hours a day (mandatory overtime), our shift changes constantly so you may get short notice if any that your start time, or days off have changed. Right now we're on a mandatory six day work week schedule. "
bad,if you do not make any sales you min wage that you have to pay back once you start  making sales
bad,overall just bad. didn't teach the new hires how sale the product.
bad,"I worked over 60 hours a week, but took home 1500 $ every week based on comission on what I sold. "
bad,"This was the worst job I've ever had. Fielding call after call and all the customers do is BERATE you. Immediate supervisors and management could care less. The company would provide you with paid time off for sick, vacation, etc; however if you called out sick you would GET IN TROUBLE and be put on a warning, because you didn't give advance notice. Because, ya know, everyone is psychic and knows when they are going to get sick. Management instead of providing you with actual monetary raises for job well done would provide you with company events like ""waffle day"" and ""ice cream day"" and ""pretzel day"" and this might boost morale slightly, but they are buying this food for a large size call center of over 1000 employees. Use that money to pay your employees. Food only goes so far, once you eat it, its gone."
bad,they suck and they dont pay there in employee but they are so quick to take money from there in employee there never give anything when you always do a good job
bad,"a typical day is the 1st call of the day set the standers for the day, on daily basis learning refresher course, management engaged at all time. my co workers we help each other enjoyable knowing at the end of the day I was able to help some one else"
bad,Growing company. Co-workers are co-operative. Re organization goes on all the time. That is the most challenging part.
bad,this company is now out of business..its no longer here anymore
bad,"Absolutley NO LEADERSHIP, Supervisors need to brush up on Supervisory training, Regional Manager mico-manages. Staff suffers, moral down, weekly contradiction, weekly change, change and more change."
bad,"The worst place you can ever work. A typical day at att involves dealing with very very annoying upset customers and negative criticism from management all day long. Att has the worst customer service and that is coming from an employee and a customer, if you call and need something expect to get transferred. When its comes to vacation or using sick time you can forget that. In the dsl technical support dept they only allow 88 hrs of time off a day out of having around 300 employees and no matter how extreme you situation is you will get written up or fired even if you have doctors note. As far as advancement, that doesnt not exist at all. Out of the yrs I have been there I have only witnessed 4 people advance and that is not even exagerating and trust me there was some serious brown nosing. The hardest part of this job is not walking out or trying not to dread comiing into this forsaken place.This place is the worst job you can apply for. The schedules change every month you will definitely work late weekend schedules, upper management treat the customer assitants like slaves and force the worst weekends schedules while they sit at home and live normal lives. There is absolutley no enjoyment in this job and the pay for customer assitant stinks compared to what other departments make."
bad,This is the worst contract I have ever been on. Do not apply here. I apply for a contract and was never told about this being a call center. I was SHANGHAIed in America. I could not believe this happened to me. This is nothing but abuse. They ridicule everything you do and micromanage. Horrible. You have no say to anything I have never been threatened and told off so many times in my life let along one job. Many people leave this place. Gross negligence. Dirty facilities. Hard nose hillbilly run operation. Houston Texas.
bad,No human aspect of the job exists any more. Management is only looking to hire and fire instead of coach and develop staff. Compensation does not justify the stress for sales goals.
bad,"*Delivered and or prepared sales talks, reading from scripts that described products or services, in order to persuade potential customers to make purchase."
bad,"Irresponsible in its dispatchment of tasks, and obligation to employees.. Its primary goal is to lower salaries and seniorship of all its existing employees"
bad,"It's retail, so you get to deal with the public and work and nights and on the weekends. Management cares about nothing but money. If you can't make quota, you're gone."
bad,"A typical day was constant, fast-paced, work detailed at all times. I attained negotiating skills, how to de-escalate situations, and how to retain customers. Management was versatile. Some in management were supportative, encouraging growth, and excellence, othere were not concerned about the employee, only on metrics and matrixs of the company. Co-workers were supportive of each other's role in the business, and enlightening to work with. The most difficult part of the job was hearing that your efforts weren't good enough, even though a valuable customer was retained. The most enjoyable part of the job was whenever I saw other co-workers or if I experienced kudo's from managemet for doing a great job."
bad,DIRECTV has a very bad habbit of fireing employee's for no call.
bad,ok to work there you kind of get over looked since its so large didnt care for the pay scale
bad,"typical day of work through directv included training and then taking test, which in fact if you missed one question then they let you go. The hardest part of the job is that they didn't want you to have a priorities that included family, or anything other then the job. There wasn't anything enjoyable about this job but the pay. They asked us to be dishonest about parts of the programs they offered, because of health reasons."
bad,"Don't do it, it sounds nice and is alright in the beginning, but this job absolutely sucks. Between driving all over the state, dumping tons of gas money, and running around finding equipment due to shortages, it is easily the worst job I've had."
bad,"No regard for workmans rights, 12hr workday, would gladly send you to customers house at embarrasing times of the night to start a job and encouraged us to lie to the customer to upsell uverse packages so supervisor could make his numbers."
bad,overbearing management...no family values....no respect...horrible benefits...unrealistic goals..they let the customers walk all over you and let them talk to you in any kind of way.
bad,Very firm managers and unpleasant work environment. Managers had their favorite employees and only encouraged or assisted those people.
bad,Had managers yelling while on the phone with customers and would lose sales because of her. No flexability
bad,"AT&T manages the Return and Refurbishment process for the various Customer Premise equipments by using the SAP PM/CS functionality. Once customer decides to stop continuing AT&T services, all the CPE are returned and refurbished at third party vendor for further use."
bad,no one pays attention or respects the employees
bad,"They will find any and every way to take money from your pockets. Its not a career!!!! Management could care less about you cause they are overworked. Co workers are so drained by this job that they are negligent about the work, so you will have to go out on a service call and correct their work. Not to mention that you only get $20 for the call and sometimes you are there for 3 hours. When you do a job you own it for 90 days. Meaning if tommy hits that dish with a football and knocks out the alignment or breaks the lnb, its your fault and they charge you $10!!!!!! I could go on and on. Hardest part is the no family life. Enjoyable part, keeping the miles off my car."
bad,"Horrible mangement. Managers and area supervisors have unrealistic expectations, they do not abide by their own policies. AT&T charge customers fees and usage charges that the customers did Not accure. Too many misleading sales gimmicks. Supervisors are highly unprofessional."
bad,pay is great but you work horrible hours. benefits are really good.
bad,i worked for this place 3 years and everytime you turned around they
bad,"worked as a contractor at the Englewood NOC, was a bad experience overall."
bad,Approved purchase orders in Oracle System
bad,"arrancar temprano a vender puerta x puerta la dueña era buena , lo mas dificil era estar en la calle sin cobertura de ningun tipo, y lo bnueno fue conocer muchos lugares de tuc."
bad,I have learned to work with new tools that I haven't worked with in the 20 years of working with cable and satellite. I enjoy my coworkers also liked working with and getting to know them. And also I can take the experience that I have gained from this company and apply it towards a career.
bad,Management was a joke. They had ridiculous rules like you cannot make a personal call at your desk phone. The department I was in discriminated against gender and age.
bad,"No life work Balance and Corporate Policies ridiculous. They don't pay out commissions as promised, if you get them at all. Very unprofessional work environment, and loyalty generated is nill. You will not have access to view your ACE scores, nor commissions details. 4 weeks to get a direct deposit processed, and god forbid if you change accounts. What they tell you in the interview is not what really happens. You are constantly under the gun to SELL, and people yell SELL and ring GONGS, however, when it comes to recompensating you for your sales they wait and wait and wait, then tell you that you won't get them."
bad,Treat you like a no good useless person / management see you as just a number
bad,At&T didnt care if you were sick or had a child who was sick. U got wrote up wether you time off was covered or not.
bad,1 Left don't know what the right hand is doing.
bad,"It was a great learning experience. Very enjoyable, great staff, Management was different, I learned you need to take care of the customer first they make the company. A typical day would be never everyday was GREAT."
bad,A company that is not focused on its employees.
bad,"ATT is no longer a good place to work. Contractors are hired as a supplemental expendible work force. Even if you are getting kudos for doing a good job, they just walk in and say you have 2 weeks to wind it up, we are redistributing your work to an employee. They do not honor the terms of your contract. They also outsource your job to India."
bad,new att has taken the fun out of customer service by pushing sales but do not help customers
bad,"Have you ever had a job in your life, that you ABSOLUTELY hated? Well, Directv is mine ! Management was high pressure to make sales, no matter what.... too stressful of a job. In this economy where many people are LOSING their jobs, 98% of the people who's calls I answered, had lost or were going to lose their jobs. It was my job to make sales of expensive movie/sports channels."
bad,company ethics and procedures were very shady their only goal was for you to make them money be quiet about being disrespected and treated unfair from upper manager down to superivisors this is not a god working enviornment the pay rate when i started 5 years ago was great i can no longer say that everything has changed stay far away from this web of lies called At&t
bad,Would not recommend for employment for those looking to advance throughout the company
bad,They expect you to live your existence for them and them alone. If you have any family this is not the place for you. They treat their employees horribly. The dollar is truly the bottom line here. The turnover is incredible. If they only knew that their profits would increase if they wanted to keep employees. Only job in my life that I have just quit.
bad,It is a production based environment with tight cycle time.
bad,this company does not care if their own employees die. Nor do the care if the love ones of their the employee die.
bad,"A typical day at work is on the phone, selling dsl, lines and cell phones."
bad,1.Cheap Labor
bad,"Most stressful job experience I have had in 30 years. Constant IM's from management to have perfectly scripted calls with AT&T customers or be walked out the door. Ambulances called weekly or monthly due to employees having chest pains, etc, due to stress. I can't even give this company one star, but there are no other choices."
bad,Not interested in the growth of the employee. typical corporate company. They sell the employee short. and everything is about making money for them while they cut the employee earnings by 1/4 every month not to mention the customer stress and the implimentations of sales taxes and the sudden bill surcharges that they dont tell us about
bad,"If you want to work for a company that allows you to balance your life and sell products that benefit your clients,"
bad,buy the study guides for the tests from them. they wrote the test questions! make sure you have a doctarate in programming!
bad,Hours change monthly
bad,for a communication company no communication. in a average of a yr about 10 manager came and went. just not a good work environment.
bad,"It is difficult to make a good living installing directv due to the amount of charge backs that they have. If 1 little detail is not met they will charge you back for the entire install, even if it is not service effecting. This was a difficult pill to swallow, but as a contractor you realize that this is how these companies make their money by taking back from the people who do the work."
bad,"if you want stress then this job is for you. Absolutely the worst managed company. Micro managed to the point where they squeeze you under their thumb (daily). Think they are high tech with out dated software systems. As a communications company, communications is they worst thing they do. Sales will say anything to make sales then technician delivers the reality every install. Technicians cut corners to meet unrealistic efficiency numbers created by people whom never done job. Managers (whom come from different backgrounds, non technical) have inferiority complex issues and take it out on technician. Technicians always at fault, no support from managers what so ever. If they want your opinion they will give it to you. An actual no-win situation. Schedule all over the place, required overtime (weekends too) 6 days in summer mandatory, Required loaned to other locations (other cities) 3 weeks at a time with no return home. Definitely a no life job. If you have a family, forget spending quality time with them. I thought slavery was outlawed. (and all the above is the ""good"" stuff)."
bad,"if you thrive on stress, go here. absolutely the worst managed company. think they are high tech with outdated software systems. micro managed to the point where they squeeze you under their thumb. management has no clue on the actual task (all came from different backgrounds non of them technical) - most technician cut corners to meet their efficiency numbers, every repair is a re-install, if they want your opinion, they will give it to you - always the technician's fault no matter what - a real no-win situation."
bad,"I have been a tech for 6 years through HSP's, contractors, and retailers. Over the years of installing, even for other companies, it's always changing. New products come out along with new technology. After awhile it's easy to learn. Iv enjoyed installing vary much and have traveled the country doing so. You never know what the day is going to bring, however not always a good thing. Iv always loved my job. Lately however, installing Directv through HSP's and contractors has been miserable. They have been increasing the amount of work and time that goes into every install with more and more strict guidelines that in most cases is too high for the average house/structure. As well as not paying to install many new items. With gas prices and equipment prices on the rise, as well as more non paid labor being requested, this job is as bad as it gets. Everybody but techs get a pay raise, all Directv techs get is more work less money and if the customer doesn't want to pay for items than the tech is stuck with the tab. Directv is doing a beta program where they will pay for some of the additional items promoting there are no more custom charges to customers. However they are paying less than what the items are worth... Once again the tech takes the tab. As well as not paying for all custom items, what about the stuff that's not on the national list? Hope that doesn't stay. Tech eats the tab. What if you goto a house only paid to swap a box and the rest of the houses cables are not installed exactly how Directv wants them? Tech has to completely change the whole house, taking most of"
bad,"I noticed most comments were positive from areas outside of Alabama. I loved my job until changes .Employees are not valued , your job is in secure and the stress to meet numbers , unrealistic, I quit due to this , any place that is hiring everyday , probably not where you wanna work ."
bad,Would not recommend this to my worst enemy!!!!
bad,terrible management non eoe place changes goals in the middle of the month employer is always looking to find ways to reduce the amount of benefits you recieve
bad,This is possibly the worst job i have ever had in my life. I have never worked for a company that has so little disregard for their employees. You will never have free saturdays until you have been with them for about 2 years. lord forbid you have a family emergency or have to take a day off. The management is horrible and unknowledgeable. There is no consistancy regarding anything. I wish i could get back the 2 yrs I wasted at this place! Oh and you are required to maintain sales to keep your job.
bad,"AT&T is a Fortune 500 company whose main focus is their bottom line, not employee or customer satisfaction. As an employee you are treated like a number with no human value. This is possibly the worst work enviroment I have ever experianced."
bad,"I went in to test for this job and the hiring manager said I did not ""pass"" and would not allow me to see the scores or give me any info about minimum pass rate required. I believe this person was lying because of just simply not wanting to hire me for whatever reason."
bad,"I worked for this company loved it at first. However, favoritism was shown to reps. Alot of back stabbing, managers fighting with each other and the mangers didn't know how to talk or treat the employees. I should of never worked for At &T"
bad,"This was the worst company I have ever worked for, hands downs. The chargebacks on commission were the worst part. It was like they didn't want to pay you anything. Just come in and sell phones for free. I wouldn't recommend a job with AT&T to my worst enemy."
bad,hardcore sales people and management make working here quite unbearable for someone with ethics.
bad,AT&T does not value the employees they have. Everyone who works there is not a human just a number and everyone no matter what they've done is replaceable. They announced mass layoffs before 2020 and have held true to that all through 2019. They will keep throwing people away like trash and expect consumers to eat whatever they feed them.
bad,Very dishonest and unprofessional place to work and making a living out of.  The expectations they put on the employees were very demanding and harsh along with the quota being very difficult to accomplish and surpass.
bad,Job based on who you knew not what you knew. Most senior managers had no experience in their field. Managers/departments worked against each other and not with each other to benefit the company.
bad,"I work as a DirecTV Technician, and since AT&T has taken over, we have lost much of our pay, technicians, supervisors, customer service, and the benefits are poor compared to the old DirecTV standards."
bad,Laid off after 19 years 2 months. Looking back it appears that senior management knew who would be let go at the beginning of the year. Myself and one other were moved from reporting to a director to an area manager. After being moved we evidently were used as sacrificial lambs so the are manager could keep as much of his team as possible intact.
bad,"If you enjoy being the bottom of the totem-pole and working ALONE for 12-16 hour days, then this is the job for you! I worked at this position for 5 years in Miami,FL in a company truck with NO A/C. I ALONE was responsible for the installation/maintenance of Cable/Telephone/Internet. (That was in the beginning) Later on they began laying their Fiber Optic network and acquired DIRECTV. All of a sudden I was now a Fiber Optic and Satellite technician in addition to my primary roles and countless regulations and processes. (With no raise in pay!!!) Keep in Mind, we were not permitted to leave until all work in the area is completed. The initial training for the position was 2 months. When the Merger happened, our training consisted of a one-day crash course on both new systems.(Otherwise we were told to ""Youtube it"") They would send us out to do a job without the necessary tools and equipment and expect exemplary results. The most common response to any technical/ethical/ issue was ""Just get it done."" There is a Union in place but sadly they fail and continue to fail their patrons time and time again. I started off making the minimum you can make and had to work my way up from the bottom of the pay-scale because I had no previous experience. After two years, there was a new Collective Bargaining Agreement signed which mandated all new employees to receive TOP PAY upon hiring.(the rest of us would just have to CATCH UP EVENTUALLY) I had to TRAIN someone with less seniority and NO prior experience, and they were getting paid MORE than I was. Management is an absolute wash, if you"
bad,Had a death in the family & son had mental illnesses. They did not care. They gave me points for everything. I wasn't trained properly because the manager takes vacations every time she hires someone & the assistant manager should have been a statue. She was worthless & retaliatory. She nitpicked alot and I understand why that location has so much turnover. No leadership or integrity.
bad,When I first stared at AT&T I loved my job I had a manager that made sure her employees learned things and made sure you moved forward. We all got along like family. I can’t say I was happy with them when I left. If you weren’t a part of the click you were out. It doesn’t matter how well you did your job. If you are lazy and do the bare minimum then you will last at AT&T. You will become a manager for and don’t know how.
bad,"Resources are only retained as long as the project has a source of funding.  Otherwise, they cut you without notice.  Leadership prioritizes budget over working relationships with Individual Contributors."
bad,I have applied over 200 times within the company the only jobs I was offered were lesser paying jobs where I’d have to relocate. They are consumed with numbers and no work life balance. Most of the time you have to request time over way in advance and in the summer you can forget about your family

bad,"Retail has lots and lots of Stress! Managers...Constantly harassing you about a sale, if you could sale, you should have done this or that.   Even if you are top 5 in the store or have several years under your belt. They don’t care!!! It’s all about a sale! And God forbid if an elderly person comes in needing extra help. You will get written up for assisting them.  You don’t get your 15 min breaks.  And you will not go home on time."
bad,I'm afraid to answer this question in this forum.  Terrible senior leadership who is disconnected from front line management needs and challenges.  I would not tell my worst enemy to apply here.
bad,Sell sell sell. You had to sell at&t services or receive a low performance rating. Most of the time managers made you wait when you needed help. And time counts against you
bad,"AT&T has great products and services.  "
bad,"Ruthless management! I've never been treated in such a childish manner in my life. They micro manage to the fullest. I had to pull out the union hand book on several occasions and the management would still argue. The Union (C.W.A.) is a joke. They do nothing but steal money from the under paid employees. If i had to do it all over again, I would've opt out of union dues. When they fire you, because they will regardless of your numbers, you are better off getting a lawyer."
bad,"Working as a wire technician for this company is an absolute insult. Job security is a joke, theres no free time for work life balance. Avoid this job if you can. The money is good, but you will lose hair over the amount of stress you'll go through to get it."
bad,"Managers only know fear based leadership, surpluses are extremely common, moral is low, company doesn’t care for its employees, only its executives, not a good role pace"
bad,I sometimes have nightmares about working there. At first it was good and I was very happy but as soon as they brought in a new manager things started to go very wrong. I shouldn't have to deal with unions to work retail but the fact that there is one speaks volumes about their ethics. I was encouraged to lie and cheat. I was threatened on a regular basis and finally accused of a crime that they wouldn't report if I accepted a transfer.
bad,ATT is only concerned with stock holders. Employees are disposable and not cared for in any way.  You are measured ridiculously by metrics that you have no control over and most of the numbers are unrealistic. There is no advancement from the lower tiered positions. You are pretty much on your own to do any and all work asked of you with little to no assistance.
bad,"If you like to feel secure in your job and like your sanity, this is not the company for you.  The company in constantly changing because they don’t ever figure anything out before implementation.  This leads to a very stressful working environment because you are held to standards that do not make sense and do not work.  The upper management team is completely disconnected from the retail environment.  They try to walk in and tell you how to do your job, but do not have an ounce of sales experience.  These people are true managers, not leaders.  "
bad,Work at AT&T has always been extremely stressful in the past 10 years I’ve worked there. There has always been inconsistently usually in the 4th quarter regarding budget resulting in layoffs and surplusing dedicated employees who have been there for over 20 years. Long hours of overtime with no pay.
bad,work place was very toxic. many favoritism with ladies. always changing schedule. poor management made you feel very low at certain times when could not make the sell. talked back in a very disrespectful way.
bad,Horrible company to work for. Management doesn’t care about clients nor employees. Executives just want to get richer. Very uncomfortable work atmosphere.
bad,"3.5 years here, 6 days a week, 10-12 hours a day. No work/life balance. Expected to work outside in all weather conditions all year.  Bullied into joining the CWA union who only really support job titles with 15 or more years with the company. Management micro manages every aspect of your job with unachievable metrics. They lay off thousands of employees yearly. No job security. Barely any opportunity for advancement."
bad,"Att bought out the company I used to work for.  Went from enjoying my job to hating it basically over night.  Management cares nothing about employees, never felt so insignificant before."
bad,No clear direction. The daily goals would change by the hour . Mystery write ups started to appear when sales goals weren’t met or were exceeded. Any type of write up affected bonuses and raises. At the end of the day would feel like the stereotypical used car salesmen.
bad,AT&T does not have a good work/ home balance and really seems to not care about employees. I was never home before 8:00 at night. I would not recommend anyone to work there.
bad,"Number driven company.  They put too much pressure on the Techs,  worst company to work for.  Over charge customers too much money raise rates twice in one year"
bad,"The management treats you like garbage. There is no advancement. I would not wish this position on my worst enemy. Do your self a favor and keep looking as you will end up regretting ever working for this company. You will receive no training and the managers will pressure you to do unethical things like lie to the customers and tell them everything is free free and misquote. This will place the rep in a 200% over goal thus the Manager will praise the sales rep knowing that in three months when the customer receives the bills, they will start an escalation request and some times gets to upper management. Once upper management starts asking questions, that sales manager will throw the sales rep under the bus. Thus allow the untrained rep to take the blame and be terminated. I have witness this multiple times. If the sales rep pushes back and refuses to use the unethical sales tactics, the sales manager will start to harass the sales rep until they resign from the position. Don't believe me? ask any ex IHX rep."
bad,"inns or security dos not support you with incapacidad and company looks for excuses to fired you and hypocrite people or STAFF,  that say I started from the bottom yeas you had to leak somebodies butt to get where you are farming people do that a lot that is why city people, get less lately ignorance from a foreigner that have a degree but do not know educations comes from hme nor from a peace of paper. that make salaries and cheap  labour fro that people that comes from put side name it from another country or from small towns. it is from everywhere but sny how slavery in i maximum potential."
bad,"Being new resident I took advantage of an opportunity to work for AT&T call center with my primary skill being sales because they pay great hourly wage. So it sounds great until you understand what your real day today will be. We started with 15 people in our training class and by 6 months in there were only 5 people left. If your mental health is more important to you, walk away. "
bad,"a cash cow for share holders , near wage slavery for everyone else."
bad,My review the pay was decent but I didn't have time to spend with my family or enjoy relaxation I was always stressed out that I was going to lose my job and I was always written up for something that I cannot control almost all the time. It seemed as if they only wanted to keep the installers for two and a half years and then let them go. At one point I overheard the managers say if my cruise not written up when they're not working. And with that mindset I would never work there again.
bad,If you’re okay with having no time for yourself or family while receiving less commission year over year this will be a good fit. Some benefits are good but mostly garbage.
bad,They use you untill they are ready to get rid of you. Then they discredit your work to have a reason to fire you. I was in management and it is a disgrace how some employees are treated.
bad,"AT&T acquired the company that I worked for, therefore inherited a bunch of great employees however AT&T didn't see it that way and immediately started to surplus great employees in place of low performing employees"
bad,Company is looking for any and every reason to fire people. 5 people in 3 months including myself. Ridiculous. I worked so hard for this company and they just threw me away like i was nothing.
bad,"I hated the job and hated going to work there every day. it was miserable for me and my teammates. Everyone is looking for new jobs. The only reason there still there is because  they haven't found new jobs. they will have a HIGH turn over eventually. "
bad,"I have the rare perspective of having worked for the ""real"" AT&T (when its' HQ was in Bedminster NJ) back in 2000 & what the company is now, is a far cry from the true industry leader it once was. So ""real"" At&t had stellar benefits - all from day 1, healthcare, EAP, PTO just to name a few. Now all of these benefits, technically, are still available, but there are restrictions, waiting periods & deductibles that didn't previously exist. SBC...i mean AT&T current management now demands the highest levels of integrity from the employee, but finds everyway possible to cheat employees out of bonuses, paid breaks & other benefits through manipulation or trumped up minor infractions, that in any other environment would be easily coached through. Nepatism is rampant, they promote those they can control or intimidate, often with little or no experience at seriously reduced salaries, in comparison to other managers at the same level. Management has seriously unreasonable & unattainable goals for CSR agents. Managers issue directives to teams, & later discipline those same employees for following those very directions. The pay to start is tempting but what is asked of you in return is not worth it (once you see the workload you'll understand, also consider that this same company closed another call center, laid off all its employees [making $33 p/hour] only to reopen a new center with the same job duties at half the old rate). Several employees ranging in age have become so overloaded by the stress levels that they have passed out right at their workstations & 911 had to be called. I"
bad,"If you’re in high school this might work for you since you make slightly more than minimum wage. You will be promised the world and all kinds of money but will see pay decreases and chargebacks and writeups galore. You’ll have 4-5 different store managers if you stay more than a year."
bad,This is a very stressful environment to work in. You are not trained properly and they are always under staffed so expect overtime. There isn't a good support system for you within the company.
bad,"I saw so many stupid things happen over the years from upper management. You’re just a number to the bean counters and they care nothing about you or your family life. First line management is hit or miss but they really have no power. If you just want to be a slave then it’s ok I guess, if you have any amount of self worth you may not like it too much."
bad,"Hard sales position. Every customer that comes in needs A new line with DirecTV. If the customer is not interested in a new line or adding a new line and already has DirecTV, push the customer off to customer care 1-800 because you are not going to meet your sales goal or make money off that person. Management awkwardly interrupt your sales pitch in mid conversation with ""so are you interested in starting a business account today or know anybody who is?"" "
bad,Everything is centered around TV. You are encouraged to break ethics to slam numbers by management but if you are caught you will be disciplined and management will distance themselves from what they had told you to do previously. If you’re a shady person this is the company for you.
bad,"to start training is very little and vague, expect you to know 6+ systems in 4 weeks and get on the phone and save customers that are disconnecting services and we dont even know the company well enough to try to save them. high turnover rate due to unprofessional management, a work environment that is to relaxed(no dress code so people can come in a nightgown and slippers if they felt like it, or extremely short dresses, robes, cheeky shorts, etc). agents tell management what they will and wont do. lots of arguing and physical fighting among coworkers. everyone seems to have a bad attitude. a temporary job at best,"
bad,"Multiple layoffs every year creates a stressful environment. Leadership decisions are based on lining their pockets and the pockets of shareholders instead of what's best for their employees or customers.  Customer satisfaction is rarely a priority, making money is more important. Top rated employees are taken advantage of instead of rewarded. Women are still paid less than men doing the same job. There are very few supportive leaders who encourage employees to better their skills and advance their careers."
bad,"you are constantly worried about being laid off, no appreciation by upper manegment you are just a number.  if you file a complaint you will be retailiated against, no direction by upper management.  constantly cutting back, being requried to do the job of 4 people with no overtime or appreciation."
bad,Not really sure if working for an AT&T Retail Store is the right move. Perhaps getting hired on directly to work at a corporate store would be best. Our store was robbed a total of 6x in 1year. We had no security at the shopping plaza (can you believe that... Yes I know very shocking) and check this out best of all we had no working cameras. Several times this was bought up to our heads in command to relay back to HR and nothing was ever done after almost 2years I knew I had to get out of that place.
bad,I did not like working for this company. This company is very disorganized. Nothing ever started on time. The person in charge was very rude and rarely ever cared for how the business was running.
bad,"Decent pay for a call center... I guess..."
bad,"This company would change so much that even my bosses couldn’t help me! Constantly being referred to HR Onestop because either they didn’t want to help or they didn’t know how. If you ran over time on a call and you didn’t get to lunch or break and the scheduled time for the day (daily changing) then It went against your metrics. Supervisors were in tight clicks and were so close they spent holidays outside of the work place. Trying to find someone who wasn’t biased to help you was not going to happen. Need help to fix your time or walk through the new system, ask someone else. If you are trying to assist a customer and do good towards them, just make a note of it in the account and maybe a policy will allow it. Their complaint system was so full that it was impossible to clear out issues especially when you are restricted on how to help them due to the company will not compensate or credit customer for awful inconveniences, that were not the customers fault but the company and Techs on the field. Signed up for the union. And Att never kept their end of the deal. They ended up closing departments and hiring out of country agents. Techs on field constantly calling is begging for someone to help them complete a order due to the system kept going down. It was very hard to have joy in this place when it seemed that no one cared or matter to anyone."
bad,I wish I had read the reviews .. definitely true and got worse. All they care about is sales nothing else. Oh yeah I quit 4 months ago and I’m still an active employee. Obviously someone’s not doing their job .. nothing new.
bad,"Lots of broken promises , uneducated agents, system problems, outdated policy’s, out dated systems, high turnover rate, no work life balance, nothing is ever prompt and finished in a timely manner."
bad,Bad place to work and bad environment. Did not enjoy working there. worked 6 years and still couldnt get good weekly hours had to still work weekends.
bad,"low-paying job, stepping stone.  I worked there over 32 years ago, so I'm sure the culture has changed a lot in their customer service field.  This position may not even exist anymore."
bad,"Rather not. review the center is closed. While the center was open, their was reverse discrimination. The Manager would only promote others of his own race."
bad,"AT&T prioritizes sleazy sales tactics to boosts its pockets. It's mission is never truly followed. The company also liked to re-org all the time and lied to employees about career advancement. I read all the job postings that said this before signing on and gosh, do I wish I would have taken the advice to stay away from this company - especially its BDSLP program (total scam)."
bad,"They only value the share price, nothing else, especially people as they value no one and have no heart at all. Skill means nothing and they are ruthless."
bad,"All about numbers, they encourage you to lie to customers, no job security, very dangerous. The network infrastructure is ancient and your expected to make miracles happen. The worst part is they are aware of they can't deliver the service or speeds they advertise. Do yourself a favor and never apply to this company."
bad,"•	Responsible for all aspects of technical project and program management. "
bad,The most horrible working environment ever with terrible management. Don't expect progress in your career and raise in your salary.
bad,"the workloads are heavy, the management is horrible and allowed a coworker to sexually harass me for months, continued to make me work with this coworker even after i submitted several complaints and reports to HR. Management then retaliated against me by cutting my hours and writing me up for things they were allowing the sales reps to do."
bad,Would never recommend to a family or friend unless desperate for a job. The company does not care about its employees. They do a lot of illegal things. Only time they allow anything is if benefits the company they will turn there head to but an employee will be disciplined for any little thing.
bad,"To be fair, AT&T is a huge company and other people working in very different roles may not share my experience.  However, in my role, and in hundreds of jobs I see around me, the company seems to rely on motivation by fear.  There always seems to be a layoff imminent, which then highly motivates the average worker to do whatever he/she can to stay off ""the list"", regardless of whether such self-protection benefits the company or not."
bad,Don't like management it's a  Micro managing type of place they only worry about the number not the employee that makes them money.  Really long hours over book you everyday have no time to talk to customers and they don't give you time to do job right
bad,I did not enjoy my time at AT&T because it was sales and I did not have a background in sales. I am not a pushy salesperson so I was not able to personally enjoy what I did for the company
bad,"This is a rough place to work. I was located in Boston. There were a lot of exciting things going on with the new entertainment developments. "
bad,"A typical work day is from 5am to at earliest 4pm. The daily task is to push a crew of individuals who are protected by union contracts and do not care to the extent that you do about the job to make projected metrics that for 98% of the business is almost impossible to reach. I learned working here that team is a word that is loosely thrown around but not enforced or practiced. Within a group individuals are so driven to meet metrics and personal agendas that they will do anything to reach these metrics and agendas regardless of who's name, character or reputation is tarnished in the process. Management only allows you the freedom to be mobile and not have to work in the field daily. Workplace culture is dog eat dog. The hardest part of the job is going to work to do the job. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I was a technician."
bad,"2wks of training was cool but once we got on the floor the pressure to make sales was unreal. If we needed assistance from a supervisor they would first ask if we had a sale, if not, then they would tell us to search for the answer ourselves."
bad,This job was for customer service but the call center is made for you to hurry up and get the customer off the phones. We are made to offer services very fast paced.
bad,"Terrible. The worst. Management are idiots. Jobs are stupid, products sold are insufficient. company has no reason to upgrade. they get blown out by comcast and rcn."
bad,"First 11 years I was with BellSouth and it was the best 11 years of my working career. The last five years we were merged into AT&T and to say the least it sucked like nothing else has ever sucked before. Management was fickle. There was no movement or room made to expand your opportunities. I welcomed my ""graduation""/layoff. It was a relief to finally have closure and the ability to move along again. Not a company I would recommend going to work for unless you like exposing yourself to poor management, a general lack of direction, having smoke blown up your butt on a regular basis, constant threats of layoffs, never being able to move about within the company to expand your knowledge base, what's not to love about it?"
bad,"This place used to be a really good place to work but overtime it has gotten worse. The pay continually decreases for compensation. You are constantly lied to by management. Very few managers know what they are doing and most do not deserve the job. Constant micromanagement. Can’t even take a bathroom break without being hounded. The benefits are great and discounts are great. But this job is very stressful and will take years off your life. They will suck you in for the first year then over time you will learn they care nothing about you. The tactics used to make seals are very unethical and when you do what they tell you to get the sale of corporate finds out, management will throw you on the bus. The company is very mismanaged at the Cape Girardeau office. I’ve heard different centers are better. A lot depends on the center manager. But at cape it’s def not the place to work. They would rather fire you than keep you. Turnover rate is super high. Been here for over 5 years and after the 1st year they started cutting my hiring class down from 25 people to just me left. DO NOT APPLY FOR CAPE OFFICE. YOU WILL REGRET IT."
bad,"I worked on the Customer Loyalty program. My job was to prevent as many customers as possible from cancelling their AT&T accounts. Most of the time, the customer had received horrific customer service, misquoted pricing from sales agents (both in call centers and at retail locations), and below average service quality from AT&T's products. This lead them to want to cancel all of their services with AT&T, and I was expected to ""re-sell"" the customer on the products they already had. Of course, in this competitive market, most customers would cancel their services. Instead of working toward a better customer experience and fixing the issues that led the customers to want to cancel their accounts in the first place, AT&T simply imposed a more unrealistic ""save"" quota each month. This made for an incredibly stressful work environment. Many times, I considered leaving the company, because I felt their tactics in ""saving"" customers were immoral and unethical. Unfortunately, I needed a paycheck, so I stayed. As a result, my health suffered greatly. All the while, AT&T continued to raise their expectations while ignoring the pleas of employees to improve their processes."
bad,"Be prepared to have managers changed on you every other month, this makes having a consistent work place next to impossible. Talk to the reps in the store about the traffic before accepting a position managers will tell you they are a busy store when they are not and next thing you know you are having the same conversations about numbers despite traffic being next to nothing."
bad,I didn't have a pleasant experience working here. I'd recommend you start looking elsewhere. No sense of culture. Hardly any values are upheld. Just a whole hot mess...
bad,"Managers tell you to do something, then you get fired over it, and they will not back you up. Then you are treated like you are the person who is shady."
bad,I was laid off after 1 1/2 yrs.as a Technician and 8 yrs. in management. Upper Management is only concerned about getting their bonuses. They don't care about the employees or the customers.
bad,"forced to leave 1-1/2 years short of full retirement due to office closure. hours are not flexible. 20 years ago it was a great place to work, but over the years all the company cared about was sales, customer setvice was no longer a concern for them. managers are poorly trained"
bad,"If you enjoy working with insecure people then work here. Most of the Managers don't have any education in management. They are promoted by tenure. If you have questions on how to advance they are generally not helpful. Very tense, angry environment."
bad,"AT&T will lie to you on a regular basis. They promised us in our recent labor contract that they would create 3000 American jobs, but instead laid off thousands of good employees! AT&T expects employees to follow strict guidelines as per contract but will not deliver their end of the promise. Management has a ""cookbook mentality"". Management is not promoted from within and has no idea of how to do my job but instead hired on new. They claim that there is an equipment shortage regarding Directv boxes but the Directv shop has plenty. Dont be a prem tech unless you really enjoy being treated like fecal matter! There are plenty of jobs that pay what I make and I am looking. AT&T does provide free psychotherapy counseling. If you work here you will need the counseling. Instead of counseling, I wish they would stop lying to me and driving me crazy. Don't even get me started on how much sales lies to my customers."
bad,"I was at DirecTV for 12 1/2 years and I NEVER felt secure there.  They constantly make you feel like you are doing a terrible job and that you are replaceable. I lived with constant stress that I would be fired at any minute. It caused migraines and panic attacks, but I was making good money and felt I couldn't leave.  When the merger with AT&T was going through things got even worse.  Management finally found a way to get rid of everyone that had been there 10+ years to save their bottom line."
bad,"managers promoted based on race or fraud sales. company is good ole boy, and is now laying off the good people. also they are terrible to their sales people by cutting pay every april."
bad,"Everyone is constantly under pressure to appear to perform, real results are not required. Everyone wants to appear to conform, nonconformity is highly punished. Heaven help you if you come from an acquired company. You may as well wear a scarlet letter."
bad,i dont enjoy management at my job. job title constantly changes. procedures constantly change. constantly fixing other peoples mistakes. unable to assist the customers how it is needed
bad,"I do not recommend working for AT&T.  When they acquired DIRECTV they came in and destroyed it with their work ethics, their disregard for their customers and employees and complete focus on the bottom line."
bad,"The company uses militant tactics to remove staff.  Pay rate is not equal across the board and job security is almost non-existent.  Metrics are put in place to remove employees, not develop them for success, which removes the ""human factor"" that helps companies thrive and survive."
bad,I love to help customers.  One-on-one sales is my specialty.  I did a really great job and made a ton of sales.  I got laid off two weeks before my wife gave birth to our daughter.
bad,"This call center is a joke.  It's run by chickens with their heads cut off.  They offer commissions but make them really close to impossible to attain, growing more difficult with each passing month."
bad,"AT&T is a corporate giant which is only interested in one thing; high quarterly profits.  The company has no regard for the quality of life of its employees.  Filed level managers are only interested in numbers.  At AT&T, it's about quantity not quality."
bad,"company does not know where its going , it has everything to be the best company but does not treat its employees right, they have no respect for employees,the employees are what make att ,"
bad,"This company has no interest in developing its employees, vastly preferring to hire from without rather than from within. Of all management positions filled in the four years that I was at this company, only 2 of the over 100 were internal hires or promotions, the remainder were exclusively external hires."
bad,Not a job I enjoyed. call centers never again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!They were nice enough just not my cup of tea. as I said I do not wish to ever do that kind of work.
bad,"Run for the hills.. calls are back to back. If management doesn't like you they will find a way to have you fired.. If management doesn't like you, at all you will never be able to be promoted.. Management will keep you in the same department. Especially if you make a high commission they don't want you to leave because you make managers extra money on their commission."
bad,"They just care about sales and numbers. They fluff your mind to trick into believing you will advance. However, the previous regional Director would solicit “favors” for advancement. Currently they just provide fast track dreams to nowhere."
bad,"Horrible place to work with no teamwork. I feel for those left there to rot. "
bad,"stressful, cut throat..."
bad,"It was a good company to work for in my early career. The money is okay, I wish I would have stayed longer with the company. The people I worked with were great"
bad,There are unfair practices within the company. Some people who are promoted are promoted because they are friend of the managers. Some people are required to say certain things to customers while others do not have the same requirements. Not the best company to work for.
bad,"The company buys other company's then merge and lays off. They do this every 3-4 months. Over the last 5 years I had gone through 15 layoff cycles. "
bad,"Unable or not willing to learn from diverse disciplines or perspectives, AT&T prefers to offer stale successes from their past rather than elevate new products that have an element of risk-to-reward."
bad,I honestly believe they hire people just to fire people. Constant change to systems and procedures that make no sense at all. Everything that goes wrong is your fault.
bad,"It is a good average job but managers are really bad, sometimes you have no help at all from any of your coworker or manager, not enough training time to start at job"
bad,I unfortunately worked at AT&T for almost 33 years and then was surplused in my opinion due to years of service and salary. The current management is a culture of ambiguous every person for themselves and move toward younger workforce who will not have a pension but only a 401k for retirement. A lot has changed and unfortunately not for the good of the employee.
bad,I was hired from Directv and it was one of the best jobs that I have had. ATT purchased and the job quickly went down. Our schedules changed daily and became very high stress.
bad,Im just filling out this review by saying that atnt was not a good experience but what is these days. All you can do is be professional and go about your day
bad,Management with a third party be vendor was okay would much prefer to be with the corporate side of things. In the long run the owner was let go to due problems at home
bad,managers drinking on the job. upper management fraternizing with employees. Managers had you working constantly under duress. environment set you up to fail.
bad,"The title says it all.  In addition, there is an extreme lack of recognition for work done.  "
bad,"Call center environment is ridiculous-cutthroat-hired on as a customer service representative, they quickly changed it to a ""Sales Representative"" which was geared towards selling as many AT&T products as possible. Quota was set and if not matched, individual was set up for ridiculing by having their name exposed on a bulletin board or via e-mail for everyone in the company to view."
bad,"Before At&t took over BellSouth, it was the greatest place in the world to work. But when At&t took over in 2007, the company became a hostile environment. Employees that exemplified Customer First were let go. For those who remained, the pressure to perform was constantly pushed until the office was closed. We were a team before that and supported each other in our day to day jobs. Afterwards, there was no team spirit or support from management."
bad,Typical work day starts with little time to prepare to leave the shop. Then you are at the mercy of AT&T gods to either accomplish an impossible one man job with little to no time or get a cancellation job that your manager will blame you for. Management in this career field is a joke. You will most likely have a manager that has no idea of what you do in your job and micro manage you to death.
bad,"I've worked for this company in many different capacities for 25 years. Unfortunately, the past five years there has been nothing but horrible executive decisions and constant lay-offs. I work non-stop, achieved some of the highest awards, but regardless still a target for surplus."
bad,"Management raises your goals so high you cant met, to fire you. not worth working here any longer. ATT is shady and add things behind customers back to jack up their bill"
bad,"The GM was terrible, was rude and never listened to anything we had to say regarding our concerns. The company kept switching and changing our commissions then would threaten us and take them away without ever trying to make compromise as why we were having issues at our locations."
bad,"Horrible chain of management. If the district managers boss is unhappy, the district manager is mad, which means there is always a conference call with the managers, then the managers are mad because they got yelled at, then it all comes down on the sales reps. Always feeling like your job is on the line even if you meet your goals. They are never happy."
bad,Bad union contact appendix e dont get paid what core makes 26hr ot 38 not fair when we change pairs climb poles repalce drops work on fiber. core has double time prem techs dont
bad,"Company has too many layoffs, not loyal to employees. There is no job security, they will layoff thousands of well trained employees, then turn around and hire college grads the following month."
bad,Stressful. No loyalty to tenured employees. No opportunity for advancement. No support from company to improve on policies and procedures. Not provided to necessary tools to complete job function.
bad,AT&T is not focused on customers or employees. The main focus of this company is on how to make money for the CEO without regard to the family/work balance of the employees. We never know what time we have to start work or what time we will be done for the day. Getting equipment is like asking Congress to move mountains and the managers don't care about the employees any more than the execs do. It's sad that AT&T bought DTV and have ruined it's name and customer service by outsourcing the work to other countries that do not care about our customers.
bad,"I installed DirecTv and this company made my life miserable. Every day we would have a new set of rules, so we had no idea if we were telling customers correct info. They cut our pay every month and never gave us any reason why. Your whole job depends on the review customers leave from an automated phone call."
bad,When this was DIRECTV I loved the company. It was amazing. Now that AT&T took over it is ridiculous. The culture is horrible. they work you to the bone and dont pay you for all the work you are doing. they dont care about what is going on with you outside of work that may be affecting your job. the environment in the building is stress and more stress. they ride you hard about stats and performance but there really is no benefit to work that hard or perform well. Management couldn't care less about what is going on either. it is just really not a good place to work.
bad,"AT&T often chooses poor leadership within the retail environment. You're often coached to lie to customers and direct reports and act against the strict ethics it preaches. Retail managers are overworked and underpaid, though that seems quite typical of retail in general. They tout ""excellent"" benefits that diminish quarter to quarter. AT&T truly only cares about its margins and not about those employed to achieve the margins. If you decide to work for AT&T, learn to lie and be deceitful to everyone around you as it's the only way you'll get anywhere in the company."
bad,Management is very difficult to work with. Many supervisors make their employees quite uncomfortable in a plethora of ways. There were several problems with supervisors Singling out individuals and making inappropriate comments regarding the individual's performance or personal matters.
bad,"A typical day at att is walking in and management not asking how you are doing but how many sales you are going to get. Managers will tell you to hold the resolution hostage until you can sale the customer an additional service, even if the customer needs it or not.  It's a very stressful job."
bad,I worked for S4 Communications a 3rd party for ATT..and This was the most unprofessional Management job I've ever worked for..the upper management was poor
bad,"Horrible, clueless management. So out of touch with what the individual contributors do on a daily basis. Bellsouth was a great company to work for....AT&T is terrible. My benefits cost and deductible have ncreased tremendously since Bellsouth.  They cared about their emplpyees.  AT&T...take some lessons from  Bellsouth."
bad,"All this company cares about are the sales. Work/life balance is non-existent for managers. Company lays off employees without preparing them with enough time to make adjustments. The commission payout for sales reps are horrible. It's all about who you know and if you are on their ""Favorites"" list in order to obtain promotions. The health benefits were good. Only work for this company if you are coming out of school, be part-time and only use it as a stepping stool in your career."
bad,"This company was a great place to work for it, but know long time employees do not matter to this company. It is all about one thing and that is to get rid off people that has been there for a long time; and send the call center to other countries for less pay. They do not care about their customers ."
bad,"This company drains your soul. They start threatening you in training. (do this, this way or you will be promoted to customer) and other such threats. Once you start dispatching on installs they measure you on your efficiency and quality. The times they measure you against were created in ""lab"" type conditions where there are no obstacles impeding your work. You are required to continue working until all jobs are complete no matter what time of night. Sick days are allowed however if you are sick and have to call in you are written up for taking them."
bad,"A typical day at work involved calling people over the phone to offer them AT&T services. If they refused I had to proceed and assume the sale until they either hung up or requested to be put on the do not call list. I learned how to work around peoples objections however it was not very rewarding work knowing that I was offering them services that they did not want or need. Management was very scattered, the woman training us left half way through our 2 week training session, leaving us with a new trainer who taught us everything completely different from the first trainer. The hardest part of the job was definitely trying to keep customers on the phone after they learned that I was a telemarketer. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers."
bad,Workplace culture was very hostile and not healthy for any individual. Often long hours and being paid late or under paid. Management was nonsupporting and very unorganized.
bad,I worked there for one year.  Would only recommend them as a first job to get some experience.  Most people either quit or fired within 6 months.  Pay is low for the stress of the job.
bad,"The call center scene was a terrible one for me. Most of the managers were a joke. They never did what they were supposed to, often shoving it off on someone else and they always seemed burdened when asked for help."
bad,"Inconsistent management, managers don't know how your job is done but want more done in less time. Favoritism between techs and managers, jealousy from managers gets in the way of promotions. They have a very high turn over do to people quitting and terminations, yet claim they are trying to keep people."
bad,The job is simple because of the textbook training they provide and the call center script that helps get you through a call.  The union is a joke while the benefits were the best part of the job.  The high turnover rate was due to the strict policies that left no room for error such as a one year probation and if late once or called off once would result in a warning of dismissal.  It's not military or life-threatening everything goes through the flawed software that has to be updated within the limited amount of time provided if it wasn't a department escalation.  One manager in particular whom manages the system to ensure no one is ducking calls doesn't have a clue how flawed the software is. If a call is taken offline with a customer for a certain period of time would be perceived as a zero-tolerance violation and will subject you to termination.
bad,"The work itself is fine. Find challenges once in a while. Company culture revolves around leaders wanting to ""show off"" better numbers to each other at the expense of employees without regard for well-being and maintaining a professional environment."
bad,"I loved Directv, once ATT took over it was awful, really sad to see. "
bad,"I was terminated over something my manager instructed me to do.  It just wasn't a good experience at all. The break room sucked, its only about 40 representatives. I loved the money but AT&T doesn't care about you at all as an employee"
bad,"There is no work/life balance and compensation to the work is not realistic."
bad,"AT&T started off as a great company to work for until you realized the way they want their employees to manipulate the knowledge they had of a customer.  Using information gathered by employees about customers daily lives to manipulate a sale and leverage rewards and discounts to make sales seem more lucrative to customers."
bad,"Terrible work life balance,  unable to transfer locations if you move or your situation  changes. Forced to be a part of the CWA union which provides no extra benefits. Union and corporate work against each other and makes working unbearable."
bad,Work Life Balance-None.  Your family means nothing. No Advancement. They expect you to cheat customers to make your numbers. Reporting harassment only fuels them to retaliate.  This is a EVIL company. Go the other way.
bad,"they pay isn't great and full of politics if you aren't in the in crowd you'll never move up or succeed. one thing great is that you do receive discounts on services, but the awful part is that upper management will micro manage you and theres no pay off for the hard work no recognition at all."
bad,If you are in a location with a good team and management you will have a decent experience but the politics are ridiculous.
bad,"Highlights would vary, pending on the department you were assigned. Its all about the needs of the company.. But benefits are amazing and I feel blessed to have worked for this amazing company."
bad,I didn't like the management it wasn't a good system they neglected us from our pay it was a 3rd party vendor  an the care for the employees was terrible
bad,A sad tale of the takeover of Ma Bell and the erosion from a company committed to their customers as well as their employees to a monster  dedicated to wrenching benefits negotiated in good faith as greedily and as legally possible. It might seem that getting rid of union members just prior to or right after retirement eligibility would be business as usual these days but the loss of competent & capable employees carries its own cost as many of these displaced workers could still be providing that capable and intelligible assistance. The hardest part of the job was not being able to give less than one hundred percent to the customer and still meet performance parameters.
bad,"In my 1 year of work time at AT&T it went downhill very fast. You are constantly pushed and graded upon up selling products.  Also the stupid survey that customers grade you on is unfair, but God help you if you get less than extremely satisfied. manager that rarely returned you phone calls . A good old boy network that is allowed to operate unprofessionally. I was let go for performance standards which are hard to maintain at all times. I mentioned an employee to the manager that was being g violent, nothing was ever done. Like I said the good old boy network.  I'm not crying sour grapes I'm stating facts. They need to quit micro managing employees,  recognize the Veterans,  improve the life for their employees and you will see better job satisfaction.  Get better vehicles.  Alot of us were forced to drive vehicles with outdated license plates or no license plates. We told the manager and they told us nothing we could do to improve the situation."
bad,"The sales reps have the Union to back them on any HR issues or other work related issues. The management, not so much. The ASM team gets away with everything and coddled by the Area Manager, all while the store manager gets dumped on. They cannot keep store managers longer than 6 months and its a wonder why? HR, who says that they are there to help, does not. They are rude and nasty to store manager and only see things as one sided. Terrible company to work for!!!"
bad,"AT&T is very numbers-driven. They say they are not, but they truly are. The pay in the call center is minimal for the amount of hard-work the employees put in, and the pay in the store is a lot for the little amount of work for the employees. Also, the upper-management cannot be trusted, because they'll manipulate employees to do unethical things to boost numbers, which employees do because their management asked them, and then upper-management acts like they had no idea the employee performed such a task, and allows employees to take the heat for the unethical behavior of the management. It truly is an unethically-ran business."
bad,"I worked there for several years and I've never experienced anything quite like it."
bad,"My day started with opening the store, counting inventory and cash drawer. Once the store opened I worked alone until the next shift came in. I had no problem working alone and am an avid multitasker. "
bad,"Started out great the first few years working for them. The pay was good, great benefits, good upper management with great leadership skills, room for advancement. "
bad,"Work here at your own risk. Culture is plagued with racism, nepotism, sexism, and executive leadership ignorance. Work more earn less. Work harder more stress. Speak up get targeted. Watch coworkers drop like flies. Learn to kiss azz and tell lies. Only way to survive."
bad,"Does not treat employees fairly. Unethical, although not illegal practices. Poor compensation for work performed. Behind other companies on security practices."
bad,"You sell. They ask you to sell properly, which you should do, but then they allow those that lie to get good numbers to succeed. When people come and tell you that someone lied to them and you tell management, they show frustration, but don't follow it up due to them getting paid as well. This becomes agitating because you have to sift through a mountain of garbage each day because they allow this to happen."
bad,horrible work at home experience. There ending the program for work at home reps because att bought out the company. This is stressful if u get hired its only because people are quitting
bad,Not Happy at all. I worked for the company 15 years. I am now wanting to have something with stability. The company (AT&T is a great company to work for.
bad,Worked in the DSL department correcting orders and talking to customer concerning there needs. The company was great to work for .
bad,"Spent a life time working for a company  dont get hurt they will find a way to fire you they are uncocerned about you and only worried about the FCC fines and not taking care of there cables bandaid everything, telling you to create tickets for plant repair which never happens climbed the ladder for 17 years pay is good but you wont be happy and I would suggest finding a company with manager s that are compident, and know there job and yours, allways policeing you and complaining about numbers that you cant reach anyway, s poor company with no respect for employees."
bad,"This is one of the worse companies in the world to work for..."
bad,"on first job by 8am could be 10pm leaving last job. Never knowing when i was getting home.Loved my co-workers and teamwork. Technicians have had no raise in 6 years. loved meeting new people Best part about the job was my supervisor, Hands down the best boss in the world"
bad,Typical day starts with lots of work and pressure. Learned that management is not very friendly. They have sharp deadlines and if you do not catch up to the speed you are out of the company within few weeks
bad,"I would never know how many hours i would work in a day, anywhere from 6-15 hrs and only paid per job. i learned that Directv is a slave driving corporation. They only care about making money and not their employees. Management only concerns themselves with micro-manging every detail of their employees performance. Some of my coworkers where great and some not so much. The only good part of the job is I was outside and not stuck in a office."
bad,"Southwestern Bell was the greatest company in the world to work.  They grew into SBC and were still awesome.  When SBC finally bought at&t, they went to at&t best practices the nightmare began.  We went from absolute customer satisfaction, to not caring about customer at all.  If I had operated under the current direction of at&t when we were Southwestern Bell or SBC, I would have been terminated within a week for customer mistreat.  They are WAY TOO BIG and now with them buying Direct TV it is even worse.  They expect us to ""delight"" customers as long as you can cram products on the customer with absolutely no support after the sale.  It is a sad day for anyone who ever worked for the great company Southwestern Bell or SBC."
bad,"Sales rep. "
bad,This was so far the worst company I have ever worked for and the management style was the worst. Company treated you like a number and not a person.
bad,es una empresa sin estabilidad salarial y no hay incentivos para los empleados
bad,"If you value free time or spending time with your family, then this is not the career path for you. While the pay is good, it does not make up for the overwhelmingly negative aspects of the job."
bad,"Great company,  then upper management came and top producers left.  commissions went down the drain.  charge backs were common because the product did not work."
bad,"In a typical day, I would assist dozens of customers will various concerns, resolving the situations they brought to me in a timely and mutually beneficially manner."
bad,"long works hours, cannot count on commission because the goals change so often. no matter how hard you work or try it is never enough."
bad,"Worst experience of my life!  Company has no clue and the AT&T security system I was installing, is a total junk!  Company will lie to you about the benefits, then once you except the job and get started, it all changes.  There is no company handbook, so they make up the rules as they go.  They will waist 2 weeks of your life and send you to BFE on training that is a total waist of time!   Managers are clueless and only care about ""the numbers""  It's an easy job to get because they are so desperate to get people to do this job.  Trust me, take the alarm experience you have with other systems and go elsewhere.  Installations will take anywhere from 4 to 8 hours and that is normal.  Must customers don't want you in their house that long to install a ""wireless"" alarm system.  You always have issues with the installation...cameras, wireless issues, 3g issues, door lock issues, you name it.  Even my manager would tell me the system is junk.  AT&T is always changing things and doing new firmware/software updates to the system that just creates more problems.  Again, the system is just a nightmare!       "
bad,"This was the most anarchic, chaotic, messed-up, screwed-up disaster of a company I've ever worked at. There is no one in charge, no direction, no process, no one who has the slightest idea of what they are doing. They fill the offices with whatever sub-contractors will take a job for the least amount of pay, regardless of whether they can do anything or not. I now understand why their wireless customer support is so atrocious. AT&T embodies everything wrong with the tech market's indentured servitude. Anyone who dares to suggest that their lack of competence or intelligence is worth investigating, is ostracized and fired."

bad,Didn't like it and rather not wright about it. Most of the people who had the product didn't like at&t. Most hated bell south they did more harm than good.
bad,"Horrible company that cares only for the dollar, and considers employees dispensable."
bad,A typical day included knocking on roughly 50 to 60 in five or six hours trying to sell the DirecTV services while the other two to three hours were spent driving to various locations in our selling district
bad,"Boiler room environment, lack of ethics and integrity. Long hours, no customer support for clients, zero work life balance.  Intense 3 week training where you have to live on site."
bad,"AT&T U-Verse was a difficult customer service job. This job was about going door to door selling internet, cable, and phone service to customers. Also this was a commission job meaning if the employee sold the package then they get paid."
bad,great job with god benefits - not so good for a balanced work life.
bad,No clear communications from management as to expectations or duties.  Was forced to keep a desk in a different part of the building from the rest of my coworkers.
bad,Management is not what they appear to be.  They are all about stats and numbers when advising employees that it's about the customer experience.  Managers and employees have been terminated for stats.
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of receiving calls from directv customers for technical support, billing and, sales."
bad,"Schedule changes every four months; shift and days off.  Every broadcast dept except Sports Operations has 4x10 schedule.  Severe under staffing has lead to no lunch breaks, extreme workloads and high rate of outages, leading to suspensions without pay and terminations.  The department claims a lack of budget to add staffing, but they have money every year to host annual all expense paid 3-day hotel parties with celebrity guest speakers.  If you're seeing a Sports opening, it's to replace someone they just terminated or resigned because they could no longer take the abuse."
bad,"Do not do it to yourself. Period."
bad,"Long hours, low pay for the amount of work, very poor management."
bad,I would not recommend this company to anyone.  It is a very stressful position in that there is no job security and you are threatened with job ending on a day to day basis.
bad,Misery will fall upon you if you decide to ruin your life and work for this company in the sales department.
bad,"como experiencia fue buena ya que siempre se obtiene algo positivo de cada trabajo , pero lamentablemente el sueldo no era acorde a mis necesidades economicas"
bad,at&t went down hill when it was bought out by cingular wireless. They lost all of their value and good employees.
bad,"This use to be a great company to work for, then they took a drastic change in policy in order to have the ability to layoff and terminate employees. It's a highly stressfull enviornment to be in and every measure they take makes you fear for losing your job!"
bad,This place was a revolving door when I worked there. The managers were part of the problem.
bad,Fast paced environment
bad,"When I started 5 years ago was a great company , with changes to management , stress , no integrity , It has become a horrible place to work wouldnt recommend it to my worst enemy."
bad,"Nothing positive can come out of my experience with at&t. management was pretty much unprofessional. they want your metrics up, but are rarely flexible on schedule."
bad,"This company doesnt care about the individual, they just want you to produce ungodly numbers. if you dont meet your metrics they are quick to put you on discipline."
bad,"Horrible work environment. Kid manager they hired out of college and never climbed a pole in his life and telling the crew they are spending too much time on installs. They post for new techs ever 6 weeks because they can't keep people there. You will be working the worst hours once you are on your own, enjoy having NO life. Run like hell away from this job. It is not worth it."
bad,"Do not apply for this company for sales or any other position, you have no life whatsoever outside this place. In order to advance in the company you have to be an assistant manager, which is basically a personal assistant to the store manager, with horrible hours and no respect. They might as well be the rats for the company. The first thing they are told is to report back everything they hear on the sales floor. Everyone that I know is applying for a new job within six months or less or simply want to quit. They lost a lot of money trying to buy t-mobile and to make up for it they made the goals unobtainable, and you can't any commission. The overall moral of this company is beyond low. Don't do it to yourself. Find another place to work for!!"
bad,"The customers were fine, if demanding at times. Some customers were misled by the salespersons in the phone stores. I learned that AT&T is a sweatshop and that I really don't want to do business with them anymore. Some of my coworkers were nice and others were tragic."
bad,"Take back to back calls, you are constantly micromanaged with metrics. You have to meet goals. You are constantly coached on your performance, given notices. You're promised if you meet the metrics you will get bonuses, but the company works hard against you to make sure that doesn't happen. You get too many misdirect calls and it goes against You. Things like how long you stay on a call, trying to help your customer, you are only supposed to be on certain types of calls for a certain amount of time and if you go over that time, you are interfering with their metrics. It's insane! You go over one minute during your break and you get out of adherence and if you do that a couple of times, you are GONE! If a customer calls back within 30 days, even if it is something completely different from the call you handled, it goes against your metrics. Things that are out of your control, you are held accountable for. My co-workers are mainly union and if you do not want to be in the union, you are mainly snubbed. They are a bunch of liberals. I'm not. I'm surrounded by many of them and I feel the resentment. The hardest part is trying to meet the metrics. They give you 5 sick paid days, but if you do not get them approved by FLMA, (the govt), it's a mark against your adherence, and again if you get a few of those, you are Gone! In order for FLMA to approve anything, even if you go to the doctor, you would have to be about dead. The most enjoyable thing about the job is getting a paycheck."
bad,Training Instructors need training; Some don't know what they are talking about and some don't care about the trainee. Just cram the information down them and get them out to the work floor. Even if they don't make the grade. They ignore a trainee's request for additional help.
bad,"Perhaps outside of the call center AT&T may offer advancement opportunities however, within the call center environment there are no opportunities of any kind even when you have an MBA."
bad,unorganized company structure with uneducated and bad management.
bad,"I would say a typical day at work is very stressful. Office bulling is a very real thing..and when you have managers that are involved in the bulling, that adds up to a very stressful day at work. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the point system. Real life consist of 365 days..we where awarded 8 points (days) out of 365. All other centers are on a 12 points system. I will say the most enjoyable part of the day is going home."
bad,Very redundant. Management unprofessional and not very knowledgable. Little chance for advancement.
bad,"Management is horrid, policies are horrid. No support from management, and selling practices immorale. People running around with gongs, horns, and ""clappers"". Very unprofessional environment and employee moral very low. Temps in call centers are hot and not just from the callers. Rep grading systems are very unfair and reps are based upon these scores. Poor Training resources. Third world country - ish."
bad,"Not much to say, the wireless industry has grown so much that it's reached a point of muturity, and wireless companies dont have to pay like they use to. Now the message is sell more to make what you made last year."
bad,Too many calls from rude customers. No respect from managers. Bar is too high for customer service reps. Management sets unattainable goals.No compensation for hard work.
bad,Management is overbearing and extremely hard to work for. You must stand on your feet and if you have an illness you are sure to be terminated.
bad,"Fast pace and very open to change all the time, not very good with management communication with employees, change is always happening and sometimes never enough time to adapt to it"
bad,"When this place was still Cingular it was a nice place to work. After AT&T took over it was a steady decline into misery. Unrealistic stat requirements coupled with poor management. A recipe for unhappiness. There are still a few good people there but they are disappearing fast. If you need a job then go ahead and apply, but don't stop looking for something better."
bad,there was plenty of favoritism around the center- most managers were unprofessional and does not care about their team members except for themselves.
bad,Irt said one thing to get you in there and it's totally different when you are actually hired..
bad,Daily work consists of communicating with walkin customers and positioning AT&T products and services while meeting the companies daily and monthly goals. Assisting with troubleshooting of customers technical and billing issues on a daily basis.
bad,"I was responsible for taking inbound calls and turning those calls into sales opportunities. I learned that the pressures of being in a highly intense sales environment can taint the culture and integrity of a company. Management is not helpful with training unless your making the most money on your team. Your co-workers are too involved in making money to help their other teammates. The hardest part of the job is maintaining your job. The most enjoyable part of the job is the money, if you can make it."
bad,I left because they where trying to fire all wire techs and we did 80 percent of all the installations but we was paid less money barely time off and always threatened for our jobs
bad,Pay is good but you earn every penny. Horrible working conditions. Not enough training. Very high stress job. Bidding for shifts is a joke. Some managers care about you and others don’t know what they’re doing
bad,"If you are placed on a good team, you may have an amazing experience. Personally, I was placed on a team in which the members barely interacted with one another on a daily basis. From my first day until my last day at AT&T, no one on my team ever made the effort to get to know me a bit more. Everyone just sit at their usual spot, faced the wall, and silently did work. This was not a collaborative environment, nor was it an environment that enables an employee to deliver their best work. Furthermore, the physical workspace itself was not accommodating for success. Essentially, it felt like I was working in a dark basement with no windows for 40 hours a week."
bad,Never know when you’ll be next to lose your job. No room for advancement. Management are micro-managers. Would not recommend working for this company.
bad,"Springfield location was terrible johnathan is a awful person and racist. I do not recommend working at the Springfield location or any location that johnathan works at, he has a hatred toward minorities, some of the backfills are terrible people as well"
bad,I am not comfortable in suppling this information. Let's  leave it at that. I don't want to leave any more information than that. I am not happy that you make me fill this section out.
bad,"No possibility for advancement,  at least 4 immediate managers most with No experience in the field there supposed to manage, unrealistic job quotas for time and the worth of the employee measured by metrics not geared to truly evaluate work performance."
bad,AT&T says they care about their people but they are more interested in getting products out fast and they don't really care about their people.  They work them crazy hours even though it isn't the employees fault.  It is management that makes poor judgement and schedules.
bad,"Management is lousy and has no sense of urgency unless food is involved, to many pot lucks with people who can’t cook and don’t wash their hands or season their foods."
bad,You do not feel that you belong or that you matter to this company. You are overworked and underpaid and I never felt the support of the management and those who should be offering support.
bad,This is not your ordinary sales job it is stressful your have to ask for everything even going to restrooms you have to be watch at all times managers are there just to watch you dont help with anything but cash check do time editing only for people they want not a fair environment at all
bad,All you are is a number. The only thing that matters are your sales numbers. Although the pay and benefits are great it’s not worth the daily stress and micromanaging.
bad,Worst job I’ve ever had. The management doesn’t care about issues customers have or even care to help you resolve it. They only have one focus is forcing you to make sales so they can look good and in turn get a bonus. Management plays favorites more often then not. I was there for a year and it is absolutely the worst job I have ever worked at
bad,Not family oriented and zero tolerance for any attendance not covered   Missed a lot of family functions because flexibility is not an option.  Pay not so great anymore unless you was there before 2006
bad,HIGHLY STRESSFUL- doesn’t matter how good a job you do it’s never enough- there is no comparison to working for South Central Bell or BellSouth which were 2 Fantastic companies to work for.
bad,I was not happy with one of the lead and he try everything to make me look bad in front of management and lie many thing about me to make himself looks good.
bad,"We were told when we were hired that there was 5 years of work only to have funding pulled 7 months into the job. Whats even worse - is that I was given notice 2 weeks just before Christmas that my last day would be on the 31st."
bad,Management was terrible! Constantly looked to fire instead of Coach an individual so they could improve on themselves. High wages but not worth the job that you had to do. Only got 8 mins of bathroom time a day. Everything is monitored. Forced overtime 6-8 mos out of the year. Is not family oriented and could care less about customer care. ATT’s bottom line is profit year after year and they will walk over anyone to get that
bad,"The area managers act like little kids. Its always some type of drama, they force you to lie to your customers. They force overtime hours on you. This location is so unorganized. The rules and policies are constantly changing. And absolutely no job stability. I was absolutely miserable working there."
bad,"Poor management, not a place with a team mentality. It was an every man for themselves type of work environment. I am not a fan of sales with commissions and quotas."
bad,Working for this company was great until they hired new management In a company where I worked so hard to prove myself and got no recognition for it then after 3 years of working there to make matters worst I got laid off due to being accused of falsifying customer information as management you do not work as close with the customers as the representatives my DOS did not care I would not encourage anyone to work here unless they change the higher upsabout me they make it seem like they care about their people but they don’t this company does not stand by what the promise is I’m disgusted with this company and the people who work for it I got let go like a piece of trash and no one did anything to the people who were actually doing the bad things.
bad,To many managers running scared trying to justify their existence each day. 3 managers for every sales rep. They are all terrified of losing their job every day so overcompensate for their lack of true leadership skills.
bad,One week they will work you to death and the next week it will be slow and they will send you home early. All the meanwhile they will tell you how bad you are doing and need to do a better job at everything. Unrealistic goals need to be obtained for them to leave you alone. No room for advancement. Favoritisms plays a factor. Overall wake up every morning dreading having to go to work.
bad,Micro mange. Get a raise every year not much like $.50 commissions gets lower every couple years rather then going up.  Retail hours and you likely have to work on weekends. Only decent thing is get alot of vacation. And paid holidays
bad,Managers are the worst. Instead of helping they just cause more problems. Very petty individuals and if they don’t like you they try to get you to quit. Micro manage everything the employees do.
bad,Stressful Stressful Stressful Micromanaging Stressful Stressful Can't do your job because of safety Customer service is terrible all you are is a number cut throat
bad,AT&T is a global entertainment company and not so much a communications company any longer.  This company has no right to call itself American any longer either.
bad,"Dirty business with them is a SCAM on consumer.You don't get paid for work while training 6 to 8 weeks. You get used as free labor by area manager. You are pushed to forge peoples names, hide what they are signing for or your job is threatened . Then they will give you jobs you cant make money on as a sub contractor when you refuse to be a dirt bag for them.."
bad,The management doesn't care about you. They literally tell you on a daily basis you're replaceable. The remind you every 10 min you are there to sell and they need #'s. Even if you hit numbers they put more pressure on you to make up for coworker's who are not meeting. Do not do this you are better than this.
bad,"Call Center job to begin with."
bad,Not recommended no work life balance.  Poor management.  Good luck trying to do your job with integrity.  Was told multiple times to lie to customers and punished for not doing it.
bad,"I was stupid and wasted 9-1/2 years here because the money and discounts are solid. "
bad,AT&T is a very unstable workplace. They will preach safety while blaming the employee for any accidents. They do not take employees for their word. Work days are unpredictable and there is little to no work/life balance
bad,"There is no room for growth. When you are in an area, you basically stay there or leave. Their Career Intelligence section is worthless and not very user friendly. Process is long and tedious."
bad,"The job itself is not hard but the managing culture is focused on numbers and quotas. That makes it hard to do a job and avoid discipline. Management is constanly on your back for everything. There is no sick days in my role, even though you have vacation and paid time off. So, actually you can not miss one day without applying for fmla. I would not recommend any job within at&t now. It's a stat and analytical driven culture with aggressive quotas. We all know how quotas work...."
bad,"My journey started in retail store sales environment where I primarily sold wireless and other At&T products. I eventually transitioned to the call center which was definitely a mistake due to management style and overall job pressures. Retentions was not bad but the tasks and duties were far too much, not to mention a ridiculous attendance point system. Were required to assist all departments  as a last resort to save customers. I eventually quit due to the stress and constant coaching and was even denied my final commission for the second time! At&T is definitely good for people who like to be micromanaged."
bad,"This is a typical retail sales position with unrealistic expectations on how to handle clients who are unhappy with their service. Management is non existent. You are expected to sell everyone on everything regardless of their needs. You must stand the entire shift unless during breaks. If you plan to work here, plan on missing weekend and holiday events with family. Working late hours and having a manager who is focused on the numbers not your quality of life."
bad,Upper management doesn’t communicate very well with the lower level mangers. Blame is placed before the facts  are gleaned. Always downsizing and you have to always be worried about getting a pink slip no matter what kind of job you’re doing.
bad,"The stress alone from the people there caused my health to go down, i had to go out on medical leave. The title is sales but 95% of the calls are issues ans the customers don't wanna be sold something else,when what they have don't work!"
bad,Manager lie and write  you up over anything unless your a tech that tell on other technicians . No room for advancement overly worked. Supervisor don’t answer phone and don’t know the job to help technicians training suck. AT&T infrastructures old and barely work depending on the location
bad,"Management lies to employees and play games with the employees to the point of Nashua!!! They change everything about the rules of your job on a constant basis, even when the hand book states something they twist the meaning to their advantage!!!"
bad,"id rather die than ever work for att. they don't care about anyone, just the stock price, it dictates ALL the actions the company takes. you are not a person, you are employee #1234. i worked 12 hour days six days a week, we had to... it was in our union contract. our site started at 65 techs, when i left there was 28, with no new hires planned only layoffs. the compensation was above average though..."
bad,"It's a game of favorites to get a promotion. You are not rated on your skills as heavily as you are on how much people like you. The job is not challenging, but be prepared to work a different schedule every week. You will be asked to stay extra if you work the evening shift on weekends and busy nights. Overall not a bad company to get your foot in the door and build your resume, but I wouldn't make a career out of it."
bad,They are changing the rules so much that's why I was let go I had to many violations. They dont really work hard to teach you if you mess up. They let u make the same mistake.
bad,"Don't meet your number, you're treated like dirt."
bad,Management sucks and you learn on your own. Good place to work if you are in college or living with your parents. Good if you trying to get experience for another job.
bad,When I started to work there it seemed like it had a lot of promise but after working there for more than a year they would change the payouts for bonuses for sales and constantly not pay you what you were owed
bad,Meetings every morning telling you how bad your numbers were and if they didn't improve you wouldn't be working here anymore.  There were days of long hours with a forced 17 hour minimum of overtime.  The workplace always felt like your next breath would get you terminated.  The overall work was not that difficult but dealing with management always kept you on edge because everybody was one step from being fired for some infraction of rules that you may or may not know about.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when I quit.
bad,"I was in charge of their stats, running team meetings ensuring my team was pumped to take phone calls. I was also to take phone calls 1 day a month to ensure that could do what they were doing."
bad,The company had major layoffs at the assistant manager level which I was one that got cut. There were employees that broke ethic rules and HR did nothing about it but yet punished/excused/fired other employees for petty things.  I was denied my time off with pay and was paid for the time I could not use because the company wanted me working because of my sales and good work ethics. Always getting my days off pulled from me never knowing the work schedule till last minute. The 5 years I worked for AT&T I only knew my work schedule 3 days in advance.  I gave up so much time for the company thinking it was a career because I was told such.  Certain people in the company are above the rules. Rules just do not apply to certain people.
bad,"AT&T does not offer any job security at all. They do not care about the employees or the customers. I would NOT recommend this employer for anyone. If you are looking for a long lasting job, this is not the place for you."
bad,Wasn't a great experience. People who were friends with the team leads usually did what they wanted when they wanted to while you were left to pick up the slack.
bad,"They use to be a good company.  I use to love my job. I was very good, my customers loved me and I loved them. I treated them like they were my family. It was good until new management came in, half of the people are looking for other jobs,  that just shows you how badly we were treated. At&t does not care about their employees or customers,  it's all about the money!! So sad"
bad,Unreal expectations for all staff in retail.  Customer care blames the store employee and sends problems to store instead of doing their job. Pay is good but micro management times 1000. Even as a top performer I finished each year in the top ten percent of sales performance in New England and the same as a manager. Still I was talked to and treated like I wasn’t performing. Nothing is ever good enough
bad,"No job security when management can be surplussed at any point. Worked for DirecTv for 12 years. Less than 1 year after ATT buyout they started ""surplussing"" (firing) employees."
bad,"Worst “corporate job” I have ever worked for. When you are hired on, you are no longer your own person. They own you until to leave. Everything is scripted, if you are in a call center. The landline side of the company makes more than the mobility side. Who still has house phones?! They could care less about their employees. No real opportunity to advance within the company."
bad,AT&T has so many rules to follow that it's hard to actually do the job sometimes. Managers only role is to find some small rule you may have overlooked and write you up. Terrible workplace environment. There is no communication between departments. Each department is working against the other instead of working together. Foreign call centers create bogus workorders because they have no idea how the systems work. I really could go on and on about this place.
bad,Unprofessional anyone can work there. Managers were sleeping with staff. Employees fighting in call center and outside. Very unprofessional environment.
bad,The culture is like an indentured servant. They feel because they pay you they should be able to do anything to you and treat you horrible. You could die there from the stress. Not to mention you can never get sick even with documentation. Its terrible. You will never ever see your family and they do not care about the customers or the employees.
bad,Very hard to advance in this company or simply do your job due to the intense amount of incompetence from all levels of leaderships. Be ready for exhaustive long work hours that extend into your weekend and sometimes your vacation. I cannot emphasize enough how INCOMPETENT upper leadership is!
bad,"Horable management, an atmosphere of lies, manager asked me on several occasions to lie to customers to make sells. You are just a replaceable number at this company"
bad,"Very unprofessional, impromptu twerk fess, lots of loud cursing, poor managers, some colleagues worked while since most congregated because the more calls they took that didn't result in a sale or resulted in a disconnect, the less money is they made. Also frequently knowingly cheated customers out of monies owed to them. Overcharged customers for even a year and would only give approximately three months refund when found out. Certainly not geared towards good customer service as portrayed. It was all about the numbers. Management encouraged deceit."
bad,"If you are looking for an employer that is fair, compromising, a pleasure to work for, has great benefits, work-life balance, ethical and trustworthy then look elsewhere because this is not the place for you. "
bad,Poor life/work balance. The amount of time and effort put in left little to no energy left for home life. Rare to be able to get home at a reasonable time for children and spouse. Acquired new skills for mechanical fiber splicing. Met new people and seen new places everyday. Hardest part is not seeing my family and being able to spend time with them.
bad,"To me AT&T will always be a very good service provider with good customer service, but they are one of the worst employers out there. The management is very bad and only cares about what will get them more money, not whats best for the customer."
bad,It’s sucks don’t come work for ATT unless you have a great management team go for it but if you don’t get ready for all your customer to come back confused not know what they just bought because you literally have to push directv down customer throats if a customer is not there to make the company money they don’t care about them.
bad,No work life balance what so ever. You get a horrible schedule especially if you have no seniority. You get benefits but you are away from home for over 12 hours a day. Plus mandatory meetings and black out periods that do not allow you to take vacations during the holidays. Commission and hourly pay is garbage considering what you do on a daily basis.
bad,don't get used to one manager they come and go. if you work in a high volume store you have the potential to make decent money. They change the pay scale often and can make it hard to reach all your monthly goals.
bad,"At&t is an ok place to work if you like to be micromanaged and always know that someone is watching literally every little thing you do. They also are known for not keeping promises that they promise their employees. It was all lies. The pay is good. Benefits are also good. you get a good amount of days off which is nice. For me, i loved my customers, if only i was left alone to do my job."
bad,They don't consider previous work experience you begin on the bottom level and the worst hours especially for a family.  There is no real way to advance and they have you peddle cell phones even when someone has died.  Horrible customer service and work place.
bad,"Instability due to reorgs, shifting leadership, surpluses etc. You’ll be moved into a role that doesn’t necessarily fit your skills or interests. Employees are seen as disposable resources. There’s very little opportunity for movement within the company or growth/learning. Toxic, negative culture, too many false promises from leadership about improvements that never come to fruition"
bad,"You make minium wage to sit around and sell phones and direct tv... Any upgrade or new activation on an account or direct tv sale you get the commisiom after 90 days so it takes like a year for commisions to be in every paycheck when you first start, bi weekly pay sucks..."
bad,I had contract role and it ended in 8 months. I never knew the whole time that why did they hire me. Big re-org was taking place. There was no interaction with other team members. There was not much work. No remote option.
bad,AT&T is an absolute horrible company to work for. I was laid off less than one year before my retirement so they could save some money! Thank you for nothing AT&T!!!!!!
bad,"If you ever have the opportunity to be hired by this repugnant corporation, do yourself and your family a favor:"
bad,"AT&T in my opinion really took advantage of the soft economy in 2009. The wages did not keep up with the industry and the unattainable goals they set were a joke. There was always constant pressure that you weren’t doing your job well enough no matter how hard you working. The company had many inter departments that created road blocks to getting the customer their service. We were measured as far as how well we completed jobs, but with so many order errors that were out of our control it was an unfair measurement. The attitude was oh well, better luck next month. You get a fair amount  of vacation and paid days off and a company vehicle but the pay is low and no room for advancement. Good luck if you decide to work there. I was a Prem Tech for 9 years."
bad,"I found AT&T to be a company that treats employees like numbers. They don't care about you or your family. They want you to be at their beck and call 24 hours a day. If you go against the grain, you become expendable. You are of no value. There was still a lot of blatant discrimination in the company.  Non-whites and females were overlooked quite a bit for promotions. Morale and job security became a thing of the past.  Some of the folk in upper management were terrible to work with because they were ego driven. I would never work for that company again. And, I would never have  suggest it as a good place to work."
bad,"As it was not a corporate store, the manager took way too many liberties with my scheduling and went as far as transferring me to another store miles away from my home with only very expensive public transit as a means for me to get to and from work. The manager was also very unscrupulous and encouraged me to omit information customers needed which went against core competencies from AT&T"
bad,"I do not recommend anyone to work for AT&T. There is no loyalty from this company. They will lay you off in a heart beat, you are nothing but a number. the only way to go anywhere is who you know. I tell people to run the other way. The pay is really good the stress is almost not worth it!! HORRIBLE PLACE TO WORK"
bad,"Not a good place to work, very stressful many sales calls per day often getting berated for performance even though you are at or trending 100% attainment with already unrealistic goals. Stay away unless you dont value your mental health."
bad,"I'm going on 9 years and would leave tomorrow if the opportunity arose. There is zero work life balance,att believes your job is your life. They consider 30 jobs a month productive but on average book over 100 a month to a tech. Micromanagement x10. Unrealistic numbers to meet in order to get a joke of a bonus. If you want to make decent money and that's all you care about then this is a great place to work."
bad,"I would not wish this on my worst enemy. They do not care about your success. You are a number. Regardless of you trying to better yourself and move up in the company, they do not care. Pay is alright if you enjoy living at work and not having any family or personal time. If you're married or have a significant other, bid them farewell."
bad,"ATT closes skilled customer service call centers to outsourced low skilled non English workers. Infrastructure is not maintained, telecommunications failing to meet expectations of customers."
bad,"It’s either hit or miss, but mostly miss. The cliques with management is horrible. You will be thinking back to high school and how it was a cake walk to the drama."
bad,"Do not trust AT&T.   HR will lie to you and the union will not fight for you. Their benefits are decent and they pay well, however this is not a company in which you can have a career. If you decide to work for them, it is a job only. Do not plan a future career with AT&T.  They have cut thousands of jobs since last year."
bad,"Working for this cesspool of a company is one of the worst decisions of my life. Everyone is job scared so its cutthroat, no set time off so if you're working that day dont make plans that night because you will probably still be working, every move you make you are being tracked, the money and benefits are good enough that once you are in it's hard to leave but for your own sanity it's best to look for employment elsewhere"
bad,"Loyal  experienced workers not appreciated. Rather pay out of the country workers who have no idea and  are not able to help customers,   They often up sell  to a customer  who has a  problem as required to and it makes the situation  worse. And a customer  is likely  to leave as no one  helped them. Pay people who  make more issues, let  good family's  lose jobs they are an asset to the company."
bad,"Company has no regard for you all they see is the bottom line. Employees are replaceable at the drop of a hat. Management does not have your back, the union does not have your back, and the company does not care about you."
bad,Management does what it wants and doesn't care about their employees.  On average I worked 60hrs a week and had min help lowering that hourly rate.  Besides the skills I learned on the job I would not recommend working in that position.
bad,"Benefits are ok, no overtime ever, minimum holidays, management changes every 3 months, layoffs every 4 months, impossible to plan long term. No accountability as managers are penalized for poor employee performance so managers lie on reviews regardless of how an employee works. Managers play favorites when promoting, skills and management ability mean nothing. Money is the bottom line and unless you are a senior vp there is zero chance you will benefit from making the company more money."
bad,"The executives have overspent and under delivered. Now it falls upon the lower level employees to pay for those spending habits. This comes from reduction in health benefits, bonuses, and pay. This is also done by pushing a reduction in employees called ""surplussing"", where employees are fired and their duties either absorbed by others or ""auto-mated"". Morale has fallen throughout the organization causing a severe gap in happiness."
bad,ATNT is good company. I had good time working there. Little unstructured but the there benefits are not that great. The do not give good package when they lay off people.
bad,"Horrible work life balance. Regardless of work ethic, poor management tries to push you out. Micromanaging trying to find anything to write you up about"
bad,"It’s a sweat shop boiler room. They will work you 13 hour days 6 to days a week. A manager once told us it’s  a burn out position and they do not expect a sales rep to last more than a year. If you don’t make the sales quota one month they will put you on a performance plan to fire you the next. I’ve even seen them just harass reps so bad that they will just quick. Do your self a favor and continue looking, you will end up regretting ever working for this company."
bad,"If you want to be overworked, thinking about your position at all times, if you will have a job tomorrow, or work with poor upper management.  This is the place for you.  The perks:  work from home (but I understand that is no longer, effective 2019), great bonus, vacation time (if you can find the time to take it), 401K match and pension."
bad,Worst company I've ever worked for. Would not recommend this company to anyone.  It's a monstrosity that only looks to continue to take over more and more company's.
bad,No room to advance. Repetitive work. No increase in wages in over 3 years. ATT always fighting the union for basic and decent working rights. Got layed off anyways.
bad,mngment was not as well equip to take on role and handle any situation professionally. I believe they can become one of the leaders in the industry if they have better trained mngnt and people skills.
bad,"Only pro to working here is pay even though I have heard that other companies such as, Verizon pay a lot more. Cons...where to begin?!? No life work balance at all whatsoever. It is required that you work every holiday except Christmas Day and Thanksgiving day and that means you work every single weekend Friday, Saturday and Sunday from about September through 1st of Feb no exceptions or you will get a write up. Also, no job security. If you aren’t one the top 50 sellers then you are disposable regardless of tenure. Long shifts working until 9pm during holidays and 8 pm during regular hours. Commission is paid once monthly and a customer must have acct for 6 months or greater for you to receive commission from the sale."
bad,"This job is so stressful. Management is very lazy, they never want to help. They make you feel less than a person, Mangement is very poor, And the people they put in high positions dont deserve to be in those positions.There is  lack of support, fast pace environment."
bad,Go anywhere else. The management is incredibly bad. They are extremely shady. There is a lot of fraud going on in all of the stores. Miserable time here. If you aren’t hitting their ridiculous numbers they pretty much hate fly and want you gone. So again save your time and just go somewhere else.
bad,"Full of metrics and they don't care how the work gets done, you are just a number and expendable. Managers lead from spreadsheets and have no idea and don't care what is really going on in the real world"
bad,"Being a premesis tech, the management were always micromanaging you, get yelled at by both the manager and then the customer, there was no winning with this company."
bad,AT&T has been going down hill for many years now. Now the only thing that matters to leadership is money. Good people have given their lives to AT&T only to be laid off because the company wanted to buy Time Warner and now it is broke.
bad,"This company refuses to negotiate with the union whenever possible. Raises are few and far between and have been nonexistant since last year. AT&T went and bought Time Warner and DirecTV and now is in a huge budget deficit, which it used as an excuse to layoff thousands of employees. At least the CEO and board members got their millions of bonuses though!"
bad,Lied too    was brought into be a manger was not given position. hours where horrible. I also hate writing reviews and would like to move on I only worked here 3 weeks
bad,"THIS COMPANY is a nightmare. They spend a lot of time training you to be safe and when you get to the field, YOU WILL BE penalized for being safe. Ignorant. IF you want to work with a foot on your neck all the time, this is the place for you. Uneducated and poorly trained managers. Unrealistic job expectations. Awful work culture. New employees are run off by the old-timers who look like they're in the bloods and the crips.This organization at the technician level is PURE hypocrisy. They tempt you with the benefits, but it's not worth the headache."
bad,I can't speak for other organizations but the one I worked for had zero leadership.  Fear of multiple layoffs yearly. Not even sure if install exists.  Only good thing about my experience is I was paid alright (not the best) 401K and health benefits.
bad,"very political"
bad,i worked at directv for 5 years and went through a byout with att and it was terrible. they made our lives miserable so we would leave because they didnt like our pension plans and big 401k that Directv had set us up with. once they could fire or make us quit they would hire new people at a much lower wage with little to no benefits and even worse they would sub contract most our work to foreign buisnesses.
bad,They use seniority system in everything so you can't take a vacation if someone else hired one day before you needs it. They gave decent training but you will only learn when you start working by yourself.
bad,"Not a good place, no time at home, never knowing when you will get off or what days you will work. Always asking more from you but not paying any more."
bad,"Needs work, supervisors are kinda helpful talk time is  ridiculous. And training was amazing no problems with getting into the job it’s workin with the lil time on the phone with each customer."
bad,"Worked in MyLogins department of IAM.  Boss was clueless on day to day and Lead, Clo, was completely useless...Organization needs people who can lead better and not just there for demographic reasons.  Leader needs to be more fair ro contractors, which he was not,."
bad,"Definitely not a healthy work environment , extremely unfair ,unethical work practices are the norm. Management is a joke favoritism is blatant. Horrible waste of time"
bad,"When I started on I heard it was a place to have a career and move laterally. In these past few years I have watched every year the company cut managers and even groups of front line employees."
bad,A typcial work day at ATT is very stressful. You have to adhere to a strict attendace policy as well as strict sales goals. I learned to be assertive on exactly what it is you expect out of the position you agree to take. Management is great on a professional level but due to policies put in place brutal on a professional level. The work culture went from being a great place to work to being a place you dread going into each day. The hardest part about the job is being flatout lied to and then it being made to seems as if it is regular business and policy. The most enjoyable part about the job is the lasting relationships you can build with other employees.
bad,"which partners with top tier pharmaceutical, medical device and biotechnology companies to develop and execute sales and marketing strategies that deliver. In this role, you'll be autonomous in your own territory promoting a well-known and well-respected asthma product for one of Syneos Health's long-term clients and most robust relationships"
bad,A typical day at work was checking all alarms that came in the previous day. Hardest part of the job would be the lack of training. Company needs to provide job security to employees.
bad,"I knew it sounded too good to be true."
bad,"I worked for this company for almost 6 years and it got worse every year. Eventually the culture turned in to a very cut throat environment. You will be required to sell things in an unethical way, meaning lying to customers to make the sale. Your manager will direct you to do things that you won't feel comfortable doing and you will be fired if you do not comply. You will be required to sell TV services which pretty much everyone hates and are nearly impossible to sell. The company cares about money and not about their employees. This job will tear you down mentally. They require 9.5-10 hours shifts each day."
bad,"No respect. No option for growth, regardless of experience. Very replaceable. Job was difficult due to difficult customers and lack of tools and assistance."
bad,I worked for Cingular Wireless and when AT&T took over i lost my job of 7 years. They terminated everyone without even offering us a position with them.
bad,No pot of gold at the end of the rainbow you can and will be terminated at any given time and they will let you know this.  Not enough job security on this job.
bad,"No one has a clue what they are doing. Trainers can’t teach what they do. The hours are awful. You have no clue when you are going home day after day. If they need to make cutbacks? Your hard work will mean nothing, no mater how many years."
bad,"There is no real possibility for advancement, managers are not qualified and don't know what they are doing. They hire you for customer service and, in reality, it is a sales position. They have unrealistic sales quotas to meet and the company doesn't care about their employees or their customers. The only thing AT&T cares about is the bottom line $$$$"
bad,It is NOT customer service this is a sale position. Its stressful and about the sales you make each day.  If you are true customer service person this is not the job for you. The turn over is high.
bad,Management EXTREMELY BAD. The managers really have no clue what the techs have too deal with on a daily bases and could care less.  They only care about NUMBERS.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working at AT&T if you have a family, especially small kids. They don't care about your family and basically want you to be 110% dedicated to them over any and everything else."
bad,"Without a doubt one of the worst places to work I've ever had the misfortune to be employed by. AT&T is run like a mafia through harassment and intimidation of their employees. At one point you would put up with it because at least the pay was good, but every year they change the commission structure. Every year they say it's not a pay cut and every single year it is."
bad,"Good money to sell, encouraged to sell unethically. Surveys heavily relied on for job security. Union dues paid on biweekly check but no union support"
bad,upper management encourages unethical behavior while preaching about ethics.  They award top performers for lying to customers because they don't care about anything but numbers.
bad,Run for your life. Worst position ever. Managers under incredible pressure and it reflects on employees. Hollywood and Pembroke Pines had 2 managers with serious stress related health conditions. A manager in his 30s had a stroke and another manager had a heart attack. We are brining attention to working conditions but please do due diligence before applying
bad,"If you like big companies than this is the place to work at.  Your skills will be waisted working at AT&T. If you are not in a director level or above you are a nobody but a worker Bee. AT&T does not innovate and all it does is react to the future.  No new technology and when they do try to catch up they get it wrong. "
bad,Overly stressful environment. They work you like a robot! They dont care if you have a family. The pay is great but thats about it! All the other stuff you have to worry about there doesnt make it worth it.
bad,There aren’t any promotions for wire technicians. AT&T is gettig rid of the service tech and facility tech titles. As a wire tech you are paid less for doing waaaay more work. The company doesn’t care about its employees and your manager will lie to you and make false promises. Avoid this place at all costs. I spent 7 years there and was happy the day I resigned
bad,The culture is horrendous you are always wondering when and if you are the next to be re-orged out of a job. This company was a great company to work for but leadership lacks the skill set to manage and develop people. It is a what have you done for me know culture. If you are not at the top of the rankings then you don't deserve to be there culture. I once had a DOS tell me if you are not cheating you are not trying. I looked at him and said you got to be kidding me is that how you want us to manage our employees to do the wrong things and blame them 3-6 months later for not doing it right or what should be expected.
bad,"This job was too stressful and very micromanaged.  You are expected to complete a two man job which may take more than the allotted time giving because each customer's house is different, but they expect the same if not shorter time to finish the work."
bad,Most of the people in the warehouse don't want to be there but where else can they go within the company when they are laying off so many? Stay away if you can!
bad,The management is extremely disorganized. The managers screwed up my schedule and made me use my earned vacation time to make up for it. This is just one example. I would not advise anyone to get excited about AT&T.
bad,"I don't actually want to write a review on this company,"
bad,I work in California and everyone who advanced has been let go. This company just gets worse each year and they are always about cutting corners with employees.
bad,"This company is 100% driven by its shareholders.  Literally every quarter there are extremely questionable measures taken to have 'the numbers' land where they need to be to drive the right $ to the shareholders."
bad,"Young employees with little to no work experience are likely to be excited to work there. The company is focused on filling part time roles, making it undesirable for a professional. Benefits for these employees are non-existent. As a manager, this makes it extremely difficult to find highly qualified and desirable candidates to fill vacant roles on your team. This in turn makes the role that much more difficult to execute a consistently high level."
bad,"It is pretty obvious that AT&T is not interested in their people anymore.  It's a complete bro's club and if you are not in the club, you are screwed."
bad,Its not what you know its who you know. Personal friendships can get you some positions over other well qualified canidates. Every employee is expendable.
bad,"The only reason anyone came into work was the team we had. Our team leads are true leaders. The people actually doing the work are relentlessly smart."
bad,"14 hour days, worked for MasTec. "
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this job to my worst enemy... This company only care about themselves. they keep adding job responsibilities to your title with no pay increase. currently we are doing the job of 3 techs and a inventory person with the pay of the lowest tech. They keep spending billions on acquiring new companies like DirecTV and Time Warner and adding new task to techs without pay. work life balance is non existing, you get to work a 8 am and get off whenever the work load is done for the day sometimes that 5pm, 7pm, 8pm, or sometimes your out til 10pm. if anything happens on the job it is always your fault no matter what it is always something you could have done differently, as far as moving up that does not exist no other department wants to hire tech they only look at us like sheep no matter what your previous experience is."
bad,"Being in a call center is stressful enough. I will admit that they do try and keep things positive inside the call center but the stress levels are just unreal. Stop and think of a moment, you are on the phone 8 hours daily, restroom breaks are frowned upon, the union isn't the stellar agency they profess to be, and absoutley NO ONE on the other end is calling you to tell just how great a service their telecommunications experinece is or has been."
bad,"Don't expect to last long here. That is unless you lie, cheat and steal from customers. It's expected and demanded. They just don't say it. The sales numbers are totally unrealistic unless you slam customers. If you don't, expect to be fired. AT&T has to pay for all the billions they've spent in the past few years some how... And it's not because customers are flocking to DirecTV. But that's all they care about. So good luck and if you're smart, try your luck being a cutthroat car salesman... It's more honorable than this gig."
bad,I worked hard was always on the top of the score card and yet I was never able to move up and people that didn't have my status moved up due to whom they knew
bad,"The hours are horrible and it is just SALES  no customer service. They want you to sale directv service on every call..if the customer says no you have you keep asking and keep asking..  If you are good at sales then this is for you but the moment you are good at sales and have a bad day or month you will get wrote up and walked out the door.. Also if the customer does not keep the service it goes against you which means you have to sale more to replace what you sold and the commission is much lower than it used to be. So in all honesty you are working for a DTV balloon that they will place on your desk when you sale a tv.  The management is horrible be prepared to have them pick through your call with a fine tooth comb, even if u followed all the steps something is going to be wrong. The schedule you will get when u first come is always going to be 1-10 and 11-8 on Saturday but be prepared to have one day thru the week and a Sunday off. All of the morning shifts will always go to the people who have been there longer.. keep in mind those employees have fmla so they never show up to work anyway. If you have a family this job is NOT for you!! They have an attendance point system which you only get 8 points max NO sick time. Also if you have a preexisting condition and you have to go to the hospital or I’d get call the ambulance for you.. Be prepared to accept a point. The PTO options are only available to use if they have time and most days that you want to take off they will block off so u can’t. Also the reason they are doing this hiring event blows because they have a very"
bad,It takes a toll on your mental and physical health to work there.  They treat you like you are a number and not a person.  Even health scares cause them zero concern.  I had to get a letter from my doctor because I used the restroom more than twice a day.  It is also a good old boys club.  Women will be harassed and not treated equally.
bad,"If you weren't a union steward the managers treated their techs horribly."
bad,Did not like it no work life balance. No career advancement and no real training. Never got paid for some overtime we had to do. Only my coworkers were a fun group.
bad,"The company has been quietly doing layoffs twice a year for the last 5 years. The CEO blows the T-Mobile deal costing the company over 8.75 Billion dollars and he keeps his job and others are shown the door for being loyal to a company that hasn't shown the same degree of loyalty. Now they have spent over 105 Billion to purchase Time Warner. How about investing in your dedicated employee's instead of buying your way to being bigger. The entire rank and file structure at the top should be replaced with ones who have actually built a company versus just riding the coat tail of the wireless industry. Work load has been placed on the unfortunate staff left behind in wake of the reduction of workforce. Management still gets their bonuses for doing less work while the workforce staff is being overworked. Personally, I would seek opportunities with other more stable companies than one like At&t."
bad,"Very stressful place to work, job was not hard.  Company made job hard to complete.  Many rules put in place unnecessarily and it made it almost impossible to complete all job functions"
bad,"*Workplace culture was great. I felt all opinions were respected."
bad,"surplus every 90 days. no compassion for employees, will snake you out of a job terrible place to work for, i wouldn't recommend this place for employment for my dog."
bad,Working for AT&T was new experience everyday. It was unorganized and there was very little direction for what we were doing. We had to work in extremely hot conditions.
bad,Not much good to say. Loved the discounts though. That was the best part of the job. This is good for military spouse that has benefits from the government.
bad,"I worked for att for 10 years, when I started the culture was great, there was little micromanagement, and it seemed as if I was a valued employee.  Around my 4th or 5th year everything went downhill.  The management were under strict orders to hover over employees, the compensation lessened and the work increased.  I didn't feel valued, I became a number to them not a human.  The opportunity for advancement lessened and the hours were ever increasing.  It wasn't always like this, but the cultured changed and the company became harder and harder to work for."
bad,ATT is a high stress fast paced company that relies on the lower management to make things work where the rubber meets the road. In the past 10-15 years I have noticed their commitment to quality service for their customers has taken a back seat to the bottom line. It has turned from a service company into a entertainment company and the service has shown that direction.
bad,"Stressful, childish, unorganized, not career advance, the management are clueless to how things are suppose to go. The company pays the managers more who all go out to the smoke deck."
bad,"demanding and stressful job. If you can not deal with the elements, this job is not for you. It's who you know to be given an opportunity for advancement"
bad,When I started working there four years ago it was a great place to work.  In the past 2 years a new CEO has made the company impossible to work for.  Many people have either been walked out the door for things not in there control or they have found jobs elsewhere.
bad,Was customer care but after 1 year they changed to sales and service cut out all commissions and forced all customers to be sold before fixing their issue.  Management was horrible.
bad,Unfair treatment of employees in Call Center.  It's a tough gig and any advancement you might entertain is always more of a popularity contest. I would never recommend this company to anyone. They will break you down and you will leave with only a shell of your former self.
bad,Terrible company to work for. They do not care about their employees and will work them to death for not enough money to survive on. There is no advancements available even though they will harp on it. This is just to get the managers numbers better. Plenty of times I would go into work at 7 in the morning and not get back to the office until 11 or later at night. Completely ridiculous.
bad,"The managers in the building are so focused on sales - adding a line to your service, direct tv is the biggest, internet as well.  They really dont worry about anything else other than sales.  Most times with billing issues that were legitimate, if over $25 your supervisor would not approve a credit for cust.  If the supervisors were not pressured so much by their managers for sales, it actually could be a great place to work.  the push for sales vs actually solving problems angers customers and probably hurts sales."
bad,"The company is compromise by poor management. The management usually promoted within, even the person doesn't have the right experience they will promote someone on friendship basis."
bad,"horrible place to work, to many managers and not keeping the teams in check always riding you about small things never anything positive to tell you about your performance no matter how hard you tried."
bad,"It was a good experience the owners were a little strict asked for a lot in places that could not meet sales, paying for parking was an everyday thing"
bad,AT&T is a very stressful company to work for that has so much micromanagement procedures it makes it very difficult to do your job.  Working with customers daily is the best part of the job if there wasn't so many added unnecessary steps to complete work.  Overly done safety culture that inhibits employees ability to do their work.
bad,"Been working with AT&T for almost a year and the reason I quit. Aside from being underpaid. It is very stressful dealing with stupid people who insist they are correct. In the first place, they are not reading the fine print. The management is poor and the only ones who are getting benefited are the ones on top. Btw, I have been a constant top performer, currently working in a Australian based company with a high pay"
bad,This is a non customer focused company compared to what it was when I first got hired on at BellSouth. I would not recommend this company to anyone based upon how I was treated and how customers are treated.
bad,Company changes directions every 3 months. Everyone is on the chopping block and there is absolutely zero stability. Numbers game is unrealistic. No where to advance to.
bad,"Managers actually caring about customers would be shocking. They enforce reps not to care about customers. Just make numbers and make them commission. Nothing about customer care is actually caring about the customer. Everyone has some form of FMLA whether it be depression, anxiety, migranes, etc. Worklife balance is non existent. If you need a job for a little while, grab it. If you like your long term health and sanity, don't. If you like lying to people, this job will be perfect for you!"
bad,"This place was stressful, disorganized and constantly changing to the point it was difficult to keep up with all the changes. They would change our work flow then give us a very short training, then expect us to be experts."
bad,"I most horrible job experience I have ever had, short staffed, 70 hr weeks, horrible management, horrible route management, stressful, cutthroat etc,."
bad,"I was advanced to Manager with promise of being put in a different position, they did what they said and sent me back as an installer due to cuts in workforce. Lied to, worked like a mule cow and just thrown to the side. I used to think Dish Network which has won the honor of being the worst company to work for was as bad as it gets! "
bad,"I was a contractor, not much to say. No benefits, no room for growth, no job stability, payment is low but job is easy even a monkey can do. good for students/elderly people to have a little pocket money"
bad,Best explanation I’ve got pure cancerous environment and the company has major problems retaining employees that aren’t idiots.  Everyone worth keeping eventually quits for a multitude of reasons.  Obvious reasons besides it’s a call center is management has no ability in managing the place and is a nightmare to work in as a result.  It’s AT&T purely a cut throat environment for customers and employees I wouldn’t say it’s the place for you unless being a sociopath is your thing and then if it is you’ll be amazing at it!
bad,AT&T was my first job in which I truly learned how to truly manage other and be self-sufficient and learn the in and out of the AT&T system and the policies and procedures. Although they didn’t provide opportunity to progress they did provide learning opportunity.
bad,"Management was awful, and  no one did anything about it. The entire company is a scam to sell Direct TV. The coworkers were good, but the management, the pay, and the job itself were awful."
bad,Worked here for 9 years and the salary was what kept me there. Other than that I would never recommend anyone work at ATT the company care very little about its customers and less about its employees
bad,"This is no longer the phone company that people wait in lines for years for the chance to work at like it was when our parents were young. If you hire in here with the expectation of being a company you can retire from, you will be disappointed. This company is about one thing and one thing only... Making Money for the share holders. It dose not care about its workers or customers. You are under a microscope from the day you get out of training until the day they lay you off. All the technicians are disgruntled and the management is always out to get you to meet their quota of monthly write ups."
bad,Everyone that I know at ATT either wants to quit or tolerates the place but hates it with a passion! ATT does not care about it's employees. They discipline you and make you fear them for missing one day or being late on time. There is no flexibility! ATT has really high demands and dogs you for not being perfect on every single call. It's way to stressful. The metrics are unrealistic and they demean their employees.
bad,I wouldn't return to AT&T if they Doubled my Salary and paid 100% of my healthcare. They Treat their employees like dirt and work you to death. I had management call less than 18 hours before start of next shift and expect me to be at work 3 hours earlier than scheduled time. When I questioned if I could I was informed it was an expectation and I would be subject to disciplinary action if I didn't. Corporate culture is cut throat. No way I would ever return.
bad,Poor workplace culture and stressful sales targets make this job one to avoid. Continued decline in pay structures and higher demand from your average work day. The management style is demanding and the company demands results whether they are attainable or not.
bad,"The turnover is high and AT&T only cares about the bottom line and treat their people horrible. Not a people company at all. Every since Bellsouth sold to AT&T, the company values went to the bottom. The customers are treated like unfair and the employees also."
bad,"You can expect to handle calls on your own, possibly receive help from your peers. If there are still seasoned agents you may luck up and get the customer taken care of, otherwise you will suffer on the call. Most managers are managers that were randomly found. They have no information on the job itself, they only have information that pertains to THEIR JOB. The workplace is hostile, and depending on who you kiss up to depends on if you get a good raise or not. The company at&t is a great company within itself. The call center that represents the company is what brings it down."
bad,"you work in a high pressure sales position and they expect for you to just be good at your job, if your're not perfect in 30 days, you no longer have a job."
bad,I love to work and work harder than anyone I have ever worked with. I love people and love challenges and love to healthy compete to achieve higher goals. ATT has gone a new direction in favor of outsource duties out of country and to sub vendors. Promotions come from mingling at outside groups rather than work ethic and success. I am just looking for a more stable company with a personal side.
bad,"I was out of the job for 7 months and applied out of desperation. I got the job, which was vital to my survival, but it was never intended to be a long term affair. I was open to staying longer than I did, however, the culture of ATT was not very desirable and I was lucky to find a job elsewhere after a few months."
bad,"good benefits bad salary, no room for advancement  would not recommend att as a career, it is just a job and they will surplus you at any time that benefits them"
bad,"Worked for DIRECTV until bought out by AT&T, then it became a stressful place to be; there were immediate layoffs with constant threats of more... The constant threat of code of conduct violations and holding people accountable for saving accounts when AT&T was providing account flipping became too much."
bad,"Horrible management"
bad,"The company is just frustrating to work for and doesn't seem listen to the people who actually do the field work. If you do the job with the quality and hard work the company trained you to do, you won't make your numbers for the month."
bad,Modern day slavery all day everyday. Disrespectful comments from management all day everyday. No compassion exhibited throughout the company all day everyday.
bad,"ATT is a terrible company to work for they are very unfair to all of there employees, ATT is not a friendly company to work for they don't care about there employees."
bad,This place doesn't want humans - they want robots - they do not care for their employees at. In the two years I worked there I personally had to have surgery and then my daughter was hospitalized for ten days and they were totally heartless during these times.
bad,Great pay but I don't believe they offer the same anymore. Now it is less pay and you have to make up for it in commissions. The stress level was high.
bad,The company wants the managers to work 60 plus hours a week but pay you less and expect you not to feel unappreciated and burned out.  The pay is not worth the time put in.
bad,"The work vs. personal life balance is very hard here, there is little room for mistake. The company believes they stand for family values, but that is not the case."
bad,No matter how much you do it is not good enough. They want what is best for the store and not the customer. The only motivation is your job being threatened.
bad,I was a store manager. I took over a dying outlet. Moved it to a better location and made it a top performer in the market. I was never off. I would get calls all the time. Constantly under fire by different levels of management. The pay was alright but the bonus structure was so convoluted you couldn't possible understand it. I would rather sell a kidney than work for AT&T again.
bad,"Horrible management.  No chances for advancements, work life is the priority and selling everything the company offers to every customer.   Micro-managed in the worst way.  Thank god their is a union to make sure bad management is kept in line.  Most of the managers are a bunch of raging idiots.  It is not the same company I started working for.  Sales objectives are almost impossible to meet."
bad,AT&T. used to be a fun and energetic to place to work but since the last director left its all about the numbers and sales..The moral is super low and it feels like they do not care about tenured reps any longer and that they are weeding us out to hire in lower paid employees
bad,The culture is totally depressing. No one wants tobe there. I have worked fast food jobs where the environment is much better. They expect you to work and never use your sick days even though they constantly mention it in the orientation and interview.
bad,"Jefe inmediato sin conocimiento del producto, muy desmotivante trabajar sin ambiente sano, sin apoyo del equipo y del líder."
bad,"unfavorable experience, with ATT, disorganized, lack of communication from corporate to workers after policy changes, uncooperative with union questionable practices."
bad,A typical day at work would be working long hours with management screaming at you all day.coworkers not talking to you and stealing each others sales.
bad,I spent close to 17yrs working at bellsouth and at&t. in that time I had eight 1st levels and five 2nd levels. the last 1st and 2nd level of my career were by far the worst managers I had ever had. showing favoritism and playing politics within the work group. I truly felt that I was working for a completely different company.
bad,The company moves so slowly it makes it impossible to get anything done.  A lot of time is wasted filling out forms and self-managing rather than focusing on our actual job functions.
bad,Responsible for millions of dollars in assets but bathroom breaks were monitored.  Very humiliating situation.  Clearly many different factions of very insecure people fighting over nothing.
bad,"There is Mandatory Overtime (10hrs) a week.  You can/ will be working from 730am till as late as 1am everyday till up to 50hrs possibly more. Management will write you up for every little thing from not sending one end of day email, not calling supervisor after running every test before moving to next step of install.  The managers mass blast email of employee's who do not have customers download and install Uverse app and login to it and they will write you up for it. Even though customer does not want to. Manager will have you sign up using customer info."
bad,"Directv did have a room with exercise equipment. Directv also have games like guitar hero."
bad,"Not for everyone. Work lots of late nights, have to hit sales goals or you get wrote up. You do get 50% off of your at&t bills if you have any of their services"
bad,Constant pressure on having the perfect call. Management give you constant negative feedback instead of looking for things you are doing right. Constantly holds your job over your head.
bad,"AT&T, although a stable company, is very strict and their managers are micro managers to the extreme. Most of the workers were miserable because not only did we have to deal with bullying managers, but with very angry customers on the phone. The pressure to upsell to Directv was too great and punishments and suspensions were handed out too easily."
bad,Horrible job horrible boss and unrealistic/unreasonable expectations for the sales staff. Constant pressure to sell goods and services that are unnecessary and very costly.
bad,"Horrible place to work and management is ridiculous. The hours and times of working changes monthly. Training is almost non-existent. Benefits are good, but getting time off is difficult."
bad,"The company is not employee friendly, training is poor and the job stability is not there, but the benefits are good. The company is not what it was 19 years ago when I hired on."
bad,The work atmosphere is as cancerous as you could ever imagine. Rampant backstabbing and double talking. They ask you to do dishonest things to customers while on the phones then punish you for it when you do
bad,"The culture has completely changed for the company. I would NOT recommend anyone to work in sales in this company. You will eventually not feel safe and secure with your job. When they are tired of you and want you out, they nik pick everything."
bad,Every metric is monitored and held to the highest possible standard and lowest possible number while requiring a high number of sales to accompany the customer service. Management focuses almost completely on numbers.
bad,"I learned about the mobile network, how to troubleshoot mobile devices both using network data and or OS related issues.  A environment where my quality customer service skills flourished."
bad,This is definitely not a good company to work for! The managers are so incompetent it doesn't make sense. My assistant manager can't even speak proper English. One day the company wants you to focus on WTR then next it's something else. The managers are never wrong so don't try to correct them. The work/life balance is nonexistent. You get treated like a two year old and constantly get coaching if you don't shove Directv and Digital Life down a customers throat. Horrible work ethics.
bad,"Starting @ DirecTV, I was very impressed and happy to be part of the team. Once AT&T took over it rapidly went downhill. If you like working for companies that say one thing and do another then AT&T is your brand. Oh, did I mention politics, politics, and more politics. You can be a great employee, but it won't matter. AT&T is a voracious blood sucker of the most vile sort. Thanks for the paid training that I'll go utilize at another company."
bad,"Work environment was stressful and upper management toxic. Disciplinary measures are inconsistent. If they get one idea that you are looking for a different job they immediately start treating you very differently. Management/employee relations were unprofessional and very unstable. I.E., Managers having inappropriate relationships with employees and dipping into the cash register for gas money. "
bad,"Very poor management, Benefits were good, Employees where very scared to say anything to management in fear of losing their jobs.  Moral was very low."
bad,"A typical day is being told that if you don't meet your numbers and stats that you could be fired, or if you don't sell Directv you will be fired. Depending on what team you are placed on at shift bid would depend on your manager, some are willing to work with you to improve, others only care about the top performers on their team in order to get their bonus and will not make an effort to help the others improve."
bad,"Highly Stressful job, Things changed constantly so if you are one who does not like, change this is not the job for you. Your job title and other responsibilities out weigh your income. Union not very strong when it comes to handling your job."
bad,The morning meetings consisted of how the techs needed to do a better job and there was always a shortage of supplies we needed to do the job in a satisfactory manner. Most guys were always grumpy from the way management addressed the techs.
bad,"Bait and switch on the job.  Got another manager who was a thug...couldnt take any time off without getting written up.  Treated like preschoolers."
bad,"Terrible environment not work friendly, Managers don't want you help you are hostile at any given time. The managers pick and choose who they confront about work ethics."
bad,"They do not show appreciation for the hard work that all their employees do. They have actually cut their pay. They also divided all employees, we are no longer able to closely with our technicians and have taken away certian priviliages that we have come accustomed to. As a dispatcher, i worked hand in hand with field supervisors and technicians. we are no longer able to do so."
bad,"the management staff was good,trainers have bad attitude,schedule with split shifts was not workable for me must sell on every call"
bad,Management let's certain employees  do what they want hard to believe but I was assaulted numerous times at work mostly verbally I'm not going to into full details everything is being 8nvetigatrd and the truth will soon be revealed about This specific building I worked in. First off you should learn how to treat a human  being I was treated worse that a dog at company I worked at for several years. A disgusting place to call a business I'm going to leave this here now. I'm not the first to all edge harassment from managers and coworkers either just terrible.
bad,"I worked there for almost 25 years. The morale is down, they don't take care of their employees and they work you to the core until you get burnt out. The managers are terrible and have no people skills to manage employees. My former boss was one of them...he couldn't even write an email without grammar and spelling errors."
bad,"none of the other reviews are the truth, training did not apply to any thing you will find on the job, the co-workers, some are helpful but they all are looking for a way to make them self look good, and there are not skills here that you can take to another place, I would not recommend this job. "
bad,"I came to work for this company, because I already knew a lot of people at AT&T.  Being bilingual in Florida - I saw this as an advantage, I was wrong.  Manager was a backwoods hick who hated Hispanics and other minorities.  Customers routinely came in and used racial slurs."
bad,"Compensation plan was unfavorably modified every year. More sales goals and stress for less pay. All services kept getting more expensive while our pay was remained stagnant. I witnessed people get laid off, only to see a similar position reintroduced for less pay. CEO makes over 30 million a year while sales consultants are stressed the funk out for scraps."
bad,The summary says it all.  The middle to upper management was extremely poor. This company sold out many of their stores I recently heard.  Not a surprise. They treated their people like garbage.
bad,If you are tech savy.  don't work in their call center.  They will hire you for what you know but will quickly tell you not to use your knowledge/experience or you will be in trouble.
bad,Commission changes too often. Upper management encourages shady sales and fake numbers. Company invest money into everything but employees. Make it as difficult as possible for you to make commission.
bad,I would get a check weekly for around $300 dollars but there would be deductions for stuff I was not aware of so I would usually only walk out with $100.
bad,"I worked at SBC prior to AT&T taking it over. It was a wonderful company CEO was great. He took care of his employees and respected them. Once AT&T took over it went down hill fast."
bad,Call centers suck and will suck the life out of you.  Graded on everything you do and can't life up to what is expected.  The company is a great company through its just the call center is hard to work for with the hours they require.
bad,This would be a great job if the management team fought for their employees rights! If you make a certain amount of money the company will not advance you to a higher position no matter how awesome of an employee you are!
bad,"AT&T is so money greedy and does not take care their current, loyal employees properly nor assist them in any way,"
bad,"The company paid well before contractors came into play. The new managers did whatever it took to win, even if it was not to have any integrity"
bad,This company is a joke! If you have any personal or family emergency they are not willing to work with you I was fired 3 hours after my aunt passed away. Also very dirty place people leave used tissue on the desk food whatever I got sick so many times working there. Everyday when I would leave I wanted to soak my hands in bleach thats how dirty it was.
bad,they tell you one thing for a scheldule then promise you they will resolve scheldule conflict then tell you they don't care try to stick you with a impossible scheldule to force you to quit
bad,"Having group meeting."
bad,Waking up at six to get to the warehouse and pick up equipment meant for the days use then going to the job site and using materials not supplied by the company yet still being charged for them.
bad,"AT&T is not a postive work environment. All work is geared toward making production to numbers and nothing more."
bad,"they were hard on you for the QA scores."
bad,"The only reason people work for corporate cell phone stores is because the pay is good for entry level positions. Also coworkers in each store tend to get along and have a good time when given the chance. That said, the management chain will micromanage and can get very degrading if every performance metric is not exceeding goal. Being good in 5 of 6 metrics does not mean you are off the hook.Your manager will ride your butt until they see great numbers because their manager is all over them and so it goes up the chain. Metrics change often along with the equipment you are selling and the tools to sell it. You must enjoy change and be adaptable. A bit of  overtime is usually mandatory and scheduling is done based on seniority. Getting a certain shift or day off is near impossible unless taken as a vacation or personal day. However those have to be scheduled by the 4th of the month before. Seriously you can not schedule a doctor's appointment or anything else unless its at least a month out. Bottom line is that this job is only good for a certain type of person and one who has no other options."
bad,"management is unfair, they dont care to help you. hours are awful. if you are hired on you will close every night for about the first 6 months you are there. training is brutal. travel is on you and they dont care about inclimate weather. you have to be in dallas if scheduled to be there"
bad,"This company is worse to it's employees than it is to their customers. RUN the other way if you get a call to work here."
bad,I start my day at 7:30 in the morning and have no clue when I will be home. you have to keep working until all jobs are out of the pool. a typical day as a technician will be 13 hours. All first line managers have never been a tech and don't know how to help except to write you up if you don't meet your numbers.  I have the best numbers in my shop and have been interviewed twice for management ultimately finding out the positions were already filled before I interviewed. The company is run by good old boys and hire there friends and not by who's most qualified. it is very hard to advance in AT&T. My co workers are angry all the time and there is very low morale in the work place. The hardest part of this job is not getting the opportunity for advancement and knowing that everyday you don't know what time you will be home to see your family. it is a requirement that you have to work 17 1/2 hours of overtime a week before you can say I don't want to work anymore. What I enjoy most is helping the customers and seeing the smile when you do a great job.
bad,"Never have I worked in a place that promotes lying and cheating so blatantly. If you happen to be one of the people who does the job legitimately, you'll never get promoted. The hours are terrible and the union that is ""there to help"" is utterly useless. Twice we've needed to strike and twice someone got their palm greased to keep it from happening. All that matters at the end of the day is you supervisor's numbers. They have no issue making you climb poles in the pouring rain while its pitch black, and once you climb down, they will write you up for working in an unsafe manner. Att has hired and fired more good people in short time than any other place Ive ever worked. This company is a joke. I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy."
bad,"I've read some reviews of this horrible place, and the ones that are all positive and great must be put up by some AT&T higher ups because no one I know who is not a manager absolutely hates it there. Heck, my manager hates it there. I never know what's going to be allowed or not allowed. Keeping your metrics right really interferes with helping the customer. I literally hung up on customers to keep my Average Handle Time low and it worked! My manager has told me to get customers off the phone if they've been on the phone for more than 10 minutes and tell them I'm doing research. Really, I'm either taking another call or taking a break. The head boss out there needs some toilet paper because he is full of it. My coworkers and I dream of quitting when we take our smoke breaks. And they look for any reason to fire you. Once you get disciplined once it's game over, because they'll look back in your records from a month ago before you even knew something wasn't allowed or something you agreed to fix before it was originally brought up. For example, I missed a call back because the callback tracker didn't remind me and I got a wrote up for it. The next week I they found out I missed a callback from a month prior and I got suspended for that. I hate this place and that's still not even the half of it. If you are desperate for work and are willing to be treated like less of a person then this might be the place for you. Otherwise avoid at all cost because it will be the worst experience of your life."
bad,"When I started AT&T I loved it! Great company and i was making 2200-2500$ comp checks per month, however they redid the comp plan and now i average 800-950$ comp checks and I'm the top performer in the location. I can't look for a new job fast enough and neither can my coworkers! Run! they promise the moon and there are ways to move up in the company but don't believe the lies. Moving up is almost near impossible because people transfer from all over the US and fill the spots. Not to mention the politics and stupidity that makes this company tick. Also if you want weekends off or any specific day. Good luck! Only the senior reps get a decent schedule."
bad,oversee 5 different store try to provide sales over sales each year. Bulid a team that can provide great customer service.
bad,"and as my first sells job this was a great learning experience, for many reasons other than one."
bad,"Horrible place to work. Non-stop calls, poor pay, poor hours, horrible management."
bad,AT&T is a progressive and innovative company offering a nice environment
bad,Loved working here at the itme I was a go getter and they rewarded such employees
bad,"Would rather not comment as this will be my last week with AT&T as they did not keep myself or some of my staff due to them downsizing and having our positions filled, yet between myself and my staff we had over 100 years of experience next to their current management staff."
bad,No true corporate policy enforced throughout company. Each office operates autonomously which is inefficient and promotes nepotism.
bad,"Poor leadership, mandatory overtime, split shifts constant pressure to sell......."
bad,"I can basically sum this up with several bullet points:"
bad,Terrible place to work. Typical day at work is you go in feeling good about yourself then management brings you down. All that I learned is what I taught myself. Co-workers are great because we all supported each other. The hardest part is trying to help a customer but the company had road blocks at every turn.  They didn't care about their customers. The most enjoyable was working with wonderful co-workers.
bad,"Lack of Management, training and Way to much GOSSIPING between Management and Co-Workers."
bad,"AT&T normal day consist of coming to work and expecting to hear how your boss got shredded by his boss. If you have a personal issue or something that is not in the norm, don't even apply. The managements job is to make sure numbers are met. Don't expect them to train you in your job, because they don't know it themselves. Most have never actually worked as a technician inside a home. In this office, expect to order the same supplies or tools 2-3 times. The reason for this is technicians will steal out of your bin and the managers will just tell you it happens all the time. Dont think you will be able to use your union rep either..because most of them have worked all together before. My recommendation to anyone trying to get a job as a u-verse technician...don't. The stress and the lies are not worth any pay they give you."
bad,The place has no job security and need to let at&t come in and take over.
bad,"(1) Herded off the lot by 8:15 AM. No exceptions. Get gone!"
bad,"The Job requires you to sell and sell and take no excuses and sell, management is a group of brothers but the rest are slaves. If you don't sell you will be asked to go to bootcamps, saturday morning meets and basically alienated till your gone. "
bad,"automatic dailer "
bad,"So everyday I get there on time, can't be early that's a violation. I boot up my computer to login and it takes forever, but even though my system isn't up, my phone better be ready to receive calls. I do this for about 2 hours and take a lunch leaving 5 hours left of non stop calls coming in. It's not even the customers, it's the policy and managers. Starting with the managers, some are awesome sauce, while some are... honestly I think their out to get us customer assistants. I've never seen so many people quit, or be fired in a 6 month period. Half of my training was on all the ways you can get fired. I knows it's their job, but it seems like they go out of their way to finds ways to belittle us. When it comes to policies, it's a nightmare. One day they want us to do one thing, the next day that thing can get you in trouble! It's insanity! There's no stability there at all, but it some how managers to stay afloat. This is only the very tip of the iceburg too. I'm looking for a better job so I can quit, but I might have to quit just for my health... Good luck to anyone who tries this job."
bad,"Micromanaging, extremely stressful, intimidation, harassment."
bad,"poorly managed, poorly paid, unappreciative leadership, proper yearly goals, objectives and reviews are secretly never really conducted, HR is useless and only assists management with sweeping issues under the rug"
bad,"Stressful"
bad,"Typical call center! It will make you hate coming to work, you will not receive any support, every one is out for themselves. It will turn you into a person that only cares about money and doing whatever it takes to get more money"
bad,Company never completes an idea before launching so there is constant failure.  Pay is constantly decreasing work load constantly increasing.
bad,Walking in different parts of the city for 8 hours going door to door.
bad,"This was my 2nd tenure with AT&T which lasted 2 years and it was not so great this time around.  The pay was below average for technical support and the scoring metrics were impossible to achieve which co-workers cheated the system and made it hard on honest and ethical workers like me."
bad,"A typical day at AT&T involved finding an ipad to clock in, reading over my monthly action plan, and hitting the sales floor for 9-10 hours. I learned to be patient and an active listener. Management basically sits behind you during your transactions with an ipad taking notes. If something on the action plan was not offered, there's a ding. Something is wrong when there are 12 reps and 5 managers. They expect you to do something that isn't possible. Sales goals are ridiculous but they don't seem to think so. They only want money, and don't care about the customers, though they make it seem like they are the main focus. I was told we were there to save them money, Wrong. Most of the coworkers were great. Some fished for the customers spending money though. The hardest part of the job was hitting the sales goals and being stressed out worrying about it. They most enjoyable parts were talking to coworkers, some customers, and clocking out. You will constantly get yelled at for things you can't control and still get in trouble for it. You only make money if you rip people off. Advancement is terrible, and I have a bachelors degree. I could go, but I wouldn't ever work for AT&T again in my entire life."
bad,no job security at any point with this company the hours are good and that's the only good thing I can say about this company
bad,"prefer not to respond, the hours are difficult, vacation is unavailable, stress load is high"
bad,I worked for CSR it was all about the numbers not the customers and when you are out for emergency medical they treat you like you are a total waste of time
bad,"Typical day started with managers coming into a meeting either crying or yelling at employees because of numbers. Then they hurry you out the door so you can get to first job of the day. You have to barter with other employees in the parking lot to get the stock you need to get the job done before you leave because you need it to work your day. You have unreasonable amounts of time to get jobs completed, and if you can't, you could be disciplined. The co-workers are all in the same situation and do the best they can to help. The hardest part of the job is dealing with unreasonable customers, hooking up systems you may not be familiar with. The most enjoyable part of the job is the paycheck because in most weeks you work 11 to 12 hours a day, and can see how much you've been taxed for working overtime."
bad,"Good pay, but everything else was horrible.  Management would constantly push you to lie to customers about their products.  Would not want to work there.  And actively try and avoid their products"
bad,I had to give this company 1 star because it was required. Do not work for this company...
bad,"had to go bankrupt because of unwarranted deductions from paychecks, forced to buy their switches, but if they go bad and another installer makes the service call, you have to pay for it-very unfair."
bad,The expectations of sales associates are often unreasonable and are consistently hightened. 
bad,"Management is horrible,and productivity targets are unrealistic"
bad,"A typical day at work started with counting the cash drawer for accuracy, verifying inventory of phones and pre-paid cards. Passing out phone plans and up-selling plans and phones."
bad,Not a fun place to work. You have to share desk and equipment is dirty and broken. more chat going on in chat rooms than answers for needed questions to help customers
bad,"I was their 16 years and it got worse every year. Executive Management doesn't have a clue what they are doing. Account Managers have 2,000 customers and no support yet they tell you all the time that ""the customer comes first"". It is a lie. Profits and their Union come first. They will set ridiculous, unrealistic expectations and once they have bled every ounce of energy and enthusiasm out of you they will let you go. Regardless of how much they spent to train you. It's a joke and a horrible place to work."
bad,"one of the largest and oldest multinational companies and they are a nightmare... they make billions in profits every year and are completely greedy and refuse to acknowledge that the people who are the backbone of the company and who have worked hard deserve anything in regards to proper pay, benefits, and basic human compassion! do not go to work for them period!"
bad,"I didn't the fact that it was a door to door position and that working late in the evenings until sun down, while knocking on doors at night, were very unproffessional. Was very much unaware of the commission, but the values of this business,, were very much strong."
bad,"AT&T is a very stressful company to work for. The metrics you need to make for a quarterly bonus the company itself makes impossible to meet, less than 5% of the employees make it. The company is not at all family friendly. I worked there for over 2.5 years and had to work every single Saturday although I was advised I would be off Saturdays after one year at the most."
bad,"Representatives are treated poorly in the call center. There is a lack of ownership from management staff and management is not held accountable for this. The focus for representatives is performance and never customer care. One will go in with an expectation of providing help and the expectation is to meet the numbers. This causes high stress especially when one can't get proper assistance from management staff. It is a gossipy environment from management down. You know the saying, when the head is sick the body will follow. Well that description was ment for the Little Rock Call Center. The managers that take ownership end up overworked and stressed out and usually are fired or resign."
bad,A typical day envolves getting dispatched andhoping the work order is in order. We techs can no longer access google maps from our ipads. Wouldnt it be great if we had Hagstrom paper maps?
bad,horrible place to work never had a job where I worried everyday if I would go in and still have a job also if ya start making to big of bonuses then you start seeing a lot of write ups
bad,"Make and received Inbound and outbound calls and instant chats to and from field technicians and managers. Control installation equipment and routes gave to all Techs in the southwest, southeast, and west locations. Also I obtain Status information from tech and Perform Routine Quality Checks."
bad,Feable place to work...
bad,"The people that I've talked to at Sun Technologies have such a thick Indian accent that I've inevitably always had to ask them to email me the information because I can NOT understand them. They've emailed me twice to get my work address. My WORK address, at the job they placed me in & pay me for. The very few times I have called them because I needed to speak with someone, I had to call 10 to 12 times before actually reaching anyone. This is probably because the turn over rate there seems to be so high that I have never spoken to the same person twice. There are no benefits. They don't offer any insurance at all. My address changed before the end of last year & I emailed my contact with the information. Come W2 time they STILL had not corrected it, so my tax forms were mailed to the wrong address. Over all, not a good experience."
bad,No room to be sick also don't use them as a job reference! You will have difficulties finding a job. Some management takes advantage of their travel arrangements to party when they should be working.
bad,Too much high school like atmosphere. No real breaks in between calls.
bad,"Worst place to work in, management is non-existent, I have to say the best part of working there were the customers (rare)."
bad,The hardest part of the job was that the
bad,it was really fun when I had started working for att. After a while they started making outrageous demands of sales. Managers were scared of their managers and so forth. Area Managers trying to use scare tactics to promote growth opposed to offering incentives. Dealing with irate customers all the time for the pay we got is not worth it. I would go home stressed from the long hours. They need to figure out how to make their workers happy opposed to viewing them as just a number on a desk. A number is just a number and wont go further than what is expected. The only good thing was the managers i had when i first started. they actually wanted us to succeed. They just want to sell and think that will make the customer happy. be pushy but not too pushy should be their motto!
bad,"After many years on the phones, I saw lots of negative changes at this place."
bad,"This is one of the most poorly run, unprofessional companies around. They don't care for their customers or the employees"
bad,"If you like intense, fasted paced work environment with little care for work life balance, Operations division out of Denver is the place for you. Lack of diversity is very evident, virtually no blacks or Hispanics and the gay population is oppressed. You must get into the inner-circle to achieve success. Compensation for Director and above is competitive - after three years of service an IC program kicks in. In some cases the field teams feel disenfranchised. Not yet a safe environment for those who want to speak out."
bad,"Halstead communications in Ballston spa,NY was a dangerous and very overworked work environment. this company had lost lawsuits in federal court about not paying their employees correctly and were required to issue back pay to employees (including myself)."
bad,This is not a place to cultivate talent or network. Definitely not a culture of success. Boasts a 30% turnover rate. Temporary employment fix at best.
bad,Management is concerned only with making numbers (sales). Customer service is non-existent. Supervisors make it known that they do not want to be bothered by taking a customer complaint or listening to their concerns.
bad,"I worked for this company for 10 1/2 years. I started when the company was Southwestern Bell, A wonderful company to work for. But when AT&T and Randal Stevenson the CEO of the company took over. It became a horrible place to work, the CEO is greedy. He makes sure he gets his $25m bonuse while the front line employees are struggleing to keep their jobs with unrealistic expectations. Sales rep make 60/40, they only get 100% of their pay if they make the unrealistic unatainable goals. I wouldn't send my worst enemy to this place to work. It is a greedy worthless company to work for, and yes they hate families. And they condition their managers to be the same way. AT&T went bankrupt and SBC had to help them out by merging with them and AT&T has been destroying the company since."
bad,"Att prioritizes profit over employees, efficiency over safety, and productivity over customer service.  Att will place minor incentives to get employees to generate share value while adding to employees work load"
bad,When I worked there .the handle time was good but the computer systems came out of the ark and always taking a long time to load systems making the handle time they set stupid and not workable. Supervisors were always on you back to keep handle time down more so than trying to keep customers happy
bad,The compensation is good compared to similar companies. The location close to home is desirable. The benefits package is good compared to other companies in the industry.
bad,They give you a decent salary to keep you with the company.  So that they don't have to train any new people.  I was only with the company for 1 year before they started downsizing.
bad,I worked there for over 12 years and it used to be a good place to work. I was diagnosed with MS 4 years ago and all they did after was harassed me and made me feel worthless. They have no idea how to treat people with respect nor reasonably accommodate people with disabilities. I would definitely not recommend them as a place to work.
bad,"Mucha competencia desde la entrevista, perecía que les ibas a quitar el empleo. No hay calor humano y solo quieren que te enfoques a el trabajo ( esclavitud moderna). El tiempo es oro, quieren que estés en el teléfono como máquina. "
bad,"Great money but not a lot of room for work/life balance. You will get benefits as well such as 401k, dental, vision, etc. & paid vacation time. Very sales oriented and a constantly changing/fast paced company."
bad,"Be careful working here. If you work hard and show initiative, management will make sure you never leave because their job is easier having you around. I've seen it happen over and over."
bad,Greedy company. Took all those tax breaks with the promise of creating jobs then turned around and laid off thousands in Georgia alone. Did not honor all provisions of contract.
bad,very little room for raise or advancement. you can't always get what you need to do your job and often work very late hours in the cold for very little money.
bad,te venden el trabajo como algo muy diferente a un call center por ser directo con la empresa pero es el PEOR call center en el que he trabajado
bad,Run far away if you value anything in your life. They only value what they can make from your hard work and how much of that they can keep for themselves.
bad,Horrible management. Inability to work with Union directives. Management in flexibility for personal needs any emergencies. Would not recommend to anyone.
bad,Job constantly being threatened by management very stressful job for the most part after 4 years there had a heart attack from all the stress and lack of activity sitting on the phone day in day out did take care of medical bills
bad,"As a tech I loved my job. I was asked to interview for a leadership position. Because of back door deals, I wasn't hired by the manager that wanted me. I ended up gettting a managment job for a diffrent manager than I interviewed for because they wanted to make sure a childhood best friend got the job. So they traded a few managers and worked out the deal. Because of that I would be treated  poorly over a 5 year period. Till they surplused me this year.  used to"
bad,"The job is extremely easy and the pay wasn't terrible. ($11.10/hour plus commission) Lots of bill pays and complaining customers, as AT&T constantly changes customers packages without telling them. Corporate had in-home sales going out to the homes of the contracts we had signed up people for and re-signing them with their own name, leaving us with a rolled back deal. Also, you don't receive your last commission check if you leave- they keep it. Would not recommend working for this corrupt company."
bad,"Micromanagement is a staple here. Clueless  managers who cant sell hound you to the point where the hardest part of the job is keeping your sanity. I love the job itself but everything else has me on the way out. No work life balance, if the schedule says 8-5 you work 730- whenever your manager sees fit. No overtime for working extremely long hours. the gulf states is a mess elsewhere maybe better"
bad,AT&T is a company that has lost its way their management chain from the CEO and cronies on the board of directors purchase companies and have no idea as to why they are purchasing them. Goodbye companies like DIRECTV and Time Warner it’s a tremendous amount I’ve dealt with milk for a strategy as to how to integrate into the current businesses  Career development is terrible and most people more hours. If you came a terrible place to work
bad,Prem tech and wire tech positions are the bottom.of the barrel. You 8am to whenever they say you can go home. Expect 1 man to do a 10 man job. Managemnet is horrible. I was with the company for 6 years. Was a great company at first but now its horrible. Glad i left
bad,This company will move you up fast but that's because they will also get rid of you fast. This is the only company I've seen where upper management can spend all day on their phones (not work related) and then they will gage your manager and sales skills based on your production numbers. They don't sit and talk with you. They will coach and make it scripted and not coach on a personal situational basis. I was a manager and when I did that I was told just to tell them to either sell or they can find another job. Not thinking that employees in commission jobs will try to sell but you can't always get the sale. Overall the company is a joke they will setup customers for bill issues and then not fix it even if its their fault. I had multiple arguments with customer care about crediting customers for bills on TV or phone or Internet that were messed up because of an ATT error and sometimes I never got them to credit it.
bad,Horrible turn over due to over worked personal. Union slow to represent paid workers. Training is very good. Managers don't help and just care about numbers.
bad,"Upper management came up with this policy where before you grabbed a phone out of the inventory room, you had ton speak with management and answer a list of questions about who the customer had for entertainment, where they worked, lifestyle questions, etc.  I felt like I had to get permission to go to the restrooms.  I had to leave because they took my power away, I became a robot.  I loved the company until they stripped my freedom from me."
bad,Work was stressful and didnt receive any assistance from upper management. Employees were dispensable. The data is monitored by a computer system that is flawed and no way to dispute it with a person.
bad,"They bring you in and essentially brainwash you into thinking you can become a rich salesman, but in reality you're walking door to door until 8 PM, even when it rains and snows. You are only paid commission and have to drive your own car every day to different neighborhoods. If you aren't making sales (which you won't, you'll just get a lot of doors slammed in your face), they convince you that it is because you aren't using the sales pitch properly, and if you want to make money you have to come in earlier (for no pay) and try harder. You end up working months for barely any money before you realize you're being used to make everyone above you money."
bad,The pay and benefits are great. This home/work life balance does not exists here. Mandatory overtime was required the entire 13 years I worked there. 10 plus hours per week. No matter what you accomplished it did not meet the expectations.
bad,To something they are experimenting with called Smart City but no concept of smart city. They could have a better future if their top leaders understand very well what is a smart city. They believe IoT will get their selling SIM cards.
bad,"Bad management, unprofessional, bad coworkers, recruiters lie about salary to get you there. Micromanagers and it’s favoritism. This place isthe worst"
bad,You will go to school and be told quality over quantity when you get to your work HQ it becomes quantity and quality or no job. The bosses will not fight for you even when your job is better then most.
bad,"You gain some.good skills but they are continuing downsizing.   It no longer matters on jib performance but location. They offer training but upper managemnt is not giving good direction of what areas to train in.  "
bad,"AT&T is a rudderless ship. Technicians are loaded up with more work than they complete in a day, and then managers complain about what did not get done. Management seems to adhere to ""The beatings will continue until moral improves"" mentality."
bad,No work life balance.  Schedule you 12 plus hours of work per day to perform in an 8 hour day.  Management is horrible and does not care about employees.  Company sets everyone up to fail.  Unbelievable how unorganized this company is and how screwed up for one of Americas largets and oldest employers.  I don't recommend working here.
bad,"This company used to advocate diversity and inclusion. professionism from employees and management. Managment had tirned in to greedy bullies who torment and terrorize their workers into performing. They overlook unethical practices om thier team to fatten their wallets.but when the employee gets caught,they will fire them and disgrace their name and reputation. Thewholcecenter is cli"
bad,"Worst company I have ever worked for. Do not recomend.  Terrible management and your a number to corporate. Any reason corporate wants and your out."
bad,"Not a good place For your future Bad management, supervisors"
bad,"Terrible work life. Absolutely zero consideration for job/life balance. Endless forced overtime, constant overbooking of the schedule with a 6/1 job/tech ratio. Threats and discipline for trying to leave work at your scheduled end time daily."
bad,I was hired with years of experience but was treated like dirt from day one. They just want 20 year olds to work there so they can treat them badly and fire them if goals aren't met. High turnover because if they dont like you then terminate you! It'sstressful
bad,"As a former prem tech the work culture was around metrics. Which is not good for customers. Company want you to just patch problem and not take time to fix issue permanently. Manager cram metrics and dont want to hear problems with job. (Attic crawl space, had to climb pole, had to locate pedestal, neighbors not home, there is a dog, etc.) Worked an average of about 45 hours per week. If you abput money go for it. But if you care about cusomers dont apply."
bad,"You're told that if you work hard and make good numbers, that opportunities will come your way. The problem is that your management group get bonuses based off your performance. They also control if you can be interviewed for other positions. Therefore, if you make good number, they keep you under the same position because you are helping them get their bonus."
bad,"Hired on with the assumption that there was good work to life ratio. Shortly found that there was forced OT. Personal and vacation days unless approved at the beginning of the year are denied June-August. The company was not reliable about training employees for their new policies and procedures that they would enact. Company did not provide complete tools for all employees, but all employees were held to the same standard. Cut insurance and benefits. Company also increased work load while keeping pay the same. Company is continuously laying people off. No job security."
bad,I'm not a fan work there for 6 years and it was a stressful thankless job that changed constantly. I ended up leaving because the company made it difficult to use my FMLA. After my ailing mother passed away AT&T status my file as no rehire which should be illegal.
bad,The company constantly changes what is and isn't gonna be the compensation method. It's never set in stone one month one thing is the big focus then the next month it means nothing. The company is way to focused on selling tv instead of selling a cellular service that people expect out of them. It's the biggest complaint I've heard from the customers of this company.
bad,rs are protected and cannot be touched for malpractice of sales. On numerous instances managers have thrown other employees under the bus to save thier job. my entire team went to the union tha tis supposed to protect us from these situations and the manager still is employed thier while a entire new team of sales men and women have been equipped.
bad,AT&T definitely does not care about anything going on outside of that call center. No doctors excuses are accepted. Vacation time doesn’t start until you hit 6 months and you’re lucky if PTO is even available for you to take off. If there are no hours available you’re out of luck. The point system is trash is definitely set up to weed out the people that aren’t willing to dedicate their entire existence to the company.  The money is okay but if you’re willing to just dedicate everything to this job definitely knock yourself out and apply
bad,"Area manager changes every 2/3 months, sale goals are created at a regional level and are unrealistic to the economy, pressured to sell customers products that don't fit their needs, basically told to give away the store if necessary to close a TV sale."
bad,"Management is incompetent and inconsistent.  AT&T has no long term focus at the retail level. We are not supposed to help the customer just sell them TV services... Customers stopped coming into store and are cancelling cable/satellite service by the millions (according to the public earnings release) and somehow that is a sales effort issue. How about trying to keep the customer with better pricing and no contracts... Sleazy sales tactics and lying to customers is not a long term growth strategy.  Was once told by a manager that I ""told the customer too much"" in regards to the FCC required discloser verbiage, FEDERALLY REQUIRED DISCLOSURE INFO...."
bad,"AT&Ts used to truly care about the customer and their employees.  However both are being outsourced dramatically (see IBM deal) to reduce cost and the quality has suffered.  The majority of time at work is spent tracking people’s time, furloughing contractors, cutting budgets, and planning for the next surplus.  Not only is this a dumpster fire of a company, but the products/services are significantly inferior and God help you if you have to figure out how to deal with customer service."
bad,"They bring you in with promises of working with you but do not work with you at all.  My time spent there was filled with 10 hour days not overtime pay, and continuous unfriendly time with managers"
bad,"it's a soul crushing slow death on a dead end road. People who have been with the company for 25 years might need to update their views and education about surviving in a digital world. This is the only place I've ever know that went from ""agile"" to waterfall because the directors didn't want to take a course or read a book on potentially better ways for employees to work."
bad,My manager was a nice guy but when you have to push certain products on every customer that walks thru the door whether they have a need or not you are monitored on every transaction.  Not a good environment.
bad,the pay was ok not great but the managers are willing to fabricate anything the get rid of a good employee. The coworkers are great by the way they don't care about you life
bad,The Company Goals from upper management is clear. There is no execution. There is no accountability in the Oklahoma City Retention office accept to cover their own. Nepotism is real in the office with no real chance of advancement unless you are a good ol boy. The Coursey organization is flawed and until change of management happens it will continue to be.
bad,Pésimo el sistema de evaluación del PIP el cual no es verdad que que es sistema de mejorar porque aún teniendo resultados de crecimiento lo ultilozan para dar de baja a personal eviten el hacer sentir el estrés laboral a los trabajadores durenate el mes que dura el sistema de evaluación de mejora y desde un inicio den la baja de los trabajadores.
bad,"Pésima participación de gerentes regionales y administrativos, RH, están todos coludidos para no hacer agradable la estancia en la empresa, se requiere llevarse muy bien con los de alto rango y aún así es gente que hace fraudes internos"
bad,"Keep your head down, work fast, getting rained on, walking through snow and mud, and still not meeting the impossible number metrics you will be rated on."
bad,"They only think of you as a paycheck and a number. They will legit need you dying in order to miss work. It’s such a horrible place to work. The only reason people tolerate it so much is because of the pay. That’s worth it. However, the management in the Amarillo probably makes the place about 20x worse than it really is."
bad,"AT&T is as corrupt as they come if youre really interested in customer service, please for the love of god go somewhere else. there are plenty of places to go other than that awful company."
bad,No acknowledgement or appreciation for previous experience. No advancement opportunity. No job security. Constant threat of lay offs. Management concerned with their numbers and not their employees. Worst culture with no team building activities and no teamwork. Worst employment i have ever put myself through.
bad,"A typical day at work was a regular nightmare. Customers are rude and aggressive, not to mention, entitled because of the way ATT structures discounts. "
bad,"Management forces you to work OT. For months I had to work Monday through Saturday for over 10 hours every day. You can’t miss work on Monday or you’ll get written up, even if you mother died or even if you are graveling ill"
bad,"Employees are always under the threat of lay off."
bad,"I wanted to get my foot in the door and the hiring manager gave that as a real possibility.  However, later I discovered that the contract I was under did NOT allow any transfer.  Some people decided to resign and apply for other positions."
bad,"the managers are blood thirsty, everyday is a new set of rules and tasks.  advancement as a black employee feels impossible. not working out for my best interest"
bad,"Management is terrible and you are on your own even though you are part of a team. Always waiting on tools and etc if you are new employee because of seniority, and still under enormous pressure to get job done."
bad,They did care about your family wants to work all the time some time no bresks sell dtv and we acphone store if you don’t sale tonyou want getvyour comm sometimes
bad,"If you decide to work here, be prepared for a ton of undue stress, unfit management, favoritism and a company that only cares about themselves. You will be forced to write your own annual reviews and then forced to explain them and why no matter what you write isn’t good enough. You’re just a number to them. They have their own agenda and they have zero problems with cutting whoever they want whenever they want. It’s a huge political game and if you don’t play the favoritism game you will be on the blacklist. Despite the company offering its own in-house training, they could care less what you do, the only opportunities for advancement lay in the hands of people sitting around in a room talking about who kissed their butts the most. Stay away. The money and benefits are decent but the environment is toxic, extremely stressful and is overall hardly worth it."
bad,"El ambie es muy bueno pero te prometen cosas antes de entrar de dan la mejor espectativa de la empresa el cual es un engaño te controlan hasta para ir al baño, por eso la gente no dura ni dos meses, contratan gente nueva que no tiene antigüedad para que conteste la encuentra de grey play to work y después los corren por cual quier cosas así que no se los recomiendo, si quieren prueben este trabajo y se darán cuenta de todo lo malo de att."
bad,"I got 1 day of training, and ended up working alone witbout a clue of what I was doing  always ended up calling a sister store for help, which took me for ever to help my customers."
bad,"AT&T may seem like a great place to work but frequent re-orgs as well as inexplicable relocation of entire orgs around the country leads to sudden layoffs or ""opportunities to move"" - in my 28 year tenure there I made it through organizational moves to Seattle and Atlanta but was finally surplussed when my entire team was sent to California.  Also, even though AT&T is a telecommunication company that touts their products as allowing people to do anything from anywhere, they are currently pulling all remote workers into offices.  I would steer clear."
bad,"Too much focus on 100% performance without the time frame to ensure that result. The job is straight forward, but the stress that management gets from their higher ups is pushed down to the lowest level."
bad,"Managers don’t go over anything when you first start, the training class only goes over the system. In other words here is an iPad and here is a website..........figure it out and in 3 months you don’t have it figured out we are going to write you up for not doing what we expect you too."
bad,Wouldn’t recommend working there. You don’t get paid for the work you put in. The pay isn’t equal across the board. Some technicians are certified to do more and get paid the same.
bad,"AT&T was great at the beginning, before they started buying Time Warner and DTV. Now they only care about downsizing workforce and cutting benefits. Managers have a secrecy among them and they think employees dont know whats being set or planned behind doors."
bad,AT&T does not care about their employees. They will dump you as soon as they don't need you. No attempt to move you to another position. Don't plan to make this a long term employer.
bad,Don’t  know what happen used to be a great company years ago Union is not worth anything waste of money they want you to say are too much stuff but do not want  to pay better for selling a lot of stuff . Just profit for the company Etc!
bad,"Bad environment, management always looking to cut costs,  sales bids projects below cost for revenue targets but will make it up by volume and cutting operational costs, everyone at the top gets bonuses and the surfs are left to clean up the mess."
bad,"Constant change in management. Every manager has a different rule they implement. Upper management encourages fraud on customer accounts.  AT&T only cares about direct tv sales, even though direct tv does not have competitive pricing vs other cable companies."
bad,"AT&T is built on the backs of premise technicians who are paid very little, over worked, and constantly reminded that they are replaceable. There is little to no respect for an employees life outside of the company. Management pits workers against each other on a daily basis. A culture of stress and disrespect is present at all times."
bad,good company to work for if you are in the right channel.  The retail channel is not the place to be for experienced professionals.  I worked many years on the business side
bad,Just a real bad place to work. It is a very toxic environment. Never know when the work day was over. Load balancing was terrible. Company focuses on money over employees or customers.
bad,"Made many great colleagues along the way and learned from all of them. Unfortunately like so many others, I was laid off due to no fault of my own. Company seems to be in a state of turmoil."
bad,"The job pays well, but the job is very stressful. The management is big on sales. You have to multitask and be able to keep a good tone. Overall, an ok company."
bad,The only thing AT$T cares about is money.  Upper management will spend millions on CODE training and then go against the training.  They lie to customers and employees.
bad,"150 characters isn’t enough to explain to you why you should run from this place."
bad,It's all about how well you get along with your leadership. There are talks about people and employee being the top priority but in real life that's not the case.
bad,"Selling a satellite dish to cord cutters, xfinity lifers and people who have had DirecTV before and complained about it the whole time, is terrible for anyone either new to sales or old to it. They promised a hourly wage, but after that you have to pay them back!"
bad,"Firing someone with 20+ years of experience, to only be replaced by some young kid off the street with only a high school diploma. Cuts in benefits and retirement."
bad,"Job security is non-existent.  "
bad,Past 5 years have had multiple layoffs annually.  Management is on call 24/7 and averages 60 hour work weeks with no extra pay or incentive.  The company has become metric driven rather than customer driven which will eventually cause it to fail.
bad,I have given at&t many years of service with several late nights traveling from the early morning till late at night. there has been a change in the way the company feels about its management employees. you are just a number regardless of the add to the company.
bad,pitiful. shouldn’t of ruined directv an using these door to door reps lying to customers and putting them in contracts for a full 2 years with double the price of what they signed for
bad,"Job does not work around students, are not flexible with hours. Instead of teaching you and working with you they rather bash you and be little you. Job is also not understanding with personal reasons or working with days you can and cannot work."
bad,"I would advise against taking a job there. For one the stores are  becoming obsolete and Management is making harder to succeed and advance. My wife is an employee for six years, so I k ow first hand beside working there."
bad,Perfect job for someone who doesn't have kids and NEVER gets sick. Working for AT&T with no time off and not able to call in when necessary is extremely stressful. You get written up for taking time off WITH A DOCTOR'S NOTE. They actually told us in training that if you were in the hospital that you better roll your hospital bed in to work or get written up.
bad,This job is stressful due to the fact you can get fired for any little thing that comes down to compliance or anything for that matter.  AT&T at more work to your job title but keep you at the same pay by that I mean it will get rid of certain positions and push their work to your responsibilities and expect you to do it with an eight hour work day .You can get fired for the minimal thing for example not calling the customer to make sure everything goes OK out there insulation if you knew if you forgot it’s going to lead to termination
bad,Att was a good employer with the exception of contract negotiations and raises. Once Direct tv was purchased and added to the company Att has taken 12 steps backwards. Culture is too competitive between the 2 companies.
bad,Expect to work 6 days week. More the 75% of my crew are on write ups for one small thing or another it is a absolutely miserable place to work the pay is good but that is the only plus you will never know what time you will get off and there is zero room for advancement
bad,When I first started it was good place to work. When SBC management took over it was layoffs every 3 months and work began to be outsourced. They preach their workers are valuable until next cut comes.
bad,att is a tuff place to work they keep wanting us to do more without any pay increases management is ok and understanding of how hard a day can be id rather not say much
bad,"My manager and I disagreed because he was promoted for cutting corners and I have better work ethics than to cheat to get ahead.  "
bad,The training was good that's about it. The nesting manager is horrible. They think you can sell to somebody looking to check on they're bill. I would not recommend this job to anyone that has outside sales exp
bad,Assisted customers with issues with their cell phones. Set up new cell phone service and activated phones for the customer. Set up payment arrangements for customers. Enjoyed talking with the customers. Emphasis was more on selling something to the customers even when they called in for payment arrangements.
bad,"If you like to be treated like a dog, sometimes make good money on your commission one month and bad the next because of changing structures then this is the job for you. Management only cares about the numbers. Shove Directv down customers throat that are coming in just to upgrade their phones. Get asked why u didnt sell it even when they already have it. Insurance quotas are penalized even if the have it. Used to get paid at least 5% of accessories now its barely 2%. Always changing and not for the employees benefits."
bad,"It was stressful from the moment of arrival"
bad,No matter what you do if you dont get to the numbers you are disposable. There are certain emplyees that get better treatment and more coaching than others
bad,"Managers are obtuse about running a business, inept & obtuse, will abuse employees for their benefit. The benefits are great if the management will let you enjoy them"
bad,"Between the back and forth between poor union leadership, micromanagement from one of the current new braunfels managers, and the poor excuses that upper management gives us in regards to anything that we need to do our jobs correctly and right by the customer, these will truly be the reasons why I leave AT&T. I've given 9 years to this company and they cant seem to find a way to treat their employees right. I have never been treated so unequally in my entire life. They have contractors still doing our jobs, half of our work force is not trained on half of my skill set and yet they still get paid the SAME amount as me! If that isn't abuse, then i dont know what is. The benefits of half off everything AT&T and decent insurance is no longer outweighing the steady onset of reality that the company is going to continue to pile on job titles into our positions (prem techs) and NEVER offer any opportunity for growth, They have us where they want us. It's no longer what you know and how well you do your job in this company. It's who you nudged under the table long enough to get a pity management position. Which then you are ultimately pushed out of the position you were given because you never should have had it (ex seguin manager) You know who you are. There are genuinely great people working for this company, but as long as AT&T continues down this path of employee neglect and abuse, these people are going to walk out, or be trapped doing the job of 6 people with the least amount of pay in AT&T Field Operations History."
bad,Terrible company to work for. Pays well. Would not recommend to others for a work place. Only reason for staying is because of pay and benefits. Other than that would of quit years ago.
bad,Worst company i have ever worked for. Would never consider going back even if unemployed. Worst management support no opportunities for advancement. Do not apply
bad,"I would never recommend this position for someone who is passionate and driven in the job they do."
bad,"I was there for the start of Uverse  roll out .Also was previous AT&T employee for seventeen years they screwed me out of time bridge to start .They worked you 6 days a week 10 hours a day for  2 years to create a new customer base at 20 dollars an hour less than I was making. They lie to customers about there products just like commercial tell you."
bad,"I have 25 years in customer service and working for large companies.  I have never encountered a more poorly run facility.  If the position was strictly customer service it would not be so bad, the requirement to sell on every call even when the customer has no need for further service is a poor business model."
bad,"Worked for the company for many years before being terminated, my crimes were speaking out about managers lack of availability and showing my frustration. If you have a disagreement with managers you are retaliated against in short order. They claim this is against the company policy however good luck proving anything. The only upsides are the co workers, some of the most amazing people i have ever met work here. the pay was decent and the discounts offered were amazing. My mental health took a turn for the worst while working here."
bad,"It’s horrible company to work for, does customers wrong with slamming products they don’t need. Plus they force employees to try to slam products in a daily basis"
bad,"Worked with AT&T for 4 years and top performed as a sales rep and as an assistant store manager. Recognition was scarce and paled in comparison to the daily set backs caused by system issues, negative feedback and overall poor leadership that starts at the top."
bad,"Our managers are in calls daily explaining why they have not hit sales goals.  This stuff trickles down hill. Managers teach sales reps to commit fraud. Trick customers in to buying services they do not want or need."
bad,Management is horrible. Company is unethical towards customers and employees. Management is only concerned with making themselves look good to the next person above them. Most of the employees I know are on some type of medicine for stress and most have been through multiple marriages
bad,Management would encourage fraud to the point where your job would be threatened daily. Encouraged to swindle customers and force customers to buy products that weren't needed.
bad,"they spend thousands of dollars training you, but then they are on your back every second, they have about 10 charts every day that you have to review and make sure you are above 85% if not they fire you, but the problem is they don't coach you they just fire you for no reason another word they micromanage you, the union is a joke"
bad,"Working at AT&T was one of the biggest mistakes I ever made. It roped me into a pattern of doing sales and broke my spirit every day. If you're a high school dropout with no prospects, this is a pretty good job. It pays okay and it's not super hard, but you will be helping old people figure out their email at least 50% of the time and will have unreasonable, unqualified bosses at every turn. People will scream at you for not knowing their passwords or because phones aren't free anymore. What I should have done in hindsight if I wanted to work at AT&T is to apply for the management training course because I have multiple college degrees. Instead, I get there and I'm working for a know-nothing, spoiled child who had no business telling anyone there what to do. The hours are also lousy, you will have to work virtually every bad shift for at least a year due to the burnouts who have clung to life there who get to pick their schedules first. One of the worst things is how they push certain quotas on you like selling people phone insurance. If it literally makes no sense whatsoever, you are still required to sell it to everyone and lie to them about it. It made me sick. They basically force you to take advantage of old people and poor people who buy a 20$ flip phone but you have to con them into buying 10$ a month phone insurance. And every time you rebel against that because someone definitely doesn't need it and is much better off without it, they talk you down and have humiliating ""coaching sessions"". Pathetic."
bad,"AT&T laid me off after the transfer from Direct TV"
bad,"Typical day at work... 6-8 hours of conference calls + 3-4 hours of emails & report writing."
bad,That is one of the most stressful jobs I have ever had. They have went to sales so the customer service isn't very good. They drive sales more than service if you do not meet their goals then they will find a way to get rid of you. Even with sales nothing is ever good enough.
bad,Difficult jobs did not receive more time for job completion.  Seasoned employees stopped accepting work after 8 hours. New employees had to complete the jobs for the day.
bad,There is never room for thinking outside the box.  You have to follow the guidelines to the letter even when you have an outside-the-box solution that could resolve the issue quicker.  AT&T Employees must live and breathe the AT&T culture and many people leave the company stating it felt more like a cult to work here than anything else.
bad,"Micro managed, number driven work environment. They care about the money not the employee or customer. Whatever gets the sell goes. If you have good morals this is not the job for you."
bad,"Worst experience on any professional level. Managers would play games with reps to pin one against another, not a team atmosphere . Managers harass reps, even fire them even if they do not have just cause. Truly a horrible place to work for, avoid at all costs"
bad,"The pay is great , but the level of support isn’t . Don’t do work with you . You are on a point system .. they work you ten times harder. They do provide a union"
bad,"worst company I ever worked for. I worked for Directv at first and AT&T bought out company, they did not give us much of a chance and started to lay off our department one by one."
bad,Horrible they ruined DIRECTV and kicked everyone who couldn't be placed under thumb. They kept problem people and let go the soul of what once was the best company ever...DIRECTV!!!
bad,"Abandon all hope, ye who enter. I have worked many jobs within both customer service and internal from department store, logistics, to software development -- this has been by far my worst experience. The general consensus is the pay is good, and you buy nice things to keep your sanity. Some people fit this mold, I do not. Best thing I could of done is leave. Last thing I heard is they are on strike?"
bad,"When I first worked for the company from 2007-2012, it was all about the customer. Raises where scheduled and the company seemed like it cared about the customers and its employees. Fast forward to 2017, and it's all about sales. They claim in training that they want you to resolve the customer's concern first then transition into sales, but that's totally not true. They only want the sale. My manager even told me that if the customer ain't buying get them off the phone. I could no longer work for such a company and I pity anyone with a conscious who does!"
bad,"At AT&T, you're a number not a name. The company used to be decent to work for. When the company purchased DirecTV that all changed.  They no longer cared about customer service and helping their customers, they only cared about cramming other products down their throats.  Explain to me, when a customer calls to save money - and they're already on the cheapest plan, and they dont have expendable income for a television product, how exactly its in their best interest to even try to sell them a television product?  AT&T doesnt care.  Their new focus is Sell, Sell, Sell.  You're better off selling used cars."
bad,I have worked for AT&T for about 9 months now and i have learned a few things. The biggest thing i learned is that management is everything. Management was awful there for so was the culture.
bad,No job security. Poor managment. Always fear of sending your job over seas. Stats are nearly unmeatable as you are compeating with centers over seas who hang up on customers to better their stats witch the company knows but refuses to do anything about.
bad,"Managers harass and mentally abuse workers and when reported nothing happens. I reported a fellow co-worker 5 times to 3 different managers and HR for harassment. They promoted him to a manager. He continued to harass, the company did nothing. "
bad,The pay is the only reason to stay.  They demand everything out of you and give nothing in return.  They do not value their customers or their employees just the bottom line.
bad,"in this position, you are considered the bottom of the barrel in the company and are easily replaceable. i was an employee who always tried to exceed the goals given and even though i would do it on a consistent basis it was still never enough. they make you learn new skills in order to replace splicers but don't wanna increase your pay. they're pretty much just cheap all around and don't know how to take care of their employees. they will make you break your backs for them without showing any appreciation for it. and the union doesn't help much either. all in all, i will only go back to att if I'm super desperate"
bad,There are much better jobs out there.  Wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone. Young people apply only. Under paid bad work life balance. Managers are a joke.
bad,"I signed up as a Business Assistant Manager with the promise that I could move up the business side of things. However, the manages in every single store were exceptionally lazy, and when i would try to tidy the stores up a bit, i would get written up for absolutely nothing. Things that weren't against any rule, or even ethically dislikable. This not only hampered my chances of being promoted, but eventually that didn't even matter as Business Assistant Manager position was being discontinued."
bad,"Worst work experience ever "
bad,"This company is the prime example of too many cooks in the kitchen,  numbers are all that matters at the expense of helping the customer.  Hours are 8am to at least 7."
bad,There is no work and home life balance  You are nothing but a number to the company.  Does not care about home life equal/  Benifits where good but they dont care about employees
bad,"Union job that doesn't protect the wire techs properly. Stuck doing others jobs because they didn't think it was in their job description. Long hours, decent pay but not for what it takes out of you physically and mentally."
bad,The work environment was awful. Co-workers constantly trying to steal commissions away. Management was no help. It was all about having high numbers at the end of each month and hitting your quota.
bad,"Jobs often lasted well into the evening with no manager support outside of office hours. It is difficult to balance work and family life as it is difficult to guess when one may be getting home in the evening. Techs cannot leave the installation site until a signal is reached, which sounds simple enough for the size of the company. But it never failed to take an additional 2+ hours to attain."
bad,No working adult can manage to live a decent life outside of Att. Terrible management. No room for growth. Company built on lies to customers and employees.
bad,"Every day is something different at AT&T. With a variety of different customers with different products and services, we deal with many different issues every day. We are forced to think on our toes and give the best personalized solutions to our customers. In this job, management is consistently cracking down on our performance, which is a true test of whether or not we are reaching for improvement."
bad,"Inbound call center for internet set up/problems. Union job so somewhat protected. Poor management in all areas. They subscribe to ""pass the buck"" rather than helping with problems"
bad,"When I started my Position at ATT I was super excited. I had no idea of what I was getting myself into. The job itself was super fun, Solve problems every day, Travel, Explore, Learn something new. Unfortunately the stress of the position out-ways the benefits."
bad,AT&T lacks strong leadership due to an antiquated work culture and a lack of competition in the marketplace.  Career advancement is based solely on relationships with executive management and factors little with performance and achievements.
bad,The hardest part of the job is that the company does not work with their employee schedules and is not flexible. There is nothing to enjoy about a job that will not work with their employees time.
bad,With strikes and lay off people quitting because of the environment. Not a happy place to work. The stress is too much I have gray hair in my 20's. Not a recommendation in my opinion
bad,Run away.  It's a stats driven environment that will wreck your life.  You will already be worried that you'll lose your job ever day.  Your income is based on other people's decisions.  If you don't have a soul and hate people then you'll do fine at this job.  If you want to be able to sleep at night I would suggest to find someone where else to work.
bad,Goal displacement good pay great benefits terrible management nepotism lets be honest they are terrible company with no ethics whatsoever keep your head down
bad,Working for AT&T was not a good experience. it felt as if I were held captive. No real opportunity for advancement. Worked every Saturday leaving very little family time.
bad,"The company formerly known as Directv was great to work for until AT&T bought them out. The changes made to management styles, wages, quality of work/life balance, and technician expectations were all pretty bad. The company took over Directv with the announcement that they were going to get rid of 50-80% of that workforce by 2020."
bad,"Horrible work home balance. Never a real schedule you start work at a scheduled time and can’t be a min late, but never know when you are going home. Can’t make plans to do anything after work.  Benefits are also getting worse year by year. Management believes everyone should be on some form of discipline. Everything is the techs fault including bad hardware  and updates to software."
bad,"Before 2006, AT&T was a fantastic place to work and was an honest Meritocracy."
bad,"If you are ok with forcing sales on people that aren't interested in extra products, don't mind being told customer service is costing the company money so stop and do nothing but sales then go for it....AT&T is nothing but a numbers game...transferring all the work overseas then when customers start complaining about it they bring some of it back but demand that you sale on every call and if you don't then they micromanage you to death.  Done customer service in another call center for 16 years and didn't have any were near the stress I had at AT&T."
bad,"Terrible long hours, give you ""paid time off"" but you can only use it when I get they say its ok. Management is incompetent to say the least. Absolutley zero work/life balance. If you want to be a robot and work 50+ hours a week, 6 days a week with erratic schedules and never see your family and constantly have your job threatened then this is the place for you."
bad,"Too much pressure to sell, not a family company. That is all i have to say about AT&T. It sucked working there. This website keeps making me enter more info in this box and i have nothing else to say"
bad,"My main concern about this place is that is very unhappy and you are told lies from the start, AT&T is probably a great company but this call center sucks really bad.. lack of communication, they are all unhappy"
bad,"I work at an authorized dealer store, Not corporate. I only worked there part time before i moved. long hours of standing up with no option to sit down"
bad,"This is a job where your encouraged to make sales at any cost.  The pay is good, but it's a high pressure position and is very stressful.  If you don't have a problem with high pressure sales and questionable practices it's a great job."
bad,"If management would communicate with their employees it would be great!  The amount of bulling and harassment from management is unreal.     "
bad,"We were under a lot of pressure to do what the policies of the month determined, while being confined to cubicles with no view. I felt stressed without real reason."
bad,"This company doesn't care about you unless you're doing something for them. You're hired for customer service but no matter how good your customer service number are if you don't make your ever increasing sales quotas you will be written up and fired, and sales quotas go up every month. You have metrics for everything and time is measured by seconds. You have a 935 second handle time per call and this includes your sales. You have to have a sale (TV, Internet and Voice add a line) daily or the next day mgmt listens to your calls. If you don't offer wired and wireless service on every call it's considered a no offer and you'll be fired. If you don't meet all your metrics, you will be fired. The benefits are great if you can tolerate the environment. Music is too loud and inappropriate. Mgrs are always screaming. Hard to stay focused. My recommendation: DON'T DO IT."
bad,"Good pay...but be prepared to deal with angry customers and zero support from management to resolve there issues. Calls typically go "
bad,Great compensation/benefits; no work/life balance; upward mobility; fast paced; co-workers enjoyable; poor management; learn a lot about technology; able to relocate
bad,They do not explain what the job intails.  Really bad schedules without real notice. Seniority runs the company. No room for advancement. Really bad management
bad,the company need to have the managers to get involve more with employyes to understand the work enviroment. I earn testing and how to write test cases for software and hardware. i enjoy because everyday i was doing something new.
bad,"att is a purely a money machine. if it doesnt make them money short term, then they want nothing to do with it. I have never seen so many miserable people and management in one place. Network side is depressing because all they talk about is inevitable layoffs. Place is a depressing plague"
bad,"Poor management, Stressful, horrible benefits, no bonuses, 0 incentive to want to work for the company. Forced overtime, no job security, your just a number,  significant pay cut with the DirecTV AT&T merge"
bad,Currently ATT isn't working with the communication union and are refusing to hire full time employees. We've gone on strike in the last year and it's really an unstable place to work right now especially if you need to provide for your family. Their comp plans dramatically changed to where it's hard to make a good commission.
bad,"In this company you are only a number and are expendable at any time. Managers are salary and are expected to work 6 days a week for a minimum of 65 hours. When it comes down to it, your boss will expect you to get things done at any cost and then throw you under the bus when it was their idea. This is a horrible company that repays dedication and ethics with reprimand and belittling. Don't work here."
bad,Att doesn’t care about you as a person. To them you are just a number to take calls and make sales goals they make nearly impossible to make. If there is a time where more people are making there numbers att changes and raises the goals so you don’t get paid as much. They fire people like crazy. The turn over rate there is insane! Wouldn’t recommend if you have a family because if your child gets sick good luck getting approved time off!
bad,Good Pay but the stress and treatment is not worth it. New people are quitting because it’s too much stress. You can not be late or sick or they will fire you. You will have high quotas and it’s impossible to meet everything they ask for.
bad,"Since the company filed for Bankruptcy the near the end of 2016. A lot of changes had happened in the chain of management as well as the pressure and benefits. The company recently Laid off a lot of their  employees to cut loses.You don't get credit for the hours you put in. They found a loophole in the system where they make you work 40-50 but only punch in 24-35. I enjoyed working with my co-workers but I absolutely hated the management and the way they underpay you."
bad,very stressful enviornment not friendly. I was able to sell so I was able to keep my job but most people do not last more than 6 months in these working conditions.
bad,"Racism, Retaliation, Harassment  bad place to work, no help in the company or the union, when they come to fire you if you are a person of color, you will find no help in the companr"
bad,"The job is very demanding, leadership is poor, atmosphere is very distracting. Loud and vulgar music played while on the phones with customers. You are trying to get sales but constrained to customer service time limits. Everything is a metric except how much toilet paper you use in the bathroom. The one and only redeeming quality of this job is the benefits. You get 50% off the service, upgrade and activation fees are waived. You have both short and long term benefits. 401k  Good health, vision and dental insurance and drug coverage, don't forget that because you will need it. Most of the tenured employees are medicated or alcoholics or both."
bad,"AT&T as a company is actually a great company but if you are in an area where only people in a fraternity or of people of the same ethnicity are the only people considered then you are forced to transfer to another market or find employment else where if you want to move up in the company.  I have worked in multiple markets and it was different from one to the other so this is isolated but the main reason I am leaving as I cannot relocate.  So because the company has no checks in balances on this, any area could be subject to this problem even though this problem is not everywhere."
bad,A lot of hours. No family life.  I left because they were targeting which is illegal but the company is so big they can do what they want. You walk around everyday wondering when am I going to get wrote up. Did the customer give me a 7 or 8 on a survey because if you don't get between 9-10 your getting wrote up. If you need a job for experience it's great but don't plan to stay long. Learn and keep it moving always look for something elsewhere
bad,AT&T management has disrupted what used to be a fun company to work for.  Hopefully things will rebound but it is isn't looking promising unfortunately.
bad,AT&T pays well but the stress is not worth it. You get about 5 call outs per year and if your child is sick they will still point you for missing a day even with a doctors excuse.
bad,"horrible company to keep your job at especially in sales.  they have the wort churn rate in that department and turn people over there all of the time.  I have seen people come and go often even though I was in the IT department.  I was laid off being in the IT department because I was the last one in CA and the company likes to keep they're employees in Texas, so if you live in Texas your job is probably safe."
bad,"People could be fired at the drop of a hat. There is no real concern for the customer, just for the call center statistics. I hope I never have to work at a job like this again."
bad,"Very stressful, management unknowledgeable, higher ups even worse. Customer is always right even when they are totally wrong. Was still top sales in my time with the company. Commission was decreased drastically in my time there. Got hurt, Union contract would only cover me for 6 months. Two surgeries later and 5 years Im still screwed. Yes i'm very salty."
bad,"Biggest gripe with this company is the schedule. It is done on seniority, therefore new employees get the rejected hours. You will close every night and work every Saturday night and Sunday open to close. Sales associates with seniority typically stay in their position, therefore the newest associates have a hard time moving up. I have a coworker who has three years with the company and has not moved up at all in terms of seniority. Work life balance does not exist with this company, therefore if you don't have a personal life, go for it."
bad,"no review,  I have seen too many cases of retaliation in the workplace.  Objectors or whistleblowers are placed inunbearable circumstances and usually crumble under unreasonable pressure and leave."
bad,This company lacks proper management. The current culture is do whatever is necessary to get ahead and look better than someone else. Management fraternizes a little too much with front line managers and employees.
bad,"Management is horrid, you work long hours and put in a lot of effort just to be told that you are not doing things fast enough. While at the same time they do not give you time to actually do your job correctly. The pay is terrible for the work that you do. There is absolutely ZERO advancement opportunities, unless you want to be management of the Premise Technicians.. If you are just looking for something to hold you over after getting laid off or something similar it could be a decent temporary job. Apart from the company side of things, it really gives you a great feeling to provide the services that you install and to see the smiles on their faces. Most of the customer base are very nice, and that is what really kept me at this job for the duration."
bad,I didn't have a great experience. Its very cutthroat. Managers will write you up for nonsense because they're getting pressured by their boss. Very demoralizing
bad,It was okay. The call center environment after the merger changed drastically......................................................................... it was time to move on. It wasn't productive to building a career there.
bad,Stressfull cut-throat company to work for. Always laying off. No work life balance. You are expected to get your work done no matter how heavy the load. Favoritism is big.
bad,"dtv was amazing - "
bad,"This company will sell you out at the first chance they get once you get into a pay scale where you are making more than management. Do not trust in this company at all, as it will ruin your life!"
bad,"If you get hurt on the job they will do their best to get you to quick, they have no respect for any of their employees. You have unrealistic expectations meet and the system is worked so that you are always not making on matrix if not all metrics."
bad,"Company only cares about the dollar today, it does not matter that most of the work force is well past retirement and cannot live forever, will someday sooner than later die.  The investment that the company makes in each employee is not took in to thought, when someone says lets cut this center it will save xxxxxx money.  they close that location, and ship the work over seas or just neglect the work all together."
bad,Worked as a technician and unfortunately excepted a promotion.  Second level was unrealistic with expectations and expected things he could not do himself.  You are expected to have no home life and always have your phone glued to your ear.  Rather than mentoring your technicians your second level expects you to discipline them all the time.  It was a joke of a job with too many cons to list.  There is a ton of change ahead and more people that will be out of a job.  Beware of a company that does not care about its employees but only its profit.
bad,This is by far one of the most demanding yet unfulfilling jobs ever.  The management does not support you nor stand beside you while the higher up sharks come in to devour you.  Stay far away.
bad,They do not offer a fair work/life balance. The monitoring is excessive and the manager/employee relationships are poor.
bad,"Very high turnover rates for employees, management is brutal, and in no way helpful, the union is only in it for what they can get, the hours are horrible, and the pay sucks"
bad,"AT&T is going through a lot of changes, and it is unsure what will happen to the department I used to work in.  The company's primary focus is on becoming an ""Entertainment"" company, and is trying to compete with the cable providers."
bad,Company released me based on their belief that their policy superceded state laws. Because of their size the lawsuit that was filed did not get ruled in my favor.
bad,"Sales reps are bargained employees so once seniority is gained, you have a pretty comfortable sales position. However, if you consider advancing your career, expect to put the company before all else. Even when otherwise is preached"
bad,"send me an email at leojohnson214 at g_mail and i can tell you alot more about your day.I absolutely loved my coworkers at this place. the comradery was commendable and amazing while it was Directv I used to love to get up in the morning knowing that today I was going to make someones day by either fixing or installing their equipment. after the takeover and the paycuts i found myself struggling to want to come to work. It all seemed pointless, there is no reason for me to hustle and earn my paycheck anymore."
bad,THE most dishonest company I have ever worked for. Dishonest from the top down. You are nothing more there than a contractor. You're actually better off being a contractor since benefits are constantly reducedand a Contract Company will at least try to place you. AT&T will simply lay off people working on their latest project when it comes online.
bad,"Great money but terrible bosses and work life balance. You start off the day by having to race to get the needed equipment out of storage and into your van while the management is barking for you to leave the parking lot no later than 8:20 or else you will be in disciplinary trouble. You encounter something new every time you get to an install and are  frowned upon and ridiculed for asking for help. The bosses seem more worried about your numbers in regards to time spent on the job compared to what a computer says the install time should take than the satisfaction of the customer or the quality of the job being done. You don't get to go home until you are done with the install or repair you are on so there is no fixed time you get off work. I usually worked 12 hours a day or more. The money was good, the days were extremely long and challenging, the management was poor."
bad,No room for advancement until around 15 years of service. Mostly outside work with too much pressure on productivity and no recognition of customer service.
bad,"Directv was a wonderful company to work for in every aspect. When AT&T took over everything changed for the negative. No more appreciation/perks for employees, constantly changing schedules and highly demanding schedules (working all weekends and evenings) providing no work/life balance and no accommodations for a life or school schedule. Highly demanding and stressful/strict expectations from management. It became all about making money for the company and they no longer cared for their employees or customers. They also began outsourcing many calls overseas which led to negative experiences for the customers. Directv was a company that I was proud to work for and I had no problems meeting their company expectations and was rewarded for a job well done. With AT&T I felt like I was treating like a machine and not a person and the moral dropped significantly for myself and other co-workers. I would  not recommend AT&T as an employer."
bad,"Management is terrible. They promote people with good sales to management and they are terrible with operations.  Schedule changed on a daily basis. Had to cancelled plans all the time. And because my manager said the magic words ""business needs,"" and the fact that I was the newest employee, I had to stay, no questions asked. They trained you to deceive people and make sales off of people's good will and common oversights. And they forced you to sell every single thing in the store to every single person, whether they were an 18 year old getting their very first phone, to a family of five to a widowed 85 year old grandmother. They had no shame, and if you didn't fall in line with that, like I refused to, then they treat you extremely poorly. It's a complete money grab. Making money off the backs of other people's good nature and trustworthiness. They live on a culture of lies to profit off of other people."
bad,"Hated working for AT&T, They bought and took over DirecTV which is who I became employed with first, and the changes that followed were horrific and unaccommodating to all the current employees. So much so that alot of the employees quit/resigned after AT&T started to implement their horrible plans, policies and rules."
bad,"Bloated, bureaucratic nightmare of a company which is only able to sustain itself by a combination of monopolies, lobbying, and buyouts of smaller companies. "
bad,"This is by far the cheapest company I have ever worked for. There are no added incentives, no company sponsored outside work activities, no morale. The attendance policy is beyond strict. I have perfect attendance, but management popped up at my Grandmothers wake service and funeral for verification. I thought this was grossly disrespectful. Every thing about this organization from its business practices to management is deceptive and unethical. The service is too expensive and does not work half the time"
bad,"Being a customer service representative at a call center in itself is a hard job, and I have no comparison for other companies except from what friends tell me. But it is a hard job and you are timed on everything you do, you have to upsell products even though you are not in the sales department, the customers are already upset at you when you answer the phone because they have been on hold already for 45 mins-1 hour. Then you find out that you cannot help them and have to transfer them to another department, which as it turns out they have already been transferred multiple times. Basically, I don't think AT&T had the correct procedures in place for transferring, the departments did not connect in customer notes so that billing saw different notes on the account than another department, which made it more time consuming to assist the customer. Bad communication, and over-exaggerated expectations for workers."
bad,"ATT pays you good money for the work they have you do but the management there is a nightmare to work under."
bad,"Great training, but once out in the field you are ALL ALONE.  very little help from supervisors because they dont have a clue how to do it cuz they go through the College Training program not the field tech training to help their hourly ppl when they struggle.  long hours, work EVERY HOLIDAY including Thanksgiving and CHRISTMAS with no sympathy."
bad,"No work life balance--the expectation is that you are willing to work 60+ hours per week and skip lunch."
bad,"This company is an okay place to work. the benefits are good, the pay is great, if you have any health problems the time off my not be covered and you may be let go."
bad,AT&T is a large corporation and behaves in such a manner.  People are numbers and there is a lack of leadership at all levels.
bad,"I worked in the photography department and at that time I was responsible for the entertainment department at times as well. My department was usually slow and transferring to a different department was always available. However, I enjoyed learning about cameras and the different technology."
bad,I worked there 12 years and management kept getting worse and worse pushing for more sales with no respect for the employees
bad,Horrible place to work. Constantly threatened as a new employee how you can be fired for this and for that! Way too many systems to work with which is not efficient. I worked at VZW for years until my center was closed and ATT could take lessons from the management there they are that bad at Att. Unless you know someone related to someone or kiss butt forget about advancement. Not enough training before you're thrown on the phones and expected to be perfect. As a new employee I was told I would be ignored if I asked for help. They expected you to figure it out on your own. No regards to the customers who wanted answers to their questions quickly and efficiently. They expected us to use their resources to get answers but their resources stunk! What did it for me was a customer called in asking for a courtesy credit for data overages. She got the text alerts letting her know she was over but at the same time was burrying her 3 year old daughter. She was a 10yr customer never late on payments and my manager said doesn't matter what was going on in her life she got the messages informing her she was going over she should have called or went online to change her plan! Made me sick and that was it for me with that company. I have never been so unhappy and miserable at any company I've ever worked with but this place was a living h**l and I had to force myself to go there every day! I cried day after day until I finally found another job and high tailed it out of there. There were 19 people in my training class several were also previous VZW employees. They all left along with others
bad,"horrible place to work. when you first start working there, you have to work EVERY WEEKEND NO MATTER WHAT. managers will do anything to make a sell, even if it means lying to customers then throwing employees until the bus later to save face."
bad,"*Management is inflexible"
bad,This place is extremely stressful. You are paid average pay but the expectations are extremely difficult to achieve. The managers for the most part focus on the negative.
bad,"During the short 3+ years I have been there, the job I was hired for changed from Advanced Tech Support (Tier 3), to a front-line customer service rep.  Benefits have been taken away, and attendance policies amended to be more strict.  The company as we know it has changed so much that many, many tenured employees are leaving the company after 10+ years."
bad,"Poorly managed division of ATT&T. The metrics are designed with a convenient excuse to dismiss any employees with out legal recourse. The system is not reliable, yet the management team insist on moving from a development and start up model to a sustainable business model. As a result of this mismanaged approach this division is loosing business as clients continue to loose confidence in the system and its abilities as stated by AT&T sales representatives."
bad,Good money after that nothing good to say about this company.   Take their training money while looking for a new job would be my advice.
bad,"Management did not offer any support to its incoming employees at all. Job was located in El Paso Tx. "
bad,A lot politicking. Seniority was also a problem and hindered advancement. It was easy for management to black ball you and hinder you from advancement.
bad,"Wasn't a pleasant environment to work in it was very hostile, employees didnt know from what day if they were going to be fired the mangement team made up guidelines as they see fit.  Very Poor management.......Employees feel bullied, High turnover rate"
bad,working for this company is like working for a slave driver. the company does not treat their sales employees good enough for what they do. I would never work for this company again!
bad,"Aside from the hourly wage you make AT&T is a terrible place to work.  I am a field employee and a union rep.  I have seen all manner of horrible treatment of employees.  In call centers, employees were being disciplined for taking more than 5 minutes of bathroom time a day, it got to point where employees actually had to urinate in their chairs to relieve themselves because the company would not let them use the bathroom.  In the field, employees providing the companies uverse service are haphazardly trained and let loose to wreak havoc on people's homes and businesses.  Then, after almost no training are disciplined for not knowing what their doing and fired based on an electronic numbers system that gives you the same amount of time for each job regardless of what the job entails.  This resulted in several lawsuits against AT&T for wrongful termination.  This company has so many contradicting policies that no matter what you do they can and will discipline you for simply trying to do your job.  If you have any other employment options I strongly advise against seeking employment here, unless of course you are ok with being treated like a piece of excrement on the bottom of at&ts shoe for a decent wage."
bad,"Hard job with no appreciation from management. Can make good money once you learn the ropes. But do not expect any support from your supervisors. At least not at the Ontario site. Co workers are great. Management is really, really, really bad."
bad,Managers are the worst I ever had as employee. I am glad that I finally out and found much better job and environment.
bad,Horrible experience!  Management was misaligned and unwilling to help attain goals or staff the store properly.
bad,I had the worst manager that I've ever had. He was very selfish and rude.
bad,"trabajar para esta en la parte de ventas, es muy engorroza, aqui en la ciudad es muy dificil, en otras provincias o zonas es mas facil, y llegar al objetivo que ellos solicitan, y eran donde yo hubiese comisionado era de 30 ventas, eran imposibles hacerlas."
bad,"My day would start by logging in, answering incoming calls, after 3 hrs, I did paperwork, follow ups on account problems. The afternoon was the same. Some days were split up for training and updating. My co workers were all supportive and we all worked as a team to reach our monthly goals. Some days were more stressful, esp. when new bills were sent and customers were irate about charges. I enjoyed going into work and seeing so many smiling faces everyday. The work was sometimes overwhelming but my supervisor and the whole team helped you get through the day."
bad,Overall att was a good company .... But they have their picks and chooses and you have to be very careful as to whom you have a grudge with there... They will do their best to mess you up and make it hard for you to work there in peace
bad,I started my training in mid July took approximately 4 weeks with one week in store. I was an RSC at a retail store in LA the company preaches equality and great working environment that was so for from the truth. My first week I was paired up with a training buddy I started to see exactly was goes one behinds the scenes when a customer comes in to upgrade there their phone or buy a new one. They will not let you make the sale unless you are able to sucker the customer into buying over 100 dollars of accessories that they are not going to need. The managers seem like they should be working outside selling cars. Thats the kind of environment that was at my store. The managers will come down on you if you do not follow their rules and sell to benefit their pockets and screw over your customer. Oh and digital life the new service that att offers they will force it on your customer  any way possible example offering discounts on cell phone service just to make the sale.  Managers at the store will make fun of you any way they can like immature children at the playground.
bad,"We were just being used while their workers were on strike, and once the strike ended they got rid of all of us."
bad,"typical call center. simple work and good pay. customers are rude, managers are utterly worthless in most regards. bias against white males."
bad,"Hated work here. management doesn't care about the workers, and they over work you and randomly take money out of your check."
bad,"AT&T has a high turnover rate due to witnessed favoritism. I was employed there for almost a year and my supervisor did everything in his power to see me fail. From unreasonable phone calls to conflicting information. He even had me call one of AT&T's resource departments because he didn't know how to handle a situation, and then wrote me up for calling the resource department and following their instructions. We worked typically 13 hour days and some days I was told by my supervisor that I was not allowed to take lunch after completing 6-8 hours of work. The union that they force you to join does nothing for you. They take your money stating that they are there for you when in actuality, they look out for the best interests of AT&T, so in actuality AT&T has billions of dollars to pay for attorneys if you try to go against them and they have the employees pay for arbitrators that are on AT&T's side. The issues I had with my supervisor are supposedly being arbitrated by the Communications Worker's Union but I've been met with delays and excuses and anything you can think of to sweep me under the rug."
bad,"Having worked for the company for 7 years I can honestly say other than pay and benefits, it is the worst place I have ever worked.  Rules apply to some, not all.  Management constantly plays favorites.  AT&T is shady in their sales practices.  I do not recommend anyone accepting employment unless it's for 6 months or less."
bad,The manager at my location was very unprofessional. He had his assistant manager and 1 sales rep. that he pushed to excel. To motivate the staff the assistant manager would scream at the sales reps and intimidate them.  Management was like a high school click.
bad,"This is just a pay check, don't look to be appreciated or to advance!"
bad,Alorica is an awful company. It was very disorganized and the management was poor. I hear the company is closing down now and maybe it is for the best due to the fact that people were not receiving their bonus money they earned for selling Uverse.
bad,"Cons:"
bad,"A typical day on my job if there is any work that day is simply installing directv service at new customers homes. Installing the dish in an appropriate place, running RG6 cable neatly to each location, installing the receiver at each TV that will get the service, and introducing the product and how it operates to the new customer."
bad,they do not care about there employees.they make up job titles to give to people seniority doesn't mean anything as it is suppose to. 
bad,"Cuando nos llevaban alas capacitaciones"
bad,"The first part of my career at AT&T was great was there for 2 years than budget cuts happened and I was forced to a Prem Tech position since day 1  life sucked worst experience ever, in the short time employed there I had gone through about 15 managers, super micro managing you have to account for every minute, forces that are out of your control like order issues you pay dearly with your efficiency numbers and are reprimanded for it, everything seems to fall under the ""Grey"" area of the union book and decisions are always siding in favor of the company, worst experience I have had yet"
bad,"everyday was a very stressful day at thos place. I stayed in bad health and ended up back in jan having to stay in the hospital for 8 days and when I got out was on short term. after my short term ended my vacation began and per doctors, advised that I still keep my florida trip. I had a team member email me a nasty email saying I was pretending, was not sick and manipulating the system. I approached my manager who basically took her side.this girl plastered it all over facebook and att did nothing to help me. I was forced to quit because my manager refused to move me away from her at all causing a hostile environment. although I quit, I learned so much about cell phones and collections. the enjoyable part of that job was the close friends I did make."
bad,"It's retail, so you have to deal with working with the public, as well as having an inconsistent work schedule. Management doesn't care about its customers, just making money. If you don't reach quota, even if you have good feedback from customers, you're gone."
bad,Scoring system is impossible to meet.
bad,"First job; worked part time as a car hop. I would take food to customers, sweep the parking lot, help behind counter. It was an easy and fun first job."
bad,Mangers always on people's back yelling and threatening to fire for no reason.
bad,"Call Center in Lafayette Louisiana is very prejudice against the minority group of people working there,has set new unrealistic statistics that uncontrollable unless plan the system and cheat, have good business values and will not cheat system. Managers are inexperienced in management skills and play favorites. Not one customer service representative likes their job, mostly only staying until can find something better."
bad,Ohio Bell became Ameritech - SBC - AT&T
bad,"3 years on the job with AT&T. Job functions change ALL THE TIME. Policy & procedures change at a rediculasly rapid pace (what you had to say WORD FOR WORD to customers would be one script when you clocked in, change mid-shift, change again next day). No management accountability. All issues/problems are passed down and attributed to the employee. Clear favorstism between departments and managemnt. Abilities truly do not matter, as long as you are there, you can be horrible at your job, give misinformation, blatantely lie to customers yet stay employed. If you are a single parent, DO NOT APPLY FOR OR ACCEPT A POSTION WITH THIS COMPANY as there is ABSOLUTELY NO work/home life environment. You will be told upon interviewing that you will move up in senority within a year, to be able to have a decent work schedule, then find yourself still working 3-midnight or overnights 3 yrs and even 5 yrs later. Shifts also change for EVERY HOLIDAY. Unless you started at the EVANSVILLE, IN call center the day they opened, you WILL be working ALL holidays and because of the way the schedules change, there are many 12-16 day working stretches, especially around the holidays. The company does not care at all if you have any outside obligations, you are to be there, for them, at all times...often implementing MANDATORY OVERTIME with as little as 48-hours notice. Managers are never on the same page. The right hand does not know what the left hand is doing. Much incorrect information relayed by management yet employee is still held accountable for ""wrong-doing"". Management instructions/expectations"
bad,I can handle a sales quota and customer experience but this company really bound my hands with this. There wasn't just a sales quota there were at least 12 on top of this was the balance of customer experience. The products and services were priced to high to be truly competitive and the company relied solely on the sales reps and the pressure was continually increasing. The pay was continually decreasing. This was not a pleasant work environment.
bad,I worked as a temp for AT&T. The company employed some very ruthless and hostile business practices. AT&T has pretty much stopped hiring permanent for Uverse Technical Support and is now hiring all temps. The pay dropped from $22.00 per hour to less than $12.00 per hour when they let Pinnacle Technical Resources come on board. Pinnacle started hiring people with no technical experience because they had suddenly dropped the pay and these people also had no customer service experience. We were made to work 16 hour shifts with our company scheduled breaks being forced to be completed within the first three hours of the shift. We couldn't move. Everything was automated and we had to be on a call or get fired. People started getting sick. People started quitting. We were told we had 7 minutes for one restroom break. Then they said 5. Then they said 4. Nevermind the fact the restroom was in the center of the building far away from where we sat and we had to run to and from it.
bad,It had nice people to work with dont get me wrong but going around town trying to sell tv service was not good considering it was all based on commision. the ad lied saying it was hourly and most of my work day consisted of suckering people to buy a tv service that was expensive at the expense of buring gas going from town to town.
bad,"Hired for a customer service position, forced into a sales position."
bad,Benefits are great!!!
bad,AT & T sucks. Management is all worried abou their next career step and don't give a squat about you. There is rampant age discrimination...especially if you make more than your manager. You end up doing cusomter service work 75% of the time as a sales person because the company is such a mess. They think it's a honor to work for them. They are living in the 20s.
bad,"I worked for this company for nearly two years. I have never worked somewhere where employees were treated so poorly. The store managers are typically wonderful to work for, but are consistently bantered by upper management, and have little control over who keeps their jobs. This is a numbers only game. Nothing else matters. If you have children at home you will rarely see them. Kiss a personal life goodbye as the hours are usually 9:30-7 or 10-8:30. You will work every single weekend because schedule are done by seniority, and AT&T prohibits sitting down. You will stand for 8 hours. You have potential to make decent entry level money (55k a year) but it just isn't work the emotional beating you take. Three people in my store went on leave for metal health in the one year that I worked there. All of their claims were approved by therapists."
bad,Upper management sucks and has changed everything so it is no longer a fun place to work. The pay is ok but not really worth dealing with the outrageous expectations.
bad,AT&T is a slave driving company and they do not care about you...If you were to get into a car accident you would get written if you didn't show up for work..You have to be basically beheaded in order from them to show any empathy. Everyday you walk on eggshells because you don't know whether or not you get fired. There isn't any room for any advance there. DON'T DO IT!!!
bad,"AT&T Mobility has a call center in Cedartown, GA that is not a place that you want to work. They do not promote people, not an atmosphere to raise a family. There are good people that work there but upper management makes the environment stress. You are graded on chat/calls by managers and QA. They make it impossible to do a job well. You are criticized at everything that you do. It is very hard to have a work/life balance."
bad,"Hired on with BellSouth in 2001, then AT&T took over and basically put us behind by 15 years."
bad,"A typical day, mad customers, managers breathing on your neck, why you did not sell this or that, you must do this or that, you have to say this or that, you feel like a robot that somebody is trying to program."
bad,I had a bad experiences with DirecTV. hard work with less pay. I did have a great time this company. I work long hours never pay with any over time.
bad,"While the pay at AT&T is not bad, the working conditions are as bad as I've ever seen. There are constant threats to your job, micro managing by mid-level management (who are just as afraid of losing their jobs as the workers), unrealistic demands and constant turnover. The average life span of salespeople is 6 months here. The location was recently Unionized in an attempt to curtail the mistreatment of employees, but so far AT&T continues to answer to no one. A very bad place to work."
bad,"AT&T was a difficult company to work for, long hours, poor opportunities for advancement, very political. Benefits were great, pay was adequate. When the company actually hired more technicians to decrease the workload, they subsequently fired most of the more senior technician’s right after. At the location I worked for, interdepartmental working relationships were poor, people could not focus on the goal of providing the best service for the customers. At that time AT&T, was not Union and subsequently employees were treated as the company pleased. In 30 years of working, this was one of the most difficult companies I have ever worked for."
bad,Family is not a concern for this company. If you have a family this is not a place to work unless you are a work all the time person and your whole life is dedicated to your job. Your a number not a person.
bad,Wouldn’t recommend working here! I have worked for this company 5 years and currently work in management. They constantly change our leadership and only promote people based off politics. They don’t reward employees for hard work and consistency. They do pay well and offer great benefits! Not a family friendly company as personal time and family time you are still required to be on call at all times.
bad,"Work-life balance is the worse part of working at AT&T.  If you are a salaried employee (exempt from overtime), you can work 64 hours in a week and have four hours deducted from your pay.  For example you can work 10 hours a day for six days (every day except Friday.) If you work 4 hours on Friday, you must use vacation or other paid time off.  If you are out of these, you will have 4 hours deducted from your pay."
bad,From my time working at RDI they could never accurately track my attendance points or even my hours. They would always mess up my tax forms and when brung up would just place blame on me. There was a bedbug infestation and continues to be with a bad drug problem and no enforcement.
bad,They encourage high wfucation learning however a very micro management company and stressful. It is not a company that promote minorities and the union is not unified.
bad,this job is the worst. you have to work 6 day weeks and a ton of hours. usually minimum 10 hour days and its in the rain and cold and heat and sun and its terrible. it just sucks.
bad,I started at at&t thinking it would be a career and a company to could retire from. Since then the culture has changed and the only thing they care about are metrics. Employees input is not valued or listened to. They dont value long term employees and make it known that you are replaceable at any time.
bad,"Toxic Environment, no management accountability. High turnover. Impossible Metrics. Management Violates company policy all the time. Hr and Ethics don't value your opinion."
bad,Worked for AT&T for a little over a year. I reported misconduct and was retaliated against. Ultimately decided to apply for a different internal position and the culture was so toxic that employees would call out of work every day to avoid leadership. This caused customer service issues and employee complaints that we ignored for over 6 months. Would recommend a union position not a leadership role. There is no support for making positive changes.
bad,Mucha prepotencia de parte de los jefes de departamentos
bad,"They hired me to write software.  I did, but the software I was writing was doing the same thing as another organization.  For reasons that were never explained to me (I asked) we could not take advantage of what they already had working.  Thus, I was wasting my time."
bad,"The company is more focused on sales than their employees. Very poor management. There is a lack of communication between management, employees and other departments."
bad,"Dead end job, not the same company it used to be. Our system is constantly messing up and gives us extra work. Extremely underpaid for what we are tasked to do. toxic work environment."
bad,If you are looking to make money and have great benefits this is it. But they don't care about the employees one bit. They also make very difficult to manage your personal time or issues.
bad,It was not a good experience. I really did not appreciate the development of culture from management down to the employees. The pay and benefits were really good. Life/work balance was awful.  It was the best thing for me to be let go from that place.  Money is not worth the hassle or stress.
bad,Terrible leadership and doesn’t care about employees . This company has no loyalty . If you are someone new you get treated better than long time employees because it’s easier for management to manipulate new on boarders. Training is great but management is terrible . If you are lucky to get into a location with a decent leader you can certainly flourish . Very hard to find a location with great leadership .
bad,"Not the best company to work if you have a family or any other activity outside work. Sales based goals, hard pressures to fulfill quotas and upsale customers."
bad,"Att has a hostile work environment. Southern Bell  and BellSouth were great places to work. After it became att, customer service went out the window."
bad,the union cares more about keeping their own jobs than improving the overall welfare of the employees as a whole.  the general culture is that only atts bottom line matters.  it is a very greedy company to work for.
bad,"Its a seniority based company, you can be the best technician, do all the training and do the best work but it doesnt matter. They will lay you off and keep the horrible, slow, low performing senior techs. The Union wont do anything about it and just wave you to the door unfortunately. Its a shame, you would be better off going to an IT school with an FCC license and you would be better off"
bad,worst job ever save yourself I cannot begin to talk about this experience. I'll just say I was fine until I started working there now I am not mentally healthy
bad,Goals are set high and no call or score can be perfect.  It's incredibly stressful and you are set up to fail rather than succeed.  Management does not listen to concerns and show phony care for your well being.
bad,"They hire you for customer service when the true is for a sales position in which they make you harass the customer with offers and push back for sales on every cal when the customer is calling because he has a situation.   "
bad,don’t do it  and if you do make sure you’re gonna make positive changes this job sucked the souls from me and left me with nothing but bad memories so happy i left
bad,"Run, retail was ok but if you are looking for or considering IHX don’t do it. Employees were physically assaulted and management didn’t care. We were a number - if you didn’t hit that number you are gone."
bad,"Si no vendes te empiezan a fastidiar, obligan a cubrir cuotas sea cual sea el metodo, ni hay cultura donde el cliente es primero, lo primero es vender"
bad,"AT&T will tell you that they are a place to work for a lifetime, but when through 2-3 rounds of surplussing a year every year I was there. No one is excited to be in the office day to day."
bad,"While I'm thankful to have a job, I have never worked in a more hostile and abusive company. Not by employees but the non stop harrassment and abusive talk and belittling by management is over the top. Very sad because at one time it was supposed to be one of the best companies to work for."
bad,Avoid like the plague. Toxic culture feels like a locker room most days. Bigoted managers that can hardly contain their inappropriate comments. I could go on.
bad,"Poor everything else. Trust me, not worth the money. Stressful, manual labor position with little help and unrealistic time frames to complete work. Pay is great but don't expect a life in between."
bad,"The FE/Wireless Tech III job use to be the best job at AT&T Mobility.  Today in the Atlanta mobility market if you are the unlucky one to have the wrong manager your workday could be miserable.  This man will sneak around to try and find items to write you up for, while hiding in the woods.  States that is what he gets paid to do.  Lies about things that you were not responsible for, then adds it to your work-list.  Acts like a real good friend and compliments you when he is trying to get information from you - like a true hypocrite.   Writes up false incidents (made up) in your name."
bad,i did not like working for this company and this is my opinion. I do not wish to leave any types of remarks regarding this company and this is all i have to say.
bad,"I was very excited to work with AT&T after working for an industry competitor for many years. When I initially started everything was good and the atmosphere was encouraging and inviting. Ultimately, I had my blinders on and was unaware of the Management Vs. Employee culture I had stepped into. The leadership has no real sense of direction and they lack the ability to develop employees."
bad,"The inbound sales call center was a very  poor and unkept work environment. Management was very unprofessional, with no people skills, they would talk to the lower level workers very rudely and showed no concern or mercy for their well-being.  If you are having a slow sales day expect to be harassed! Management & team leads would do side by sides, and monitor your calls all day, however, you are not given any feedback on what is needed to improve until its far too late. The Union was lost hope; they leaned more towards Management over craft employees. Before the Kennesaw center closed, the majority of the employees had been suspended or fired without just cause reasons in order to avoid paying servant packages. The terminated employees contacted the union for assistance however, they were no help, even though the employees had been paying union dues bi-weekly during the full time of employment. The dress code was poor and shameful- anything goes! Rainbow colored hair, Short blouses with the belly button out and pierced, mini shorts in the summer, private parts hanging out, and morale was extremely low. Georgia is an at-will work State, therefore this department could terminate workers for any or no reason at all and get away with it. I’ve held many positions within the company, and all divisions are not corrupted, it’s mainly the call centers. I recommend this company, but definitely not any job in the call centers that are labor union protected."
bad,"It’s a great company initially but you have to Convince people that dtv and internet is worth it. They don’t care how many phones you sell, which is ridiculous. You have to meet high quotas, and basically get fired if you don’t meet them. Management is either not helpful or doesn’t know much because they are so new. The only great thing about att is the 401k and the education reimbursement if you’re full time."
bad,"Management is better than you, even though they can't do you job. Pay is good, however it is well earned. The best part of it is the coworkers. Everyone feels the same pain.  This is just a job. Not a long term company to work for.  No one Retires"
bad,They pay great but are unrealistic with attendance even if documents can be provided for medical reasons. They will fire you for anything. Especially when it comes down to attendance.
bad,"They play games with your ability to take care of your family from day 1. They tell you 1 thing and it's always another. Work life balance? Forget that they hire a bunch of people at the end of the year to fire most after the holidays"
bad,"Stressful job due to unrealistic metric expectations ...unfair workload ...uneasy workplace...no job security..."
bad,"I originally was hired through Bell South, wonderful company, loved my job. AT&T bought them out, sad day for all employees involved. They train their management to harass the employee. I literally was on the phone with a client and one of the managers started screaming at me you only have one cell phone sale today, I need at least three. The client heard her and was devastated. This client repeated to me what she heard. I was very embarrassed. I tried to cover for her behavior."
bad,Not a company I would ever recommend to anyone. The management team was not helpful and the training was insufficient. The supervisor would scream behind me to get off the phone and customers were able to hear her. Very unprofessional.
bad,Micro manage creating atmosphere for unethical behaviors.  When the behaviors were discovered the management team all the sudden wasn't aware of the issues that were prevalent. Not a healthy culture!
bad,It is stressful with constantly changing rules in a fast paced atmosphere with CEO's that are unforgiving who are clueless to the employees who interact with the clients.
bad,"Management is utterly incompetent. "
bad,"Very clicky environment, hard to work for, always changing rules"
bad,Pay is good but employees get personal preference by seniority and who you know. Union and higher ups don’t care if employees know how to do their job as long as they have plenty of  years of seniority they’ll keep them and kick out the door hard working techs with less years and who perdón way better than others no matter what.
bad,Prime Communications employees cared little for their customers and more for themselves. At times I felt pressured to do something with an account that I knew wouldn't really benefit the customer. Management is inconsistent and hard to get used to all the new rules. Hours are long and staff is never promised. Sometimes leaving you to run the store by yourself. I did learn to be more patient and understanding. Also how to sell. I would not recommend working here to ANYONE.
bad,"AT&T pays well for a soul crushing low bar call center job. "
bad,Management is really bad.  They promote people based on gender and brown nosing.  The pay is good if you are willing to put up with the nonsense from the top.
bad,At&t is not a good place to work anymore. You are a number and they arent loyal at all nor do they care if your loyal. They are trying to outsource all jobs
bad,I was sexually harassed and i reported it and no one did anything. That’s why i left. It was a great place to work up until than. Attendance is really strict. You can’t be late ever or you are fired
bad,"Customer service is far from the goal of the managers and the regional manager @ At&t in southeastern Massachusetts. The culture is very stressful and far from family oriented. The online training classes was great but what the training teams push as “customers first culture”, is so extremely far from what the regional manager sets the tone as! He just wants numbers and to make sure he makes it to the yearly summit! Worse than car sales."
bad,Everyone is out to get you... Horrible environment. Layoffs and surpluses are always an issue here... SIMPLY NO JOB SECURITY... Managers hide behind bushes to look for any mistake...
bad,"The work culture is one that is designed to keep the employees ignorant of a company policy that can be changed at any time by the 2nd level manager.  There is an open ended schedule which makes it impossible to know what time you get off everyday.  The company puts the managers vs. employees instead of employees and managers working together.  As an employees under the Uverse side of the Company, you are subject to harassment and targeting at any time a manger decides they don't like you.  The protections that the company has set up to appear to provide a fair and just working environment, are bias and set to provide a favorable result for the company."
bad,I have worked at AT&T for 11 years. They pay very well and have great benefits but the cost of receiving that is your sanity and life/work balance. They run you with the mentality of they want you on write ups or being fired at every turn. There is no positive work environment with management and the union is extremely weak. Most of us only stay for the money but we all also know that they want us gone. Do not recommend working here unless you want to sell your soul to the devil for a good paying job.
bad,"I worked at AT&T for 9 years & saw a large number of employees get fired or quit. High turnover & politics exist. I stayed so long because I was a high performing sales rep who was tricked into management. If you get hired, be ready to have a target on your back. Your manager will listen to your entire customer interaction and then tell you what you did wrong and believe me you will always be seen as doing wrong.  I hope your a good actor because they make you do stupid role plays over and over for the entire time your employed their. Also get ready to spend your money on costumes and jerseys to wear to work with your team to then post on Twitter to fake your having fun working at AT&T. Be ready to sell everyone a new phone line, tablet, hotspot, DTV, home Internet, Insurance, and a ton of accessories and to only get paid lousy commission that will get taxed by the government at 40%. All the workers who were there when I started no longer works at AT&T. Look up all the workers complaints online if you don't believe me. Report an issue and they will fire you at some point. Do not sign their document when hired that states you cannot take them to court. They make you handle issues internally if you do which will always benefit the company and backfire on you.. If you want to work for a company who will threaten you, lie to you, and come up with false accusations as a reason to fire you at any given time then AT&T might be for you. Let's not forget about them always doing lay offs as well. Hourly plus commission for sales reps and salary plus commission for management. It is a"
bad,"When I started working at at&t it was my dream job, pay was great, management was amazing, sales representatives were always happy to work because the commission they used to make was outstanding but all that started to change for the worse. At&t started to include more products to sell while decreasing commission, some management wouldn't even protect you if you were getting yelled at by a customer. Simply everything of what used to be a great company is now gone so if you can stay away from here the better you are of."
bad,Would not recommend working here. They make many promises and never followed through. They micromanage and it's hard to breathe there. When asked for disability help the manager refused.
bad,Pay and benefits were decent. Union is an absolute joke. Management is a horrible clown show at best. Horrible place to work. Unethical practices when dealing with customers.
bad,African Americans are treated badly. Managers do not support African American employees and plot to have them terminated as soon as possible. African American employees are given worst assignments. Supervisors send us out to the worst areas to work in and tell white employees not to answer called requiring assistance on.
bad,Management is constantly asking you to lie to customers or use some other unethical sales tactic to close the sale on people that they know can not afford the product and will cancel later on just so they can meet their hourly or daily goals to keep themselves out of trouble. When service is cancelled it comes back out of your commission and after so many chargebacks they can launch an investigation against you. This on top of constant unnecessary coaching whether you're meeting your sales goals or not.
bad,"Te bajan la luna y las estrellas pero te corren por que al gerente regional le da la gana, según hay crecimiento pero nada más entre directivos, great place to work por que la empresa pide a los empleados que la califiquen bien. Es una pena. En si el trabajo es bueno, uniformes gratuitos, nada más que no te toque jefe nuevo por que te inventan fraudes y cosas por el estilo para correrte."
bad,"Was in the sales department that was highly stressful in which demanded objectives to be obtained.  If the objectives was not obtained, than corrective action unto and including separation from the company was processed."
bad,"Would not recommend anyone to seek employment with this corporation.  Too many rules and regulations make for a disagreeable, unhappy workforce.  Some people got lucky with good positions but few."
bad,"Don't apply they have the worst customers & managers that have no clue about call centers and rude customers AT&T is a greedy company that has no "
bad,Too many back stabbers. Always had people that would turn you in for doing something that may not have been totally with the desires of the company but would help mankind.Glad to be out of there.
bad,"Si bien el ganar 15000 pesos al mes suena atractiva no es suficiente como para arriesgar tu salud mental, el tener que responder mas de 100 llamadas diarias con clientes que solo llaman para gritar porque su servicio no funciona bien, no lo vale."
bad,"Primero Te contrata un outsourcing mismo que no te brinda mucha información ni está en contacto contigo."
bad,"Horrible on life work balance. Dont acfet doctors notes for sick leave so you get pointed and if you get 8 point you are terminated. Mandatory overtime even you worked 10hours already. Change you hours every six months and you have bid for the shift tou want based on seniority. Your kid is sick they do not care, it a point.  Chbage teams every 6 months Good pay.  Decent time off that paid dont get til 6 months in. Lief happens in between time"
bad,My summary says it all.  Working here provided great pay and benefits for myself and my family however the management is the worst I have ever seen!!!!
bad,I would not recommend this job to any of my friends nor family. While my current management is ideal the work hours are horrible. This company does not care about its employees.
bad,"Working for AT&T was an awful experience due to the awful management, hopefully they will beable to improve for the benefit of the customers and staff"
bad,"Understaffed and poor management from the store managers to the area managers. Horrible training, and unprofessional and irresponsible communication tactics by text threats to let you know you are not doing your job correctly! Would never recommend this job to anyone!"
bad,"The company does provide decent pay/benefits. However, I dedicated myself and my time to my job. My reward was to be fired when I needed my job the most; just before Christmas and during some life threatening medical issues involving my newborn son. Not only did the company know about my limited work opportunities due to a very obvious physical disability, I had just returned from Paternity Leave after my son required medical transport to Portland. They were also aware that the medical care for my child was going to continue and maintaining my income/insurance was imperative. My work record with the company was almost spotless, an uncommon trait among employees of iQor. Still, no one with any real power advocated for me or even made an attempt to save my position or move me to a different department. The main reason this is frustrating is because the mission statement of said company guarantees that they care for their employees, like family. I was told if I did the job as described and followed company policy, my employment would never be at risk. And yet, here I am, struggling to survive on what is provided by unemployment."
bad,Had a terrible experience working sales for this company. They push you to use unethical methods to boost sales. As soon  as they don't need you anymore they find a way to terminate you. They also have a point system that penalizes even when you are ill. They care nothing about your work life balance nor your health. Just looking for cash cows.
bad,While working with directv and at&t is was a very good work experience for me. All though the pay was constantly messed with as far as them saying the checks or commission was late. Not getting the correct amount.
bad,Inconsistency is the only consistency. Management turnover and lack of oversight and support are the daily routine. No opportunity for advancement other than filling in openings created by the butter churn that is middle management.
bad,When it was DirecTV it was a great place to work. After AT&T took over it was not. Management was horrible. And they don't care about you as a person.
bad,"Terrible job life balance. company is based purely on numbers. If you get injured, forget about it. Everything in placed to benefit the company. Pay is good. Vacation time is good."
bad,"if you can't learn systems in 2 days you're out.  Also believe age is a factor in weather they keep you or not.  "
bad,"Data-hiding culture - managers reward actions that make them look good at the expense of the company, and will readily sacrifice their direct reports' career advancement."
bad,Lowered my pay $8 when the AT&T merger with Directv took place. Do not recommend them to work for or their services. Managers are on your back to sell their protection plan and will threaten to have you fired if you don't reach goals set.
bad,"Being a field technician for AT&T really sucks.  Management doesn’t care about techs and their knowledge of working in the field is extremely lacking.  They want unrealistic numbers to be produced and if you fall short, you could get fired easily.  If the entire management culture changed then it would be a great place to work."
bad,Compensation and discounts only good thing. Literally every other criteria they are terrible in. Would not recommend unless you are desperate. Very easy to get laid off very quickly.
bad,"You take back to back calls with no breath in between. Expect to read from a script and do not use your own technical support knowledge if not on the script. Managers are very encouraging because their bonuses depend on it. Metrics are setup for a rotating door. High enough to make it hard for any employee bonus and the potential to lose your job in 4 months if 3 months missed. Nothing fun given to the employees. Union gave the raises, not the company. I learned where I don't want to work and who I will never buy from."
bad,"Typical day was sitting behind a computer, answering telephones, selling items to customers, sending customers to correct department, trying to make your quota by the end of the day."
bad,"This job is incredibly high stress. Management constantly picks favorites, and will single out and harass employees they don’t like. I work in a LITERAL prison now, and I get harassed less than working in AT&T’s metaphorical one. They don’t let you have paid sick days, and it’s luck of the draw when it comes to the store you work in. Upper management is very political and never considers the needs of lower employees."
bad,too much work and not enough bodies to fill the roles and company doesn't see a problem with that. days are filled with missed appointment windows and upset customers. we technicians are under trained for some of our work responsiblities because thats how the company wants it.
bad,The company has lost its focus on services and only care about meeting targets.  This shows in all of their customer base products.  Every silo within the company Is pushed to meet ridiculous metrics.
bad,"Manager left the day I started. AT&T started 2 new manager and is not great at all. Company does not care about AT&T just Directv. If you do not sell DTV, management will hate you."
bad,"If money is all that compells you take this job. If you have a family, or wish to stay married this isn’t the place for you. The stressfully environment has caused 85% of employees to get divorced. When you go to work you cannot leave until further notice, could be 8 hours could be 14, you don’t know until you are told you can go home. Employees are given a job script and are expected to follow said script even for technician position you will be micromanaged like an employee at McDonald’s. If you use paid sick time you get written up. This company owns you once you join."
bad,"This company does so many job cuts its insane, they do not care for you as an employee at all, the pay was fairly decent but the management was absolutely terrible."
bad,This company is the most worst company to work. They start let people go. Plus the Union dosent do nothing to protect you job. They just want unión dues.
bad,"taking calls with customers with bill concerns , the hardest part of the Job is the calls being routing to the wrong department and customer having to wait on long holds and still not connected to correct department . Management not taking the correct action to resolve issues always saying its being worked on with no positive results. Being Forced to sell Products to customers even though they have stated already bill was to high ,and if you didn't make the amount of sells discipline could occur ."
bad,"Bad management Is what I cant stress enough about At&t. I was told to lie to people on a regular bases, not stretch the truth, straight up lie. Mostly when it came to credit checks. If you are applying for service you have to have a hard credit check. I was told to say it was a soft credit check or that there wasn't one if/when a customer asked me if at&t did credit checks. That is horrible and can hurt people financially, I didn't do it and got pressured to leave. So I did i'm not hurting people so a company can make more money. Horrible place to work ."
bad,"The position is amazing, you can't really ever get bored. You can learn something new every day, which keeps the position interesting.  I loved my actual Job, but the management constantly used scare tactics to get you to do more than what was in your contract.  Micromanaging is not the greatest when you have an employee that has very little repeats, great customer service and does the job as trained.  It seems that this local management see the employees as replaceable... which we are, but when you have a good employee that does right by the company, stop trying to end their career."
bad,I liked the job alot in the beginning but over the years it seems the company has just turned it's back on us and the employees who work hard on making customers happy and love the tv service but I'm just tired every time we turn around its policy this and policy that and u write us up for being sick and tell us to file fmla and the hours suck you never know when u will be home u never know if you manager will answer the phone and every time u think your doing something right your not I just have had it with the company  u all should know the best way to make a company work is make your employees happy and u will have great customer service
bad,Typical sales job with unrealistic sales goals and always under the threat of losing your job. The manager at the time was rude and unprofessional and condoned dishonesty towards customers to reach goals.
bad,"Managers will lie straight to your face and get away with it, the company only cares about money and promote you to lie to customers in order to gain sales"
bad,"Was treated just like any other disposable employee they hire. Was told the world, was asked to spy on other employees. Very stressful experience and would never recommend anyone for this job."
bad,"Wouldn’t recommend working at ATT if you need work/life balance. Benefits are good, but as someone with over a decade of loyalty, I’m often dismissed and don’t ever get the chance to speak up."
bad,Be prepared to work hard. While AT&T is a great company changes happen even quarter. Often times jobs are moved to other states and you may not have the offer to transfer. Benefits are great and if you are lucky enough to work there use even opportunity possible to further your education with the tuition aid programs
bad,"ATT preaches a lot, but they don't follow much of it. NO work/life balance, although they preach that a lot. You will work, and you will work, and you will work some more. Don't plan on anything outside of work, because, chances are, you won't be able to participate."
bad,This company definitely has some work to do. The environment was not at all pleasant. Managers were not helpful. which made the job so much harder when it came to customers
bad,This was a very stressful place to work. Not knowing if we were going to strike or not. The company always putting work on us with less pay. It was shown that minority employees were targeted by management. Other coworkers were able to do the same actions with no punishment.
bad,"Unrealistic goals. You are to Demo the DirecTV display REGARDLESS of what the customer came in for. Management is terrible, they don't care about anything but how many sales the reps got so they can look good in the eyes of their superiors. and God forbid you or a family member gets sick, You get no sick time whatsoever you get points and after so many you're automatically fired. Worst company ever."
bad,"Depressing work environment slowly watching dedicated experienced employees laid-off, month after month.  No future here.  Continuous mergers have left this once great company a confusing mess.  Work harder, not smarter is the motto.  Top-down communication only.  Everything centralized for control regardless of effectiveness and cost. Fake 'we care' emails not in line with reality.  You are locked into dead-end positions for as long as they need you, then kicked to the curb."
bad,"Come in sit at your desk log into systems and begin calls. "
bad,Pay and benefits are great. Very toxic work atmosphere. Manager's feel the same as technicians. The all hate it but tolerate it due to the pay and benefits.
bad,"No work-life balance, treated like a number, no advancement opportunities, asked to perform tasks that are not part of your role, pushed beyond your limit to the point of loss of emotional well-being, exhaustion, subjected to inhumane and dangerous working conditions...just to name a few things.."
bad,This was a good paying job but they really didn't care about the members or the team members. they out sourced outside the US and that really impacted the company.
bad,The upper management do not care for their employees whether you are sick or have medical emergencies. You are a number to them and you are replaceable.
bad,"as a rep when i statred for the company we handeled one job for one product, by the time I left we were forced to handle several jobs and several products which involves many different programs to learn about the products how to work then tech suport billing selling all products which we sell thur att it is way to much info for one person to have to remember"
bad,"Expect not to see your family that much forced 14 hours of overtime a week. Very stressful job, No job security. Benefits are ok top out pay is better than most but is not that good for all the work you will have to do. Every week expect a new “Expectation” that you will have to do that doesn’t not benefit the company or yourself just make the work you do take longer and increases stress and anxiety. You will have to do other departments jobs that they could of handled over the phone. I would not recommend this place to anyone with a family. If you are single with no kids and want to work your life away I would highly recommend this job."
bad,"horrible culture, only mindset on the bottom line without consideration to employee livelihood. moral. AT&T does not care about their employees, but rather bottom line. For a company that pseudos strives for safety first, there are many things they do to undermine safety. AT&T took a dump on DirecTV and all that was good about working for Directv."
bad,"I'll start this by saying that being a prem tech for at&t does pay decent and you don't need a degree to get hired. That being said, this has been the worst job I've ever had. You will be judged based on metrics that you have little control over and the schedule you get will be based on seniority. They do force employees to work six day work weeks (sometimes for months straight). As far as the schedule goes you can expect to have split days off for a few years. Also, the union should be avoided. They will take about six hundred dollars a year and give you nothing in return."
bad,"Good pay,"
bad,"Manament wont listen to employees, They want your life to exist for them they don't care for your family, My son died and no one from the company came to the funeral or even said anything to me."
bad,"Management (or lack thereof) is, without question, the worst I have ever seen.  This applies from the top down.  If any college graduates read this, do yourself a favor and do ANYTHING else (Walmart, Target, grocery chains, restaurant work) before considering this company."
bad,Management is not qualified and corrupted. Upper management only hire/advance their close friends and relatives. Decisions are random and not well calculated. Training and classes are not sufficient nor useful.
bad,"As usual - AT&T will call this a disgruntled employee comment.  However, the leadership at this company is marred within it's own hypocrisy.  If you want a company that shows no loyalty to its employees but rather its profits - this is the company for you.  If you want a company that will stagnate your skillset while the industry moves on - this is the company for you.  Better to be a contractor making high dollars than to be an employee."
bad,"i worked at circle 75 door to door rep, was NEVER paid for all the work i did. this nob has awesome co workers but the management was not the best at all."
bad,"So you'll take calls, ALL day and all day you'll get hounded.  Not by customers.  No, that is to be expected in a customer service role.  You'll be hounded by management and upper management about sales and what you plan on selling.  When you make a sale and your sales are going well things go ok, when they aren't going well everything you do is under a microscope.  If you like constant anxiety and pressure, At&t is the place for you."
bad,"much work to do, not given adequate information to understand job and the knowledge it took to do the responsibilities that were required of me.  It would have been nice to have better and adequate training."
bad,It’s really long hours they aren’t Carring towards people with families and small children. Mistakes aren’t allowed and the management  does not protect their team everyone is out for their selves
bad,"No recomiendo trabajar en una empresa que dice dar muy buenas comiciones pero el sueldo base es malísimo 4800 pesos no alcanzan para nada,en mi caso pago universidad mensual y el sueldo apenas alcanza para pagar colegiatura y comidas,el transporte corre por mi cuenta."
bad,The management likes to make things as difficult as possible. Using the computer programs is rediculous while talking to customers and trying to sell to them. Totally stupid.
bad,"A day of work consists of the company harassing you on stats that they cannot fully explain what information goes into creating the stat percentage."
bad,"I feel like I am working for a local company that doesn't know which way is up, not a multi-billion dollar company. There is little room for advancement locally, and there is more emphasis on metrics than customers."
bad,"I could go on and on about why not to work here, but I won't bore you with the details. This place will basically suck your soul dry and take every part of you away until you have nothing."
bad,"Run away from this company as fast as possible, Sinking ship! I have never been treated so poorly in all of my years working for a company. I wish I turned and ran sooner"
bad,Never know what you are doing or where you are going.  Too many jobs have no time allotment.  Was inconsistent and management does not help train.  Can be a great job or very bad.
bad,"In my opinion it was very hard to work for this company. You have very little, if any, power to help the customer and are so strictly monitored it can be very unnerving. The pay is not bad and if you stick with it, you can move up. However, I can't imagine the stress is worth it. Keep a stress-ball handy!"
bad,"It felt as if you were in prison.....Management was fairly poor......the most stressful job I have ever worked, although the pay was good.got a raise every 6months....................."
bad,"Further your education . This company is strictly based on sales and if you don't make your sales, you will be terminated. They constantly change the commission structure making It impossible to meet your goals"
bad,Its a job payed the bills no family time one weekend off per month no room to advance paycheck will say unprotected employee..........................This job is just good for the experience dont plan on having it for retirement
bad,"The best part of AT&T is the pay, and that is it. You have long hours working out side, and dealing with irate customers is just the start. Management uses scare tactics and will give a formal for anything. No one wants to be working there, including management."
bad,"AT&T Directv is a terrible place to work. High turnover rate monthly. Micro-Managed daily; Wages are not enough for the area to live. Initial training is a 1/3 of what one learns in 6 weeks. 2/3 of the job is learned on the floor. Extremely frustrating dealing with angry customers everyday (retention) and at times loud music is played in your work area, making it very hard at times to listen to your customer. Not a professional atmosphere to work."
bad,"Good pay, but how they treat their employees is terrible, at the call center. They frequently hired policemen to sit as security, because they mistreated so many workers. Constantly on you for bathroom breaks,ect. Can, and will fire you for any thing. With no help from the local 702 union, you pay dues to. I made my family get rid of ALL at&t services after working there."
bad,"Poor Management, The Area managers take the managers side. My Manager was allowed to treat me with disparity and favor the african americans and they did nothing.  Directors will side with their Managers as well.  "
bad,wish things would have went differently. Scheduling was all over the place. I believe every business can grow from within it just makes sense. More leadership should hold meeting for staff to try and fix issues or at least understand the Improvements that need to be made. More jobs should posted for to give chance to people who are will to work hard overall and nothing less. And why do we not have a section for military personnel .
bad,I worked customer service it was horrible . they made you offer a service on every call and if you didn't you could be fired. If you was more than 3 minutes late that goes against you if it happens three time you're fired. Dont have a true emergency . You have to decide between your livelhood or the situation you are facing.
bad,"No advancement for your career, very stressful, agents keep leaving the company, expect too much of the managers and agents and makes working there too stressful"
bad,Coworkers were out to get each other on a daily basis.  There was so much drama that concentrating on the job at hand was impossible.  Management was a joke in that they were a bit too friendly with some of the employees and talked about other representatives behind their backs.  I learned how to offer Directv and the programs provided by DTV.  Hardest part of the job was getting the motivation to go there every day to deal with people's hostility. The most enjoyable part of the job was the paycheck and vacation.
bad,"Would not recommend, sales is all they care about. Best decision made was to leave there. No work/life balance and it takes 6 months for any benefits or time off"
bad,once your piers become management they will use everything they know about you to get you fired.  The union is just sucking up you income not doing anything.
bad,"I loved my job, it paid very well and it was not a stressful job.  I had a diverse amount of co-workers but we all got along as a family. I believe the hardest part of the job was dealing with attendance.  A lot of my co-workers never showed up to work which in the long run made our office closure more of a reality.  Until it happened and a lot of hard working and dedicated employees were left without a job.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the family connection everyone had.  It my home away from home."
bad,"Within the 10 years I worked at AT&T I very rarely got time off when I requested it. I missed out on a lot with my family.  Due to my seniority, I barely got a decent schedule.  My whole department was laid off because our jobs were replaced by robots.  I felt that the company is making more and more money and has less and less need for actual humans to do the work.  The people at the top get richer and richer as the workers in my position could barely pay bills, and then got laid off. I lived from paycheck to paycheck, and I am a single person with no children.  The company paid us enough to stay, but not enough to live.  In addition, I tried for 2 years to move up in the company.  I feel I was passed over for a promotion several times."
bad,managers micro managed everything.  It was more about the company and needs of the business rather than the customer.  this also applied to employees.
bad,"Great place to work if you want to be followed by private investigators when you call in sick.  Stick to adherence which means leaving breaks and lunches on time couple minutes off because you're stuck a call, and then numbers are off and you can be let do.  Not to mention if you have to use the restroom you get 6 minutes a day provided that you went on time for lunch and breaks.  While the pay was excellent , but the micro management and the constant fear of losing your job it was not worth it.  Was so much better as Ameritech or SBC, but since the merger with Att is very unpleasant environment to work."
bad,"Managers do not care about employees. Will work you till the bone for little pay. No family life nor time off. The only cons was the benefits, and discounts."
bad,"AT&T was a poor place to work. You never knew what time you were getting off, it might be 2pm or 10pm. Everything went by seniority, including transferring to a different department even if you knew more than the person with the seniority. Your days off were not back to back. Management is a joke. They would not help you out on a job if you were stuck and would not send anyone to help you."
bad,"Not a fair work environment, very fast pace and unfair goals and stats managers will not coach fairly , scheduling is seniority which makes it very difficult for a lower tenured person to ever get a good schedule . Saturday work forever with day off during week .. director no longer cares and threatens to send work to Mexico call centers"
bad,AT&T is focusing on reducing salaried employees which reduces customer service.  Most jobs are being off-shored and there is no depth of knowledge or critical thinking skills left at AT&T to service customers and sales force.
bad,Everyone is out for themselves. Practically impossible to be promoted. Constantly blamed for repeats due to bad weather ( equipment very sensitive to static electricity).
bad,"Working at AT&T in the collection division is extremely stressful. Management pushes very hard to collect money from customers, and has reduced the amount of customer service that was given in past years. I saw many changes over the 15 years I worked for the company, but the last few years have been the worse. I have seen people have heart attacks and other stress related issues, and have seen the company put care for their customers behind the need to increase cash flow."
bad,"Att use to be a wonderful place to work but they have lowered bonuses to almost non existent and don't give thier employees any sick time.  Also within my center I feel like there are diffrent prejudices amoung the majority of the management.  If you don't look like or act like them you get treated differently, won't be promoted, and could possibly loose your job."
bad,Extremely poor management. Makes you feel like scum and stupid. Haven’t even worked here 6 months and I already hate it. I would not recommend anyone work here unless you want to be miserable.
bad,Manager at At&T will force you to sell unethically. They cheat customers just to boost up their numbers. All they care about is self recognition. They do not care about their employees. Specially if you’re the best seller they will do anything to get rid of you because you’re earning more than the managers.
bad,Great pay... Great benefits but you are nothing and are managed with fear tactics and reminded daily you are nothing.
bad,"Too much stress over selling cell phones and then adding in DTV made it 1000 times worse, I wouldnt want anyone I know to work here I would feel bad for them. When they paid more I was willing to stay and deal with all the stress over nothing considering there were points where I was ranked in the top 10 out of the 22000 retail sales people."
bad,The company might be great if they could find management and control the inventory of the store. I was often encountering scheduling errors or told I was switch d with another person without any notice
bad,As a CSR for a company that lost a class action law-suit the job comes with the territory but in no way shape or form does AT&T make it any better. Mandatory schedules that are different from those agreed during interview.
bad,AT&T is not the company it use to be. There is no longer a career they will get rid of you without warning. Trust no one. The union CWA is not to be trusted no matter how much you pay them. The incompetence in locals will cost your job. It's not worth the stress..
bad,"AT&T for the Retail Sales Consultant position is limited to adhere to whatever management decides to call business needs. Scheduling and hours and days off are completely out of the reps control and solely in the hands of management to decide upon. Also, politics play a huge role in advancement and who you know within the corporate food chain plays an enormous role in promotions and advancement."
bad,I’m still undergoing therapy from working there and it’s been ten years but I learned a lot on several different categories but the pay was nice but totally not worth the traumatic experience from working there
bad,AT&T is a great place to work if you are an outside technician or an awesome salesperson other than having those two skills look elsewhere for employment
bad,"ATT wants to sell you products and not care, they Lie and all they care about is getting you money, if you are a good customer service rep they will tell you to lie to make more money."
bad,Most of the managers I had were pretty fair but the company overall does not care about their employees and expect more work for less money. The work itself would not be so bad if it weren't for the systems in place to control every aspect of your work day. No autonomy to perform your job.
bad,The more you lie and cheat customers the more likely you are to advance working at AT&T.  I was simply not as morally flexible as the company would have liked me to be.
bad,"Too much pressure to perform in sales, The culture changed from customer service to sell something, no matter what the customer's situation was Pay is not enough for the pressure!"
bad,This company was not all that great to work for! Annoying customers who are VEXED because of the company so they take there anger out on you! Management was horrible!!! They will put you under the bus to save themselves after they told you to do something that was not the correct way! Benefits were above average. Understand this is not a career job just a stepping stone to further advance your in your endeavors.
bad,"Call Center - Troubleshooting customer issues with cell phones and applications. "
bad,Overall terrible company to work for. No job security and the company allows their managers to sexually harass employees and steal. ......................
bad,"Overly large greedy corporation more concerned with profits and share holders than having happy employees. Work taken from higher paid work groups and given to lower paid work group. Everything that could be measured was: how long vehicle was idling, how many jobs completed, cancelled, how quickly they were completed, how long job program page was open for, expected extremely unrealistic quotas for amount of work needed to be performed. Management rarely ever had worked in the position themselves, not knowing how much work was actually needed to complete the job, uneducated, tried to rule by fear. AT&T had union contract written with multiple catch 22's. If you were sick you would get suspended. Lowest moral of any place I have ever worked in my entire life. Company has over 100 billion dollars to spend on other companies but not enough for it's employees and lays them off. Most enjoyable part of the job: helping customers get their service repaired or installed and having them feel taken care of. Hardest part of the job: coming to work where no one wants to be there. Learned how to climb telephone poles, run cat5, coax, color code, run cross connects, mounting dishes, climbing ladders, read work orders, manage time, work in confined spaces, communicate needed work with customer, interface customer devices, networking, broadband services, telephone, TV"
bad,Starts off great until you realize how bad it is. The managers are out to get you if your not part of the clique. It’s a very cut throat business with att.
bad,Management sucks you are responsible for metrics you have no control over and they watch you every step you take and quick to write you up for stupid things
bad,Large company that is going through changes in direction and focus. This has been witnessed over several years. This company is perfect for someone who likes constant change. This company is focused on agile management.
bad,A few managers had horrible work ethic and the environment was childish. I felt like I was in high school all over again. The breaks were very short and their training was not long enough for beginners.
bad,high turnover rate and asked us to lie to customers  and there was very hostile work environment little to know traffic into store so numbers were hard to meet
bad,"Poor work life balance.  Poor communication. Poor Job Security/Advancement.  Limited training, limited career developed.  Excellent Compensation/Benefits."
bad,"if you dont like to sell sell sell don't go there.  they don't care about the customers real issue or even fixing the issue.  They only want the employees to sell dtv, internet or home phome services.  Very bad place to work.  I love taking care of my customers and always treated them the way i would treat my own family.  sprint has at&t beat hands down in custimer service"
bad,"AT&T cut their throat when they merged with Directv and is expecting their employees to bail them out. Puts customer service on the back burner trying to get a sale. Also prides themself on ""integrity"" yet fire you when you are being honest. Lower level management stays stressed out in return stressing you out. You can literally feel the tension as soon as you walk into the building. Upper management is heartless and do not deserve to have the position they are in. While the pay might look very appealing....it's not worth the damage that stress will do to your health."
bad,"My job at AT&T was horrible.  Managers were always trying to push us to break laws and company policy's to make sales. The company awarded these managers creating a tense environment of constantly being harassed and threatened. ""No one has been fired for this"" was my managers' favorite saying.  The policies became a loop hole to be able to fire people at will.  These policies were only enforced if the person was wanted out."
bad,"This was a landline repair center. As a support rep, I handled the calls from irate customers that were typically upset about the length of out of service time."
bad,The pay was great if you wanted to be a slave at your job. You could only get promoted if you were best friends with someone in management. The customers will yell at you on a regular basis and you have to push sales on them. Assistant managers will rate your performance regularly so be prepared for constant criticism.
bad,very bad leadership. the job itself isnt horrible but the management is very poorly trained and the leadership focus is more on selling TV than phones these days.
bad,"lots of layoffs right now and people should stay away until a later date. With the Time Warner and DirecTV mergers, lots of great people lost their job."
bad,There is a constant threat of termination and complete lack of management in the Kansas City area. Techs are held accountable for things that are not within their control. An example would be quality. If a storm takes out the lines servicing a customer just visited by tech. It is their fault. In addition the Union fails to listen to the issue brought to them.
bad,"The culture really went downhill before I left. the way managers were treated made it hard to make decisions that helped customers."
bad,"I am a technician for AT&T and have been for 7 years. Regret accepting the job every day but it’s hard to leave due to family and bills. Morale is extremely low throughout this position. This position is the frontline of AT&T and we are treated like the red headed step child. Write ups are not an if they are a when. The company doesn’t believe in finding solutions to better a technician. Management is write up happy and they itch to discipline a technician with excessive punishment for a minor mistake. Your schedule will say from 8-5 but I can’t remember the last time I got off at 5. You are forced to stay until all jobs are complete or you will be written up. Get ready for cold dinner and if you have a family let them know you won’t see them until your off day rolls around. You will only receive 1 Saturday off a month. Your off days if not forced to work 6 days will be 2 random days throughout the week and majority of the time they are not consecutive days. You will be forced to work outside in thunderstorms, rain in freezing conditions and when you get sick even if you’re  near death if you use a sick day which is given to you by the company you will be written up when you return to work. When 90% of your coworkers are job scared, extremely stressed, and looking for another job something isn’t right. Apply at your on risk. Money is great. Benefits are great but after 7 years in this position I know the meaning of money can’t buy happiness. Don’t believe me? Get the job and tell me your thoughts after 6 months."
bad,Your work performance is measured by how many jobs you can close out to make the company more money and not so much the quality of work. They’d rather you sabotage 5 jobs than do 2 perfect installs. They pay is bad and you don’t even have a guaranteed hourly rate. They pay piece rate wages and give you ridiculous jobs. If your 18 and don’t mind breaking your back for low pay than this is the perfect job for you.
bad,Training does not provide skills or knowledge of performing job requirements. Time was wasted on information & activities not productive to actual skills needed to navigate programs used.
bad,"Company does not care about employees just profits. You can be replaced and they make that known, Very stressful environment. Managers forgot where they came from."
bad,They lie about scheduling to get people working horrible shifts on purpose to get people to quit. They change policies or even change programming and don’t tell us major changes are made so we end up looking like liars to the customers or like we don’t know what we are talking about.
bad,"They are still doing unions here. I wouldn't recommend this company to my worst enemy. The work/life balance is in shambles, and the metrics rule your life. Once management finds a way to have extra options for employees to advance, and have a balance of work and life then maybe I would recommend, but until then...stay away."
bad,Stressful and impossible job metrics. Poor management. Customers generally unhappy but don't have other options. Cable plant not maintained. Sales staff lies to customers.
bad,As a union till this day they still haven't agreed on a contract. Ever since they aqcuired Directv. The pay focus merged to Directv with the Wireless pay drastically dropping. In the end pretty much a lot more work for the same pay.
bad,"As a customer care associate, my time at AT&T was short and terrible. The trainer did a poor job and the most of the managers were completely useless."
bad,"At at&t you never knew if an when they were going to shut down you center.No sense of reassurance in the company. If you did a good job,no recognition for a job well done, you had no sense of value"
bad,"Huge company, horrible management , unrealistic goals . The company is not as great as it was before all the acquisitions and mergers. All they care about is the bottom line. Customer experience and employee engagement are but on the back burner in order to generate revenue. Very stressful call center sales environment with many variables that you can't control. All the managers coming in now are new, unaware of company polices and completely unengaged. You can tell the company is cutting costs by the people they chose to promote."
bad,"Call center- get yelled at, during every call, due to billing issues. Rather than fix the billing issue you are required to sell every single product available to that customer on every call i.e. Cellphone, internet, DirecTV, Uverse, home phone. You are graded on every call. High anxiety- every one of your coworkers is on prescription anxiety medication and antidepressants. Management will get rid of you for any reason especially if it impacts their bonus. Union is a joke and will not provide the assistance you pay for. No such thing as a sick day, most employees are on FMLA or special accommodations so that they won't get fired for calling off sick. The managers and employees that have stuck around for several years seem to be brainwashed that this is the ""best job ever"". Your phone cord is your shackle for 8hrs a day. You do not get two consecutive days off a week. There is zero opportunity for advancement. Management  is so out of touch, they do not know how to actually do the job. Everything you do, call time, amount of calls, customer satisfaction surveys, sales, etc is part of your bonus structure each month and is monitored."
bad,At this time the company is not trying to keep call centers and it is constantly being close to a downsizing or complete closing. It is very hard to maintain job security here
bad,Management used public humiliation to motivate workers.tasks were added but time to resolve issues and complete tasks required not increased. You could ask 6 managers the same question and get 6 incorrect answers. Benefits were fantastic but not worth the mental issues caused by working in that call center.
bad,This was the worst five years of my life. The hours are horrific. ZERO work/life balance. You want to schedule a doctor appointment in three months? Don't count on it - shifts are changed routinely based on seniority and NO exceptions. Rules and methods are changed hourly and you are coached for not keeping up with the new changes. Horrible place.
bad,I was let go because I didn't use my company cell phone in an area where there is no signal so I used my personal phone to call the customer. AT&T fired me because of something completely out of my control.
bad,Taking supervisor calls. Helping agents with questions. Discussing bills and technical issues.Enjoy helping others get issues resolved. A typical day checking emails for any new alerts log in the phone ready to assist agents with questions and take a escalated phone calls.
bad,"Organization is 100% metric focused, which has many limitations in our customer-centric climate.  For a tech company, it also moves slowly to resolve issues for customers such as product and pricing that are often urgently needed and on a short timeline.  Learning on the job is self-taught and there is a lack of mentorship in the retail channel.  Management on the retail side focuses solely on metrics and growth is limited to the company's current vision of target metrics; support of smart, thinking employees in this channel wavers at best.  Management on federal side is much stronger and focused on solving larger-picture problems, though speed of problem-resolution remains an issue."
bad,Poorest managed company I have ever worked for!  Was with DIRECTV before the buyout and the difference is night and day.   Management is so worried about losing there they are passing the stress to workers.
bad,Things have changed after the AT&T buyout of DIRECTV and nothing really cool to talk about.  AT&T does it their way or the highway.  It is very management heavy and good talent continues to leave.
bad,Terrible place to work.  Horrible leadership. Cut throat.  Job security isn't a thing and they hold it over your head to manipulate you and get you to do things that are unethical.
bad,Working at ATT you never new if your current day would be your last.  Multiple times a year the company reduces headcount and shifts jobs overseas or to contractors
bad,benefits were good and pay was good high very stressful high demand call volume. At times goals set by managers were unrealistic and if not met was looked down upon. didn't feel valued as an employee for 12 years.
bad,Worst communications company i have ever worked for. Management sets unrealistic goals. No work / family balance.Union is very weak. Not worth the application.
bad,The company like most runs off the needs of the business. I worked their for over 17 years and was able to see a lot . Their was not a lot of room for growth for the average person.
bad,"You must be willing to sit for long hours, answer back to back calls, and multi-task while dealing with upset customers.The ability to stay calm and work quickly under pressure is a must."
bad,"expect drama if you work in a bigger store. If you have more than 15 employees and managers, drama plays a huge part in work moral and creates a hostile work environment. I hope you don't have to experience this."
bad,"Not a friendly employee work environment, unless you were part of the manager's in group.  All employees not located in Atlanta were treated as outsiders.  No room for career growth.  Once you are in a group there is no chance at moving groups or departments unless you quit and come back as a new employee.  Answered phone calls from manager and co-workers on vacation with no reward for the disruption to the family time.  Cannot get promoted unless you are in either Dallas, TX or Atlanta, GA."
bad,The only good things about this job is that you have union representation if you chose to use them and the pay. other than that this place is terrible!
bad,I enjoyed talking on the phones too the customers and just the job it's self was nice I always had a smile on my face each and everyday I really miss this type of atmosphere.
bad,I have worked for the company for almost 3 years now and the longer I work here the worst it gets. The are constantly changing the hours of operation which means you get a worst shift with every shift bid. They are so tight on stats and stress you out if you don't pass for only one month but back on track the next. They don't listen to feedback with the problems going on with their systems all the time. There is no consistency and a lot of misinformation
bad,"Totally unethical company."
bad,"With an IT background I was extended a job offer to do satellite installations at customer's homes.  During my training and mentorship, one of the techs was taken aback that I had zero previous construction experience, and straight up told me ""You should not be doing this job.""  During my interview process, the supervisors knew I didn't have any previous experience with running cable, installing satellites, or handling power tools, but I was willing to learn and do what it takes to perform well.  None of them told me that construction experience was mandatory like my mentors did."
bad,"a typical day was to work your butt off with no recognition or appreciation. Management was condescending, belittling, and only cared about getting the sale. Management does not build people up they tear them down. Management doesn't understand the concept of motivation, encouragement, affirmation. They only understand one thing the mighty dollar nothing else matters to them. It's all about meeting the numbers and making the company more and more money."
bad,"No work life balance. Constant changing schedules, and I'd you aren't in Texas forgrt about moving up. Years of low hiring and constant pressure to perform."
bad,"The company continually pushes more work without added pay increase on to its employees and constantly creates a stress filled and taxing environment. Not a good company to work for.A typical day of work consists of being screamed at by customers for 8+ hours. I learned a lot about devices and technical support. The management was continually pushing the employees for numbers that can't be changed no matter how hard you try. The workplace culture is that everyone hates being there and coming to work. The hardest part of the job is waking up in the morning to a job that takes the life out of you, along with the fact that your schedule constantly changes and is based on seniority. The only enjoyable part of the job  was the pay."
bad,At&t is a very political company which has little to no job security at the entry level. Employees at At&t are really just another number and are no treated with respect.
bad,But when it switched over to At@t it was horrible we lost benefits and they brought premium techs in for less pay and laid technicians off management is aweful they micromanage everything you do only care about numbers nt the customer as bells out did oh and they put GPS on trucks and they don't believe in replacing trucks me and my brother worked here and quit my advise don't waist your time when senority was throne out the door they would promote people that had no idea how to do the job they were paper pushers
bad,This was an entry level position which was not well supported or managed.  It seemed to be created as an afterthought perhaps to act as a safety valve to the field techs.  Ultimately the entire department was eliminated.
bad,"Pay was excellent if you want to be a lifeless and sad robot. Environment was terrible, everyone makes sure you know that you are 100% replaceable. The most miserable I have ever been at a job."
bad,"I worked there when it was still directv.  Directv was great. Always promoting and always creating excitement for advancement.  As soon as ATT took over, they stopped all promotions and even cut management.  For over a year now, there has not been a single promotion in the site.  People are rapidly getting fed up with the lack of opportunity and the ever increasing demands that they place upon their frontline CSAs."
bad,basically you are treated like a middle school child and the managers always talk to you like your stupid. your always wrong and rules are made up on the spot. they dont give you what you need to do your job effectively and then yell at you because your hands are tied. the work itself is enjoyable and the pay is good. but its not worth how your treated.
bad,"I sold there for about a year. In that time the commotion structure changed 5 times. Each time taking money out of my pocket. They will right you up just to keep you at there store if your good or I have seen them transfer people just because they ""don't fit in"" everyone is lazy but that was nice at first because I could always be up next to get a customer but after they caped our commotions for the 3rd time there really wasn't money to be made. It was not a good place to work. On the other hand I loved working with the people there it was like a big family"
bad,"Customer service is the worst position to have at at&t.  You are just a number.  Benefits are awesome, however your job will be held in front of your noses on a daily basis. There is no consideration for your home life.  The pay would be your only reason for dealing with the job"
bad,"Worst management practices."
bad,"Place is downsizing every year.  You don't want to be a part of this train wreck.  Middle management is only looking to keep their spreadsheet looking good, no matter what the consequences or lies that need to be told."
bad,Very high stress environment and the managers micro manage you to the point where if you forget to say one word (you are required to say some things verbatim) you can be suspended for three days.  No opportunities for advancement since they are getting rid of more and more jobs in California.  They keep sending jobs to the Phillipines.  AT&T charges customer for their landline service but then doesn't want to spend money to fix the wires--They just keep patching them up before they try to sell the local landline service.
bad,"Never have I felt so unwanted or unappreciated in a job in my life.  Compensation is nice but if you're looking for a management staff that will stand behind you and a sales team you like working with,  look elsewhere.  I could approach my manager about anything and the answer I recieved was a shrug and ""I don't know how to fix that"" or ""I don't know what you want me to do about it"" . You can kill it in wireless and accessory sales which,  let's be honest,  is what most people come to the store for.  Selling thousands and thousands of dollars of both, but if you don't sell a DirecTV or digital life home automation,  you get a coaching and told how poorly you're doing.  They say you have job security here since it's unionized but if your unliked by a single person in the store,  you better believe they will find a way to try and make your time there a nightmarel. They don't allow you to help any customers in need and your coworkers do not have your back.  So much in fact,  they don't mind stepping into your sale and stealing it from you.  Hours are ridiculously long and the commission structure changes every day and Its never consistent so you can't plan for bills or what have you. Don't waste your time working for them if you're in the Harrisburg,  PA area unless you enjoy being belittled, yelled at day in and day out by irate customers and micromanaged by people who just want to see you fail."
bad,"This job does not care if you have family outside the job, they expect you to work WORK WORK. they don't care if you have emergencies or not they expect to do whatever they say. you never have days off. management is poorly trained"
bad,The hours are terrible. I've worked in 3 different stores over 5 years and the management is all the same; Idiots who sold well and was bumped up to managers but aren't qualified. The thing that gets you stuck there is the pay. You make really good money and the discounts are nice.
bad,It's a sales job that requires you to upsell on every call. This job was not the right fit for me. The initial trainer was phenomenal. The employees were great. The hardest part of the job was trying to sell something the customer didn't want.(hard sales)
bad,"I've worked at the Quail call center for almost two years. It has not been enjoyable. "
bad,Never have a family cute they don't care you life doesn't matter it's the numbers to them. Every thing is set for a tech to fail. Every chance they have they want to write u up no matter what scare tactics is what they are about.
bad,"no stable work hours changes weekly, many people left due to not able to finish school or have day care families demand not a good place to work if you have a life outside work"
bad,A typical day at work. Managers are no where to be found when employees need assistance. You find yourself running the whole show with no assistance. The equipment was always down and computers ran like dinosaurs. The hardest part of job was waking up doing it all over the next day. The most enjoyable moments is when your employees tell you they appreciate you as a manger for always been there for them. The most proud moment is when you have employees trying to come to your team but you already have 25 when the limit is 16. The saddest moment you put all your time and energy into the company. Thinking you will have a career and retire after 7 yrs some people 10 yrs you are let go laid off without a moment of notice. Because they decide to send work overseas now customers are suffering when trying to pay a bill. Language barrier issues and been over billed
bad,"Bad attendance policy , no work/life balance whatsoever. Management is terrible. The politics are awful."
bad,"I had a lot of experience working here dealing with phones, electronics, and customers. I left because im looking to expand and also start a business of my own."
bad,"It doesn't matter how good you are at your job the chances of being promoted or moving to another job in the company are somewhere between slim, and none. The only reason anyone works for this company is the pay. Micromanaging to the extreme."
bad,"Att doesn't really care about the work family balance. They only really care about Att, they would rather you come to work sick than call off, and you work with general public. You get penalized on a point system for calling off, and not very empathetic for its employees."
bad,I wasn't really a call center worker. I don't like it. I can't speak for many but this place is very time consuming. If you like call center work than this would be the best fit for you.
bad,"You apply for customer service & get interviewed for customer service-collections.  Nothing about collections in the job posting.  Management is constantly on you to make certain ""metrics"" (goals) & if you don't make those metrics by even a tenth of a point you get wrote up."
bad,"AT&T will not work with you. even if its an error on there end, all they care about is you making sales. if you don't make the sales, they fire you. sales are hard to make when every customer you talk is has a problem with their bill or need troubleshooting with their phone. you get 5 weeks of training which is not nearly enough training as they don't train you in all the programs necessary to do your job."
bad,"this job was very stressful and demeaning taking calls from irate customer and even when being cursed at could not end call had to try to calm customer and then sell to them even when they were connected with a competitor already.  management very demanding of meeting sales quotas that were unattainable and always being told that you were not good enough.  I learned some data entry and order input,  Co-workers were the best part of the job as we became like family because we were all in the same situation."
bad,"A typical day working as a Customer Assistant at AT&T can be stressful. However, I did gain technical skills. The work environment can alienate you. The hardest part of the job is remaining positive when there is so much uncertainty. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking with customers."
bad,while working there  the managers singled out certain employees for advancement and would disregard or negate the one that were qualified.
bad,"While being one of the largest companies in the world AT&T may seem it is a buttoned up fine tuned machine however chaos ensued on a daily basis and little guidance is provided by management.  That leaves the risk of spending a significant amount of time on work that may be viewed as unnecessary or incorrect.  This was a trend in most departments but specifically to my own in Operations."
bad,"The company offers good benefits and a really good training course that lasts 9 weeks. After training you are put on the field and then expected to perform at the level of someone who has been there for years. The performance goals are unrealistic and they never give an employee the benefit of the doubt for not hitting the goal. The treatment of employees is something horrible and almost degrading. Management will always tell you that your work is never enough and always mention that its ok to quit and just look for something else. Management will not support you or help you in any way. You are on your own and in need of looking to other veterans hoping they will help you. Safety is one thing they ""SAY"" is important and always come first. If it takes you a bit to properly place a ladder and secure it to be safe and come home to your family, you get yelled at for being to slow and almost reprimanded just for taking your time to be safe."
bad,"Underpaid workforce and incompetent management, many of whom did not have backgrounds in the areas they had jobs. Wide range of experience, from thing to many years. The veteran engineers knew that TDMA was on life support as the ""evil empire""--Qualcomm--was about to hit cellular technology with a tsunami."
bad,Now this may just be my district. It was more concerned with management advancing rather than the employees that contributed to the companies growth.
bad,The is a hard balance of having balance home and work as a new hire.  There is not set schedule. If you do not meet sales quota the management acts as if it is the end of the world!
bad,i learned how to be faster on the computer and use multiple tabs and tools as well as customer serrvice dealing with all types of customers
bad,This company does not accomodate your personal life no matter what the case is. They are absolutely horrible when it comes to any thing that could come up in one of its employees lives.
bad,"this job was very unorganized and was a waste of time. managers had no time to even train their employees, so there were new guys training new guys. that's the type of environment I was in."
bad,the company is not concerned with it's employees or their customers.The goal for management is to increase their bonus money at the expense of the customer and the employee.
bad,"Worked as a premise tech for 8 years only settled on the best install allways,the best quality work for my customers.but, the problem is what is called management are people that just want to get their retirement and will do anything to secure that instead of helping there tech's.expect to be scrutinized as if you are a inmate in a prison,only you don't get 3 squares a day! Upper managment is so bent on total control of the work force that they would rather suspend you for exstended periods of time ( 30 days,2 weeks) take your pick, for the most insignificant  things that you can imagine!But good news, if you are a robot, you will get a job here!keep looking!"
bad,I worked for this company for 6 1/2 years and they decided they wanted quantity not quality and I didn't believe that to be appropriate. On a typical day you would take calls and force people to log into their online accounts. Best part of the job was talking to all the wonderful customers.
bad,"co-worker were nice it was sometimes a nice environment to be in management could have been better, overall it was a job if you stay in your own lane you could be successful"
bad,While in every sales position and telecommincations the job is always changing. It just gets old fast and its a high stress environment.
bad,AT&T is again going through cuts and the team in NJ will be eventually moved to Dallas so the culture is not good....  Work hours are 10+ and the benefits are lower than other companies
bad,"micromanagement, unfairness from management, co workers are there for the money not the customer same as managers."
bad,"I had opportunity to learn not only within the project , also with the other skills that we have interest upon"
bad,Politics not really the best place to work at if your not a good fibber....sometimes you gotta sell at all costs
bad,"I learned to have more patience, not every person will handle a customer accordingly. I see myself as a customer with limitations, which makes me relate-able, personable, and conscientious.  The management team I worked with seemed ill prepared many times. Notably so, because the company was still in groundbreaking stages. My co-workers were always awesome. The hardest part of the job was having to give a customer some negative news about his or her services, due to a situation outside of my control. The most enjoyable part of the job is making a customer see light at the end of the tunnel by either fixing an ongoing issue, crediting account for service outage, or both."
bad,"My main complain was the schedule and how they had a seniority picks first form, if you worked there for 10 yrs sold barely anything , You will be considered a senior therefore pick the schedule you wanted 1st including weekends off,the days you wanted free, and of course mon-fri 8-5  If you were new you would have to suck it up and get what you get because you were at the bottom of the seniority list. which meant working the whole month with no weekends. all closing shifts, just lovely lol"
bad,"If you want some quick money work there, but don's depend on staying there."
bad,"Worst company I have Ever worked for. management does not care about you as a person. All they care about is numbers. They want you to be a sleazy salesman. Lie to customers and tell them that their bill will be 100$ when in reality it will be 200$. You will have no life and will be asked to work 6 days a week for 10 hours a day. don't have a bad month, you will lose your job if you do."
bad,Working here I learned a lot as far as customer service. The hardest part of the job was the unwillingness to work with the CSR's from management. The most enjoyable part was working with customer and solving any and all of their problems or issues with our services
bad,"I never worked for a company that completely controls your life.  You find out your first job of the day at 6am, but have no idea where or what you have for the rest of the day."
bad,Company could careless about you as a person they are quick to accuse and quicker to terminate.  Upper mgmt micromanages everyone to the max and scrutinize everything you do and if you a good job they think you're doing something wrong and refuse to believe that your team could do that well.
bad,"AT&T is only worried about making that almighty dollar. Setting goals for their employee's that is almost impossible to reach. Management doesn't care about their team, or employee's. Can't take sick time unless time is available. AT&T expects the employee's to work and operate like robots."
bad,AT&T is the type of company to expect the best customer service. They like to keep their agents on the phone rather than move them up. The management is horrible towards you unless youre well liked & a favorite obviously.
bad,"What an experience! I have 15 years of sales experience, including 5 years, working for the largest Verizon Wireless dealer. This was by far the worst. Management in the Wesley Chapel, Fl. location made this position unbearable. When your weakest links are your leaders, it will never matter how well your sales staff  perform. I'll NEVER forget the time I sold almost $500 worth of accessories,mifi and upgrade to one customer, several $20-$50 units, which was admittedly by management the most she'd ever seen, immediately reprimand me for not pitching, digital life. Ok, yes I should have, but to not let me have my moment was beyond ridiculous and should have been handled in a positive way. The most apparent part of this experience was that EVERYONE was miserable with the possible exception of the positions above management. I didn't want to be them in the future, so I resigned quickly."
bad,"they are all about get you in and getting you out. never worried about you as a employee. managers have no communication,"
bad,"You are only a number on the tenure list, treated like a dog until you get to the top 10 but 150 have to retire first!!!"
bad,"Management is not fair, the job is unrealistic, and there is no sympathy when it comes to things that may arise in a person life.  There is no Job/Life balance.  AT&T expects you life to be the job during and work hours so no unexpected things should arise with children, doctor appointments, getting sick, or wrecks.  Very selfish one-sided employer."
bad,There Manager was completly un-true about the things he said and no one did a thing about it. How does a company allow things like this to happen?
bad,When the company turned into Yellow Pages things changed for the worst
bad,Very high turnover rate due to managers that care about nothing but numbers on your metrics.
bad,"Do not ever work for this company. They treat their employees like garbage. A typical day is having your manager tell you to tell ""semi-truths"" to the customers, and when you get written up for doing what you are told to do, the manager will say they never told you to do or say that."
bad,"Att forces employees to work mandatory over time, stresses them out all the time with stuff that does not matter and treats them horrifically!"
bad,"if your a good salesman you can make alot of money here, but not without putting up with alot of drama."
bad,"If you enjoy an over Micro-managed position, a Wire Tech position is totally for you.  If you like working from 7:30/8 am - 9/Midnight this job is for you.  Wire Techs are setup to fail, the company policy is to be safe, but at the same time will want you to climb a latter with thunder and lightening around.  The time allotted to do specific tasks are unrealistic. They expect you to perform an install in a certain amount of time, however they don't factor in any problems that will occur, that is beyond your control and scope of work.  if you get hurt, you get wrote up, if you have an accident, you get wrote up.  If you need to take a day off unscheduled, you get wrote up.  After 3 write ups you get a 3 day suspension W/O pay.  I am not enjoying this job at all.  I don't feel they manage employees the way they should."
bad,"New product in field, Learn as we go and not given any time for performing new tasks. Management numbers not being administered fairly. Hurry to first job, rush through and try give customer all information while on the go, Being inspected by a manager that has never worked in the field to show up and offer advice, costing you valuable productive job time. Good co-workers all learning and performing under same circumstances. Eagar to help one another. Hardest part of job is being forced to work excessivly long physically demanding hours, Schedule constantly changing and forcing us to work six days a week thus killing our family time. The most enjoyable part is watching the customer learn about new tv services, and watching new technician learn about new services."
bad,"need to find a job with a better work/life balance. "
bad,"completely regret making the decision to work for this company gives a bad name to AT&T and anybody that represents them... no orginization, company does not care about customers or employees, All in all i believe whoever own and runs the company is a crook and someone needs o sue this authorized retailer!!!!!"
bad,Pay is best in industry but it comes at a high price. Company and Managers are extremely unreasonable in demands and they keep you in a constant state of concern for job security.
bad,"I worked for At&t formally Bellsouth for 17 years and was unfortunately terminated for unknown reason to my knowledge. The company has gone down the drain and management doesn't have a clue and don't care about anything dealing with telephoning. They have discriminatory practices and I believe that was the reason for my dismissal. The best thing At&t has going for them is the employees that still exist there that care about their work. I wouldn't advise anyone to work for them in Broward County Fl, if youre not white."
bad,"When I first started working for the company I worked the 12-9 shifts and Saturdays, which was not bad. I was told the longer that I worked at the company the higher my sonority would go allowing me to have weekends off and working 8-5 shifts or 7-4 shifts. Which after working three years I did start to get earlier shifts with holidays off and weekends off. I was hired to help customer's with their bills and currant service. However after working there five years, ATT focused more on selling things to customer to force it down the customer's throat, and our job security was threaten if we did not sell. Then our sonority went out the window we were scheduled later hours and holidays again. The company started treating both the customers and the workers horrible. Before the company started to get consumed with selling their products it was a great full time job with wonderful benefits. I liked the set hours, and knowing I had medical, dental and 401k benefits. Once the company changed to focusing on selling the company no longer became a secured place to work for."
bad,This is a good paying job. There is no job security. DTV has a very high turnover rate. They fired people over ridiculous unrealistic metrics they set each month. The metrics are not the same for each employee but they all get the same kind of calls daily. Its a stressful job. Management don't make it any better with their constant threats of firing you.
bad,"Not a great company to work for, they do compensate you very well however if you have morals and values this isnt the place to work."
bad,"Nobody cares about the employee anymore, its all about negative and how bad everybody sucks at their jobs."
bad,"A typical day at work was to take high volume of incoming/outgoing calls taking payments and making payment arrangements within company guidelines. What I learned working for this company how important it is to give great customer service and how to empathize with customers when they are in certain situations that are out of there hands. As representative I went above and beyond to make sure they where assisted to ,maintain there services."
bad,A great place to make sales. If you like selling products to others it's a great place to start.
bad,"Loved my job. Managers are hard to work with. Good employees are not appreciated, others work the system. Hated when they closed our office and sent our work to Corpus Christi."
bad,"A typica day is getting dispatched and hoping the work order is in order. If you are lucky you dont get lost using the gps on your ipad ( we techs cant access google maps anymore). I learn something new each day. Ordinarily that would be a good thing but here, it's a skill set that you did not learn in training and now will have to call your boss who berates you for not knowing this aspect of job, completely ignoring the fact that you had no prior knowledge!"
bad,Extremely difficult company to work for. Do not recommend anyone with any common sense to work here.
bad,no job security what so ever my schedule was switched and i only had a week to switch or i would be terminated
bad,I didn't like feeling like I was a cog in well oiled machine. I felt like I could have been replaced at any moment.
bad,"I enjoyed working for AT&T, but if you have a family this is not the place for you. Job security is not guaranteed."
bad,This position would be great if it was not for the manager. Very unethical and abusive
bad,"Answer phones, be exempt from jury duty as an operator as you are a civil servant in this department. Turn on a light to go to the restroom, turn it off upon return when the next standing person has a chance to run to the light , turn it on and go ONLY if they can close the current call they are on before the next 1-5 people close their calls and run to the light. lol. You have to be on the cordboard or TSPS console within seconds of your work start time. If your cab was late or bus breaks down or you face a traffic jam, The company writes you up and tells you, you should have taken an alternate route, bus, or planned ahead. They frankly don't care. If you cover your mouth piece you BETTER cough or sneeze or you can be written up. There is a legal reason backing this."
bad,"There's no advancement, not a fun or productive place to work"
bad,This company is a bad company because the put extra pressure and some is unnecessary. on it's technicians. They have better than average benefits and good salary.
bad,They have no respect for you as a human being. I was pregnant and went into labor early on the job. The doctor put me on bed rest since my due date was still 1 month away and I kept having far apart contractions. They first approved it then when I came back to work they suspended me because FMLA decided to deny my claim. My co-workers son had an asthma attach in school. When she checked her messages at lunch the school said they have left several messages at work about her son. They never came to tell her and worst they didn't want to let her leave and threatned her with her job she was there crying.
bad,I worked in an inbound call center that handled customer service as well as inside sales. This essentially means that irate customers call in to complain about the high cost of their bill and you are expected to sell them new products and services. If you have any integrity you will not be successful at this job.
bad,"AT&T is hiring employees in Slovakia and India to take over being system administrators and database administrators, leaving American workers jobs at risk -- actually they will soon be on their way out..."
bad,"Great pay with excellent benefits which included free health care. Horrible with vacation time which you are never able to take, no personal time available and you work 12-16 hours a day listening to people complain about a 1.00 charge on their phone bill."
bad,"I work in New Albany Indiana. I am a repairmen that fixes the phone cable. Management will not let us do our job right the first but instead we go back time & time again. The cable is very old (1970's) & shouldve been replaced in the 1990's. I feel so sorry for the customers that live in the country without cell service. Im also sick of the lies that we are told by management & the lies management tells the customers. I would love to see security escort these jokers off the property but they are told what to do by corporate. In the good ole days you didnt come back to the garage unless all customers were back in service. Now you have to have special special permission to work over 2 hrs on any job or you will get written up. This place is worse than the Marine cor. I am very surprised that more technicians arent on here complaining unless they dont know about this blog. Management is ignorant to say the least. They dont do our job nor can they, yet they have all this advice. Managements favorit quote is ""Just Do It & Stuff"". What ignorance. You will be persecuted on a daily basis no matter how well you do your job. Its all part of the ""Beat Down"" mentality. I dont know of any lazy people here except management. No wonder they pay mgrs very little, they dont do anything! Ive seen alot of people get railroaded & lose their jobs. I read some of these blogs on how great AT&T is but can only assume it is management covering the companies rear & lyeing. Fellow workers are taking ""Stress Leave"" all the time. Sure the medical benefits are great for the family but use them for yourself"
bad,"as a U-verse tech i was responsable for the customer service and work to be done run lines, change tips, program boxes and TVs all this job had t be done with in the time frame given by the system and ontop of that mannager wil call and sence they were gided by numbers and there manager were ontop of them they will take it out on us as a premises technichian you qre at the end of the chani between the lock and the chain"
bad,I worked for a part of the company that was a complete opposite from the rest ofthe company. They did not offer flex time or sick days.
bad,Its a great job and has great pay but the job is all about work and no play. The manager's are all rude and very unbusiness like.
bad,"Great benefits; quotas are unbelievable; if you have a counscious, your job security is zero to none. You are coached to say anything to get the sale...if it means lying"
bad,"They had good benefits and okay pay ( constantly adding on more work without increasing pay) but the company as a whole is horrible to work for. In all honesty I only stayed as long as I did (6 years) before quitting to focus on school, was because of the benefits they offered which is hard to beat even if the amount we had to pay for it went up every contract. But that’s the only thing the company has going for them."
bad,"There is not much job security   Ethical sales behavior Is absent   Leader ship is aware of an ethical behavior but turns a blind eye to get the number   The company has always encouraged diversity however the state of Georgia is racially divided "
bad,"You will be expected to work in rain, snow, ice, wind, or apocalypse. You will work long hours under exhaustive management and are expected to install services with a very high quality within an impossible time window. Installs that can take between 6-8 hours will only be alotted about 4-5 hours worth of time. The work is great but the management is very poor. This is why uverse will be cutting their employment by 20% by the end of 2020."
bad,"Would not recommend working here, there is a growing trend of outsourcing underway at ATT.  Hundreds of employees, many who have worked there for 20+ years, are being let go in order to bring in cheaper offshore people.  Stay away."
bad,not a good time and management was not there and when they where they did not want to help. they had required overtime on a monthly bases. they will not help the cust with a real issues if they dont have too
bad,Its not a job for someone with a family. It better for someone that is single and all they want in life is to make money and nothing else. IN the credit and activation department. You will work every holiday and weekend. No rotation in holidays. Its a good department and easy department but you will not have any life time
bad,"Worse job I ever had. Benefits was good and having FMLA, which most of us needed. Majority of the managers were cool and tried to help. Too much under the table going on to meet goals at this call center and others. Surprised it's not under investigation like Well Fargo. Customers complained and worshipped their phones. Majority of time the salesman sold them a pipe dream and they called us to complain , instead of going back to the source. All money isn't good money. Before we switched to the Retention department our job wasn't stressful, it hit the fan afterwards."
bad,"Everyone is expendable "
bad,"Company only cares about the share holders bottom line, they don’t care about employees or customers, it’s all about sales not resolving the customer’s issues"
bad,"Besides being laid off earlier this year, AT &T has been a great place to work."
bad,poor management they treat people very bad . its like evry time the managers are trying to get people to fire so they can look good at their bosses etc..
bad,"If you’re a technician be prepared to work your tail off for your pay..some managers are fair while others are harsh and unreasonable. This company will lay you off no matter your experience, performance or knowledge. I worked there for 5 years and was let go due to a terrible manager. The pay is great and benefits are good though."
bad,"The job itself is fulfilling. However the pressures to finish installs and repairs in a certain amount of time due to company metrics is quite stressful. Managers will push you to the limit, but also tell you to work safe, but pressuring you to do quality work really fast. They don’t care about customers I see it first hand just get the job done. And in the summer just be prepared to work 6 day 12+ hours a day week in and week out."
bad,"No tienes vida personal, tus descansos son trabajados por igual, ninguna inducción o capacitación."
bad,Phone rooms are run like boiler rooms.  The only thing that matters is more sales.  You are encouraged to push products on customers even if it makes no sense for them.  Wost employment experience of my life.
bad,"Hay muchisimas llamadas, siempre estas llamada tras llamada, el crecimiento es muy selectivo, es muy estresante, mucha carga laboral, agotamiento mental, los clientes siempre estan molestos, son groseros, los compañeros son agradables y el cafe es muy rico, los vales de despensa son lo mejor."
bad,I believe that other segments of AT&T are ran very well. AT&T Consulting is only about two years old. Very poorly managed. Sr Managers have very low technical screening skills resulting in un qualified Sr. Technical people with gradious titles and no experience or knowledge. Projects suffer as a result.
bad,"AT&T is going to keep letting people go until there is nothing left of the company. They are running it and every company they buy into the ground. They are constantly outsourcing. They do not value loyalty or commitment, only the price of the share."
bad,"Competitive, cutthroat place to work.  Favoritism. Too many rules, regulations, practices and policies to keep up with. Metrics that are used to grade technicians is unobtainable unless you cheat. Stressful.  Always worried about what kind of meeting you will be called in for this week.  I got good training in the beginning. Towards the end of my 6 years, training for complex subjects was 1 or 2 day or just handed to you in a handout format.  I felt a weight lifted off my shoulders when I left. The only reason I stayed that long because the money was good.  Untrained supervisors.  I had a new supervisor almost every year."
bad,I was paid well at ATT.  Wire technicians are treated like red headed step children by both the union and ATT.  I had 6 managers in 2 years at ATT.  The turnover rate for wire techs is extremely high.
bad,"Would not reccomend for anyone with a family, friends, or any kind of social life. Forced over time is a given ay least 6 months out of the year. Lowest seniority will be working every holiday."
bad,No comment. Employees. Are only a number. All about the bottom dollar. No consideration for employees personal ot emotional needs Started out ad my dream job but later years it changed. Not employee oriented any longer
bad,As a wire tech it is the worst job at AT&T. Long hours means almost no home life. 6 day work weeks are very common during the summer months. Upper management treats you like you are a burden not an asset. Your job is constantly being threatened with layoffs.
bad,"Great working with the customer and trouble shooting with them, a blast working with other departments, exciting testing with other companies, enjoyed having the confidence to work without management supervision."
bad,"transferred when DirecTV was bought out.  I traveled for 3 years training their staff, received great reviews and feed back. Laid off ,very shocked because I was promised that I had nothing to worry about."
bad,"AT&T comenzó bien, con una cultura hacia el confort del empleado en call center. Sin embargo, duró poco y salió a relucir su verdadera naturaleza. Salarios cada vez más bajos, dejo de contratar directamente para pasar a una outsourcing que en caso de permanencia el contrato tarda un año o más, las prestaciones son distintas entre las razones sociales, siendo el call center la más golpeada (at&t conecta de México) dónde se ingresan horarios infrahumanos parece que regresamos a 1800 con jornadas de 10:30 horas ¿Y la vida en balance que tanto pregones at&t? Es solo un espejismos"
bad,"well, I started 7 years ago and immediately my manager said he was going to fire me and if he fires me I can not receive unemployment. which was a lie."
bad,"Aprendes demasiado, sobre todo en un ambiente bajo presión."
bad,Micromanaged to death. One weekend off a month and if you have no seniority you’ll never have your off days together. Managers try to sneak up on you. You work in dirty unsafe homes but management will not work with you or support you. Hated every minute except for the training.
bad,Very fast Paced. Customer's are so rude when you are only trying to help them. Get burned out very quickly. Management acts as bosses and not leaders.
bad,"The Pay was good. I would have stayed, but mandatory over time from the distance i was working from home meant not a lot of time with my 4yo daughter. Its super important we have a bond."
bad,"Their management is horrible. The store"
bad,"Estuve un año trabajando para esta empresa para la campaña de Credit and collections de servicios celulares. Trabajé en el horario de 10 horas diarias y después me cambié al de 8horas. Llegaba a las 7am y desde el primer instante en el que le das auto in a tu avaya empieza el back to back. Tienes 30 minutos de comida y cuidado con pasarte un minuto porque el supervisor estará arriba de ti. No puedes ir al baño fuera de tus 30mins de comida. La gran mayoría de los clientes te llaman enojados y gritando te. Tu trabajo será convencerlos a que paguen mientras escuchas sus gritos. Si al cliente no le gustó tu cobranza o tu servicio te pueden dar un mal review de cómo lo hiciste, la gran mayoría de los que contestan esos review son los que están super enojados y se quieren desquitar o los viejitos que no saben responder los reviews. Tienes una métrica que solo te permite tener uno o dos bad reviews para estar dentro de meta al mes, usualmente te caen de a 12 reviews por mes. Muchos clientes son racistas y te piden un ""american agent"" si te escuchan algún acento, los mejores clientes son los latinos en español, ellos hasta te piden disculpas por no haber pagado. La gran mayoría de los supervisores son un asco y siempre te estarán recordando lo mal que haces en tus llamadas aunque tengas números buenos. Las métricas son casi imposibles de alcanzar y para como va la campaña las van a subir mas. No puedes tardar mas de 5minutos en llamada porque el supervisor te estará monitoreando. No puedes tranferir mas de 6 veces al día, la mayoría de la gente no habla para pagar (hablan para comprar"
bad,This job was consist of unfair pay and long hours. The benefits was great but you also need great pay to take care of your family.  The hours were long and also without notice. An employer hired with a known family with kids and I could barely afford daycare and by law you have to pick of your kids by certain hours per facility.
bad,Everyday was a worry as to who was next to be fired. The best techs were let go as well as the worse. Any day could be anyone's ticket out just depending on how someone felt. In the field even the simplist inconsequential error was enough for a upset manager or higher up to run on and try to fire you. Using sick time or leave was the worse offense and upon return you would find yourself on a write up or decision making leave. The Pay was great when you considered no education could get you over $24 an hour. All of the over time and out of town time as well helped pay a lot of bills. However its high pay and high stress.
bad,"Great company. Center leaders abuse their power in the call center environment and it trickles down to the coaches who don’t have much say or control. VP of sales is a phenomenal leader and some directors and area leaders are fair. Unfortunately, those in power don’t know the reality of what occurs because everyone is on their best behavior when visits occur. Front lines people are not truly heard or valued especially if you’re a person of character and integrity."
bad,It’s never enough always want more. Long hours no time for family. Turnover is high even with good pay. That should say something. Never know when you will get off so don’t make plans
bad,West Sacramento yard is a joke. Management are dishonest and pathetic. If you dont kiss butt you will be treated like dirt . some people do nothing all day
bad,"I thoroughly disliked my employment with AT&T. Although the pay was fair, the environment was terrible. Nobody enjoyed being there due to the nature of the relationships between other co-workers and managers. Managers played favorites with their employees and had a severe sense of self-entitlement. As an employee, you were always blamed for issues that would arise, while management pretended like they weren’t to blame for your lack of training or education with company policies and procedures. The training is a complete joke and hardly prepares you for the floor. It seems like you are performing the job of 2-3 people on any given day, which is probably why they have to pay you decently. Managers had sketchy sales habits and didn’t follow the policies much. A couple of my co-workers were great, however, most of them are lazy and miserable people who create high school drama in which even managers get involved in. Many people have left and the only reason anyone stays is for the money. Not worth your sanity. Look elsewhere and be advised."
bad,"If you like the mundane, being told what to do, being a robot just to meet the company's goals for their shareholders to make more this is the place for you. "
bad,"This company is not really a customer service company, they are more sales based, I received more coachings for being too customer service and not enough sales oriented"
bad,Poor upper management and lack of leadership from Area managers to the Director in the Midwest. You need to part of the good ol boys club to advance in the company. Friends within the organization are more important then your skill level and knowledge.
bad,"Whatever AT&T touches turns to garbage. It happened to BellSouth, it happened to Direct TV, and it's about to happen to HBO. They have no real vision. My first manager told me to start looking for a new job the day you are hired. Great advice."
bad,"Managers are uneducated and undereducated.  Stressful work environment.  If you dont party after work with management you wont be a favorite. If you dont sell to EVERYONE,  your job is on the line"
bad,"This was easily the most stressful job I have had. You are supposed to lead with a specific package of internet and TV, and if you didn’t/can’t, you better have a VERY good reason. You are expected to hit 30% of your DTV sales and 10% of internet sales … regardless if you are getting qualified calls or not. If you are about making money, upsetting and belittling customers, and love the “looking over your shoulder” feeling, this may be the place for you."
bad,"Sales was becoming the main focus of att when i left and no so much and focusing on what the customer wanted when they called in "
bad,Co-workers are very friendly. Immediate management realistic and down to earth. Upper - Management very hands off and unrealistic. Overall cooperation shifted commission into a new product that was not the reason for customers coming into the establishment in the first place. In times of need upper - management was not to be found taking personal and vacation time often and barking orders. Creating a very stressful environment for us at the store level. Even if our customer experience goals were over achieved that was not good enough and eventually became an accolade never recognized.
bad,"You are trained at a training facility, and alternate back and forth from there and the location you will work at. You ride with another technician one week and school the following until training is completed. The training is good but nowhere near the real world situations you will encounter. You basically end up being thrown on your own. There was only one good manager at my location. Everyone quietly wanted to be on his team because he actually managed and would come to your job and help or at least try to assist if you had an issue. The other three were lazy and if/when you called them it was like you were bothering them. Their day consisted of getting us out in the morning as fast as they could, riding around burning company gas acting like they were working, playing games on their phone, eating lunch, and going home. They had their “favorites” who were allowed to do things others couldn’t. They spoke very inappropriately almost daily. Unfortunately for some of the guys that called HR, they were mysteriously fired shortly after their complaints. Managers somehow knew who called to complain about them and at that point found ways to filter them out by writing them up for minor infractions and creating a paper trail to fire them. Union representation was a joke! They were close friends with management so guys didn’t have a shot in at fighting bogus write ups. The union rep and manager would talk beforehand and decide on what your punishment would be before you even had a chance to defend yourself. You are supposed to be able to call union representation if needed for any"
bad,"Have a backup plan, surplus will become a common terminology while working here.  Regardless of tenure or achievements layoffs come every year and surviving is like a merit badge."
bad,Large company that is inventing new technologies and moving into new lines of business as it looks to diverse itself.  It is going through a major transformation. I am glad to have had the opportunity to work there.
bad,"I start my day by holding a status meeting with my staff auditor to determine their level of completion, then compiling of working papers to write my audit reports."
bad,Basically a well paid retail job. Personal life is non existent and this company does not care about employees. Management says they care but if you are selling the way they think you should they don't help you they just push you out the door.
bad,"I was excited at first. I was told there would be job stability, and advancement. Non of this happened. After a year of my hard efforts there was a surprise layoff. There was one month of severance pay, with no explanation."
bad,Bad company that doesn't care about their employees only profit. Will not care what you say even if you are right and they are wrong. Management just slacks off and blames the people under them.
bad,The company wants to get rid of the technician all together.  They want customers to be able to take a box home and plug it in.  Increase profits and not have to pay employees.
bad,"Not a good place to start a career-constant job cuts then budget cuts while buying other companys. Benefits getting cut as well, one would be better served looking elsewhere."
bad,"Horrible and racist manager, made the job really stressful. If your quotas wasn’t met your job was always on the line. You were forced to set up DTV with each customer even if they didn’t want it, which created fraud churn."
bad,"In general, the company values are strong. Unfortunately, they are not followed in the entry level positions. It seems money is driving ethics and accountability is missing. If they find a way to make the culture work throughought all departments, they have a chance to do better."
bad,"I never was placed next to my team. Always separated from them."
bad,"Very good training and benefits. Management very disrespectful to employees. Most coworkers are willing to help new employees, but some are more concerned about personal stats. Schedules weren't bad, there was plenty of overtime. High turnover rate. Will find ways to limit your bonuses with unwarranted reprimands. Very stressful."
bad,"The pay was excellent but the work experience was terrible, Standards that are almost impossible to meet creates a lot of stress, the constantly changing schedule makes it impossible to have a life outside of work"
bad,had to make sales on each calls and had to have outstanding customer service on each call and had to multitask with computer to note accounts per call
bad,"At&t received a huge tax cut and said they were going to create thousands of jobs.  Over the last year, the number of jobs they have created has matched the number of people they let go. Premise technicians are forced to work 50-54 hours per week or will be written up.  There are rumors that they will be forced to work six (9) hour days only giving employees one day off per week.  Other areas are already enforcing the six day work week.  In southeastern Wisconsin, we have lost almost one third of our workforce since 2016. The majority of people that left the company so that they could have a better work/social life balance.  At&t has not hired any new technicians in about five years.  This company has made over $30 billion dollars profit in the last two years and still refuses to hire needed technicians. The $30 billion is pure profit, not the total amount they have taken in over the last two years which I believe is somewhere around $150 billion."
bad,"Just another big company that uses it's employees as bartering chips,I was surpluses after 12 years with no call back opportunities.Just dumped and found out it was a plan they had with all the new hires, they just play with your life."
bad,"While I enjoy working hard, management never stopped an overabundance of overtime which looking back I feel is extremely dangerous to anyone's health. While they liked to talk about career opportunities in the 7 years I was there no matter how hard I tried, no doors were opened. Micro-managed to the hilt. Extremely stressful nearly daily ambulance visits upon arrival at work. Not impressed with how hard they push their employees."
bad,"it's an ok job for the pay rate and the fringe benefits. 50% off entire wireless bill, DTV for $10 month, medical, dental, vision, and retirement. management above store level is a joke. DOS in my area has no clue about regional market demographics and could care less about employees and their lives outside of work. only cares about bottom line and sales numbers and doesn't care that stores can't always meet the quota, again, market dependent. almost always a ""why didn't you do better"" mentality from ARSM and above."
bad,Company changes so much with no regard for employees. They expect you to understand material with little training. Their tool is online access via their intranet. This makes customer service lag.
bad,The job honestly wouldn't be too bad without the crazy manager environment. They split hairs with the rules to keep all of the employees on their toes. I had a coworker that got written up for heaving an empty bottle of coca-cola behind the seat of his single cab truck. The manager stated it was a safety violation.
bad,"Works partially on commission, which means you have other reps take your sales.  Management does whatever they want and reps just have to deal with it. Rules change all the time.  Management changes all the time.  Current management plays favorites to better sales reps. Constantly in trouble for not selling things to customers when they already have services or not demoing services and accessories when they have already said they don't want something."
bad,"At&t puts up a front of being a great company. They consume your best efforts and don't replenish you with proper compensation. They truly thrive on the success of others. It could be said, “hypothetically”, that they literally have a scheduled model for getting rid of people every month. They are a machine. I am not a fan and don’t appreciate their approach."
bad,"Training is rushed. Taking calls after 3 weeks. Trainers teach you shady things that get you in trouble in coaching down the road. And forced to stay past desired shift because calls still come in at 9pm. Also you are required to sell DirecTV by asking every customer what their life story is first, you cant just start talking about its wonderful services. Managers are never around when you need them and each manager tells you a different teaching method of how things need to be done. Very stressful job due to not being to be able to sell how the customer should be sold on a product."
bad,"Union workplace with different rules/contracts for different areas.  uncertain job future even with union in place.  most management is actually the best part, but those could be cut at anytime as well."
bad,Forced to pick up work from all the departments they downsize and long term goal of the company is to cut costs by sending jobs overseas . Fmla leave is disputed aggressively and are treated like a peg in the machine
bad,"Switched days to make Sunday a work day, and now they don't work on Sunday's.  Management was good, but they were only as good as upper management.  The Job Culture was not very good at all.  Yuck"
bad,"management sucks, that goes for a lot of coaches, upper management sucks even more because they put stuff on the coaches....maybe you'll find 1 manager who cares but overall rating sucks.  pay is good.  be careful, you're gonna be walking on eggshells, literally.  After a while depression starts to kick in and then anxiety.  And theres no help provided for that. It honestly is a medical condition that forms in this environment at at&t. Coaches are backstabbers and i'm telling the truth."
bad,"At first, AT&T Mobility was a great place to work but then ""maximizing shareholder profits"" crept in and nearly the entire department was laid off."
bad,This is a good job to work if you are only doing it short term. There is a lot of job burnout. Goals always change and a lot of the goals are unrealistic. Upper Management is horrible. Horrible work life balance.
bad,they made our quota almost impossible to reach to the point it gave me and most employees anxiety attacks cause we were threatened for our job every day
bad,"You will work and be required to work overtime. You job even though it is union, is not guaranteed because they are constantly outsourcing jobs and surplus the jobs in the US."
bad,I would like to thank At&t for the tremendous knowledge about low voltage. I was able to parlay that into my own business. Other than that I could care less about the people there.
bad,Trainer wanted to party with new employees. Managers did not care about employees or asked their input. Everything you did was dictated by managers. Including bathroom breaks. Customers on the phone were extremely abusive. Would not recommend anyone have to go through that.
bad,No possible advancement with management holding you back.  Work is expected to continue during home life.  There is no separation between work and personnel life.
bad,"Lots of pressure for number and they don't care how you get them- lots of cheating, lack of ethics, lack of work life balance. People that will do anything to get ahead."
bad,"It would be impossible to write down everything wrong with the company in less than a 10 page essay so I will try to keep it brief. But before I go into too much detail, let me assure you I am not just another disgruntled employee. I actually left the company on good terms. That being said, I feel that it is my civic responsibility to do what I can to inform people of what they are getting themselves into by looking into this company for employment. "
bad,This company will do a really good job of baiting you in with incentives and work life balance but you will find that that may not always be the case. The company is a good place to work if your life is fully dedicated to work
bad,Most companies are either pro customer or pro employee. AT&T was pro dollar. The company didn't care about it employees and most of the customers were treated as just another dollar. Management was poor and difficult at best. Very stressful work environment.
bad,The 117% turnover rate speaks for itself. Terrible management and communication. Very Hostile work environment and the worse job that I ever had. Do not work here. Not worth your time or money
bad,"AT&T is more concerned as a company with making money and meeting(or exceeding ) the bottom line predictions, than with taking care of their loyal customers. The field texhnician job is the most thankless position in the company.  It should be the best position considering that this position is responsible for the actual service and delivery of their products."
bad,"While I worked at this location the management constantly cheated customers.  If a product was on sale and the customer didn't know it, we were told to charge full price for the items so our commission and sales would be greater."
bad,Some of the managers were amazing to work with but when it came down to scheduling you didn't really have a say. If there were not enough people on shift or not enough people signed up for overtime they made overtime mandatory for everyone and you couldn't get out of it. They were not willing to work with my schedule when I needed it most.
bad,"I started out loving my job..then company take over and employees started being treated unfairly..pay is great. But you get paid time off for sick days but get assessed points for using your sick days. Cost of insurance keeps increasing..job security keeps getting threatened..unhonest upper management,  unfair treatment"
bad,All in all they are not a good company to work for. It was very disorganized and very stressful. We could never get proper support for the project. Also had a team member who tried to derail the project.
bad,"Poor management.  Poor work environment, worst company I have ever worked.  They do not care employees only the $$$$. I would not recommend anyone to work there unless they are desperate for money."
bad,"Benefits and pay are great for a job at AT&T. But, the management is very poor. The ethics department don't help at all. I wish I had a better experience with the company."
bad,"It is exactly what you would expect from a call center. Take 60-120 calls a day and be expected to only talk to each customer for a certain amount of time or you will be fired. They analyze how long you take on each call and what you do on each call. They require each call to be within a certain amount of their Key Performance Indicators, otherwise you can be fired."
bad,El empleo es tedioso y no hay un respeto de la empresa con sus empleados
bad,"I work cell site troubles - It's a very repetitive job - We have a good local manager but CEO is untrustworthy and only interested in revenue and not customers - There are multiple job lay-offs in the company every year which gives you no job security - Basically, we are high paid secretaries in a very unsatisfying occupation in the group I am in."
bad,"AT&T does not care about it's customers, they are pure profit and as a worker you are not allowed to have the customers best intentions at heart. In fact you are encouraged to take advantage and place the patrons in debt, the system is awful and morally wrong. Constantly being threatened of being fired by management by not selling enough directv packages to a store that saw very little traffic is stressful and discouraging."
bad,This was a highly stressful job that was mostly sales driven and calls had to be answered fast. You were limited on time to assist customers and forced to sell on every contact.
bad,Unionized technicians but managers aren't Unionized so they can't really discuss anything with you. Managers use shady tactics and can't be trusted and only care about their teams numbers
bad,Be careful when you go to get a job with AT&T you are just a number for their benefit they do not see you as a person and you are expendable hence why i am looking for a job
bad,Lots of fake enthusiasm and cheerleading. Only real concern is bottom dollar. Taking advantage of customers was part of sales training. Very picky on rules always trying to catch someone even when customer was well taken care of if no sale was made.
bad,"Too big, too corporate. It's just a nightmare and a clusterF$&& mess. They keep raising expectations on sales metrics but lowering the commission structure."
bad,My job used to be about helping customers and fixing their problems. it has become a mental health hazard that most people are running away from. sure we get benefits that are pretty great but nothing is worth the breakdowns that the place causes.
bad,"work 8-10 hour days minimum, sales to high end customers, getting contracts signed, implementing products sold, maintain contracts/customer accounts, answer all calls from client, resolv any issues/concerns/complaints."
bad,"One of the most stressful jobs that I have ever had!!!!!!!! Call center environment, in which your job is on the line for each and every single call!!!!"
bad,Management is to focused on the numbers and not its people or customers. They ran off allot of good people including engineers that were essential to the backbone of the company.
bad,"Terrible Manager,"
bad,Too much favoritism here. Sales mean much more than customer satisfaction to this company. They rather you pitch something to an angry customer even if they are already calling angry and don't want to hear is and don't spend too much time helping customer cause you're losing sales.
bad,They have us less than a week to let us know that the call center was closing down. Management sucked because they kept getting shuffled around AT&T because other centers kept closing down.
bad,The pay was great at first. It seems that every year they just screw you over the commission. They make it harder for you to earn more money and increase the sales goals on you. I wouldn't recommend this place
bad,I was a wire Tech for a while. Management will find anything and everything to write you up. Schedules do not allow family work Balance. Management would like to remind you you are lucky to have this job with every chance they get.
bad,I work there for 2 years. Management will throw you under the buss to make themselves look good. I was in the top 3 sales performers in the store and was fired for not opening the door for a customer. I wouldn't advise my worst enemy to work here. Also from what I hear from friends the commission is caped now. How do you expect a sales person to sell if you cap the commission.  I would give up when I reached the limit no incentive.
bad,The company gives great benefits and good pay. You learn something new everyday or atleast you should or you are not pushing yourself to do better. Hope dispatch is a big plus and saves you on gas cost.
bad,"AT&T now isn't what it used to be. The commission structure has been capped severely for entry-level retail sales consultants. Years ago it wasn't uncommon for entry-level sales reps to make over 50-60k a year. Now, the top earners are barely going to make 40k a year and thats with the maximum hourly amount of $17hr plus commission. When new people start you will be given an option of insurance which is going to take up half of your check and you are only eligible for benefits when open enrollment comes in December. You get a 50% employee discount on your wireless bill but the 50% only applies to the data portion of your bill. The hardest parts of the job would be dealing with customers who want to come to AT&T and price match. Dealing with people who have billing issues and the phone reps send them in the store to get help knowing its nothing the store reps can deal with, and lastly depending on your management staff you will either hate work or they can make work a fun place to come to. Last but not least whats going to drag down your take home pay is the fact that your commission is taxed at a higher rate than your hourly. In Texas we do not have a state income tax and thank goodness because I would hate to see what my commission checks would look like in a state that has state taxes and high taxes on commissions."
bad,"I started when AT&T was still Ameritech. I worked in Operator Services also know as Information.  I work split shifts. For example worked for 4hrs off for 4 and went back and worked 3hrs more.  I took over 1000 calls a day.  Very monotonous.  Very little interaction with co-workers. I transferred to Maintenance Administrator, which involved working with technicians and customers. I enjoyed learning the ""behind the scenes"" of the phone world. I was able to interact with co-workers on various daily reports and special projects. This department became surplus so I transferred to Customer Service. I love helping customers. Explaining there bills, helping them move, transfer or set up new service. However, the department changed from Customer Service to Sales Representative . The hardest part is meeting your daily sales quota for New Provides, Cell Phones, Internet, TV. I had great co-workers and enjoyed working with them and learning from them as well."
bad,"Not enough pay for the tasks, training was not helpful in relation to the field. Management is only concerned with numbers and the employees they have been friends with for years."
bad,"ACT, was a dirty nasty place, the boss wasn't fair with everyone always had favorites, there was roaches, bed bugs, there bad when I was employed."
bad,"very stressful environment, un-attainable goals set by company, pay was goo, benefits were good, but overall a very greedy company that puts their employees last and cares only about big profits"
bad,"Made sure all the work was completed, then I could help other department, My position required me to leave my department in order to assist end users."
bad,"The Money was great."
bad,Productive and fun envoronment. Lots of different types of people and work. hardest part of job was commute.Most enjoyable part was monthly team meetings
bad,The petty back stabbing was more than enough. They will build a file on you and then when they dont want you around anymore they have no problem letting you go without telling or showing you any proof other than their word. dont bother.
bad,A typical workday is quite stressfull. The hurdle of my day is over coming the lack of organization with in the company to provide customers seem less installation and repair of products.
bad,"High turn over rate"
bad,A typical da at work was very stressful.  The sales quota was unreachable.  The hardest part of the job was trying to sell 2 dsl a day when you had 0 opportunities.
bad,"A typical day is spent tied to your phone and your email inbox. Processes and procedures are constantly changing, and the business reorganizes at a rapid pace. Often, it is difficult to determine who you actually work for. Management is largely ignorant of what you actually do, and is rarely of any assistance at all. My co-workers were some of the best people I've ever worked with, and also some of the worst. A great portion of your day will be spent correcting other's mistakes. Other departments frequently ""push-back"" and refuse to do what they are supposed to do. Yet, a great many of the people I worked with were knowledgeable, helpful, and fun. I met some really great people there, and I will miss them the most. They were easily the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part is the job itself. I wish I could say that the benefits made the work worthwhile (because the company does offer good pay and benefits), but sadly, it falls short. Daily you will be instructed to control things that you could not possibly control, and you will be told to do this by a management staff that has no inkling of how to do what you do every day. It's a thankless task. I would not recommend this employer to my worst enemy. Take this job only if you are desperate and need something to bring in some pay while you search for a better job."
bad,"AT&T has not valued it's employees since the Bell South, AT&T merger.  They have been either offshoring or outsourcing 200 to 300 jobs a week over the last four years.  Outsourcing is probably the worst as if those folks are offered a position at the outsourcing company for less money they can either accept it or walk away with no severance."
bad,"The hook up with u-verse is really difficult the equipment is faulty and doesn't work have of the time, I never had equipment to do any of the jobs, the only thing the managers was worried about was having good numbers everyday they wouldn't help you or answer phone calls at all if you was stuck on the job"
bad,"AT&T in Cape Girardeau is corrupt as they come.  More concerned in being the top call center, less concerned in doing things the right way.  Off records, they encourage things completely against company-wide policy like giving services without permission, giving credits to encourage new account creation, and flat out lying (or just forgetting the small print). These same things that they turn a blind eye to when listening to calls (of course because its revenue generated and another chance for the office to make top offices and get free trips for management and lots of gifts) are also the same things that will get you fired the first time that the anonymous group randomly selects you to listen to.  For the record, as long as you are top 10% (the office manager doesn't even speak to you if you're not, way to go ATT!), you will never be listened to, not sure how they stuff the records for that.  But if you don't give somebody's senile granny the free upgrade on a service that will no longer be available to her once she is upgraded, then you are fired and the union has nothing to say.  Probably because the union is off the phone as much as they want and have their goals adjusted, kind of funny how they can represent the employees when they are basically in management's pockets.  The benefits and pay is great and I recommend you take the job for that part but put money to the side because you never know when one of the management will decide it is your last day.  Good luck, remember to stay in the in circle, hit your adherence, customer sat, strategic units, repeat calls, and revenue"
bad,"I applied for the retail sales position because of the compensation. the pay is impressive, but consider it slave labor. ten hour days on your feet. standing. seems like not a big deal, but once you do it for a while, it is miserable, and affects the quality of your workmanship. Everything that you say or do is monitored. everything. even the way that you breathe. and then it is discussed. You can do backflips for supervisors and there will always be something that you are doing wrong. "
bad,"Talk about stress & bad managers!  They train a little to well, on how to drive, talk, work, dress. 9 weeks of paid training in which 8 weeks were of no value. Then they throw you out there and that's when you discover all the BS. Its common to start at 8am and get off at 9pm, they don't care about you or your family life. It was so bad and I couldn't get any help, I literally walked off the job. No job/career is worth that. The stupid thing is, they give you ""X"" amount of time to drive, do a job ETC. Then bust your butt if your numbers are not up to speed, thats the stress part, just trying to do your job but spend hours on the phone with tech support watching your time burn up."
bad,"The money made here is great, but it just isn't worth it.  There is absolutely no security there to be found, and management treat you like absolute garbage.  You are of absolutely no value to them, whether you work hard or not."
bad,"A typical work day consisted of taking many calls, and trying to get the person on the other line to buy something, regardless of what they were calling for.  "
bad,"very good learning experience in the telephony arena, company moved employees into new positions frequently."
bad,"it's a job, the call center life is great for local students or if you are retired and just looking for some extra easy cash. i would not recommend to make this life a career. most of the management staff is great but others will make you want to quit after a day. co-workers are friendly but a lot of drama. usually don't see any advancement within the call center unless you become friends with the hiring manager or turn into a hot woman. nothing is hard about the jobs here a monkey can do them. you get paid an ok amount but you have to spend years before you get to the cap pay. the jobs are so easy but employees will complain night and day, but they have no idea what hard work is. it's an ok place and it's a job so if you need one they are always hiring."
bad,"I work for the Convergy's in the AT&T chat support. It is a center where there is a casual dress code and friendly people. I did like working there for a while until I found out how well the employees are treated. I had a mild seizure around the time of Thanksgiving and was unable to work for a few days. Instead of really helping me, the HR department still gave me the attendance points even though I handed them a doctors note. They only seemed to care about whether I worked or not, rather than if I was ok. That isn't how employees should be treated. We are human beings, not robots that are made for work. There wasn't anything wrong with the supervisors, but most of the management just didn't care about their employees. Half of my training class quit early because they were treated so unethically. I would give this place a 1.5 out of 10 if I could give it a point review."
bad,management constantly nag you to insure their bonus. No bonus for the people actually doing the work!
bad,Co workers on the team are okay for the most part. Management is abusive and uncaring about anyone but themselves. They run on an unreal number system that they base life on and they preach customer service but don't give time to do it. I learned quite a bit about the industry and how to do it right but the company was not supportive at all. insurance was ok but every year it consistently get worse. They give you false hope by saying it is union but they are in bed with the company and wont help you at all. Best part of the job is teammates helping each other but the company has that so restricted you are pretty much on your own. If you get stuck with something you don't know then you're just on your own.
bad,The managment is constantly changeing every 6 months. Had 15 managers in year time span. The work is fun and intresting. Management is under so much pressure that they dont manage or make decisions. Area manager is basically your manager and 1st level are babysitters. Most managers are promoted from the field and have no experince in what you do. Co worker morals are basically out the door. High turnover in the last two years of working there and is verystressful. Goals are unrealistict without cutting cornes to satisfy 100% efficincy every month. Getting off on time was the most enjoyable part of my job.
bad,"ATT was only for the business needs and shareholders, so if you have a family or are a single parent the pay is great but you will hardly EVER see your children. Also they don't accept doctors notes, so you or your family either can't get sick too often or you have to have a great support system. They change a lot in the customer support rep area of the business so don't get used to anything being solid and set."
bad,Run for the hills! They just don't really care about you the person. A lot of promises were made and none were kept. Customers were unhappy because the product didn't work yet they made them sign a 12 mo. contract so they would just stop paying and we would get charged back.
bad,"You cant say things like would'nt could'nt should'nt. they. them , The Qa for your calls is so picky you feel like you will have break down after each one worried you said the wrong words, they would tell you to step out of the box to talk to your customer but if you make a mastake watch out. The people are the best thing great friends but they have strayed from coustomer service. but they exspect you take all forms of abuse from the coustomers. It its own Monster. Never again could I put myself threw it. they have great places to work. but you are just a number , you have to do a lot of sales, but they dont want you sound like your doing do. alot of traning about there stuff but not enough they change things but give you very little training, like setting you up for failier. you can never miss a day and ask for help and training. and get nothing."
bad,Company steeped in high level bureaucracy preventing common sense ideas and changes to better the company to be implemented.
bad,"Imagine this, working a few jobs a day, 5 days a week. You work about 40-50 hours a week. Now imagine opening up your paycheck and seeing around 400$ for those 80-100 hours. This is what DirecTv is like. Oh, and I hope you have your own tool set, because they charge you 600$ for you to buy their set or ""required"" tools and expect to be paid back that money within 6 months of you recieving it. GOOD LUCK DOING THAT MAKING 400 BUCKS EVERY TWO WEEKS. In my own opinion, work here for the two months of training, then get out before you start working on the road, trust me, its not worth the headache"
bad,Fixing television problems and phone problems inside premises and outside...Customer contact always a pleasure
bad,The company has a great brand presented to customers but customer service and tech support really needs a revamping big time.
bad,The managers will treat you badly. You WILL work 10+ days 6 days a week. The product is terrible. Other techs will push off repairs on you. There are lazy techs that you will have to take up their slack. I would let my worst enemy work as a prem tech.
bad,"en esta empresa aprendi y tuve la oportunidad de saber llegarle a los clientes, como expresarme y como desempeñarme mejor en el area de las ventas"
bad,"Working for AT&T in a call-center environment is a high-stress, sales intensive career. For those working on commission this is a perfect fit. For those not used to the high-stress level or quota-based sales, this is not the right fit for you."
bad,"After completing my training program and certification, I consistently asked management when I was able to work independently as a fully-trained technician. I was consistently given the same answers: ""I don't know,"" or ""Still waiting to hear about it."" I was given this answer even after the rest of my classmates were working independently in their own work vehicles. This was surprising because I had my own vehicle and tools long before my classmates did, and my in-field trainers confirmed that I was fully trained and more than capable of doing independent work."
bad,"Worked for them for 3 years and I just walked out one day and never looked back. Left behind everything and lost everything because of it and I don't regret it one bit. This company is about money and they will let you know it-and they show it. The healthcare is AMAZING for anyone who is not management and above. Other than that it's a $2,000 deductible. They go on a point system-if you late more than five minutes it's half a point up to 6 points and your fired. Yes the points drop off- after a year. So if you have kids, family, medical conditions, or even a life out of work then consider this a temp job. This company goes through employees like you wouldn't believe. When you go for training you go away for one week, then come back and train, leave again for one week and then come back and train, and then go away again and then train again for one week. If you start working for this company DO NOT let them pay you anything less than $9.50-$10 hour. It won't be worth it unless your life is going to be solely this job and this job alone. The commission is changed every 6 months, and it keeps getting worse and worse. They change it to the point where you can't keep track of what you sell and how much your getting for it. If your a sales person, you have to walk around with a clip board and do things verbatim to what At&t wants you to do, and if not then your written up- just for not saying ""Yes, I can help you with that""-exactly like that and you can't say it any different. And that's not all of it. When you sell to a customer you have to sell Dish or Directv (whichever is the"
bad,This is a horrible place to work they try it be happy-go-lucky on the outside but inside it's horrible absolute horrid. Every year they go through job downsizing and removal of jobs this always happens  A few days before Thanksgiving right before Christmas and the people are scared for their lives all year long.  The stress causes people to get cancer to get sick to not sleep to have eating disorders all pipes of horrible body health problems exist from this stress and if they don't get your one year you may make in a few years but eventually there will get Chur. I was called in on Christmas Eve and I thought I was getting a Turkey or a $25 gift certificate instead I was told today's your last day get out grab a Box and get the funk out yeah they're real wonderful the work for people have dire hatred for this company that's why and the
bad,Att could care less about their employees all they pay attention too is numbers and will fire you at the drop of the hat they treat you like trash and will search for ways to get rid of you.
bad,"Att is a great company for the money but the culture and athmosohere that Is created is sale first only , manager are encouraged to push reps to selll things that the customer does not need"
bad,"This is union. The manger is only concerned with how he looks to his peers . "
bad,"Very unprofessional with commission sales, co workers fighting over customers. Training was lacking and frustrating. I worked there for less than a month."
bad,"If you are looking for something temporary, this would be it. Talking to customers all day, forcing upsells in order to get your commission sales. Absolutely poorly managed."
bad,They are more concerned with quantity as opposed to quality. The job will stuck the life out of you. They don't focus on anything but money. If you like to be a robot this if the job for you
bad,"As a technician for AT&T of 6 years I love the pay and benefits, and hate everything else. AT&T manages people horribly. There is no work-life balance. The company ALWAYS comes first. You will spend your life with the company and not with your family, and when you're no longer needed, they'll lay you off. You're constantly harassed by management for your numbers and productivity and never praised. All that being said, the job itself is great. You get a company truck, tools, and the freedom to be out in the world. You work alone and only see your boss once a month. Its the best/worst job I've ever had."
bad,The Company worships sales- as long as your making money they do not care what you do. Common to have managers and co workers come into work drunk or high.
bad,"Financially was great, but an incredibly disorganized company. Employees were in constant fear of jobs. Company would hire too many people then try to fire them to get numbers down. I was not impressed. I had 4 different managers in 2 years. I had one good manager while i was there, but he was demoted back to technician."
bad,"The phone company I started has changed. Most people over 20 years service have been forced to leave. The company has changed product lines, management by numbers is the new culture. People including customers are not important. Benefits, pay were good. Opportunities in some cities great especially for new employees. Appreciated my time at SBC now AT&T, but now glad to be able to use my skills developed there in a new career."
bad,AT&T is run by an upper management team that likes to re-invent the wheel.  Instead of letting things that work stay they have to change it up all the time so you can't ever get really good at your job.
bad,"They started downsizing and after promising to have a very similar culture, made directv's culture the opposite of what it used to be, causing many employees to get frustrated and quit. Including myself."
bad,"Company is losing subscription customer base.  Field services personnel are being laid off. "
bad,"Bad management, employees aren't treated with respect with no regard to what you may have going on outside of work ie Kids, School, Prior commitments. Compensation is great but aside from that, I would not recommend"
bad,I would never work at AT&T again!! They care less about you as a person. Care less what difficulties are going on in your life. No excuses accepted. They beat your self esteem and self worth down. I've never been made to feel as stupid as they made me feel on a daily basis.
bad,Call centers are stressful and AT&T was just constantly angry customers. The plans and prices can change and channels can drop at anytime so you will have people screaming and blaming you.
bad,Never know what you say will end.  Can never make plans for personal life. Very hard on family life. Management doesn’t care about personal issues and just make you work. Very deflating company to work for.
bad,I know all jobs are stressful but working for this company your stress can turn in into an actual health concern that would require you to visit a doctor on a regular basis if not a morgue .Not a fun job like it starts out as office politics will eventually find its way to you making you feel like your holding on to your job by a thread no matter if your the best or mediocre it will not matter.
bad,No job security due to quarterly layoffs. Compensation is nice. Medical benefits are not too expensive and decent. My manager was fantastic but upper management not so much
bad,"You are owned. I left the company after 10years. Never having a steady scheduke and then when you pick a schedule there is a high chance it gets ripped away with 2 days notice. Its taken a bad turn... And I would not recommend this for anybody."
bad,"No set time of clock out"
bad,"At AT&T you can instantly go from being promoted, having accolades, bonuses, salary increases, etc. to having your entire office laid off and it doesn't matter who you are or how good you were."
bad,The pay is good but you work hard for it and get a horrible schedule. It’s very stressful the work environment is like high school. Mandatory overtime
bad,"I cannot understand why a company as large as ATT has so many problems.  The managers are DUMB, but because they are white, they get to manage a group mostly black.  "
bad,"I use to assist and resolve all kind of customer's concerns, inquiries, complaints and requests. "
bad,In the interview they said they would work with you that was a lie. In training they said if you were behind on something you would get help. No help got written up.
bad,"Mega aquisitions, benefit reductions, disproportionate wage increases, outsourcing both international and third party domestic, rate hikes, etc.  It used to be a place I was proud to say I worked.  It is now solely about extreme profit margins.  Those margins are gained on May fronts that hurt both it's customers and employees."
bad,"There are a lot of great managers at AT&T, I know this because I had 5 of them before my last one. I think if the company would not be afraid to review their managers with a 360 review and let their employees rate their managers this poor manager would not have been able to fly under the radar for so long unexposed."
bad,It was a decent job.  Management staff was horrible.  Work culture was ok.  the hardest part of the job was managers not having consistent coaching with you .
bad,"The workplace culture was very was like a high school, you had the mean girls, the popular guys and then the reps that tried to do work. People were somewhat accepting and there is always that one that helps you no matter what. The management was no help. They basically made you fend for yourself. I did take some good things away, I learned how to navigate through the system. I learned how to stand up to my bosses and not be bullied. I basically just learned my way through sales."
bad,Job functions constantly changing with no pay rate increase. Highly stressful job environment. Employees spend their lunch and break times venting about the job
bad,"This company only looks out for the people at the top. There is high monthly sale quotas to meet, which wouldn’t be a big deal if the company didn’t continually change the commission payouts."
bad,"The job is great when under skilled and capable management. However the retail stores in my area are suffering from poor hiring in upper and middle management. You are constantly pushed into a cheat to win sales strategy, and if you refuse or push back against the corruption you are maneuvered into a situation where you can't win in customer interactions. They put you under a microscope and look for ways find you out of policies that are created by ""manager discretion""."
bad,"It was hard to work as a maintenance supervisor and never doing any maintenance on any lines. Every supervisor was worried about their supervisor getting mad, except for the frontline who had to explain to customers. Pay was great but I hated the daily grind of trying to make a dying business successful."
bad,"Call center agents are under intense pressure to meet somewhat unachievable metrics, with little reward. Management constantly advised employees that if they didn't like their job, they should just quit, very little positive reinforcement."
bad,"It's never about the employee, it's always about the amount of time it takes to complete a job. It's all timed, every job, every moment of your day, drive time, breaks, lunches. If only companies could learn to trust their employees again. Maybe someday they will treat them like assets, instead of a liability."
bad,Corporate AT&T is completely incompetent in managing DirecTV. Employees and customers are treated simply as a number. Benefits are currently being cut
bad,Very poor management and pay. Only good thing is the union and how much they help keep your job safe while management is trying to find every way possible to get you terminated.
bad,"A couple years back as a tech it wasnt so bad but for the last 3 years the culture and overall leadership and/or vision is looking really grim to say the least. A typical day in the morning you show up to the garage your assigned to for the you are supposed to 1.have morning huddle led by your supervisor 2. Get the equipment off your assigned shelf for your work load and dispatch jobs through out the day. Notice i say supposed to what actually happens is 1.Your supervior most likey wont be there to give direction or any support you may need fom him/her 2. your shelf is short of equipment you need fo the day so you have to ask around for equipment that everybody eles is looking for as well."
bad,"Benefits and compensation structure are very good. Management is hit or miss. My current manager is amazing, but her predecessor was awful. Management shifts a lot. Frequent surpluses and restructuring make consistency a rare thing. Quotas fluctuate and are sometimes difficult to hit. Drinking the Kool aid is a must to get ahead. Work ethic means relatively little for advancement."
bad,"They have the most abusive attendance policy I have ever encountered...."
bad,They very intolernet to any illness and punish you for being sick by changing requirements for FMLA without violating the law.............................................
bad,When I first got the job use to love going to work. Now I hate getting up to go to the job. Management only care about sales . The management are all phoney and all they know how to do is write you up for everything. Wouldn’t recommend no one to work there
bad,Just horrible all around. No one is ever able to help its always a figure it out situation. And the pay isnt hourly so you get stuck in one home all day. Made about $60. To 110$ a week.doing phyaically hard work.I got paid more during training.
bad,"There were too many different systems for employees to be evaluated based on, you could score great in one a terrible in the other and end up wrote up for the month."
bad,Was promised to become a manager or advance into another title if I did well upon which I made top performer and five start countless times and guess what! Still in the same spot four years later! My boss got promoted though.. Always went above and beyond for the customers being that they are the lifeline and the company would rather play you as being the bad guy. They ended up taking some of the tools we used to help customers away and that was the final straw for me. One of the best managers we ever had ended up leaving also.
bad,"BellSouth was a very employee-friendly employer. The atmosphere changed drastically when AT&T took over. Sales quotas, abusive management tactics and harassment abound. Sure, they say they appreciate employees & values families & customers, but nothing could be farther from the truth."
bad,answer incoming calls .  try to sell products and services that customers do not want or need.  I learned that AT&T doesn't care one bit about customers that will not spend a lot of money with them over their lifetime are treated badly.  worst management that I have ever seen at a company and I have been working on & off since I was 15 years old and I am 59 now.  What workplace culture?  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the ever changing rules and managers.  The most enjoyable part of working as a customer service rep for AT&T was when it was time to go home!!!!
bad,"un dia tipico de trabajo lleno de regaños por los clientes ya que nunca recibi una llamada de un cliente calmado"
bad,"Long hours, management change the rules every day to suit the way they want things done. No choice if you want to work overtime they just force you to do it. Do not work here if you have a family"
bad,Good job but the company makes everything so hard to get things done. I thought the military was backwards and made everything hard to do until I started AT&T.
bad,Used to be a great company to work for but not anymore. They no longer care about the customers or it’s employees. You feel as if your not doing the best you can for the customers.
bad,Do not recommend being a prim Tech AT&T will abuse you and keep you out late  On a regular basis making it impossible to have a family life... Terrible management  Seems like every week there is some new stupid policy in place and if you do not keep up with the policy you're subject to discipline. As an AT&T employee  You are nothing more than a number on a piece of paper to the company.
bad,AT&T has become too big for its own good. the customer now suffers for it. Requirements for management clearly include never having actually performed the job or any previous knowledge requirements. They are promising money being put back into the infrastructure but they are laying off hundreds of technicians a year. You have to be ok with living one foot in and one foot out because your job wont be secure until you're 15 years in.
bad,"Don't ever take a Machine operator job in the Raleigh Morrisville area of NC  there has been over 4 managers in the Morrisville area in less than a year."
bad,"my career with AT&T started out as a great job. customer services was a great part of my daily routine and selling our products was a bonus, as the years went on, it seemed that at&t had greatly shifted their focus from their customers, to just numbers. with this shift there was more stress with less enjoyment for the company. nothing ever satisfied the company's greed filled motivation for pushing products and services unnecessary for customer needs. the company monopolized the entertainment industry with directv, directv now, hbo, time warner. they physically tell you they no longer identify as a cell phone carrier but as an entertainment company. they will consistently howl you even well over your 100% attainment or goals for the store. very greedy company be warned. does not care for customer needs only their own"
bad,I didn't enjoy taking phone calls for customers that were very rude. The company wasn't bad it was just a bad environment to work it at the time. Long hours on the phone and not a lot of breaks.
bad,company pays well but is cut throat will hire in great excess to cover periods of forecasted sales and installations with intent to layoff before you reach your vested tenure. Company likes to layoff right before 3 year tenure mark to avoid paying out severance and company matched 401k benefits.
bad,"After getting an internship at AT&T and eventually landing a job at AT&T/DTV through referral, I thought I would be all set for years to come. What people don't see is the toxic culture of promoting clueless people to management roles simply because the person has many years of experience. If it wasn't because I need more experience and the pay is good, I would have left the company and never look twice."
bad,I was initally hired as a customer service rep and they now transitioned it to a Sales position when my position was a Retention Specialist and I was pressured to  upsell and meet quotas while  customers are calling to cancel because they can't afford the service. Plus they relocated to a distant location which did not work for my life situation and they would not accommodate me. I ended up separating since they could not accommodate me. No life work balance whatsoever.
bad,"I have been with the company since 2006 and am currently a Client Solutions Executive -2 with AT&T.  I am an integrated seller responsible for both wireline and wireless services. My job is to sell anything from an entire network, security and applications to mobility services and applications.  I work very well on my own but am grateful to have an outstanding Account Manager who assists with all post-sales needs.  I have an excellent Sales Manager who is result driven and very supportive of his sellers. We have a very open and communicative team. I am able to work from home the majority of the time when I am not at customer facing appointments. The hardest part of my job is the lack of control in knowing when a customer will close a sale - or having it push due to an internal issue on their side. The most enjoyable part of the job is turning around a relationship that was previously soured and closing a deal, thus creating a long term relationship that positively affects the company and their bottom line."
bad,Company worried about numbers and not employees having jobs. Company always looking to lay workers off. Always looking over your shoulder not knowing if someone will catch you doing something so slight as not placing your parking brake on to fire you.
bad,"I was offered great benefits and the pay was decent, but management was very poor. Managers would deliberately ignore you walk the other way if you needed help."
bad,They treat you like children!  They have such tight ridiculous rules that make you feel like you are back in elementary and most of the time none of the managers know their jobs.
bad,"As a Uverse manager, standard working hours were non typical."
bad,"Incompetent management staff, most are friends and family members. The training instructors function on a high school (or less) educational level. No classroom structure and absolutely no classroom decorum what so ever. Nice facility but poor management and poor employee representation."
bad,This was a pretty easy going job. had lots of different events and a very open mind culture. most enjoyable part of the day was just helping the customers
bad,"The pressure from the management was way too much. Upon the rollout of new goals, veteran workers quit. Just when you think there's enough pressure, they find a way to add more. Who your manager is will make ALL the difference, as some managers will do what they can to help you, others will see you as someone to whip for their own gain."
bad,Great pay and benefits. Training is exceptional. Huge gap from one manager to another with information.  For a sales environment the energy level is near zero.
bad,Do not work for AT&T this company only cares about it numbers and competing in the market. Day to day employees that do all of the important work are laid off with little to no notice and not given much of any explanation
bad,Been here for about 9 years  they don't offer any promotions or any lateral moves. Also you're forced to stay until all the work is done for the day while you watch other people leave on time and get paid way more than you do in any other position.
bad,"Long hours, hard to make plans with family. Wont ever know when you will get home each day. Some management makes you feel like they have a personal vendetta against you and single you out unfairly. Constantly keep adding more duties to keep from paying other job classes to do a job, making work loads unbearable at times. Fiber sucks!"
bad,"Listen to everyone at rjp.  Good money lots of hours no home life.  Micro managed at every level.  Only one weekend a month off, and you could be out 12-14 hrs a day.  No set time for end of day, work until all jobs are complete"
bad,forced overtime with no relief for years on a daily basis ...management never kept on information to make it easy for customers .... was never told of new info until was issues with customers
bad,"Great place to work. Nice people. Being on a surplus list is not ideal. The management was very family oriented.  The union was awesome.We understand that our customers want an easier, less complicated life."
bad,"aprendí mas de lo que necesitaba saber."
bad,"Management is horrible, especially in the Wheeling store. The do not promote a positive environment, they manage by fear when most managers have less experience than the sales people and have no clue. "
bad,"As a Premises Tech i install Uverse for Customers in the Houston area.  We receive jobs VIA I pad and dispatch on those jobs to the customer premises to install requested services.  During the install I have to build and maintain a professional rapport with the customer, while keeping the company objectives in mind also."
bad,Help customers with account questions and resolve issues. Sold products and devises. Was a busy and fast pass work environment.
bad,"A typical work day provides customer service. I learned various techniques to get the job done quicker and more accurately. Management was great as far as teaching everything I needed to know in the work field. The hardest part about the job is if you're stuck, no one is there to help you out. Most enjoyable part of  the job is being able to interact with different customers on a daily basis,"
bad,"The job requires a lot of time it was a good job until jobs slowed."
bad,"inbound calls about att accounts, home cable internet accounts"
bad,If you need a job Directv is ok. they have a no rehire policy. Nothing more to say about directv. I love their service as far as television packages goes.
bad,"At&t as a whole is a great company to work for. However, the Retailed Dealer store was owned by another company. No benefits, low base pay and low commission percentage. Company does not care about their employees at all. If certain products were not sold, then you received no commission at all. A typical day at work was opening up store, helping customers who had problems with their phones, changed phone plans, answered calls. The hardest part of the job was selling products that I knew a customer did not need. But if I wanted a job, then I was supposed to sell what I was told. Helping customers with their phones and seeing how happy they were, is what I enjoyed most. I wanted customers to know I was there to help and to come back. I was told on several occasions that I worked well with customer service."
bad,"I liked working and navigating the AT&T systems, however it seems that the people at Sykes @Home were looking more to fire people than they were to keep quality workers"
bad,"In the job description it does state that there might be a sale quote you will have to reach. But what they don't tell you is that you HAVE to reach this quote of you will get WRITTEN up for not meeting it. They want you on the phone all day except for your breaks and lunches. but if you are on the phone with a customer and your break has come up you finish with the customer BUT you get docked for going to break LATE for being on the PHONE WITH A CUSTOMER. The management hardly knew answers to questions we asked. Their response was ""Did you look it up"" I enjoyed the hour Lunch. I hated that you have to meet metrics. You Availability(not logging off if you need to use the restroom/staying on the phones with customers ALL day) has to be at 80% and your Adherence has to be at 90%(going to breaks on time/being on the phone) It says you will be a customer service Rep 1. but they don't tell you that they are all about sells. and you can not hang up on customers if they are verbally abusive to you. You have to take that call like a champ. and its hard to find a manager that is willing to take an escalation call. If you like to sell UVerse than this is the place for you. If you HATE SALES then turn the other way. Co-Workers all all about them selves and dont care about you."
bad,They treat the employees like garbage and force them to lie and/or tell half-truths. And then they will fire you for doing what they told you to do. Horrible for the customers who have to rely on this terrible example of a multi-billion dollar company.
bad,"People steeling eachothers sales while management don't care, unstable work environment"
bad,"Management, all the way up to top management have no concept of the physical aspect of providing great customer support."
bad,"A typical day will be to calm down irate customers while trying to meet an objective; in a stressful environment with my supervisor. I love to come to work and see my co-workers; we make the day go by fast all though the customers are truly upset with the company and their services. We learn not to take it personal but after being cursed out on every call, it becomes draining. The hardest part of my job is to come to work and try your best and still do not be appreciated. The hardest part is there is not many opportunities for advancement or different jobs in MS for AT&T; relocation is my priority right now. "
bad,I would answer inbound calls. assist customers and resolve there issues. I would say the hardest part of this job is dealing with angry customers with high phone bills. The best part was being able solve the customers issue.
bad,"First, I am not sure why they hired me and 24 other people. They were constantly letting people leave early from lack of work and when they put us on the floor to take calls, several members of my training class brought in coloring books and crayons to pass the time because the call volume was so slow. This is the main reason I left - I was told to expect 75-80 calls a day and I think the maximum I took for a day was 15."
bad,Basically upper management does not care about their employees at all and that just sums it up
bad,"This job could be great, if it wasn't for the screaming and extremely rude customers. You'll probably get called every name in the book and then some, as well as get sworn at in ways you couldn't even imagine (customers can get very creative when they're angry). Your calls are randomly scored, and even one little thing that you do or say wrong can end up giving you a bad score. I had a call where I didn't give a customer the COMPLETE right answer, and my call ended up getting red flagged and I got a written warning for it. Upper management acted like some little high school clique, and if they like you it's great; if they don't like you or don't care, you're screwed. I ended up getting fired because of this very thing - one of my calls was recorded and the customer asked for a supervisor so I had to put her on hold. BOTH of my supervisors were busy and it was late in the evening so there weren't many other supervisors. The customer ended up hanging up while on hold, and because nothing was going on on my computer screen they said I was standing in the way of a supervisor request. They didn't even fire me right away - they said I was scheduled for a ""term review"" and so I had to sweat it out all weekend. Then, I didn't even get a chance to defend myself - my team leader (who had just been promoted), my manager (who wasn't even a real manager, but was just an ""upgrade"" who wanted to stay on top) and they woman in HR were just gone all day, and then literally at 4:45 PM, they called me in and said they'd decided to fire me and had my Team Leader escort me out of the building."
bad,This will no be a good place if you just started or even have a family. They will write you up for any small thing.
bad,I learned new aspects of upsaling products to economically challenged consumers.
bad,"This review is isolated to the Call Center side of AT&T. If you have any alternative, do not work in one of these places:"
bad,"To be honest, this company is a third party vendor for AT&T. This is a hostile work environment. I don't recommend this company."
bad,Worked there for 11 years and was diagnosed with prostrate cancer. Had to take a lot of time off work for treatment and I was fired. Thought the union would back me up but they were of no help either
bad,"Aprendí a hacer potabilidades, atención al cliente"
bad,Lots of corruption.  Manager's giving PO's out for work never done and taking kick backs from Contractors.  Very toxic environment.  Untrustworthy and knowledgeable Management.
bad,At one time it was awesome place to work. Over the last 3 years the company has restructured its outside work force several times and laid off hundreds of people from management on down. With the restructuring came the business model of quantity over quality. This is one of many reasons for me leaving the company after 21 years.
bad,"Just an ok place to work, mgmt couldn't really or just didn't want to tell us anything. Just shut the entire place down out the blue. You could get written up over calls you didn't take. Just a toxic environment where no matter how hard you tried to help someone, you could risk being fired because they didn't like the person who transfered them to you."
bad,"Pay is good. vacation is good. Good people.  From day one, you are always in fear of a lay-off.    The company is there to provide a means of bonuses for the board."
bad,They are cutting 30% of employment not a family oriented and don’t seem to care much about people  just bottom dollar  horrible ethics and no care for anyone
bad,Waiting to be laid off or trying to find a different job before that happens.  It's too bad as the pay is good with consistent raises.  Work load has plummeted in the last year and there are now too many of us.  This is due to a combination of a changing market and poor business practices.
bad,Very stressful environment with a lot of micromanaging. Rules change without warning. Left there after my shift in tears more times than I can count. I was fired when their HR department screwed up my FMLA paperwork and refused to take responsibility for the mistake.
bad,"Very stressful environment, Management only manage numbers, not people. No advancement available, use of sick days are frowned upon and even punished."
bad,AT&T is not a job I would recommend to anyone. It's just another company that's only concerned with bottom lines. The company was offered billions of dollars in tax relief by the government in return for more jobs created. AT&T instantly started laying off employees and has not created one job.
bad,more and more corporate stores closing and being replaced with authorized dealers  pay rate is good but not much time left for family life with hours open being cut
bad,"Great organization to work for if you don't mind executive micro management.  Compensation used to be pretty fair but now salaries are lowered in order to increase executives bank accounts.  The cost of actual services provided to customers has increased slightly if at all which means customers pay more and more and employee compensation has decreased significantly. Higher management executives seem to have littles trouble buying second homes, boats, cars, etc. while the technicians struggle to make ends meet.  It's typical corporate workplace environment today.  People don't quit a job...they quit a micro managing, ""metrics"" obsessed boss."
bad,"Worked for this company for 6 years they were outstanding early on, about my first 2 years of employment were enjoyable. Then it became a constant fear of losing your job with a poor service mentality and no work life balance. If your child was sick and were to even try to use one of your vacation days you could never do so. Using vacation that was given was almost impossible on any day that wasn't tuesday or wednesday. The higher management treats you like numbers. I do not recommend anyone work here. You're constantly belittled and seemingly punished for being efficient at your job."
bad,"The call center had a water fountain in it, that was about the best part of the entire time I worked there."
bad,"Prior company's were good to work for but when at&t took over it was bad for the customer and the employees. Very stressful tactics and not warranted. Look elsewhere is what I suggest. Stress, Micro Management, and you are a number and nothing else. We didn't even get so much as a good bye and good luck when they moved our job 70 miles away. Heartless! Pay is nothing like it used to be since they grandfathered the older titles from the good days when an employee mattered."
bad,This company has a tendency to pigeon hole employees so that moving to work in a different area seems impossible. The micro-management is terrible. You are limited in your freedom of expression without consequence.
bad,"Review of this position was done earlier. Everything pertains this job also. vacation time.  My responsibilities varied, much clerical work, helping my department heads, mail runs, working at the security gates, making badges for the over 300 contract workers at the plant."
bad,"Great pay but stressful"
bad,"att lies to its employees they are laying people off and hiring cheap labor level 2 and 3 you cant trust them, that find stuff to write you up so they can fire they lie to customer and then you get blame and write up for a bad survey"
bad,I loved the money but I didn't like the clicks. Management allowed things to go on that were not professional. The company training programs helped you keep up with the needs of the company.
bad,It just wasn’t what I Inspected to be . I thought ist was a office job but it trun in to a door sales thing and I didn’t like it because I am a women working at night  by myself going to customers door and I didn’t think that was all Safe. An sometime I didn’t get paid .
bad,"Its a lot to learn I really mean a lot to learn so much that its over whelming. Very strict, stressful no flexibility and very much demanding. Management do not have any type of understanding when it comes to any type of situation its always strict policy and procedure and not willing to work with you and possible being a little lean ant and not willing to compromise. I its not so much the job its the management there make your job hard and to continue to work there. there is very high either people are quitting and or they are getting fired because metric is very hard and impossible attainable  "
bad,Quotes are HUGE even in customer service. You miss one of your stats and you lose your entire commission. The people you work with are great but the stress level is high.
bad,wasn't happy there at all everybody was treated differently pay wasn't goof at all but dont get me wrong i loved doing the installation part of it was a lot of fun and this was directv at the time before ATT bought them might be different now not sure
bad,They pay 10 dollars an hour plus commission but its almost impossible to make commission because they barely explain it and the structure is always changing
bad,"Management is constantly on you about selling Directv even if you hit your sales target. That's what pays out the most in your commission but I once had a manager mention selling Directv to me over 30 times in one 8 hour shift( I was at 5 submitted at a goal of 3 at the time). Upgrades, gross adds and pretty much any other item in your at risk(1,350) might as well not even exist.  In my sales area only a small percentage of the county has Directv and we get a lot of customers who already have service with us, but don't tell management that because they will flip out. Meanwhile we don't see them doing anything to drive customers into our stores."
bad,pay is the only thing that keeps you there. everyday something has changed and you may not know. Rather go look it up on top of everything ELSE YOU HAVE TO MAINTAIN TO KEEP FROM GETTING A WRITE UP .
bad,All this company do is lay off hard working dedicated people who have dedicated their time and time away from their family to help their company be successful.
bad,you have to experience it for yourself so its not something i can convince someone of its not for everyone work life balance is of no essence if you get hired prepare yourself for long hours you will have no seniority the company is pushing for full time reps out and only part time
bad,"Typical day of work is clock in and get on the phones,. Stay on the phones all day making sales. Pretty much force products on the customer whether or not they want or need the services. Best part of the job was the pay."
bad,"ATT purchased DirecTV and changed all the policies for transferring and the pay structure/cutting wages raised benefits cost,promised increased pay and hasn't followed through also were told we would be cross trained in other departments of ATT...(telephone, broadband,fiber,splicing)"
bad,"The company is taking a much different approach to their employees. "
bad,"This is a very micro-managed facility. There are many stats that you have to juggle. Prepare to be excellent in every one. You don't get paid to think outside the box; only read scripts that are in front of you and if you go outside of the scripts, you get verbal, written, and then disciplinary acts. The fellow employees are friendly. There is a diner inside, but it's kind of pricey. It's close to several food places."
bad,It was a great place to work. Many things learned. A lot of experience in customer relations attained. Customer and goal focused. Makes sure to put customers first
bad,"it was great working there until they put a 20 year old in charge who felt the need to treat his employees horrible, degrade them and persuade them to commit fraud to boost his numbers. stayed two weeks after the change and left. "
bad,"Forced overtime managed in a way that it is 6 days a week"
bad,"As a new employee you work the late shift and they don't mention that you could be on this shift indefinitely.  If you are one of the select few it isn't as bad.  I go to work at 9:00 and get off at 7:00.  Coworkers are great, management isn't so great.  I love to talk to people so it's great, but you have to hard sell on every single call even though this is a billing cue."
bad,"As far as pay and compensation goes, its a fantastic job.  However the rest of the job is plagued by virtually no work life balance and terrible management.  The Bozeman, MT location lost 8 reps over the course of a single year because of the managers and the higher ups didn't seem to bat an eye.  "
bad,"Typical work day login as a number not as a human. Its been so long but it was my first just since coming back from overseas. Very funny environment."
bad,when i contracted through AT&T the managers were great however I there's a very high turn over here...  Internet Services in Detroit is the worst.  They do not Value their employees..
bad,"Work environment was uncomfortable, not much cooperation among staff and mangement. Difficult time period due to breakup of Bell system, changing goals and objectives."
bad,"ATT doesnt care about helping customers, all they want from you is SALES and Money. that is all you are good for. Management has poor communication skills. Do not apply for the call center. You will hate it. This company governs your time like the military. If you are two minutes late it is an occurance. no ifs ands or buts."
bad,"When I was in training they never told us of the million metrics you had to meet every month! You don't get information regarding the entirety of the actual job until you get out of training. The work environment is FULL of DRAMA! coworkers having relations with each other AS well as with MANY of the managers and other personnel ESP to get promotions or favoritism. They have impossible tasks for each call and your expected to be the perfect human with not one error, EX: your made to say a script verbatim (which changed every day) and if your customer is yelling at you or asking you not to read it , you must read it or you will get in trouble no matter what the situation...A majority of the metrics you are ""supposed"" to meet are completely out of your control... I know jobs make changes but this job not only makes a million changes a DAY but the managers don't communicate the change or tell you not to follow procedure on any call and its your A** on the line. This place was a HUGE headache the ONLY thing i enjoyed was the paychecks esp. if you have no college education. I was told i could advance within the company HAHAHA thats funny!! This place of employment has a turn-over rate like you could not imagine , they fire you for any and everything. EX you are EXTREMELY hurt if you dont have vacation days... forget this job, its over for you. And the steps of discipline with attendance are impossible to come off of.EX 9 months without being late one minute for any reason or your written up, again.I;ve seen great employees who have worked very hard for this company be put on the"
bad,"AT&T is a wonderful company to work for: the management team  makes the job so very stressful. They are lazy and not properly trained. The management team makes poor decisions which effects the Customer Service Representative job in a negative way. I feel the upper level team need to go into the Chicago Office an clean out their manangement team. The manager have become to comfortable in their jobs an do not care about the service reps at all.  They need to add more professional manager who cares about generating revenue for the company. Managers who care about the success of their employess as well as themselves. I was with AT&T for 12 years; I worked in the Customer Care Inbound Call Center.  I was terminated for not making my sales quota; the goals would conconstanly change. Management routed the calls to different departments so commisssion representative would succeed while salary representatives would not succeed at all. We were to resolve the customers concerns then offer them products in services. This is the way the compnay loses: the management team would want us to up sale the customer services even if it would increase their bills when a customer would call into reduce their bill. Now you have a irate customer who doesn't trust nor want to make future purchases from the company. The management time observed the calls for quality assurance however, would over look bad behaviors an frqaudulent sales. I could go on and on however, the management team in the Chicago Office is very lazy an do not care about their employess. They set behind their desk most of the day listen"
bad,There are so many expectancies and sometimes impossible request that are asked of the employees.
bad,Great job if you have no soul. They want to sell high priced stuff to people on fixed incomes. They were looking for more sales and less customer service.
bad,"The good about AT&T would be that the work environment I have experience in is pretty laid back, there is a CVS on the premises which is very convenient, the employees are union protected, and the building, where I work, is surrounded by all kinds of places that are in walking distance."
bad,Only care about numbers.  Pay is good but push sales to elderly customers and most employees feel its unethical in the way it's presented to the customers.
bad,"ATT does not care about their employee, this company will lay you off in a drop of the hat no matter how good your performance ratings are. Worked there for 11 years."
bad,Not a good place to work. It's draining and takes all of your time. District Manager is constantly breathing down your neck to get things down. Not a very comfortable environment.
bad,AT&T treated me unethically.    My personal rights as a U.S. citizen were violated.  I was not able to have free speech.  AT&T treats senior workers very unfairly.
bad,Att really sucks! But directv was better when I first started. I didnt like working for att thats why I quit! The pay was horrible and they treat there workers like trash
bad,The union encourages and supports lazy workers. You work more then you should bc everyone abuses FMLA. The older workers are the worse they do the bare minimum and when it’s time for a surplus the lower seniority group gets let go first
bad,"The manager above my direct manager was always trying to find something to write someone up for, he would go beck six weeks to find a day where your performance score was poor to write someone up. The company would always change the grading system if you would meet the requirements."
bad,En lo personal puedo decir que no me sentí agusto en ese trabajo por la poca paga recibida
bad,Management and upper management and the union treat Term employees like garbage. The company can do what they want with you in 1-3 years and sometimes they let employees go within 3 months!
bad,"Unexpected customer situations, technical issues or sales mislead. Lack of communication between departments. Under qualified managers. Generally treated poorly. Work alone so safety and protocols are your responsibilities. Expect to work 10+ hours at any given day, some times over time is enforced. Job duties change frequently. Pay and benefits are great. Fair warning, benefits are only allowed to be used per 3rd party insurance's approval upon long medical leave of absence. Great for a stable well paid job, poor for overall healthy or enjoyable work environment on company grounds. Job advancement is possible, but time and title are based off seniority and many workers have 20+ years."
bad,"Good pay, very poor management, unskilled management and upper management, no opportunity for advancement unless you know somebody. The company seem to promote advancement but everyone knows is all political. The company is not loyal to their employees and they will cut your position regardless of years worked, they will keep their favorites."
bad,"- stressful & heavy workload"
bad,"I work the land line side and at&t does not invest in the land line business, as it is a dying market. At&t sells an inferior internet product and refuses to upgrade systems to remain competitive in the market."
bad,I have worked for AT&T for 18 yearrs & they don't know if they can find me a job.  I was really hoping to retire from this company.  It just seems that everyone is out against you at AT&T even the union.
bad,"NEVER WORK HERE! This is not a job that a person could do who is not 100% dedicated to the sales filed. If you don't eat, breathe, and live sales this is NOT the job for you. Some days you don't interact with a single person so you simply make just your hourly pay. At times you spend hours with a customer just for them to leave without having bought anything and then they come back the next day and buy everything you offered them the day before from another rep and that rep (who was there while you were suggesting all the items the customer decided to buy) doesn't split the commission as they should. I hate shady people and majority of the people I worked with including the area manager was extremely shady and sneaky."
bad,"The role I was in causes mental illnesses for a lot of people, and most employees only stay for the benefits. You'll notice how much you hate people when you work here."
bad,"I've never been very good at sales, this was a 98% sales job, outside of that maybe taking payments. Sales isn't for everyone and I definitely couldn't get a hang of it."
bad,"overall the compensation is great, but it is a stressful and competive enviornment. There is little to no job security at this point. Not even for people with senority."
bad,Loved it but have had personal stuff happen so I lost the job. Have to maintain a good attendance for them to keep you at the job. It is hard for people sometimes to manage that so they lose their job.
bad,"Very stressful work environment. The pressure is very high and everything is based on how high you can get your numbers. For example, since the number of job you produce per day is the most important thing, this causes people to lie and cheat to look good. This is the AT@T culture, everyone in fear of loosing their job."
bad,"Not my type to of job"
bad,"The management was great the environment was great, the pay and it was diverse. The technology was also great. When you wanted overtime or take off you just used an App! It was even Union in Florida!"
bad,"As much as I was happy about getting the position, and the opportunities that are available.  My start in the Bellaire DSL Department wasn't the best experience."
bad,Contract can end any time without advance notice. Work life balance is good. Flexible work schedule and flex work space are something that are not available anywhere else
bad,I worked for a call center.  The stress is crazy bad.  Management was horrible.  The goals were rediculously set high so that no one could reach them and the management pushed you go achieve them but didnt give you help in trying to achieve them.
bad,Hostile work environment ...            .. allowed some worker to create some must trouble.   ................        poor company follow up after company because aware
bad,"Responsible for keeping cases organized by establishing and organizing files; monitoring  attorneys calendars; meeting deadlines; documenting actions; in putting information into file database and case management software; confirming case status with attorney.

Taking inbound and outbound calls including giving legal consultation on criminal cases; Keeping clients informed by maintaining contact on their case progress.Maintains case costs by verifying outstanding balances with attorney and clients."
bad,"Great job but comes with a sometimes unforgiving corporate mentallity, a lot of customer interactioins, very mobile and many different job tasks. Work mostly alone occasionaly in teams.Possibily of out of town work"
bad,Very stressful however it has provided me a very nice living over the years. But I love my manager she is the best at what she does and is very caring and has a very wonderful style of management. AT&T should be very lucky to have her
bad,Band worst part of job was customer interaction.Very secure job for first 5 years virtually no job security in the last 3. Layoffs start first week of february
bad,"This is a Union Job, which is nice to have that protection, but management seems to ""go out of their way"" at times to get rid of people. Management also puts unrealistic demands on employees."
bad,"My manger was wonderful, she worked very hard. The upper management was horrible and seemed to not care. They made it impossible to make any money there and set the standards to high for our little store in a small town. We did get free pizza on launch days though"
bad,"After 17 uears of service on September 15  we got the announcement that December 22nd would be our last day. Merry Christmas 🎁 from a company that was out first before kids , family, church, etc. due to getting rid of landlines 📞. Me ans my office we’re committed to this company daily because of their no fault point system. Closed doors bring bigger opportunities so thats what im hoping for."
bad,"I love meeting new people everyday and supplying great customer service as well as my independence. However, the lack of communication at such a prominent company is very disappointing."
bad,"Very fast moving,  stressful,  have to be able to multi task and meet 100% per month goal.  Do not appreciate their long time employees.   Learned alot of types of computer systems."
bad,Everything went down the hill after AT&T bought out DirecTV. All the perks of working there were taken away. It went from a joyful place to I can't wait until I find another job.
bad,We are like family. Hardest part of the job no support or accountability from management team in all departments. I learned that its not what you know its who you know if you want to advance.
bad,Very poor work/life balance.  I see customer more than I see my own children.  Would not rcommend to anyone that wants to have a family as you will never see them.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job, is my co-workers. "
bad,"At&t is a great company to work for but be careful of management. if they dont like you they will work you as much as possible. other techs would work 8 hrs and go while the less favorite ones would be ran 1hr 30mins from your house. i specifically remember hearing about how they were working a tech to death so to speak. he lived 1 hr from the job sites and they kept him out from 8 to 8. he didnt quit so they fired him before it became at&t. one might not thing it so bad now that there is a union but they havent even acknowledged the union contract, they changed to hourly and refuse to look at the contract to keep things fair for the techs"
bad,"To start off, AT&T is one of the worst companies to work for unless you are very good friends with someone very high up. That being said, it WAS easy to progress within the company, but with the merges with DirecTV and Time Warner Inc. there will be massive lay offs and job security is out the window. Some of my co-workers are best friends. I had 2 completely different experiences with management, my first manager almost made me quit within the first week, then my second manager I would have done anything for. Some of the managers are great, but those are the usually new managers that haven't had the pleasure of the uppers raining on their parade."
bad,Bad sales tactics.. Management expects you to lie to customers to achieve sales goals. Pay is decent. Company will take advantage of you. I was asked to come back earlier than 6 weeks from maternity leave because a new phone was launching.
bad,This company is definitely not it if you're looking for job security and stress free environment. They will literally stress you out to the point where you if you don't make those sales even though you have excelled in customer service they will keep writing you up until you've had enough and just leave.
bad,Did not work for AT&T; but for Verizon Communications.  Provided access service to AT&T and did settlement for Verizon clients who used AT&T
bad,"la verdad es una muy buena empresa en cuanto  a infraestructura, publicidad , pero por ser un producto tan costoso no es competitivo en el mercado actual."
bad,"I can honestly say that when I started working for AT&T, I loved my job. The money was good, the management team was great, our personalities were able to be shown and more times than not encouraged, but it didn't take long for that to change. After about 8 months with the company, I underwent my first commission structure change and it honestly benefited the company more than it did the individual employees. Roughly put, I suffered about a 15k a year paycut but the workload is heavier than it's ever been. If you're looking for a company that takes care of it's employees, I'd suggest looking elsewhere, as I'm doing the same."
bad,A great place for college students. you have the ability to make your own money this is a commission based job. phones sell themselves just learn to educate yourself on other At&t products.
bad,Change in Comp plans every year as well as poorly trained management team. Management seems lost. Management doesn't care about customers at all. Horrid Customer Service
bad,"The manager was wonderful in making sure the schedule was posted on a timely basis.  Loved working with my co-workers, they were fun, caring, and made the time spent at work enjoyable.  The hardest part of the job was competing with the company itself and meeting sales goals.  Company sets sales goals for the in store reps.  Also running better and cheaper on line.  Customers see these prices come into the store to see the product, talk pricing and plans, then go online to due business.  I enjoyed working with the public.  Being able to help someone solve a problem to setting someone up with new services and a phone."
bad,"I believed AT&T to be my new beginning, my new career and a place where my hard work and good work ethics would catapult me to a position earned by my own labors.  It didn't take too long for me to realize how far off I was when it came to my ability to control my future within this company.  After three months of employment, I was advised that I was hand picked to be moved to a ""new"" organization within AT&T.  This had nothing to do with the job I was doing since I quickly learned the position and exceled at achieving my monthly quotas.  Let me add that the only training I was given was computer lead courses and side by side instruction from a veteran employee.  The side by side instruction was awesome and the only helpful action given to me.  In my personal opinion, online powerpoint classes are a waste of time and money.  Everyone other person I worked with was given a two week introductory training class and other instructor lead courses that were pertinent to the position I held.  I suppose I just slipped through the cracks.  So to continue, in the new organization I excelled in the position I upheld.  By the next midyear review, I was in first position of all other employees in the same role within my organization and in second position company wide.  It was at this point that other opportunities presented themselves.  I had a choice of what the next step would be for me to continue advancement within AT&T.  Or so I thought.  I received a call from a member of upper management in the organization I was removed from after my first three months of employment offering me"
bad,sucks The management promoted people who weren't qualified and they didn't work with those on work accommodations (disability( at all.If you used it you had to stay and make up the the time that you needed to use. The management there really sucks and they are so crooked
bad,There is nothing special about working for this company. The pay is close to minimum wage.
bad,"This company is more concerned about making the sale rather than helping the customer; that's where I didn't fit in. I ended up quitting because management focused on the negatives rather than the positives. I enjoy constructive criticism, but this place used sabotage and found your weakness on a daily basis. I'm not sure if it was some kind of reverse psychology, but it didn't work on me."
bad,Required 24/7 support to support run of applications including weekend support and night support.
bad,The company does not know from day to day what they are doing!
bad,it was an ok job but to me i feel that they really don't care about there empoylies.
bad,"Outstanding supervisor. "
bad,"The environment had become so sales driven that low level managers that you know are incapable of doing the job that you and your co-workers have done for 17+ years, please don't advise this job to innocent people."
bad,"After promising the government to create 7,000 jobs if they received a tax cut, they instead have laid off/surplussed over 20,000 employees. There is zero chance of keeping a job as a service technician. Mobility is safe for now, but the wireline side is in turmoil. I have 6 years put in with this company. People with as many as 20+ years with the company are facing surplus. On top of them cutting jobs, we have been forced 12 hours overtime per week."
bad,After completion of training the company separated 250 new hire. I would not recommend this company to anyone. And the odd part about the downsizing is they kept the contractors.
bad,Company wont hire and you cant move up laying off techs that you could move up to unmeetable metrics no idea when you are going home if low on seniority work every Sunday and holiday. But good pay
bad,"Depends on the department you are in.  I can’t imagine all of AT&T was as bad as mine. At least I hope, it has changed.  Favoritism was rampant in the group I worked in.  Not enough checks and balances on the Director level and above,"
bad,Run as fast as you can they don’t care about nothing but a sale. If u have a family this place is not for you ATT only wants someone that can make them money
bad,Numbers driven environment that promoted shoddy work and lying to customers in order to meet demands of managers and corporate.  Wad hired for customer service but company clearly does not actually care about its customers.
bad,"Worked as a Prem Tech for 3.5 years. It was generally an enjoyable job you got to manage your own day. There was a decent amount of physical labor which I found to be better than any desk job. The hardest part is planning out your time off because you work until a job is done, so there was no guarantee of when you would get off for the day. The corporate culture isn't good. Eventually AT&T laid 100 people in my position off from our area. There was always a some sort of shortage whether it was tools or equipment and you were expected to make it work. The pay and benefits were good but there was always lay offs hanging over your head."
bad,Company took over Directv and has been the biggest joke ever. they care nothing about you and have weekly meeting about how you can lose your job. Management doesnt go by the handbook. When you have the money to buy out any company I guess you can do what you want. The pay was good but with no job security why waste your time.
bad,"La presión en call center en todas las áreas es impresionante. Muy exigentes en las métricas. Los clientes que se manejan 99% te llaman molestos, te insultan, etc. En lo personal no me gusto aguantar humillaciones de sus clientes en USA."
bad,"If the general public knew what kinds of environmental laws and ethics violations were going on daily, they would freak out.  Its not the company you remember.  They are low life conniving filth in management.  Its all about the money.  Anyone who is an ATT customer probably already knows this.  The employees arent much better.  The ones with ethics and honesty are beating down, retaliated against, treated like garbage, and have their jobs threatened or even taken with trumped up BS that the companys own Code of Business Conduct says is not tolerated or allowed, yet those rules only apply when they are slamming an employee.  When management violates it all over the place, its completely ignored.  If you get a job there, dont bother thinking you are in a good place.  Fleece as much money out of them and do as little to get it.  Decent honest, hard working, law abiding employees dont last or get their integrity and morals beaten down so badly they just go through the motions to keep that paycheck."
bad,"I couldn't make enough money to pay the bills, even though i was working Fifty hours plus.  Commission based only, which means if you get no sales, you get no money.  No matter how hard you're working.  The manager was an amazing person though, I respect him and SOME of my co-workers.  Other than that I would never do it again."
bad,"Feels like the company is always looking for the next way to terminate you, always a new rule that is put in place to deter you from bonus’ given out for following strict guidelines"
bad,If you want a personal life or to persue a higher education or career field avoid this position. If you just want to be a cable technician for your whole life check it out.  Working here will make recruiters think you can't do anything else making leaving the job very difficult.
bad,I did not enjoy my time at AT&T. The company as a whole did not value their employees and there was little to no opportunity for advancement since the merge with Directv. I would never recommend anybody work there.
bad,"Management is unrealistic with project time-frames. Treats all long-term temps like cattle.  Tells employees that they will get a permanent but then makes them transfer to locations far from their home to keep their jobs, then terminates their ""contract"" after 3 yrs of employment to avoid overhead costs for the company."
bad,Very poor work environment unethical practices asked of employees. Preferential treatment. Not a goos place to work. They don't care about employees you're just a number put on a seat to produce sales by any and all means possible.
bad,I got hired on to install directv and as soon as we signed a contract with the union I was laid off. A bunch of bull. I was one of the best techs on my team and had some of the best numbers but because I was low seniority they cut me loose. Screw this company. I recommend no one ever work for At&T because honestly they could care less about their employees. The pay was good but you could lose your job at any moment so it’s not worth it.
bad,"For the first year I had absolutely nothing to do. I was given no specific duties. Yet the outsourcer billed for my presence there by some means. It was the same story with many others. I learned by assisting those who seemed to have work in their assignments. The AT&T professionals who came to give seminars to us spoke in their own institutional jargon, alienating to anyone outside their tight group. So the seminars were not informational. People worked without understanding what they did. A general understanding of AT&T's works were not possible. Their stocks were plummeting; they had, for the first time dropped below 18 dollars per share on the DOW. AT&T was entirely in need of being completely reconstructed and two Congressional remakes had not made AT&T simpler. Nevertheless, I did learn how to manage corporate project set ups and how to find missing funding on ATT's archaic computer programs and get that funding back into circulation for the prospective corporation's international communications. The workplace consisted of fine people doing their best to gain a meaningful understanding of a system so beyond contemplation that it, internally, no longer understood itself. Yet, chasing down missing funding in old systems was challenging and rewarding as well as assisting companies obtain their service project goals in other countries."
bad,"Typical day was dealing with customer base from the 48 states. I have learned how to handle a multitude of different diverse people and learned how to negotiate a win win resolution to almost every situation"
bad,"I work for the company contracted to service at&ts fleet. at&t controls the contract, they do not care about their employees. the pay is sub par and there is not a lot of room for improvement."
bad,Nice Place to work  i get the opportunity to speak and work with different type of people with different personalities. I also like having different rewards for working hard with having a schedule flexibility.
bad,clock in and start working on device unlocks go to lunch and two 15 minutes breaks and then back to work. its a cool place to work but I need a better and and would like to move up in the company
bad,"I have never hated a company more than this one.  The culture is purely based on who is running the site you are at.  IF they are great, morale is great and if they suck, your job becomes a meaningless soul sucking life drain you will do anything to avoid."
bad,Management lectures and yells at employees in front of co-workers. Schedules change every 6 months so they're never guaranteed. People are always leaving so you never know who you'll work with.
bad,"I would not recommend anyone to work at ATT."
bad,AT&T does not care about their customers or their employees.  They only care that you get sales. How can you hire someone and after nesting and half goals and they don't meet they are placed on corrective action? Where is the time to develop?  AT&T has revolving employment doors.  Do not apply there is no job security and the floor supervisor can get away with halfway training you. At the end of the day you get punished not them.
bad,"First gathered all necessary information and paper work for technicians daily work. "
bad,Cold calling and more cold calling and more cold calling - Yellow pages business advertising sales calls per day about 100 you might make a sale
bad,You would think because this is a huge company it would be a great place to work but it is much the opposite. There are layoffs every quarter and most times you are in fear of not having a job.
bad,"Since the workplace i was in was field with friendly people it was a good day at work majority of the time i come i grab my tab hit the floor and begin to sale , then take instruction and guidance from management."
bad,"I started out at directv and the job was great! They treated everyone well, and really cared about the customer. Att bought us out in 2016 and it went down hill. They started laying hundred around our region. They dont care about the employee and they almost brag about not caring for the customer. I will say that my boss was great! He always helped me out and was here for me, that goes for the supervisors at our shop as well."
bad,Contacting customers to bring accounts up to date; emailing Account Managers if there is no response from the customers to resolve debt; creating spreadsheets and doing reconciliation to locate missing payments.
bad,"Great company to work for. Need to have ability to multi task the issues at hand so you can resolve the issue in a reasonable amount of time. Of course listen to the concern at hand, is one of the key points in this line of buisness"
bad,"They really don't care about you as long as you make the company as much money as they can juice out of you. The management is rude, they give no flexibility for anything including funerals and or birth."
bad,"Started the job with a training course that taught me a fair amount of useful sales skills. The first day outside of training, I felt prepared and empowered for what seemed like to be a simple job. I knew nothing. Felt like I did not understand anything that I was doing. "
bad,"at&t is eliminating installation and line workers throughout the company. They are picking up the slack with contractors. Terrible work conditions with more ""surpluses"" always looming overhead."
bad,poco interes del suervisor por las ventas falta de creatividad y manejo de mterial para la pulicidad correcta
bad,"Lots of micromanagement, which leads to frustrated workers. Leadership typically follow the flavor of the month strategy, thus difficult to understand the direction of the organization. Layoffs every year."
bad,"Training was bad from the start.  We sat for four hours and watched the paint dry before we were given a username to log into the computers.  Once we got logged in we were told to go to a knowledge base and read what we found.  We were basically going to the company's version of wikipedia and reading random articles, none of us knew what we were even looking at.  It was three more days before we even learned how to clock in.  The trainers don't like to answer questions; every time we asked a question we were told to look up the answer and then ignored.  You get fired for everything, right down to taking a plastic fork from the lunch area unless you bought something from them.  If you brought your own lunch and forgot a spoon, you better drink your lunch because they'll fire you for taking a plastic one from them.  Once we were out of classroom training our sales manager came in and basically told us to forget everything we'd learned because he was going to teach us how he wanted things done on HIS team (so we wasted three weeks of our lives).  This is NOT a customer service position, it's sales.  If the customer isn't buying then AT&T doesn't want you talking to them.  We were told to offer on every call, our sales manager even had a sales pitch for a wife who called in to disconnect her late husband's line...  We were told to play up the products and promotions, but unless asked we weren't supposed to say anything about term commitments or contracts.  That's all in the ToS and it's not AT&T's fault if the customer doesn't read.  It's all about the sales.  If you're not selling"
bad,They teach you how to lie to people in order to get the most features out of their plan. It's a giant sh*tty corporation that overprices their cell phone plans for no reason
bad,"A lot of work and a lot of overtime, but a lot of family time missed. Good benefits with good pay, but you are working alot. During peak summer time we are being forced 6 day work weeks while it will die down in the winter months."
bad,"After interviewing for the In-Home Expert position here in Memphis, Tennessee , I was very excited to hopefully get the job. I did! From there, it was downhill. I quit a very good job at Apple for this opportunity as well. The pay is not what they say it is. My manager was very hands off, and seemed lost at times. I didn’t receive all of my materials, including shirts, ID card and access to internal programs months into the role. The In Home Expert position was not something I’d do if you have a family as well. There is no work life balances"
bad,It use to be a great company to work for 20yrs ago but over the last 10yrs the atmosphere & managers in the downtown Tulsa business office have not been the same. It's always a dark cloud over your head about job stability if you don't make sales.
bad,"Learned alot about fiber optic networks. Difficult to get intouch with management. They werent really friendly, anyone less than management were treated poorly."
bad,"Es un buen lugar de trabajo, donde estás cómodo y te pagan bien pero desde el principio de tu estancia ahí es un constante acoso por parte del personal para quitarte el empleo. La mayoría de la gente que trabaja allí no dura más de tres meses."
bad,"Good products and team members. "
bad,You are pushed to work fast. All they care about is numbers. No one ever gets in trouble for doing sloppy installs. Only for taking yo long to do one. Constant stress about meeting your numbers. Constant overtime. No home life.
bad,"Att has integrity issues, employees at the Chapel Hill location are a hot mess, etc etc. Nuff said. Customers are constantly bombarded to get tv and internet services. If you don’t meet your goal, your job is threatened."
bad,AT&T always puts fear in employees about loosing there job and getting surplussed. I was there for about three years and saw many people surplussed and then bring in lower paid to replace them.
bad,Was perm for 4yrs then laid off was term for 1.5yrs then laid off great pay no job security management cool people.                      Union a joke.
bad,"High turnover, overcharge wireless bills, hidden charges on customer bill and store and customer service have little control of credit or fixing account error."
bad,work was good but having to deal with management and their numbers made our jobs alot harder. all the company/mangers care about is productivity not quality of work. company laid off thousands of employees all over the US. they had us working mandatory 6 days prior to giving us our 3 week lay off notice. i would never work for this company again
bad,"The dollar is the bottom line. AT&T would rather hire 3rd party companies, than take care of their most tenured and accomplished employees. Customer Service negatively impacted due to lack of knowledge of 3rd party Service Companies."
bad,Had an issue with a manager saying things to me that were inappropriate. When I brought it up to my direct supervisor she told me “You should just leave if that kind of talk bothers you.” So I did.
bad,It's a shame what a company will do and just lay you off knowing it will cause so many problems very unfair. Those that are making these decisions are making huge amounts of money and retiring
bad,severely micro-managed and severely under-staffed.  You have to check in with manager during every interaction.  High Pressure sales tactics.  Used to be fun to go to work.
bad,"The first little while was great, then they look for ways to write you up. It felt like if you were to breath in a way that displeased them they would fire you. I have never been so stressed in my life."
bad,Training now consists of PDF files instead of proper training.  The systems used to dispatch jobs are slow and buggy.  I am expected to do lower rated jobs as well as my normal work load.  Customers paying for premium service have to wait for me to finish with a lower priority job to come take care of them.  The company has jacked up prices of POTS service in an effort to intentionally show a loss of customer base.  vOIP service is being pushed on everyone and it is not the same quality or service.
bad,If you do not mind the constant changes to policy and procedure it is a good fit. Also your manager and schedule will change every 6 months and attendance policy is very strict.The job itself is very difficult as you are trying to help people who are limited in their ability to help you help them and their opinion basically decides your performance scores so if they are upset with att they are upset with you.
bad,"I worked here for more than 3 years, I would highly recommend not working here. You will work long hours, holidays and weekends, it's seniority based and they do not hire consistently. You will be treated like a number in a system and will be consistently micro managed until you have been worked to your core. The only two things I've taken from this job is the pay and the work experience. otherwise steer clear of this company all together. They mistreat customers and have seen how they treat employees and customers alike."
bad,"Limited room for advancement, and poor organizational structure. Salary does not reflect work accomplishments and achievement. I would not recommend working here"
bad,"At&t was a great company to work for nearly a decade ago, but has since become a greedy shell of it's former self. This year (2019) was dubbed ""the year of the stockholder"" by a high ranking sales leader. We were downsized to understaffed levels at every location and then all the goals were raised. We were told to work with what we had, operate more efficiently, and get used to it. Then we were penalized if employees quit or if attrition numbers fell outside an approved range. We are constantly belittled, demeaned, and spoken down to and then told to go energize our teams, embolden them to high spirits to maintain morale... at our own expense because the company is undergoing budget cuts and can't afford to buy pizza for the store."
bad,ATT does not care about how much time you get to spend with your family. You work until the load is clear no matter what time it is. Most of the time the customers don’t want you to come that late.
bad,The territory manager was very biased I’m a larger person certain items for me was called inappropriate and others were told they looked nice. Worked for s 3rd Party
bad,"Well, well, well. What is there to say about AT&T Springmobile? Nothing. There is nothing to say. Besides the fact that its a ""retail Partner"" of AT&T owned by Gamestop that goes out of its way to consistently prey upon below-poverty employees with false dreams of grandeur and the promise that they will provide bottom level employees with a live-able wage."
bad,"The work itself was awesome; however, it's physically demanding and can cause medical issues. It's very demanding on the knees and shoulders. It's a self managed job. The best part was the variety of work, such as office, driving and outdoors."
bad,very stressful and work hours are not family friendly when Directv became ATT it didn't feel like a job anymore but more like a military it wasn't;'t a happy place to work and they didn't seem to care much about the employees it was more like welcome these are the new rules deal with or quit
bad,"You end up making long lasting relationships and friendships, but as a whole the company has been cutting costs and taking it out in the employees salary."
bad,At&t needs  better managers to have a good team on board working for this company. favoritism runs in this company if your not liked well manager will find ways to fire you.
bad,"I enjoyed working at AT&T until they fired me for being too amazing. I was #2 in the region and #1 on my team for gross voice adds. Some people are just not ready to see me at the top of thier company maybe it is because im black. It took my boss 4 months to fired me because my numbers was so great she couldn't afford to cut me but since she was retiring she let me go and others. How can you say you love your employees (she told us that)and leave the company in devastation by firing the best but i get it she was probably following orders because everybody downsizing. In the end, AT&T was a amazing adventure."
bad,I would never recommend this job to anyone. I hated to go to work everyday due to the policy on how the job wanted you to bring up a tool on the computer screen just to pay a customer bill and if you didn't do it you are dinged for it in the call center.
bad,Company was great at first but then had changed to sales when customer service was the primary goal. All they wanted was to push sales and not take care of customers.
bad,"The pay was hourly plus commission, and totaled out to better than other similar jobs in the industry. There was a staggering level of micromanagement. Every week or two, some new ""best practice"" would surface that was either predatory or just ignored customers' wants and needs, and if you didn't do it, you'd be escalated through a disciplinary process. Actual examples for me were not bringing out an Apple Watch to try to sell to an 85 year old woman with a flip phone that wouldn't work with the Watch in the first place, and not trying to get customers who already had one television service with us to get our alternative television service on top of it (the secondary service provides nothing that the primary service doesn't already provide. It's essentially a lite version of the primary DirecTV.)."
bad,"Horario de 11 a 8"
bad,"Nunca hubo una capacitación y eran varias plataformas las que se manejaban que si eran difíciles, mal ambiente de trabajo todos veían por su interés personal, pocas prestaciones al principio te dicen que tendrás un bono y ese bono nunca te lo depositan , horario muy extenso ,"
bad,"Did not like it, did not believe in their services that I had to sell and the merger made a lot of things more difficult than what they should have been and the two companies were not on same page yet"
bad,"The work itself is actually pretty fun and challenging. The down side is the management. Unfortunately the managers do not understand how to be leaders all they know is how to be ""THE BOSS"""
bad,Supervisors are terrible and schedule sucks. Its all different depending on which union you are in. Hard to get what you need to help the customer because you have no support from anyone.
bad,Upper mgmt. would actually threaten your job daily to get the numbers they wanted from each individual. Not a great place to work. And the shifts changed daily.
bad,"The call center was a decent job, at times it can get out of hand when it gets too busy. During training they make it seem like they care about you but once you're out on the floor you are on your own"
bad,"This job is a great entry level position, also very demanding. You are expected to go above and beyond with every customer interaction and provide an all around wireless and home entertainment experience which is obtainable, but the pay rate that is provided is a joke. Being a Retail Sales Consultant who breaks down monthly and annual costs for services and providing an all around solution isn't a simple task."
bad,"Received a list of existing clients, which needed to be retained.  Due to the previous rep, this became a real bad situation.  Empty promises that needed to be dealt with."
bad,If you are going to force me to answer this over and over for the same company why dont you make it where you can tell that you are asking abou the same
bad,"Inconsistent schedules made it hard to balance home/work life"
bad,this job was a great place to work at. wish i could work back here again. mangers were good and caring . work wasn't hard at all. people were nice and fun to work around
bad,everyone is on anti depressants and hates their positions. They are currently on a union strike due to treating representatives within the store unfairly.
bad,Working here is good experience.I learned many things here coming to work culture it is pretty much good.Finally i worked as a Sr..ETL developer here it helps me to improve my career growth.
bad,This is abosolutely the WORST company I have ever worked for in my life. They do not care about their customers or employees. If you were on the clock and dying I swear they would ask you to stay alive until your shift is over and penalize you if you left in the ambulance or died.
bad,"For being the phone company of all phone companies, it is really difficult to go above and beyond for a customer due to their practices. Not a good company to work for at all. I worked for a contact center through a third party, and it was no fun at all. Never consider working for this company."
bad,Great environment to work in with a team. Poor training. Management has trouble communicating properly. Positive environment to work in besides poor management.
bad,The contract was for 3 years and I ended up working only 1 year and  8 months.  It seems that the company is trying to eliminate contractors and use existing employees to fill positions
bad,"The manager and owner constantly blamed the employees for poor sales and absolutely did not know how to treat his employees right. terrible atmosphere, would not recommend to anyone."
bad,"The job overall is super simple and actually quite enjoyable. However AT&T has several kinks to work out with their management in the Hunstville area. Severely understaffed, extremely high turnover rate due to the way employees are treated by management. I would recommend the job, but not in the Huntsville area."
bad,didn't work for at&t so i do not know why this pulled up i worked for DirecTv for over a year and half as a customer service rep for through converges in south salt lake
bad,job was inbound retention call center . We were required to maintain the customer and then try to sell additional products to the customer .  Job was very demanding and difficult but could also be rewarding .
bad,A typical day at work was just go in and do your work.  What i have learned most from AT&T you will always be recognized for how well you did your job and how well you get along with others.  i absolutely loved my coworkers we believed in helping each other.  Everyone pulled there weight.  The hardest part of the job getting the information you needed to do the job.  Sometimes the orders did not have the information that was needed.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people.  I had the opportunitty to work with some wonderful people.
bad,Did not like it my manager was an inconsiderate person and had no feelings for anyone but himself I wish I never work with anybody like that again.
bad,"I enjoyed working with the customers and co-workers. The levels of inconsistency were too much to deal with for a long period of time, and the management were not well trained on the specific line of business."
bad,"I worked for a great team, however AT&T did not care about their seasoned employees and started laying off those with the most experience that were the heart of the company."
bad,"I have really nothing good to say about ASM, there was zero support for me at this job and i was left to my own devices. Management need training on how to support their staff!"
bad,"AT&T provided a great salary and fellow Techs were a very helpful. I resigned because Technicians have no idea when they will be getting off of work and I needed a predictable schedule for a healthy social life and for the furthering of my education."
bad,I enjoyed helping customers resolve their claims when an error occurred in their print advertising.. I worked with sales reps and managers to retain customers.
bad,"Working to install u-verse all over Florida. Working outside in all sorts of weather, working in attics all day. You do get a full 3 weeks of training in a warehouse before you go out on the field, which is great for new people."
bad,My job  was to  help customers with  there bills  and services on  daily basics also  was  top collector for  25 years  good  customer skills . got along  with all  my  mangers and  co workers.
bad,"I worked for this company while it was still Michigan Bell/Ameritech. It is far worse to work there now, would not recommend the stress it causes."
bad,"Was a sales position and not customer service like originally agreed. Co-workers were wonderful."
bad,I hated working for att. The benefits are great but there is no chance for advancement and they treat you like a number and not a person.
bad,"Not a great company to work for. I started with them and I liked it at first, but then i Couldn't take it anymore of getting yelled at and your job is on the line just because a customer gives you a bad review."
bad,"ADP®, one of the world’s largest providers of business outsourcing and human capital management solutions, serves more than 600,000 businesses of all types and sizes in 100 countries. We help employers increase productivity, improve employee engagement, and meet regulatory and legislative requirements using our solutions for human resources, payroll, talent management, tax, and benefits administration."
bad,Good place to work until they want to move jobs south. Not worker orientated. Get more work from less people and not necessarily interested in promoting from within
bad,I love working with my customers a day at work can be extremely busy or it can be just slow I have learned a a lot about the technology business.
bad,"ATT as a company they do pay their employees very well and the benefits are above and beyond what is expected. However, the constant micromanaging is very frustrating.. If there is a problem they put a bullseye on your back and continue to pick away until they fire you. I have seen people written up for their first counseling on monday and fired on friday. They don't give you adequate time to change the problem you were written up for. and constantly micromanaging . "
bad,"It was a okay job ,but didn't get a full experience because I was going back and forward to school. It was interfering with my school work so I had to leave."
bad,Horrible place to work at due to constant overturn on employees and their constant stress over quota. Managers are horrible and don't care about anybody except for them.
bad,"Expectations were a little rough at this job. And they had very stringent rules of what you did off the job. I liked working downtown, however. They are no longer in business at the office I was at."
bad,"Handled collection activity which may include inquiries from customers, outside vendors and/or internal departments regarding the outside payment-agent system"
bad,There is no place for growth or opportunity here. It is micro managed and every department is separated so you will never know what happens next. It's just a job but I don't recommend it to anyone looking for longevity.
bad,I hated working for at&t and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. They make millions yet cut wages whenever possible. High pressure and shady.
bad,I hated this place! The sales goals were so unrealistic and if you didn't meet them you would receive a write up. I would not recommend anyone work here unless you are ready to be a sales shark towards all of your customers. The most unethical sales tactics I have ever seen!
bad,Good people; given all the tools necessary to perform responsibilities
bad,It was ok alot of cool people.Work kinda easy but its a lot of it .
bad,"There is no reason to talk about a work stoppage. It goes along with the contractual job. When asked not to return and turn in your ID and keys, you go home and wait to be recalled."
bad,This was a fun job I planned on staying at for a long time until they decided to lay off folks end-of-year out of the blue.  I would not recommend anyone looking for job security to go there.
bad,"A typical day at work in retail, especially during the holiday season is an intense one. Managing employees and managing employees customer relations are a full days work. Exceptional customer service is the most important thing in our company and creating those experiences takes a lot of work. Only teamwork can allow these great experiences to take place and with teamwork, any team can be successful."
bad,I hated working there. It was high pressure but the employees were awesome. Management was absolutely terrible though.
bad,"Your just a number, can get kicked to the the curb at anytime."
bad,good job low pay good schedule off on weekends project closed
bad,"In the sale position, you're only as good as your last sale, and treated as such."
bad,pay was great but that was it. Horrible requirments made it impossible to help the customer with what they needed.
bad,very challenging and hard work. the lack of leadership definitely shows when asking for help. They are inconsistent in their training policies.
bad,"Good job "
bad,"answering call from directv customers assisting with billing payments& questions about bills issuing credit as needed, what I learned is how to explain bills & assist customers with understanding bills & other directv questions the hardest part of the job was trying to assist customers within the required time frame. the most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers with their directv questions & understanding their bills"
bad,"AT&T provides a pleasant, professional work environment. I learned to process funding applications and managed applicants.  Co-workers were amazing. The hardest part of the job was meeting deadlines but the outcome was rewarding."
bad,Overall a very great place to work the environment is face pace and changes is one of the best part of working at AT&T. I have learned to embrace change and perform your very best at all times.
bad,"As a technical support representative the position consists of several different job functions involving customer service. My job as a technical support agent is to meet the callers needs by resolving the technicial issue by leading the customer step by step over the phone to help troubleshoot their technical need, answering billing questions, staying informed with the latest equipment directv has to offer, maintaining excellent customer service, retaining customers"
bad,"horrible place to work, very unprofessional, even had customers telling me that it was unprofessional the way the management acted."
bad,DKL marketing and anything like it was a scheme. Pray on young adults.
bad,"It is a great first time job for anyone but I would not recommend making it a career for anyone, You can never make it anywhere with the company."
bad,the job entitled calling out and bugging people about upgrades to premium services
bad,"Follow the flow. Follow the flow, follow the freaking flow please!!!"
bad,"AT&T was a nice job however, if the people don't want the product, than there is no sale which, mean no pay."
bad,"Handled inbound calls to company"
bad,Great if your looking to try and start at an entry level in sales the company name I worked for was Worldwide Marketing.  Say its easy to move up but its not.  I left because of the overal company core vaules.
bad,Untrustworthy company. They dont value their employees much. Rules and changes only affect some or a portion when it should affect the entire group.
bad,"It's a union company. So, You had a lot of lazy people and only about 20% of the workforce doing 80% of the work. Management is horrible. The only thing decent about the job is the pay. So, unless you like to be disappointed at every turn, look elsewhere!"
bad,Environment resulted in low morale. Not an enjoyable work experience.
bad,all they care about is hiring new people for less then they are paying u
bad,"Didn't enjoy my time at AT&T. My supervisor reviewed a call of mine in front of my team and then bashed the whole call, embarrassed me and I ended up leaving the company."
bad,.. Strong sales quota ..No room for advancement .. Great coworkers and enjoyed being able to satisfy my customers on a daily basis. Overall great company.
bad,little to no structure and my checks bounced. lack luster compensation.
bad,At@t is overall the best Tellecom Company to work for with so many benefits.
bad,I was not being paid for work that was performed and agreed upon before hiring.
bad,I did not enjoy my timea t this company I did learn alot about retentions sales and leadership
bad,great job all around but job security is very bad. dont care if anyone passes away inn family birth deaths or medical issues moral values are low but still a great job
bad,"This job especially on the BGI or Billing and general inquiries, is very difficult. Most shifts run eight hours and most of the people calling in are very upset with their bill. What you need to focus on is calming the person down, if you're able to do this you can help the customer a lot easier and will find your job goes by smoother"
bad,Its a take it or leave it kind of job. Great people and great opportunities. Everyone was very friendly and nice. Management was great
bad,"Worst company I've ever worked for, most dishonest and unethical company do not recommend them in any way.  "
bad,It is not a place i would recommend people to work here. I would not wish anyone to have to work at that place
bad,Taking inbound calls from customers that where either interested in recieving our services or taking customer services calls from callers that are already customers with Directv.Assisting with there account.
bad,Weak inexperienced management. Customers were lied to as to their actual service coverage.
bad,The business was not open very long due to the owner backing out of his own investment.
bad,"the pay;;;;great! the managers from the lebanon location- some were good, some were mean and hateful..... had their picks!!!!! the union sucked. they didnt help like they said they would. ALL A GIMMICK. also if you looked at a manager, and she was a woman and you are a woman, a certain manager thought you ""liked her"" lol what a freaking joke place to work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,I worked as a premise technician for several years at AT&T and I have never seen so much unethical conduct by a company. From the top down there is ruthless practices that I have seen go on. It is a travesty how they treat people. I would start my own company of some sort before ever going back there. It to several years before I felt enough was enough and I found something else and put in my 2 weeks notice. There was mandatory OT. I finally had it when I worked 11 days straight with OT everyday then after that only got one day off. I could make a list of offensive practises by AT&T to long to explain in this small review. Bottom line any person can do better than to work for this company. Just so you understand the dept of my dislike for them it has been almost 3 years since employed there.
bad,Worst job ever!!! But you dont have to take my word. If you are hired.... You will find out soon enough.
bad,nothing correctly about job discription and job location.
bad,great place to work for when it was Bellsouth I think Att forgot that this was a family company and they came in and made it all about the dollar not the employee
bad,i love meeting new people .You can learn sometihing new everyday.
bad,The company does not show much care for the employees. It's all about productivity for the company.
bad,"No work life balance, schedule changed every 2 weeks based on seniority and performance.  Not recommended if you have children, pay is good. I had free Directv and Sunday Ticket"
bad,"Awesome pay, union benefits, competitive environment to work in, call center sales metrics, lofty monthly targets to hit, no room for home life,  extensive overtime"
bad,company is getting contractors for all labor work. I worked there for three years and was always scared to loose my job the next day till they let another large portion of us go AGAIN and it was finally my turn even though I could run circles around some of the other workers that had more seniority.
bad,If you are a term employee which means you are on a contract example for 2 years they will job complete before that time if you have done the work that they needed or if you are a permanent employee you could be surplused and you have been there 18 years and if your the lowest person on the totem pole you are let go and there is nothing you can do about it they only care about getting service to customers and once you have done your part to prepare for that service they let you go. Of course they got it from that point on cause all the hard work and manual labor is done so now all they have to do is flip a switch so to speak so bye bye
bad,"Constant layoffs, if you have under 20 years, you're never safe from surplus. Great job, absolutely zero job security. Have a great manager in 1st line and second line."
bad,"Worked around good people, had a few poor poor managers over the years and a few good ones, loved the job hated the politics,poor customer relations,every customer I've ever had the privledge to speak with was very very dissatisfied with at&t in general.."
bad,"I liked my job at AT&T as a premise technician, the give you on the job training also good benefits and pay.  I was one of the layoffs they did as well as around the country.  the job its self was great at first but AT&T as a whole kept making it harder for us to do our jobs correctly because of a computer program that baby sat us on a daily basis, making it harder to get paying customers in service."
bad,"Work a whole day nonstop to be grouchy and upset when the weekend comes around, if you even get the chance to be home on the weekends."
bad,i have always have a good relation with my managers. i am a good team player. The environment was safe and enjoyable. the benefit was good.
bad,"Level 10 stress job not for everyone... very sales oriented, fast paced you stay busy all day... goes by seniority for hours... if starting out you will work second shift"
bad,"Unsure when you're going through a surplus several times a year. Too stressful to enjoy. Always told can advance with school, but always out of reach."
bad,"I was assigned a basic job and I noticed the RF part of the network was not correctly utilized on the product I started working on. I started to correctly implements the RF part on the Nokia products, but the job was terminated in one month after I started due to budget issue."
bad,"I learned a lot about splicing copper and fiber. Did not care for the out of town travel for months at a time. Overall not a horrible place to work, but after 13 years there, they are just going to surplus the bottom 11 guys in the area and I will be one of them. So you can say that makes me sort of bitter."
bad,You are a number to AT&T that is it.  You will get lost in the shuffle. A company this large and monopolistic they only care about making money.  Don't let the company fool you into thinking they care about the workers
bad,even though I did work for a long time at at&t on behalf of the company act it was a fun job to have. the only reason I did not like this place it was because of my superiors.
bad,"The college co-op employees were treated like second-class citizens.  I felt like we were orphans begging for a working headset, sharing cubicles that looked like crime scenes, and being treated like we were all under suspicion.  The workspaces on our floor that were built for -I am NOT kidding-  the work from home employees were beautiful... and usually completely empty.  Guidelines changed on a weekly basis, new products and customer bases were dropped on us without warning and in some cases without the benefit of training.  Most of the managers were over-privileged children who spent more time avoiding work with their favorite employees (or at least the attractive college women), who were also avoiding work,  than they did doing any real work.  That was time that could have been spent getting even basic management training.  Company policy prohibits employees from exercising their rights to legally carry a concealed weapon for protection and management is ignorant of state and federal laws that govern how they may restrict those rights and state-licensed privileges. Breaks and lunches are unreasonably short and require you to work too long to be eligible for either."
bad,"Typical day at work was taking incoming calls to resolve customers telecommunication issues and needs whether it  be billing or selling the customer one of our new services.  examples of what we sold to our customers were cell service, land line service, high speed internet service or cable TV.  Co workers on a whole were great and we worked together as a team.  The hardest part of the job was consistently meeting my sales quotas.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping my customers resolve any issues or concerns they were having that made them call in to the call center."
bad,"I learned alot working for the company, there was always room to grow. Co-workers worked as a team and management would do what ever they could to make their team suceed."
bad,In a tipical day I mainly take care of 8 technitians assisting them in their daily work need and providind the equipment they need to perform the job and compleet it.
bad,"The pay is great, the job very stressful, was a good job to have until they surplused me."
bad,Union only saves the garbage employees and doesn't help the lower seniority employees keep their jobs. Management was usually easy to get along with. Alone most days.
bad,The job itself was okay but AT&T is an unethical business.  They are lobbying for the right to gouge prices on their service while simultaneously strong arming the government for tax breaks they don't deserve.
bad,Work for att twice in one year and got laid off and forced reduction . No job security you can do the best you can but big wigs dont care they ruin lives on a daily basis . They only look at spreadsheets and if they dont like what they see they eliminate jobs due to their high expectations.  Too greedy but lack the definition  of an american dream for their employees.
bad,"I enjoyed working at AT&T for the simply fact that I enjoy technology and sales. I enjoy working with people and providing them with the best solutions for their home, business, and work needs. That's all that I focus on."
bad,"process civil and criminal subpoenas. Relaxed work area, management very helpful. Great benefits. Been working here for 15 years."
bad,"Not to put so many years into a position,  and think that things cannot change on a daily  basis."
bad,It pays good and have very good benefits. And the environment is great.
bad,I really enjoyed my experience with DirectTv a company dedicated with incorporating cutting edge technology to residential homes.
bad,The place is great to work for and a great company but there is flaws  the store manger thinks she is better then everyone so it really puts a damper on your day
bad,"AT&T provides training to their employees. They are fully vested in employee development and growth within the company."
bad,"Management doesn't have a clue as to what they're doing, you train at your desk between calls. And the goals are sometimes unobtainable. You can't get assistance from management but they sure know how to tell you when you've done something wrong."
bad,"When I left, I didn't receive the bonus I won, they didn't give me all of my vacation pay, and they took away my first year (and didn't give me credit for it) like I wasn't even there."
bad,Paid well. I learned a lot about marketing and advertisement at this company. The company compensated me very well. Base pay was great and our annual bonuses were good.
bad,the customers were always mad at their bills and complaining all the time it was beyond stressful but i stuck it out until i got something better for my family and myself
bad,Super great job with great pay and benefits but very often you are worried about losing your job and rightly so. They layoff and hire at lower pay. The CEO has several buildings in Bothell but never heard of the place when asked. You are a number.
bad,Unless it is summer. It is too hot in Florida. But if you can take that the benefits are amazing. The job is secure unless you do something stupid. Really stupid
bad,"Great job for starting out, they do not support management decisions if you're upper management. But they have okay pay. They are super strict and not nice to women."
bad,"Managing accounts all day. New and existing customers. Sold products that customer needed as well upsold customers as well while displaying great customer service. While executing the job description at the highest level, a balance of different sale/customer service metrics were balanced on a daily/monthly basis. Also trained a lot of new consultants to top seller with our group which was called FTL4. Overall a great experience and blessing."
bad,Es un ambiente de trabajo muy bueno; buen sallrio.
bad,"Un dia normal llegaba me logueaba, atendia los clientes, aprendi mucho sobre la compañía, sobre toda la parte técnica, como reiniciar un decodificador, sobre la señal como solucionar en línea, a tener escucha activa, manejo de los clientes, la dirección y gerencia excelente son muy humanos estimulan a los empleados, la parte mas difícil cuando no podía solucionarle al cliente y tenia que enviar un técnico por que sabia que el cliente se podía molestar pero aprendi a manejar esa situación, lo que mas me gusto de mi trabajo todo lo que aprendi acerca de el y el personal que me rodea, las capacitaciones, las felicitaciones, logros obtenidos y premios que daban a los mejores operadores."
bad,"I loved working for this company, love the service to it' employees as well as customers."
bad,"business on the phones helping customers with their cell phone issues, problems,  services, coverage "
bad,"I choose not to answer. This section should be optional, and is a prime example of poor usability. Someone should really look into this. I’m almost do"
bad,"The best thing about the company is the various locations traveled. The rest is bad. "
bad,Even with the knowledge of the telecommunications industry from its inception working at AT&T has ambiguity and no real reference point to help get your answers it was miserable
bad,I did not like working at AT&T. It was very stressful. management was terrible. I met and exceeded my sales goals and was still micro managed. I would not recommend anyone to work here
bad,This job sucks butt I wouldnt recommend no one to work for this company just how they treat the people that built the multi billion dollar company!!!!!!!
bad,I am not a big fan of pushy sales and this job really felt that way. I find it hard in this day of people not working or having little money to be able to afford these amenities and you have to meet a sales quota every month. Way to stressful for me.
bad,"You are constantly monitored, spied on and reprimanded. Nothing is ever good enough. No praise. High pressure to sale on all products and offer, offer, offer."
bad,"This is absolutely the most unorganized company I have ever worked for. Everyone is new, therefore no one knows anything. Management is a joke. They spend most of the time in their offices and instead of helping you with a difficult call, they go find another agent that started a month or so before you to help you."
bad,"I was not really impressed with this job. I was hired as a temp, and never made it to full time. Their training and development was slow and dysfunctional. "
bad,"No longer the att i loved to work for, the company cared about there employees cared about the safety of there employees it is now metric driven. Minimum weekly hours worked 48 to 60hrs a week, but anything worked over an 8hour day goes against your bonus company just seemed to have lost focus on what’s important. A sweet apple tastes better than a sour one."
bad,"Working for AT&T can be quiet stressful. It is a huge headache. I don't mind following the rules at all, but there are different rules everyday. Also, everyone is not trained on the same information so it really makes it hard on the workers on the call floor because we don't know what to tell the customers."
bad,"Did not enjoy working there at all.  Had conference calls everyday for no reason.  Immature co-workers. No work/life balance.  District Manager was very good and enjoyed working with her, but that was the only thing positive about my experience."
bad,"customer service job, att left the site and left all of out to dry. like we did not matter and said that they were going to come explain but never did."
bad,"I would not suggest working retail for AT&T. the environment was very toxic. Poor team work and management. Not much room for advancement unless you are part of the ""good ole boys club"" Now this was 15 years ago so things could have changed."
bad,"It was literally the worst place I have EVER worked at. There was only a total of 3 employees at the location, including the manager. The commission and pay sucked. It was only minimum wage and you didn't always get commission. We had to lock the main door to use the bathroom because there was never more than one person in there! Its been awhile since I've been there so hopefully and maybe they handled that."
bad,"AT&T took quite a bit of my life (14 years). they were good to me in the beginning. I always found a way to succeed but they constantly were working against you in every way possible. "
bad,"aprendi a que hay que ser amables con el cliente y tener un habla para que puedas convencerlos de que compren o asepten el producto"
bad,"Overall working with AT&T was really helpful in my career."
bad,"boring job. dont feel like doing this post. why do i have to do this. leave me alone. okay  get it youre helping me so i must help you"
bad,Really stressful due to poor training. A typical work day starts with a meeting telling you how good or bad you are doing. Then you have to be off the lot with only 5 minutes to prepare for the day. I learned that this is not a company that I would refer anyone to work for.
bad,"My first week there, an employee quit. For the entire 5 moths I was there they did not even try to look for a replacement. I was forced to work 60-80 hours per week to keep the store covered with NO overtime."
bad,"It's great for someone who has just finished college and is looking for an entry-level position.  You will get a lot of professional trainings, collegial atmosphere, almost cult-like team building environment.  However, if you are a mid-level professional, know your profession pretty well, especially how things are done in the business world, this is not the place for you.  They expect you to start with a clean slate, no preconceptions of how things need to be done, but to take orders from above, as prescribed."
bad,"Es una empresa donde se pone en practica las habilidades de negociación, proceso de venta y post venta, da la oportunidad de interactuar con mucha gente y cuestiones tecnicas de las Telecomunicaciones, lastima de administración por parte de gerentes y coordinadores, se dan oportuniddes de ascenso a los amigos y recomendados y se deja por un lado el talendo, nada de balance entre vida laboral y personal."
bad,There is hardly any chance for advancement. It is hard to make money because the management is very greedy with th sales and will not allow you to learn or make your own sales.
bad,This is a horrible place to work. Almost everyone that works here has some type of medical problem due to stress and or anxiety of this work environment. Or they have bad allergy/sinus issues due to the building having mold and allowing live plants in the building even though per policy live plants are not allowed. I am current looking for a new job.
bad,Management was terrible well most of them anyway. Half the time they didn't know what they were talking about. They had to ask their team lead to answer the questions for them.
bad,"I already reviewed this why is it asking for it again? Coworkers were the only reason to show to work."
bad,Was a productive company that I really did not enjoy working for. They cared more about there quota then there employees.
bad,"Work really hard for minimal pay. Never get off the same time each day. Mandatory overtime, no choice at all. Really hard to manage family time during the week. Stressful job and anxiety inducing. Best part is meeting different people and making people happy when you have their tv system set up."
bad,AT&T is not a great place for a contractor. Each fiscal year an employee has to wonder if their going to be cut from contract. That is not a good job environment to work in.
bad,AT&T is a great place for people that enjoy stability.  I find it to be constantly changing with not much direction and a hostile environment.
bad,"For such an old company, AT&T is a poor one. This company knows what it wants and will dispose of people and positions to do so. They have gotten rid of all benefit packages for retirees. The only benefit for retiring is your 401K and they don't match very high."
bad,Directv is a throw away company. They make you drive over an hour and a half from your house before they start paying you and make you drive 3 hours between jobs and they wonder why you can't get anything done. They will not let you take time off and when it comes time for a raise they terminate you so they don't have to give you a raise. Worst company I have ever worked for.
bad,Did not enjoy the constant change in scheduling and lack of job training. This job was a temporary assignment without  the possibility of permanent placing.
bad,as a tech you are told do something if not you cant work here . you have to go behind in-house tech and clean up there messy installs
bad,I spent my full work day assisting as many customers as I could as efficiently and as quickly as possible. We answered questions anywhere from technical to billing issues. Questions that were not understood I was able to communicate to a more seasoned representative to obtain the correct answer.
bad,This company rips off it's customers. I don't. They are always trying to get people to spend more money even when they cant afford what they already have. They do sneaky secret charges to their customers phone and internet bills and don't explain what the charges are for. I would never work for this company again.
bad,"There is not work/life balance."
bad,They money on this job is great cause we get paid by hourly and commission but they don't pay us for overtime and sometimes when we get so busy we don't have someone to give us a break and they deduct so much money on our commission without telling us.
bad,This company cares about the C-Level employees only.  Will overwork store managers dues to them being on salary.
bad,"NO FLEXIBILITY WITH SCHEDULES. No compensation for taking on other departments jobs. horrible 3:15 to midnight shift, I have an 8 month old son which I informed them of in training because I needed a morning shift but somehow everyone who doesn't have any responsibilities get the morning shift."
bad,"This is a great place to gain experinece, learning customer service skills and to be trained on making sales and also management skills. It is slow to move up here and there is no flexibility for continued education. Everything that is promised to you is not necessarily yours. Get in and get out!"
bad,"typical day- Installation"
bad,Good job but required long days.  Learned a lot about wiring and worked with good people.
bad,"A typical day involved a 30 minute meeting starting at 8:00 and the requirement to leave the garage by 8:15, already impossible demand to meet. First job for the day would be an install, where the sales rep promised the customer that they would not have to be home for their 8 TV, 2 VoIP Line, and Internet installation, so once explaining to the customer that it is necessary to have access inside, they are already angry with you and the company. "
bad,"Would not recommend as place of employment. Good company on paper, traditional mindset."
bad,"I made a few friends. I learned alot. However the leaders constantly up-sell the job and make promises they can't keep. They constantly threatened to fire you, or as they call it ""motivation"". Witness them hire people just to fire them to motivate their good sellers. My W-2 were horribly wrong. It was definitely a learning experience"
bad,i didnt learn much working here. everything was unorganized.
bad,"I worked as a cotractor from 2009-2010. I dealt with wireless customers calling about bills, payment arrangements, phones, etc."
bad,Does not take care of their employees. The company was better as bell south.
bad,"If you love getting overloaded with constant calls from people who love to assault you verbally, then take the job."
bad,Very metric oriented. Not a very good place to work. Feel more like a cog in a machine than an individual person. Expected to sell ridiculous products. That nobody wants.
bad,Absolutely not family friendly company whatsoever. This company uses processes and procedures that directly prevent you from achieving bonuses and required metrics.
bad,"Director was not aligned with the company standards"
bad,"The Management, is out to fire people and look for reason to fire you, and when you seek advice, you get the wrong answer, and this was from a union leader,  the (bleep) you have to deal with, is not worth the pay, you have to do things the right way, but the right way is long, so when you take a while cause of bad infrastructure, of the lines and on top of the heat and cold and you get mixed signals from so many managers, and in the end, you are thrown under the bus."
bad,Work conditions and expectations were unrealistic. Poor management structure and extremely inefficient processes and procedures. I would not refer anyone to this position or employer.
bad,I don't want to say anything else about this. I think that an outside source had a hand in my being let go. Which is so wrong on so many levels. Enough said.
bad,"Seniority rules"
bad,"Desde hace mucho dejo de ser una buena empresa para laborar, no existe estabilidad laboral, falta de apoyo de los directivos, en ocasiones no te pagan lo que corresponde e incluso te descuentan constantemente de tus comisiones, no hay apoyo por parte de ningún área cuando se requiere."
bad,"If the job is for AT&T itself, go for it.  If it's for DirecTv, it's not worth the stress. Low pay, expensive benefits, if you get hurt in any way, they'll do everything in their power to not pay for medical, and even if you're you're on short term disability, they'll make you go on cobra insurance after 90 days. Satellite is a dying career. Just don't"
bad,"Management didn't care about you. Making you work in blizzard's and temperatures below -30 degrees Fahrenheit. They didn't care about your personal life whatsoever, for family emergencies, etc."
bad,"I worked for this company for 12 years.  They managers you work with on a day to day basis are usually great, but all of the trickle down BS finally made me say enough is enough.  I had to leave for my own sanity, they use to care about their employees, but we became less and less important and were devalued more and more.  They just want to keep buying company after company and outsource everything"
bad,"There are some very nice employees there and a few nice managers."
bad,"Union Shop with mandatory membership, Management is at odds with the union almost all the time and during contract negotiation times it is much, much worse.  Even when not under negotiation the staff at AT&T feels like it is them against the managers and the Managers feel that they have to be overbearing and micro manage everything the employee does."
bad,"This was a company that was sub-contracted by the AT&T mother company/umbrella. The company had very poor management and even more poor work place morale, culture or values. They stole time from employees and often employees were working off the clock. I did learn how to ""work"" in a hostile environment. That was a plus, I suppose. Other than that, the job provided me with a small paycheck that still kept me still constantly needing but yet somehow thankful to have had the position during the time."
bad,"After training, you are required to work weekends. Your typical day off is during the week; Tuesday, Wednesday. New recruits typically will work closing shifts: 12pm-930pm. The sales commissions are so low,a top sales rep will earn around 1600-2000 in commission a month. That will be taxed at 39% leaving you with a joke of a commission. "
bad,"Unorganized and inconsistent management. I get that call centers are fast paced and ever changing, but the policies change depending on who you are talking to. One person can lose their job for something that someone else just gets a verbal warning for. The favoritism is blatant. Benefits, medical coverage, and time off are foreign concepts to this company. It's like they took the legally bare minimum requirements and made them as painful as possible to obtain or understand."
bad,"Why is this required? I will make this sentence exactly 150 characters minimum as a typical work day, i have left. what did i learn coorape business in cellphones are just lies"
bad,First year was great then after that the targets became too hard to hit to get any type of good payout. Your job can be easily outsourced are required to move to stay Within company
bad,do not recommend. they do not care about their employees.  they pay you less and less each year and you have no job security. 50% off on their. ..........................................
bad,"Toxic environment to an extreme. I was fired for crying and having to leave the front desk when a customer came in out of nowhere, threw his cell phone at my face, spit on me, screamed at me, and all while I had been helping another customer. My manager yelled at me for being upset despite ending up with a bruise. It was not at all a healthy or supportive job."
bad,Management was just worried about sales. Didn't care about the customer not employee. Always writing customer service reps up due to the lack of compassion or if you didn't offer 3 or more products to make a customer bu.
bad,Culture is being reworked and is midstream.  Continued opportunities for communication from the top down in order to realize Senior Leadership's vision.
bad,Nothing special to say. I was glad to leave the place because it way the buddy system. Certain people would get more work and had to drive less distance.
bad,"When I first started working at AT&T I enjoyed the company, my co-workers, and walking as much as I did. After the first couple of weeks the manager started to show his true colors towards me. He was ignorant, rude,  and short-tempered. I didn't even want to ask him questions because of how rude he was. Once your out of the office, he spends most of it time in his car and simply follows you around making sure your making money for him while he does nothing."
bad,"For how slow the nampa stores are, the company will still give you an unrealistic goal for the month that will never get reached. The managers who are comfortable there don't like anyone trying to move up in the store and will terminate them if felt threatened. It's a corrupted company that will play favorites as the Linked Cricket Nation have there own inner circle of people in the canyon county. Wouldn't recommend for anyone to work for cricket around Nampa. They will rob you of your hours/pay and anything good you do for the customers, they will kick you down for it if it's not part of there policy like mentioning phone accessories at other stores like walmart etc. Job only pays you $9 hourly, they should offer more than what they give."
bad,the company is a great company to work for but unfortunately what changes that is the cut throat area managers and the favoritism they play. They dont help when helped is being asked for and they tarnish you if you have a bad month
bad,"My last manager was counting days to retirement and was used to fire people. He fired over 20 people in 3 years, I left when he was assigned to our area but I wont forget watching him ruin the lives of good reps due to apathy."
bad,"The reason I say it's good and bad is because, you get paid good. The bad is it's so stressful because your boss is telling you need to make phone call shorter but when you handle a customer that needs patience you can't rush them and you can't hang up on them."
bad,"a very hard physical job in the elements with enormous pressure from management to produce numbers "
bad,"A monthly quota drives the company. There is a script you follow, which does not allow for much freedom. Calls are closely monitored to be sure all points in script are addressed."
bad,The drama was was a daily issue. When its drama around you its explainable.  Team leader and their drama was a pain to deal with on a daily.  The job was more stressful than having teenagers.
bad,"They don’t work with your schedule "
bad,"All management cares about is sales.  You can slack off or even steal time as long as you sale. Training is poor. 2 weeks of orientation is all about selling strategy and nothing in terms of problem solving or how to navigate the companies website for answers.."
bad,Not happy at all how they are handling the merger with time warner we are not being let go unfairly. Not everyone can afford to be without a job right now. It’s kind of stressful and trickling down level by level.
bad,"It's all about more greed at the top, There's no appreciation for employees. Jobs are being moved across seas and layoffs are continuous even during a surplus."
bad,"There never seemed to be to much time between the threat of force reduction.  News would be how great the department was doing, and in the same breath, there was going to be more reductions, and an increase the numbers and results overall expectations.  Very clique-ish.  More of who liked you than how effective and knowledgeable you are.  Few chances to move up,  The best part of the jog were the people.  I had the best time working with those who really made an impact."
bad,Very stressful can change your job responsibilities without a moments notice. Very unorganized with management ussualy not aware of whats going on. Changes your schedule often with only needing to give you 8 hours notice.
bad,"Working for AT&T, I did learn about customer service. However, working only for the commission is not a great idea when you have bills. Maybe if there was a base pay plus commission then the job would be more motivating. Also, the managers take a huge percentage of your sale when you first start which leaves you with little to no check."
bad,"Shifts starts at 8am, Should be dispatched and off the company lot by 8:15am. Once you arrive at customer's premise, explaian what work you will need to preform in order to install or repair their service. Do this all day in the rain, snow, or sunshine. 10/10 would not recommend."
bad,"Here you are a number, not a person. Typical corporate America nonsense. Do more with less, shut up and color and drink the kool-aid or face the consequences. Probably no different than any other telecommunications giant, I'm sure they are all the same."
bad,"You are not treated as a person, just a number. Your co-workers are the only thing I liked about working there. There is no potential for advancement, pay raises are based on time in company not performance."
bad,Att is constantly adding work to technicians without comparable pay raises. The company is constantly looking for a way to get rid of employees and move to contracting jobs. Everything ATT does is to the employees and not for the employees.
bad,"The Fayetteville, North Carolina call center is easily accessible in area and on a bus line.  Center hours are M-S 8am-10pm.  Shifts change every 6 months and you have to bid on them depending on seniority.   You do get commission for sales of television and internet services."
bad,I ve worked here for several months. the pay is low. it is a mandarin company so there is a huge language barrier. you will have to teach your self how to do the job as well. Accountants have 60 hr work week during tax season
bad,"Huge company with very little ability to advance unless you know someone.  Stressful and long hours with constant quarterly layoffs across company. "
bad,"Call center work is brutal, you sit at your phone all day, customers call and are mad and curse and try to get free stuff from you. AT&T says they give bonuses but if you do too well on their bonus metrics they add and change the metrics."
bad,"The management is lacking to say the least. The managers deflect responsibility any time they get the chance, making this place a huge bait and switch. The job itself isn't very hard, but I couldn't work there any longer knowing that I was lining the pockets of my superiors."
bad,"If you enjoy being misled by upper management about advancements, if you enjoy having your sales goals change every month with no explanation, or if you enjoy forcing to sell people services they don’t want then you’ll love this company."
bad,It is not how it was.  It is not a stable work place as there are frequent layoffs.  This layoffs are due to cost containment. I have been at this company for over 25 years and this is the worst layoff that I have witnessed.
bad,"Es un ambiente en extremo viciado, no tiene nada de diferente a cualquier otro call center del DF, y la prueba está en los reclutamientos masivos que están haciendo para parque toreo en estas fechas. La información que se me dió de mis horarios y de la descripción del trabajo fue poco clara desde el principio."
bad,"as an employee for 8+ years i've seen most of it. throughout the year every contract there has always been an increase in medical. i love the job and the interaction with the customers but when you're micro managed it just make your  job much more less meaningful. the company has taught me alot about the industry and i am thankful, just wish they would care more for their employees then worrying about profit. i thought this was it for me and i would be able to finish my career here but the way i see things going now, i feel that my time here and every other tech that hold this prem tech position our time will be cut short."
bad,"There's not really much to say, the company has an active initiative to close 60% of company owned retail stores in favor of authorized retailers and moving call centers overseas by the end of 2020. The benefits package is phenomenal, but you won't have a job in two years. The company is actively breaking fair-bargaining laws (retail and call center employees are unioned) because the fines are less expensive than the cost of keeping corporate-owned stores open."
bad,"For this part of the experience that I had with my job, I would say that the workplace had a semi toxic environment and the management that they had was never effective. They tend to offer incentives that they never really give out in the end and there is no regularization, it is only job offer or contract based. The company does not display pro agent attitude & the managers usually do power tripping over subordinates."
bad,"boring place to work, sold phones and homes services, they push home services more than phones and markets are 100 percent saturated already. sell cars"
bad,The company itself is an okay place. It is those people they promote into management positions who lack the skills to be managers. If you are one to turn the cheek and be treated with no respect or dignity by all means this is the company.
bad,no work life balance! the company makes billions off sales reps back but yet they cut our pay 50% Management places favoritism and a large amount of discrimination
bad,"My manager was the only reason I stayed as long as I did."
bad,"The upper management uses fear and intimidation to ""motivate"" people. You will give all you have as hard as you can and it is NEVER enough. You could meet 9/10 metrics and still get written up for the one you missed. It is ridiculous. I've never felt so small and insignificant at any other company I've ever worked for."
bad,"This is a union shop represented by Communication Workers of America (CWA).   Continuous calls from DSL Broadband  Internet customers.  This job is repetitive.  Troubleshooting internet services connectivity by multi-tasking is a must as this job requires the agent to handle many tools, have great listening skills and have excellent soft skills to be able to resolve customer issues. This job is a call center environment with ever changing schedules.  You have to be willing and able to work days, nights, weekends and holidays.  The hardest part of the job is the repetitiveness and the fluctuating work hours.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with and the satisfaction you get from being able to resolve the customers' issue(s)"
bad,"Pesima organizacion, tuve que renunciar porque me ofrecieron un puesto que nunca llego, hay muy buenas prestaciones, pero siento que hay gente consentida y no la quieren mover, al ser vendedor hize el reto de movernos y ver quienes eran los mejores, no lo aceptaron."
bad,small group of employees that worked great together. but leadership was horrible. she did not have managerial nor social skills at all
bad,"Have unrealistic exceptions of matrix to be meet for the job. And no set ending time for each day. The job is 8:00am until whenever all jobs are complete. could be 7,8,10,11,pm you never know."
bad,"The sales rep job is a well paying position but stressful. Managers were pushed to write people up since this was the only way to be able to fire someone with the union being involved. With this, they are always hovering trying/making up things you didn't do or offer."
bad,"a typlcal day at work : 10am-12am in a poorly lit room with no windows."
bad,"Expect to work at least 55 hours a week and the management does not care if you have family members dying and/or in the hospital. You are expected to work until you are no longer useful to the company. Set up to fail. Not given the tools you needed to do the job. Management knows this, but still expects you to do the work unsafely, but they will sure write you up and fire you if your caught doing what they want you to do."
bad,There was nothing fun about this job you were told tosit at yourdesk all day long and demand money from people no matter what happened you wereto always ask for at least some money
bad,Not so good management and the culture is not great in promoting and company standards are constantly changing. new director does not care about anything but meeting sales.
bad,Mucha desorganización y falta de comunicación. No funciona el apoyo de jefe inmediato.
bad,"They hold responsible for all while micro managing you 24/7, if you are meeting your goals you will still get punished and well attend to many of thier  boot camps, ""Green is not Green"""
bad,"I have been employed with AT&T for 6+ years. AT&T is a great company in the telecommunications industry. If you hold an advanced degree in IT or a related field this company would be an excellent choice. If you do not hold an advanced degree or certification, you will be unfortunately lost in the shuffle. This company definitely forgets about the little people that keep it going. As changed in technology happen changes in the company happen along with it. In an entry level position you are expected to exceed targets with little to no pay increase and you are always at risk for a lay-off. The hardest part of the job is not knowing if you will still have one."
bad,"There are many meetings that are unproductive, the results contain no action items or follow ups.  Many coworkers seem overworked there is little time in their day to help, or go beyond their own job description."
bad,"The position of employment I had at this company was a great stepping stone, gave me the skills and expertise to advance and move into the position and company I worked for after; helped hone my skills in effective verbal communication with customers. With confident to utilize resources and tools to efficiently provide expert help, to whomever I came in contact with."
bad,A stressful fast paced sales culture. The company only promotes and recognizes sellers that succeed by any means necessary. If you want to work for a company that beats you down daily and you want to feel like you are never good enough then at&t is the place for you.
bad,Below average pay for above averge work. At will employment. You can get in trouble and no one will correct your action just straight to a consequence. Managment dosent know anything about Directv. just a bunch of guys with the title manager.
bad,The only thing that I can provide as a review for this company is that I learned how to multi task and work on my time management skills for my personal life.
bad,"Typical day was 8 hours, somewhat dated corporate culture of requiring people to come into the office every day and management take account. Working remote is set up, but culture dictates you can't use it unless traveling.  "
bad,"work in a boost,with no supervision,goals to high ,discrimination low salari,no expetatives to management position,the manager area dont have the apropiate knowlledge about his job or employement laws"
bad,"The worse employer I've ever experienced. Astounding the antiquated practices they get away with towards employees. Walking very thin EEOC lines. Was top in nation and was released due to doctor advice of 2 days rest after HBP attack at work. Wanted to rate 1 overall, but for some reason would not allow lower than a 2. Same with management. Salary poor."
bad,"The customers are angry when they call in, as you are collecting on them. You consistently get screamed at, cursed at, and hung up on. "
bad,Your manager is constantly worried about your production and will harass you to either get results or make you fearful of losing your job.
bad,come in 10-15 minutes before shift starts turn on my computer have all tools needed in order to start working. I learn troubleshooting process on how to connect switches routers and help customer fix their issues
bad,"This organization is not a family friendly organization to work with."
bad,It was a pretty stressful job. You never knew if you were going to get paid your bonus incentive. The customer service reps that I was working with had no idea what they were doing. I lost faith in the company towards the end... There was no reason to stay because I never got paid for what I sold. Managers were getting fired left and right. STREAM was eventually bought out by CONVERGY'S I loved my co-workers becasuse they were the ones who helped me get through it. The most enjoyable part of the day was going home.
bad,A typical day would be talking on the phone with consumers regarding porting (switching) their cell phone numbers to At & T from other cell phone carriers. I learned my job description  as indicated on resume. Management was sometimes easy to talk to. Co-workers were great in helping with questions. Hardest part of job was having to complete working with a client in a matter of a few minutes as every situation on the phone with changing and activating a phone required longer assistance. Enjoyable part about job is my co-workers.
bad,Only thing they care about is you talking on the phone and cold calling. There is no consideration for your personal life and personal needs. WORST JOB I'VE EVER HAD. High stress. High turn over.
bad,"My typical day at work"
bad,"I originally signed up to be an AT&T rep who worked going door to door in a residential area and tell them about the availability of AT&T in their area.  I also discuss the advantages of AT&T Uverse and had contracts for the customer to sign up.   After training and working on my own for 3 weeks, i made no money.  I was then working remotely as a recruiter.   The hardest part of the job was to get the customers to sign up.  I did not really enjoy the hours as I could only do the job from 12 to 4 but the job required you to work to 8PM.   My family lifestyle did not accomondate as i had a baby at home"
bad,Piece work installation of residential TV services.  Earnings driven by ability to very quickly install services - not always to advantage of the property owner
bad,I do not have a current review for this company. Perhaps better managment at that time along with more hours.
bad,"horrible work life balance."
bad,The co-workers are great but the manager and upper management  is horrible
bad,I will never recommend anyone work for this company. I was given a pay reduction when the management changed. The pay structure of the job changed from hourly to commission based without any warning. The management cares nothing for their employees.
bad,"I worked as a sub contractor for the company, Directv is fine just not the company i was subed with, worked 80 hours a week, had to buy my own tools and wire, use my own vehicle, supply my own gas, and do my own taxes."
bad,DirecTV (vxi) was a good company to work for. There were no benefits so it made it hard to stay with company long term. It was a very helpful job none the less and I am thankful for the time I was there.  
bad,"*busy"
bad,"Bascially my calls were customer wanting directv already but the down side for the customers not for me. Was the credict check which i loved, if they dont pass the credit check the call is over. bUT IOF THEY DO PROCESS THE ORDER  based on what package they pick. The management wasnt too professional but is a company contracted through directv so i took the cook with the bad. It was ok pay for me and my family the coworkers were nice and fun it passed time the work was easy. The hardest part was explaining to a customer they didnt pass the credit check and them cursing you out and not wanting to get off the phone requesting a supervisor because they felt their score is high."
bad,"when i started this job there were all kinds of promises made to us. After working there for a while I encountered other employees and the moral of that place is absolutely horrible. Not to mention that their attendance policy is outrageous. You CANNOT miss a day within the first six months for ANY reason. So if your child gets sick or you're in the hospital, you might as well prepare yourself to get written up upon your return regardless of all the documentation you provide"
bad,"llamaba a un monton de casas de familia ofreciendo el servicio algunos me trataban mui amablemente y otros eran mui descortes aveces me venia ami casa con mucho estres, teniamos un tiempo de descanso qe entre todos charlabamos tomabamos cafe y era mui comodo el ambiente aprendi hablarle ala gente de manera que quieran contratar el servicio. mis jefes eran mui buenas y mis compañeros igual no le vi parte dificil al trabajo la unica parte mala era qe si no hacias ventas no cobrabas por eso me retire del trabajo."
bad,well iam uptodate with the new technology of directv with is really
bad,At&t does not value their empolyees or their customers.
bad,"A typical day at AT&T consisted of a rigid telephone availability schedule with highly monitored breaks and a micro-management style of monitoring performance. Scheduling was based on seniority, therefore I, being the newest rep was scheduled to work 3 non-consecutive week days and every weekend from 2-10 pm. Immediate supervisors and even upper-management were indifferent to any kind of professionalism; mostly obvious with the inappropriate and indecent dress-code combined with a very limited and coarse vocabulary. These deficiencies filtered down to employees therefore making it the most unprofessional atmosphere I’ve ever seen. Sales reps were crammed in next to each other making it almost impossible not to shout over one another to clearly communicate with the customer who was more than likely calling from a cell phone. What I enjoyed most about that job was listening to other reps and learning how not to treat a customer and what not to say in order to close a sale."
bad,not much of a review here. Managers would never work with you to get time off. Forms filled out to order tools or equipment get ignored.
bad,"Surprisingly, this was not the best place to try and make a career even though they are one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world. The management team (and supporting cast) were only there to make a buck and look out for themselves. No one ever took the time to pay attention when a worker reported that a ""customer"" (and that term is used loosely for some individuals who called in) was being abusive over the phone. Regularly when a customer asks for supervisor, you would literally have to run up and down the floor to find one to take the call. A typical day included mandatory overtime, uptight co-workers, management that did just enough to keep themselves off the radar of the higher-ups."
bad,Culture and Values are non-existant - Work/life balance... None what so ever. Management.... needs an overhaul.
bad,"Not a good job unless your income is just fun money. Get paid by the job. Can start out thinking you have four jobs in one day, and end of with one if you are lucky. Supervisors only care about the fact they have their pay check even if you don't get yours."
bad,llegas al call center...!! entro a las 9 y 30 asi que desayunamos o tomamos mates con mis compañeros mientras comenzamos a hacer llamadas...!! la supervisora controla que llamemos.. pero la verdad no siempre podes vender.. y es un trabajo en el cual si no vendes no cobras muy bien..!! entonces lo complicado seria convencer a la gente para que compre..!!
bad,"Answer phone, sale product, place orders, customer service"
bad,I found that the benifits for health are very costly through the years working there. But it is a good company to work for in my overall experience working with them on projects.
bad,Good work but the managers are idiots and most have no experience. They have no tolerance for a lot of things. The union is paid off. It's definitely not the AT&T of old.
bad,I enjoyed the work i did as a technician.  The other techs I worked with were great.  Management here is the problem.  They push solely on numbers that are out of our control.  The management role I am in now is horrible.  This channel was made to help customers but in reality they get us to feed customers a good pitch to sell mobile service and never go through with what they tell us to get the customer to switch.  AT&T is taking advantage of customers in their own home.
bad,Layoffs occur quarterly.  There is no job security and some managers don’t care about you as an individual.  Customer happiness is not a priority.  Corporate pushing everyone to live in Dallas.
bad,"Se trata de llegar a una meta inalcanzable, sino llegas como casi siempre la opcion es comprar los chips tu mismo para no quedar mal con los jefes que solo presionan por que a como de lugar llegues,  si no llegas eres malo, te hacen sentir que es tu culpa, es llegar a la cuota invirtiendo tu mismo en chips"
bad,"Surplused with no concessions. No insurance, no discounts. I was made to feel as if I were a failure all the time. My supervisor was belittling, I went 4 years without one penny of a raise.  You’re either a hero or a zero. I was totally screwed by ATT."
bad,Managers have no respect for workers. Even though there is a union they don't represent the workers and management doesn't respect the Union. They hook you with the pay but there is no work/life balance and the company doesn't care
bad,"No life, never know what is going on from leadership.  Management is very secretive.  Family life means nothing........................................"
bad,"No work life balance, management micro manages to the tee. Constantly looking over your shoulder. Only metrics matter. Customer doesn't even matter amymore."
bad,"You are barely trained to do the job,then once you are teady go to the field,you get your assignments from corporate/Direct TV put on your phone every morning at between 540am-600am,and you see all your jobs drop off.Your manager takes those jobs jobs,and gives them to the veterans of Direct TV"
bad,"MANAGEMENT at ATT is horrible, on both sides, direct TV and u-verse.The pay.... I went 3 years of working there and never got the pay I was promised in the interview. Lets just say I work for $10 less than I was promised. Oh yeah it's a union job by the way.... yeah right. Glade I found a job that promotes growth, has job security, and pays a lot better. Oh well, I will never work here AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,"I worked there for 5 years. It was one of the worst experiences of my life. The pay and benefits are good for my area, but there is nothing beyond that. Management was consistently lacking, often corrupt, and rarely available. They had disparate work treatment. There is no room for advancement.  Beyond the obvious stress of dealing with hostile customers, you also have to deal with a hostile work environment. Lastly, there is zero work/ life balance."
bad,"You'll meet some brilliant people, and this is the single most enjoyable part of working for a giant company. But expect that brilliance to be muted by a leadership team obsessed with implementing methods and procedures that were last relevant in 1989. You will be frustrated, and the hardest part of your job will be returning to that frustration day in and day out."
bad,"The management at the time of my work experience, was lacking in tack, respect and experience to know how to be the manage projects and people. The new management is more experience and have respect for the employees doing the projects."
bad,there was no managers around and being honest definitely doesn't pay there. no one is your friend and you cannot trust anyone there. the company doesn't care about their employees.
bad,The district manager is extremely two faced. Will say you are doing great to your face and truly talk badly about you. Has proactivly removef all white employees from his stores and promoted all his friends. Lies to customer as well. Only cares ab9ut him self.
bad,"this place is not the best place to work, no work life balance, no advancement, power and ego trippy managers , they have no respect for human life.  guess it all depends on the management"
bad,"Management sucks, there’s bed bugs in the facility, there is no consistency within the location daily expectations, and they only care about body counts not their people."
bad,"This job is mostly a work at your own pace ""faster you go the more you make"". Loved seeing new people and new places daily. Recommend being a people person for this job."
bad,"It does not matter how hard you work or any favors you do, management will always be your biggest nemesis. They pass the problems instead of solving them."
bad,Train your management team. Care about your employees! What id discussed between mgmt & employee should not be discussed with their friends & associates. Your metrics for QA are ridiculous. Were their to service the people not to win a J.D. award!!!
bad,"I feel like I am not fully appreciated there, I am only selling to save my job, you are literally thrown in and expected to know the work, I can't afford to keep this job if there is not enough foot traffic to rely on commission checks, it is all about the numbers, and the unethical application of direct tv now without the full approval of the customers."
bad,"A typical day in the in home channel will have you driving to the inner city where you will encounter  dogs, bug infested homes, rats or mice and all kinds of disgusting environments in which you are expected to sit down in and get to know your customer well enough to sale a cellular phone tv or internet service. Keep in mind that because AT&T’s credit policy all but eliminates certain customers, it’s not as easy as it appears. At some point during your day your numbers possessed manager"
bad,"This employer should reevaluate rules and regulations currently in place, managers should not date coworkers, advancement shouldn't be based on who you know but by your work performance. Equality should be addressed as well."
bad,when working at att you become just another number to a company far too big to think about individual employees only saving grace is the union. there is no way to move up from the bottom.
bad,This management will target you if you have a voice. Keep your head down and be happy with the poor treatment. Policy changes only happen to get back at employees. Honorable men get skipped for advancement while the buddy system prevails. THE UNION WILL NOT PROTECT YOU.  PICK A DIFFERENT DEPARTMENT. The turn over rate is 63%. Why do you think they always hiring?
bad,"Manager was not a very good one. Cared more about making his bonus than really caring about the people he managed. Instead of pointing out a mistake, he would write you up rather than coach you. This whole last year was a joke and a nightmare. Never knowing if it was going to be your last day there all because I missed something at a customers house. To meet your numbers you really had to care less about the customer just to hurry up and get to the next one. I believe that AT&T has lost their true vision. I am really glad that I am no longer there. All the guys I worked with where always complaining how bad the work conditions are. I know that if a manager is going to get rid of you just because you really care about the service to the customer, and looks for anything to say I got him hes gone, and hes done the exact same thing. He just did not get caught. Life at At&t sucks. Paid good, but its not worth it. I put in four years. No more."
bad,"They track every move you make and there are endless articles to read for promotions and compliance."
bad,There was not any work life balance and upper management constantly harasses you about your sales quota even when you are a top performer. Would not recommend working in the retail sector.
bad,AT&T though very busy is a terrible place to work. The management is terrible almost everyone is a contractor with no chance to become permanent. The people that work there that are contractors mostly are unprofessional and don't take anything seriously there is too much drama with not enough management to break that up and actually managed.
bad,"I started work for DirecTV then AT&T bought them and the wheels came off the wagon.  Cut backs, layoffs, salary reduction.  The months following ATT takeover were months of uncertainty."
bad,"They are for themselves, don't care about employees just there bottom line. Management discriminates and no one cares even if your sick. They chew you up and spit you out"
bad,"Management was terrible, work was overwhelming, it was mandatory to travel to various stores in the area for managers, annoying daily conference calls, no mileage compensation for travel, no allowed or paid time off, mandatory working holidays, etc."
bad,"I had a grandmother on hospice dying from cancer and knew she wouldn't make it another day so I came in, worked until the department head had a minute, told him the situation, and he told me to get back on the phones while my team lead urged me to go be with my grandmother."
bad,"Horrible leadership, very dependent on who you're friends with in upper management if you get promoted or not. Terrible commission pay, although it used to be good."
bad,They sucked bad don’t waste your time they are terrible and don’t care about you and only the company and pay raises are really a thing so just don’t apply
bad,"The work in the Austin area can be rough, especially in the summer. Running aerial drops to customers homes and businesses and installing inside wiring for internet, TV, and phone. Expect to be climbing up poles and into attics or crawlspaces, running fiber drops through trees, bamboo, and creeks, and drilling into people's  houses. Customers range from absolute angels to entitled heck spawn. In Austin you will  be installing fiber and copper lines, and DirectTV. You will never know what time you are going to be home each day, and in the summer they have been requiring forced 6 day work weeks. OT is paid per week not per day, but Sundays are 1.5x pay. Austin starts at 18/hr and caps at 24.75. You will be driving a lot so better pack a cold lunch or get fat on fast food."
bad,"AT&T is a company completely focused on promoting a dated form of entertainment in Directv. Management doesn't care about anything other than your results, if you need guidance, good luck because half the time you are going to know more than your management team. be ready to be coached for everything, even when you pitch directv and do all of the things that they ask of you, it wont be enough if you don't get the sale. it could be a customer who lives in an apartment and cannot get a satellite they will say you should have sold It anyway. "
bad,"I'll keep it short and sweet. A job at AT&T isn't for everyone, I worked there for 10 years, in both representative and management roles. That being said, you'll dread every day knowing you have to go there, you'll hate every day you're there and you'll dread knowing you'll go to sleep, wake up and do it all over again. It's a vicious cycle filled with hate, dread, depression, sadness, backstabbing, two-faced liars, people walking over dead bodies to get ahead and oh yeah The Union! Prepare to work with and have The Union protect the laziest SOB's on the planet. Again, I did it for 10 years, do yourself a favor and learn from my mistake."
bad,"The work here is fast paced. ATT promotes and encourages its personnel to keep up with the latest technologies "
bad,Constant fear of layoffs based on popularity vs performance. Cliques that take care of their own which usually are lowest performers.  High performers are looked badly upon and slated for surplus.
bad,"AT&T used to be a great company to work for before merging with SBC, now all they care about is the bottom line. They've cut benefits to worthless. Pay raises are rare. Still a good ole boy company. The only thing I miss is the long vacation you can get."
bad,"If you want a job that pays like poorly, has no opportunity for advancement, and treats you as disposable, then AT&T is right for you!"
bad,"I do not recommend working for them at this time. The pay used to be amazing when I started in 2007, but the sales goals have increased and the compensation has decreased. You def want to have a Union backed position here. They can/will surplus you at anytime. It's an easy job, but nothing is ever good enough."
bad,"If you are considering working here, please do yourself a favor and research the success of your individual area of the business.  There are positions that won't have a very long shelf-life when sales fall through the floor."
bad,"not a family friendly they will work you to death and don't  care about your personal life . they always say its the needs of the business, you cant even take unpaid time off unless its fmla approved"
bad,I worked at this company and suffered being sick due to their strict rules of taking sick time off and still being written up for taking off. This company pays well at times but disregards the fact that people have children and lives. God forbid if you have to take time off for an appointment you have to use your vacation time and when its gone and you fall sick if you call off you have a very good chance of being fired.
bad,"Required to hit metrics that generally are set too high to obtain consistently, unless you know how to cheat the system. Very stressful, micro managed to the letter."
bad,"If being perpetually stressed out, overworked, underpaid and over all walking into work with a feeling of dread the by all means apply. Working here cost me my education due to the lack of flexibility for people attempting to obtain one. Pay starting out is the same as someone who has been there for a few years. No advancement opportunities available."
bad,"Don't do it. They will suck your soul dry. Seriously, it is not a good place to work. There are many better companies out there. Keep looking and find something better."
bad,"There were a lot of item that came to mind for this. AT&T was a company where there was no help. If you got a late install they would not send anyone to help you to get you out of there. you were by yourself f thqt meant it was 2 am that was fine."
bad,"I worked in a call center and it was the worse job I have ever had in my life. The management were rude and only concerned about call volume numbers. There was no room for advancement unless you ""knew"" somebody."
bad,"No comment on working for a company that went bankrupt and no longer exists. The current ""AT&T Inc."" is NOT the company I worked for and I have no knoweldge of them."
bad,I enjoyed the pay but that was it. I was over worked under paid and under appropriated. I had no drivers license they know that and had fail to inform me that i would have to go to go out to trout dale to do training which was over and hour bus ride then go back to work after the trainings.
bad,"I'd arrive and we'd listen to our manager go over a speech pertaining to our work day or just AT&T news in general. Most of the time about Quality D/E and Efficiency. Afterwords we'd go get our equipment and supplies (which there were hardly ever enough of so you had to borrow other people's DVR's, Routers, cables etc.) "
bad,Not much to say.  This company is ALL talk and meetings.  Not too much action and management does not know what they are really looking for. The turn over rate was weekly and most of the staff feared job loss.
bad,"too too many rules and restrictions.  Everyone wants to a manager, so it's very cut throat..  the people that are trying to be managers are the worst employees"
bad,No much stress on meeting the number system. Set unreachable goals for bonuses. Manager in this area are not fair and consistent with everyone. Not recommended
bad,"stressful sales process with poor commission, payouts are not explained properly, most people call for billing concerns but we are forced to sell them Att products"
bad,Not good environment for building skills.  Call center that is not professional and inconsistent with processes.  Systems are always failing and customer base is unhappy with service.
bad,"If ever you wanted to work for an ill aging company having lost its humanity, purpose of honor and respect for its employees and customers in favor of corrupt mogul profits, then this is the place to be."
bad,"Terrible company to work for. Management is not only disorganized, incompetent, and understaffed, but there is a complete lack of understanding that going by the numbers on everything does not apply real world factors in every mathematical equation. AT&T is going in the direction of Amazon with statistics and efficiency, they will in the future be one of the companies that sends out an automated email firing employees on Christmas like Amazon because of low production."
bad,"They are constantly laying managers off and then will find ways to fire people to compensate for the lack of managers. There is little to no advancement opportunities here. The building smells like sewage half of the time too. The pay is good though, but not worth the stress and headache."
bad,"Your job depended on reviews done related to customer surveys, where if you fixed their internet and they did not rate you a 100 you failed, everything, you were told nearly everyday that if you did not bring your numbers up that you would lose your job.  Great way to run a company"
bad,"AT&T management is horrible. Workload varies but is normally high and very long hours. You'll be working 10 - 12 hours daily, sometimes six days a week"
bad,As with any sales job management puts unrealistic goals on their employees.  Constantly badgering a customer to buy buy buy is not a good business model.
bad,"was temporary work, met lots of interesting people.  Was more of a fundraising program for education purposes.  Was fun to work there.  Learned allot about concessions and management"
bad,"training was fun, once you get to the floor. sales are required even though when you are hired you are told your job does not include sales. if you do not get so many sales per month you get 1 warning, then you face termination. it no longer becomes fun when you get to the floor. its stressful. at the end of training you receive your new schedule. it is based of the last 6th number in your SS# so if the number is low you get a awesome Monday thru Thursday 6am-6pm shift, but if it is high you get stuck with weekends and 12pm to midnight or later, and there is not option of switching. you are stuck with your shift for at least 6 months but more likely a year before you can get a different one."
bad,There isn't really a typical day at At&t because the days vary so much according to work load. At At&t I have learned to adapt to an ever changing work environment. I am on my second manager at At&t. The first manager was very poor and was fired for falsifying company documents. My current manager is a slave driver and cares more about making numbers than he cares about the well being of the technicians that work under him. The hardest part of my job is working in extreme weather conditions and tight spaces. The most enjoyable part of my day is before the work day starts and  being amongst fellow technicians.
bad,"I worked six to seven months with AT&T and never received my compensation for commission, it was generally a bad experience. Didn't feel comfortable with the sell-tactics"
bad,Try it if you must. They have high numbers for people who quit. That speaks loud enough. They switch my position did not let us know. They tell you it is not about sales...Liessss all they stress to you is sales sales sales for the Direct Tv. They lie so much it is crazy. They tell you one thing one minute on how to get paid for sales but add all these metrics so they don't have to pay you. I will never work for At&t again.
bad,"Retail is the worst role to enter into. Corporate is the way to go. Way easier to have a work/ life balance that way, unless you have some type of tenure."
bad,Not the best place to work during the summer months and training is none after you start working. dont expect anything out of management they dont care and all about the numbers. its a push and shove type of company and no matter what you do..you are not judge by dedication but by the good ole boy attitude. in the field is not a career...but a job.
bad,"Showed promise then org changes caused stress cracks that wound up destroying the team. The experience is VERY linked to whom you report to as a Dept Manager. Culture values vary from group to group where one can be casual and comfortable while the next with the same exposure is locked in at business attire."
bad,Usual corporate negitives. People are just numbers. Hi turnaround and burns. Profit above morals. Poor training. Poor leadership. Poor management. People doing less than minimus to collect a check.
bad,"I started as an Operator for Bellsouth and moved to an Outside Technician position which was ran by Managers who had experience in the lower ranks and were more apt to assist with advancement than harm an employee, Now the company has gone thru a change of management who are allowed to ruin careers with their own personal bias with no questions asked from higher ups who live and socialize with one another such a sad state of affairs at a company that once heralded a great working atmosphere and potential for retirement."
bad,Company is downsizing. Great team environment but little upward mobility. I would recommend this position to entry level candidates. Set realistic expectations and it will be an enjoyable place to work.
bad,"No career development plan for white males, or even disabled veterans.  They claim to be affirmative action but appears to only apply to every other protected class.  In order to advance to a GM it is easier to leave and comeback than to be promoted from within."
bad,"great co-workers, but training often cancelled to stay on phones and support products/services (that you werent trained on), little opportunity for advancement, pay is same as it was 15 years ago, no flexibility from upper management to go to school (shifts changed every 3 months) so you would have to choose between going to school or going to work if shift changed mid-semester."
bad,"AT&T technicians are top notch as they are extremely devoted to customer service.  As with any huge company, employees ""on the ground"" often find themselves with their hands tied due to corporate rules made by senior management in remote locations.  "
bad,"Loved the company AT&T but Louisville, KY leadership is less than stellar. Openly does not care about you as a person and will throw you under bus to protect their reputation. Beside the poor leadership the job was great."
bad,My position was cut due to the fact the company was not making enough money or booking enough work. the company spent more money they should have on new work vans and was not able to keep employment due to lack of funding
bad,"The call center is easily accessible to the Fayetteville, North Carolina area.  Mainly your job is sales and you do get commission on those sales quarterly."
bad,The company was not a good one at all. I hated working for them. The management was really bad there. I would not go back there even if I had to. Do not work for this company.
bad,"ATT is a very competive , dog eat dog company. The company has no intention of taking care of employees ,customers or providing good service."
bad,This job is a very intense and stressful job that will build character and will show you ways of how to gain a sales pitch and how to involve yourself in the business field in an entry level environment.
bad,"My experience with this company has not been positive. Unfair pay, management favoritism, unnecessarily stressful, lack of advancement opportunities and continuous surplus (layoffs). The company has great benefits (i.e. work from home privileges, paid vacations, pension, company match 401K, etc) but the day to day work - life balance is not there."
bad,"If you can handle hard work, rude management, no formal policies, low hourly, and no appreciation then this is the job for you!! But if not don't work for this company because they will hire for the job you applied for and when you get to training the job is nothing like the description!"
bad,retail sales consultants are now getting paid a lot less but having to do much more work. commission structures have changed and it is very difficult to meet your goal now.
bad,"I don't feel the workers or mangers were very friendly, work conditions were ok. Got along with others as long as you agreed with them. You were looked down on if your sales weren't high."
bad,AT&T used to be a good place to work however recently they have been cutting cost & staff.  There is no work life balance. They have no work culture left
bad,My day started fast and ended fast.  Working with clients to ensure they had the service they needed and were paying their bills on time.  This turned into several escalations that me and the management team had to work out.
bad,"It sucked because the managers were shady, they wanted you to work everyday all day only to make money for them and when you made money not all of it was given to you."
bad,"This company was very unethical at the end of almost 8 years of working there. It is very sad, to see a company that started out with strong ethics and really cared about their employees go down the drain."
bad,"AT&T sales positions are cut throat, no chance for success. Management promotes a culture of lying and cheating just to make sales quotas. The upper sales management have a don't ask, don't tell policy, as long as you make your monthly numbers. I was required to falsify sales just to make monthly numbers."
bad,poor management very stressful work environment because of management but loved the work. its a numbers game if you do poor but fast work your praised if you take the time to do things right not so much
bad,"Employees are just a number they do not care unless you make your sales, the sales are unattainable and not realistic. The management team micromanages ."
bad,"After helping my supervisor when he had become seriously ill, he turned on me and started harassing me. He apparently had a bad reputation already, as I found out later when several other supervisors asked me to file a complaint against him. Management in the Tech Support Department is very unskilled, and lacks any kind of EQ at all."
bad,"Recent compensation plans are more confusing than ever.  Company continuously tries to find ways to take money from sales reps.  If a better compensation plan existed, more people would stay."
bad,"This is the first job that I've been that make me question if I want to go in for work. There's no job security and your job is threatened on the daily!!! They don't care about their employees and they try to give an illusion that they do. They offered a IT program to it's employees, but aren't going to make the schedule accommodating to attend. It was the illusion they wanted to give like they encourage you to get back in school and we're going to help. BULL."
bad,Too many hours Too many phone calls after hours and expected to work 6 sometimes 7 days a week.  Absolutely no work life balance.  They expected you to do whatever it took no matter what personally you had planned.
bad,"Management is a joke. The place is full of people who will stab you in the back if it makes them look good. The atmosphere reminds you of high school, and they encourage that negativity. Those with health issues (physical, emotional, psychological) are treated like trash."
bad,There is no job security and AT&T keeps on laying off people. I have couple of my family members who had been with this company for over 20 years and got laid off.
bad,I love my line of work just seeking a company were quality outweighs quanity.. Initially under impression would retire from company but as CEO's changed as well plans did too.
bad,login answer calls lots of micromanagement all calls monitored nver hang up on customers get cussed out throughout the day  not a great people place hop u like making commission cuz if you you dont make any sales you wont make any money and also if you do not make a sale they will fire you so no job secuirty
bad,"This job seemed great when I was first hired, the people were kind and everyone seemed pretty excited to have me as a part of the team. As time passed, I realized the unrealistic expectations of the management as well as how hostile of an environment working for AT&T retail can really be. When initially hired, I expected to make at least $2500 per month. Instead my checks have decreased steadily as the months go by, yet I am still ranked in the top 40% sellers at my store. Last month, my 5th month working, I made $1100. With the constant stress of the environment, this is not worth it. Please think twice before applying to work here; the turnover rate is at 65% for a reason."
bad,"If this is your first job, then you landed in the right place. If you have any experience at all, seek work elsewhere.  The job is physically demanding half the time. The management structure is atrocious and the metrics system is even worse. There is no reward for quality of work. The technician role has been a dead end as far as career advancement for the last three years. If you  do not know someone in the company with a higher position, then you will be another sheep in the flock until you can no longer handle the working conditions.  AT&T is no longer in a golden era like it was a decade ago. Expect to go through work shortages and surplussing."
bad,"There were manager's (and area managers) leaving left and right. The left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing. From what I gather it may have been just my call center. But customers shouldn't know about plans before the customer service representatives do. Plus there were times when there was severe weather (aka snow storms) and we were caution to not get on the highway, and still were required to come to work for fear of losing our jobs. They didn't do that in other call center's; I know this because we would see notices of them being closed."
bad,"managers don't get promoted by work record or ethic but by ,first skin color and second by putting att above your ethics and compromising your character and dignity"
bad,"don't work there.ts not a good place to work at period. i would avoid it. bad management, poor ran company, scamming customers left and right, always having issues. they don't pay you on time for jobs you do, list goes on"
bad,"If you enjoy working in a loud, active call center environment, this job is for you.  To be successful, you must enjoy talking with people from all over the country, and helping them resolve their issues in a timely fashion."
bad,"I was often placed in the worst parts of town, with less than savory people. As a 20 something girl alone, I would be offered drugs and other disturbing things on a daily basis. My clients were constantly changed for no reason and I was not informed of important information in my new clients until many visits later. There were many times I wasn't informed of contagious diseases and other issues until after many times being in contact with the client without the proper precautions."
bad,"poor employee care and workplace hazards, dont want to write a review about this company cause everything i have to say is not nice or expected, i would not work for them unless i reallt had to and im trying to find better work"
bad,I worked for DirectV at Revana.  overall the revana company was not a great place to work.  The morale is low and the workers are treated poorly and that leads to poor customer service
bad,"Before joining AT&T, read about the AT&T Foundry.  This is the workplace model the company wishes to deploy widely.  There are pros and there are cons.  Seek out someone who can tell you first hand what it's like to work there.  Ask them about the physical work space and its condition, quality of interpersonal relationships within the team, and the standard level of demonstrated employee trust."
bad,"it's all about who you know not what you know. the supervisors do not treat you fairly. no matter how hard you work to make the product perfect, if you are not buddies with your supervisor, you don't get anywhere in the company."
bad,"Your day starts with gathering current information and planning store visits. I learned from my experiences a new set of skills. Marketing, Promoting and different ways to get within the community. The co-workers are like family. We piggy back off each other for support and tips. The hardest part of the job is having to address multiple doors with not enough time in the day. The most enjoyable part is the work family you develop."
bad,"I do not enjoy my job, even when your at the top your upper makes you fill that you are at the bottom, always working, you never get the days off that you would like"
bad,"The company experience was not as expected. This is a international company, yet employees do not feel appreciated; rather one feels disposable."
bad,"Long time employee, only seen the company get worse and worse. They have very little respect for their employees and are constantly making it harder and harder for you to hit quotas and berate you when you don't."
bad,great team members.  opportunity to move around the state.  Management gave a yearly review of company direction.  Company provided adequate training to complete our jobs.  Hardest part were the numerous changes
bad,"The Army used to be a solid career choice.  "
bad,"I do not agree with a lot of the back end operations that I see and participate in as a part of this company. I think most of it is shady, deceptive, and probably illegal in part, or in whole. For that reason alone, I feel I am not compensated enough. If I had the heart, tenacity, and finances to be a ""whistle blower"", I would be. In addition, I feel like this company requires a high level of skill for low level jobs and aren't fairly compensating it's workers. They focus more on the less immediately tangibles like bonuses, work environment, etc. as opposed to just paying us better, which is B.S."
bad,"AT&T is a good company. However, their workplace environment at the Call Centers are poor. They do not treat their employees as human beings or as anything less than a paid for piece of equipment that they own."
bad,"The company doesn't appreciate their employees anymore. They used to care and listen to us, but not anymore. No one is safe from losing their job, and they are trying to get rid of commission, so that means they are pushing harder, hoping people leave voluntarily."
bad,"They say they have work life balance but they don't! If you get sick at work and need to leave you will receive a point. You are only allowed 8 points in an entire year. They each point accumulated will roll off in 12 months. There are no exceptions, even if you are on your death bed. You are not granted FMLA until after you complete 12 months of employment. So if you have a disability, your out of luck! Every doctors appointment you have to leave during work will count as a point. They will not work with you. No extended lunches! Management will blow smoke up your butt to get you to accept their offer letter. There is no job security! Management is horrible! But on a positive note, coworkers are great. You have to be to survive a shift. This job may lead to excess smoking and drinking!"
bad,"honestly i have read a lot of these posts and i think anyone who has given this job a good review is either full of it, delusional, or really new to the premise tech job. "
bad,"Life is pretty difficult and unrewarding if you're a contractor engaged in L2 Support, depends on which project one is part of, unfortunate to be a part of one of the worst teams there ."
bad,"A typical day at work, is very loud, mangers, and co workers play loud music, curse, talk about things they have no business talking about while at work. While on the phone, customers often question whats going on in the background; very unprofessional."
bad,The company as a whole mistreats there employees and takes advantage of them. cuts corners on safty to benefit profitablity of company.
bad,Not everyone is held to the same policies.One person will get away with something while the other will be fired for the same action.
bad,"This was a call center our jobs where to handle questions the  customer may have about their phone bill or plan. "
bad,"dont work here its all high pressure sales pushing products on people that they cant afford dont need and dont want, they are inflexible with schedules, the attendance policy is a joke"
bad,"This isn't the best company to work for, they've cut my paychecks 3 times, with their excuse being they're a new company. And I do understand that they're a new company, but they need to get it together."
bad,"Hard to work outdoors in winter. I sold At&t Uverse door to door. Challenging to meet sales each week, however I made it 6 months so I am proud of that before I applied elsewhere. This company no longer exists."
bad,"constantly switched teams, accounts, departments.  Directors and managements directives often differed.  coworkers are very helpful.  but you are underpaid and over worked for the job that you do."
bad,"Company is all politics. Internal IT was mostly outsources in 2005 and currently fragmented. "
bad,"Company managers do not allocate personnel in a cost effective manner, sending techs out of state when the techs at home are working overtime.  The overall work environment does not foster teamwork as the job reporting policies force negative feedback when it is out of the ""offender's"" control."
bad,"When I was hired, this was where I planned on staying until I was retirement age, but that did not happen. "
bad,"Working for AT&T came with too many expectations that could not be met by most employees or supervisors. Although the technology aspect was fun to do, the system and equipment constantly failed and customers were very disappointed in the company service altogether."
bad,Pulled contract 2 weeks before I was certified through a 6 week course. Management is horrible. Can only get help through a chat box. Can never speak to a person face to face.
bad,"The treat contractors as if they are insignificant and replaceable, and underpaid.  It is not a transparent or team effort work environment.  If you come up with new ideas or better more efficient ways of doing things, you are ignored and viewed as a threat.  When new orgs/departments are created and executed management starts them from scrap and don't implement full or even partial current processes, procedures and standards to get themselves off the ground."
bad,"I did not enjoy this job, piece rate work. No respect given to employees / field technicians."
bad,"The management did not do there job at all, they let everybody get away with anything, and it is too much for people to handle."
bad,High tech sales job. Union membership is required. AT&T loves to hold termination over you to get you to sell more. I had no life while working for AT&T because they offer overtime that is required to hit sales goals. Okay pay with okay benefits you have to wait 3 years to get vested.
bad,"The goals are inflated unreasonable.  Long hours and no work/life balance.  The company struggles to create a comfortable atmosphere for employees.  High turnover rate due to increasing sales goals and decreasing compensation.  The organization continues to change which is beneficial to members in high level positions.  Very difficult to advance, I have been unable to move despite having a masters degree."
bad,Wire tech position can be tedious. Management tends to be abusive. Ask a lot and then ride you when you can't meet their unreasonable metrics.
bad,"Expectations and goals were set from the start of the campaign, and none of the employees received bonuses or promised comission for sales made. Management was never organized, so agents had a hard time adapting to constant change, to a point that the campaign was forced to close down this week."
bad,a typical day at work consist of co-workers fighting with one and other. Not a place you want to work at all. Store Manger did not know how to do her job. I repeat not a place you want to work at.
bad,"Takes 5 or 6 calls to get a hold of someone."
bad,"typical day at work • Assisted individuals with inquiries about products and services that would be beneficial to each interested client"
bad,Little or no chance for advancement. All day in a cubical answering phone is not for me.
bad,"AT&T in general was great, but the Wireless by George owners did not give anyone the tools to succeed."
bad,"Inbound calls for customers who wanted to activate services, reinstated services and processed payments. Troubleshoot issues with equipment."
bad,"Not fun."
bad,"Would not recommend this job for anyone, nor my dog. Training ? Excluding pole climbing, training was done by those who couldn't cut it in the field. After training stand by for all the harassment you'd ever want. You'll hear only about how you can be fired or written up...and hear it several times a day. You are told that you must ""WOW"" the customers....which is very difficult to do when the C.O. work has not been done for your particular ticket. I guess they'll write you up for ""Failure to WOW"". On this job,AT&T gives less than a care about YOU and their customers."
bad,"The work itself at this company is great, I love what I do and the interaction I have with the customers. However the internal workings of this company as far as how the uverse world is handled is worse than two children arguing over their toys."
bad,"The job task itself is fine, however the work enviroment is overwelming."
bad,"high stress, good pay, but most of the management for the departments that pay well are very ""good old boys"" company men who don't seem to understand the human element in most modern management styles"
bad,"management not consistent thru out the calling center, not enough flexibility in case of emergencies, ie is you are in an accident will be  penalized at work"
bad,Horrible place to work. Impossible to work with upper management.
bad,"Not too many things a enjoy about working here. Training is insufficient, management is incompetent and product is unreliable.  "
bad,This is a good company to work for if you are able to travel long distances all the time and are able to keep up with the extremely overbooked work schedule. The hardest part of this job was receiving a work order for a local area and then another one that had to be completed within 3 hours but was 5 hours travel time away. 
bad,The company offered training in other areas and could move to other positions quickly.
bad,Talk with customers to see where they want lines ran and where to put cable boxes. Hook up all satellite to tvs.
bad,"You are called a sales consultant but you do more than just sales. Your customer service, tech support, and a everything else. Its not about getting the customer what they need but more of how much can you steal from them a month and lock them down in these contracts. I advise everyone to take a look at their bills monthly. Manager are completely incompetent and lack proper skills to be leaders. The turn over rate is ridiculous, I have personally been through three managers a year for the past 2 years. This is not including Assistant Managers I've lost count of those. You have to sell Direct TV, Uverse, Home alarm system, Wireless home phone, and all other kinds of products that are not phones. Now the commission sucks we used to make over $60K a year now its half of that. Save yourself the trouble work for Verizon."
bad,Customer Assistant Metairie La. training was like herding a group of cattle no personal training
bad,Great Flexibility
bad,"Money making focus with little or no regard for employees. Company made a backdoor deal with CWA to ""unionize"" which was the worst decision for the workers. Once GPS was installed in vehicles it was used in the most negative way and became a tool for annual reviews."
bad,Great place to gain some sales experience but not big on customer service. They want you to treat the customer well on the surface but in the end they ask you to sell the customer something they will have no use for because its all about numbers.
bad,"Years ago it was a great job-with great co-workers. I will always have a few friends that remain at this company, but in recent years, change in uppermanagement and tension with the changing atmosphere, left management constantly belittling employees. If you want to go to work everyday being told you are not good enough, you can not do your job. If you like getting email threats that say "" if you do not sell what so and so team has sold, you will have to deal with me!"""
bad,At the time the company starting pay was VERY LOW.Upper management was very poor AT ALL TIMES!!!
bad,A typical day consiste of non stop calls from cst all over the coutry. I dont mind dealing with the customers. The stress comes from management and how the building is being run. The hardest part is dealing with management and feeling like your hard work is appreciated. AT&T shows no respect for their employees and their family because they change shifts frequently putting single parents in a tough situation finding child care or spending time with family.
bad,Constant overtime. Lack of pay increase. Long hours. Forced overtime without advance notice. Poor management.
bad,I loved the people that I worked with. If I had it my way the people would stay. The management team would need to get over hauled. They control the fate of their employees. So whether or not you deserve a promotion it doesn't matter if the manager doesn't co sign.
bad,"revolving door job, high stress, constantly changing requirements"
bad,"Learnt Project co-ordination, how to work on weekends, not complain about anything."
bad,The satalite industry is very demanding and competitive.
bad,"This company doesn't care about its employees. Its all about business, I was fired for being admitted to the hospital and being only a 5 month old employee they were saying I didn't have any time to cover it."
bad,Really dont have much to say that i would like to place here other than the summary review
bad,"Got put on short term disability after I developed double pneumonia and an infection in my lungs. After being off work for 3 months, I was given the option to quit or get fired."
bad,"I definitely wouldnt suggest ATT for someone looking for job security. Maybe the entire company isnt like this but the business and residential sales departments are. They use to have a great salary and when ATT officially took over, salaries and bonuses were slashed. Make this your last alternative. Most reviews that are negative are firings. I definitely quit after several years with the company"
bad,"dont just dont, union is moving in and AT&T is in a panic. bets avoided"
bad,Open up the store. Credit Checks. Payments. Activating accounts. Sometimes working with a co-worker to make the day not so stressful on us around the first of the month. Count down the draw. Record all the paper work.
bad,the lucky can find themselves wildly successful. the unfortunate find themselves laid off.
bad,This job is only good for making money. Many days of forced overtime. Pay is not competative. Supervisors are airheads and have no idea how to perform the job of their subordinates.
bad,Company is big but has no room for advancement and no incentive for better pay.
bad,"Stress, stress, stress, stress, best example. You are never good enough."
bad,"It's a job with ok pay and decent benefits, the coworkers made it a good place to work"
bad,"This is an outsource center in which ATT uses for its customer service. This is a high stress environment with fast paced changes with limited to no warning. The management rarely knows about what is going on and therefore the communication is awful. The only perk is that it starts at $9/hr. You do have the opportunity for commission, but the reach to get it is near impossible. The turnover rate for this job is extremely high due to the constant changes. The most enjoyable part of this job is you get paid for full 40 hours + a week."
bad,Att has a complete disregard for the employees that work for as premise technicians.
bad,"As a faithfull employee I have learned that training is available and ATT pays and provided onsite traing for all it's employees. The benefits are great, but change too often. Coworked that you choose to know are great as long as you can stay under the radar. The attire is buisness casual, which is great. The customers are that people who want the service at a very low price."
bad,very bad place to work management is looking to fire you if you are at top pay there they will look to fire you they only want people who make the lowest pay to continue working there.
bad,"Typical Day: Incredibly busy, interact with every customer, constant training and developing employees, constant on the spot coaching, handling customer escalations, review scheduling, timecards, inventory management, and more"
bad,Upper management very unprofessional and unwilling to assist. No boundaries with personal life and the working environment.
bad,"Good job but not good job security,high turnover rates. Free television services for employees"
bad,They really don't care about their workers. They have no respect for their workers whats so ever
bad,"AT&T is a large company with many different departments. I felt lost in the shuffle, just a number with no input what so ever."
bad,Overall good company in comparison to other companies. The retail working experience can be slow pace depending on the location. It can become very monotonous.
bad,When I worked there we burned so many customers by not delivering what we promised. I was a sales rep and I do not over promise but the company sure does under deliver to the customer. I spent most of my time apologizing and trying to get customers issues resolved with no help from management.
bad,"If you don't made all their stats they constantly threaten to fire you, Extremely high stress with unhappy customers and AT&T policies blocking you from truely helping the customer, Can't find another job fast enough"
bad,"Pay is okay, zero opportunity for advancement. Managers are non-technical employees, only there to baby-sit technicians and go behind them on jobs and take pictures and look for ways to write them up. Company uses impossible quality and efficiency metrics so every employee always has a very low rating. The company starts a paper trail against you from day 1, and like most union jobs that pay well, they are always looking for a way to fire you. They assume any idiot can do the job if they make stupid computer software and flowcharts for you to follow. They treat every employee like they are replaceable in an instant no matter what seniority or skill level. Some paid time off, that you can't use on weekends or in the summer months..."
bad,"Terrible culture nowadays there.  They have taken on a culture of outsourcing the majority of their IT labor to India.  This has left thousands unemployed and been a challenge for many families...all of whom were terrifically loyal and hard workers.  I myself had to let go over 200 people.  Those employees were threatened and coerced into ""cross-training"" their offshore replacements.  If they did not they were told they would be terminated immediately and not be eligible for a severance package.  Just criminal."
bad,"long hours with pay not equal to tasks, all depends on your direct manager on your success at the job, no chance of going the path I wanted to go with my career due to the company hires based on who you know"
bad,"At&t is not the ideal company you would want to work at if you plan on longevity with the company, they will make sure to cut your job out right before you are set to retire."
bad,"You cant have a work , home life in any cable position really. Yes you will work long hours and you may get decent pay. For me I did 199 hours in 2 weeks and received a 1500 dollar paycheck.."
bad,"the amount of sales they expect people to put out (I did very well with my sales numbers) it is not backed by their compensation packages, the pressure is not worth it, the good thing about working here are the good benefits they are able to provide,"
bad,"continue to raise metrics without adjusting performance numbers "
bad,"Annual layoffs is their business model."
bad,Extremely low pay for what we do. If someone get's hired full time they bump your pay down $5.00 to $6.00 dollars an hour. The benefits are good. Hours are flexible. Turnover rate is very high due to people leaving for better pay.
bad,Company underpays talented workers.  Doesn’t see people as it’s future  automation is AT&T future.  Incentives to leave are the only positive in the environment at this time
bad,"Work life balance, inconsistent leadership, layoffs nearly every quarter for last 3 years. The job I love, but the culture needs some work. There is a lot of great talent leaving"
bad,"The company I worked under, named Prime Communications was a sketchy and not really well rounded retail company. Time and time again we had people leave the company due to lack of management and leadership as well as the horrible pay structure and how they constantly changed the pay structure ever two to three months; Never for the better. My last few weeks with the company I witnessed people including managers of my district, about four of them all leave because of the poor life to work balance having them always working even at other locations due to other managers for people leaving the company and the lack of pay due to poor pay structures. AT&T is a great company to work for but I would steer clear of the retail company named Prime Communications."
bad,"This is in most cases a high stress work environment which is constantly changing. As a manager, it is a challenging role that tests your ability to change and adapt to the ever changing needs of the business."
bad,"It was a glorious day when I started work for Directv. I died when ATT bought it. You will hate the discounts. You will hate pushing faulty products and you will hate your ""managers"""
bad,Great place to work but after 5 years of never seeing anything beyond the end of you phone cord it gets daunting.  Worked doing the same thing for 10 years because I wasn't apart of the in crowd.  Very much like high school dynamics.
bad,Company doesn’t make sense. Has poor leadership that doesn’t lead. Lots of policies. The focus of the company is not where it needs to be. Pay and benefits are good but everything else is very poor.
bad,"Training was excellent. Open door work environment, no discrimination policy which was great. Too much gossiping and the management could use much improvement."
bad,"Working at AT&T is challenging.  There is always the demand to produce at the highest levels.  It is a company with an emphasis on company-first, and where the needs of the stock-holders are held above all else."
bad,Not the place to work if you think outside the box or don't center your life around your job.   Archaic management system that pretends to be innovative.
bad,"Managers didn’t care for there employees, did not answer any questions with a straight answer , refused to work on problems. I wouldn’t go back nor would I recommend someone"
bad,"Tienen mucho favoritismo las personas que contratan y promueven, ya que prefieren contratar de staff a personas de afuera que sean sus amigos y no a los mismos agentes que ha tienen experiencia en el producto"
bad,No work life balance. Managers are very subjective in applying policy. Hours worked and hours available made for a long work day. Most days 10 hours some days 12 hours worked a day.
bad,The job itself is fine but the metrics in place on your performance were absurd. You could do a great job but you would get hit for time. Honest and straight forward work ethic isn't a good fit there. Also the union here coddles screw ups but cant do anything for you but bring it up next meeting.
bad,This company was great when I first started. Very personable with great managers who knew the job. After SBC bought out the company they started changing which isn't always a bad thing but once they started moving away from having people who know the business to bringing in managers who do not know telecommunications at all. I remember being told they don't need to know the work they just need to manage the people. The company has truly gone in the wrong direction. They care nothing about the people that work there. They completely forgot that it is all of the team that they step on who can make it a great place.
bad,Glad to finally have it out of my system. I left and went back multiple times. This last time I was lied to and sent misinformation by the recruiter and nothing was done to resolve it. There is a negative energy. I was a top seller and best in customer service I just hated the feeling there.
bad,"AT&T struggles with clear leadership.  Initiatives and projects lurch back and forth to meet shareholder expectations.  Much of the workforce is contract, leading to a lack of overall cohesion and a brain-drain as contract employees leave.  Consistent layoffs in the past 5-years, with more expected.  Do more with less."
bad,"Don't do it.  Company always changes comp plan, makes goals higher and higher, even when you don't hit them.  The lowest integrity in culture that I have ever seen."
bad,"Since leaving AT&T, I realized something.  Some people really do like their job.  Or at least tolerate it without constantly complaining.  Working at AT&T is like working at your typical evil greedy American corporation.  They send out emails or a trinket to say how much they appreciate you as nothing more than an obligation to try to get their gullible followers to think their employer actually cares about them."
bad,"typical day at work is being in an understaffed store where you are micromanaged beyond belief, you have to have a mid interaction with your manager for every customer that comes in and tell them why they are not buying a product they dont want."
bad,Firefighting best describes this position.  Onboarding is a project within itself and nobody is really managing that or they don't have the time to do it.  98% of work is managed via spreadsheets with little to no automation or collaborative tools.
bad,"you are watched on how long you spend on jobs, monitored on the route you take and questioned/investigated afterwards, becoming more of a sales position for technicians rather than the focus of quality work, management doesn't show understanding of problems and issues when they rise, the most enjoyable part is not being in front of or near management all of the time, the hardest part is maintaining a cleanlyness and professional look after going into attics or climbing trees to run new cables"
bad,"for a company as large it is , it has no structure... it is a do as i say and not as i do..  very little assistance or caring from half the managers, that are on the floor, at times overly stressful for no reason."
bad,very stressful its all sale no customer service when customers need it. they will sale you the world but forget about  getting help when to need it. Your on your own. Here's a number to call
bad,I was an employee for 5 years and sold the most I ever have the final year and made 15K less than I did the first year. Commission structure is garbage. Managers micromanage and do not allow sellers to sell. Just not a great atmosphere.
bad,"When asked questions about pay bonuses, they tended to change subject and never answered directly.  At the position I held, we would get the people that were purposely transferred just because the other agent didn't want to deal with them."
bad,Needs improvement on the upper management level. Could be a very great job but the uncertainty of job security and rules constantly changing can become quite stressful.
bad,"An experience is what you make it, but at the time work life balance was non-existent with this company; it would be a great place to work if they broke the mold for what they consider employee engagement."
bad,"I was in my 9th year when I left AT&T. The worst job I had in 45 yrs of working. I was age discriminated on a constant basis by very young management with no previous managerial experience. Commission structures were constantly changed, so most of us were making less, but selling more."
bad,"Lot of forced overtime, almost impossible to use your dental or health care, when you try to use your day off for appointments, the company forces a six day work week and you have to reschedule you’re appointment. Have to give company 2 weeks in advance to use a personal day, vacation is put in on Jan and seniors employees get first pick so you get what you get for vacation."
bad,A very big company to work for. Decent pay and good benefits. Work long hours and weekends. Work outside mostly. Have to use alot of tools and remember alot of information.
bad,"First things first, the pay and benefits are great all things considered. However, the management team is absolute trash. Managers essentially take role and complain about metrics. They do not help with equipment shortages or customer issues. They do not know how the tech works. They cannot and will not help you with your job if you get stuck, but they will demand that you call them for advice so that they can give you bad advice. They will attempt to get you to do things that can get you fired in order to meet your numbers. They will harass you. They will try to get you to risk your life stupidly. "
bad,If you want to describe a job as a DEAD END. This is it. It is amazing I tolerated it for as long as I did. I only did because I liked my co-workers. Abysmal management. Sub-human work environment.
bad,"I worked there 10 yrs. it was progressively worse every year. Forced by management to be unethical & dishonest or be disciplined. Pay went down every year while productivity increased. Management is completely unethical all the way up the chain and they get greedier the higher up the chain you go. Company keeps growing, making obscene profits, while slashing pay and benefits."
bad,Worked in the telecommunications business for 25 years. Loved working at the phone company until AT&T took over. Now employees are afraid of being walked out due to all the mergers and lack of trust with our leadership team. Responsibilities have increased while salaries have decreased. Healthcare benefits have also increased. AT&T has forgotten who built this company while they destroy it. I and glad I am moving on.
bad,At first AT&T was a great place to work at until they merged with SBC the company I was originally working for. When the CEO retired the CEO for AT&T was placed in charge and that's when it rapidly went downhill. Raises were based on equality not performance. In the last 5 years I was there I didnt get a cost of living raise.
bad,"Att pays higher than average for surrounding areas and can learn a lot about iOS and android devices can wear hats while taking calls.Nice tools allow you to screen share with customers to resolve issues quickly, NEEDS MORE CLEAR CUT ADVANCEMWNT OPPORTUNITIES,   SOME HATERS PRESENT"
bad,"AT&T was a great company when I first started many years ago.  They were leading edge in technology, had great opportunities to learn and advance and thought highly of their employees.  "
bad,While working at at&t from 2005-2012 I enjoyed it. But there was no room for advancement. There wasn't a work life balance there. They demanded a lot from their employees
bad,Don't even bother working for an agent. Either work at a corporate location or you will just be a replaceable cog in a terrible machine. Terrible hours and always understaffed
bad,"Work / Life Balance and ability to work remotely a bit more in my organization was great, but aside from that, this was the only Pro working there. "
bad,"No structure, poor communication, under paid compared to others and commission structure is on the very low end. Work life balance is a joke.  Better to be a high selling sales rep then manager."
bad,Garbage company wouldn’t ever work for them again they treat employees like robots all you are to them for s a suit ID managers are trash and they don’t care about quality of work even if they know it’s about making the customer take bad service anyway the service will be of poor quality it’s about making the customer take it a
bad,would not suggest to anyone. Management made decisions to benefit themselves.  New guys were screwed over by the so called senior techs.i was injured and basically called a liar.  i could go on and on but I choose not to!
bad,As a wire tech you will have no family life. You are fired to work off days as well as long hours. Managers will hound you about getting repeats on jobs because their equipment fails. You order work materials and it doesn't come so you have to beg and borrow from your peers. you are always at fault. Every manager has his or hers own agenda on what they think is right. Its not worth it guys the way you will get treated. I did it for 3 years before I called it quits. My whole crew quit and found other jobs within a 2 month period because we got tired of the threats of being fired or loosing are jobs over bs.
bad,"The company has poor customer service. As a in store rep, you have to call into customer service to get things done for you customer and that takes 1-2 hours. There services is a rip off especially for DTV customers. Managers are all about there commission check and sell anything to make a quick buck. The scheduling for employees is the worse. The seniority is terrible. They tax you 40% on your commission check which is combined with one of your hourly checks. They pay you $3 per upgrade and management doesn’t like for you to do those, they try to force the customer to add new lines when not needed. Upgrading a customer can take 1-2 hrs for $3 so sales reps don’t want to do them"
bad,"For such a big company, you'd think they'd put competent and honest management in their offices. Long story short, they don't. They preach all through training all the great things about the company, those are only for upper management though. In reality, you're a mindless drone following a script."
bad,"Not a bad place to work short time... you have to be a politician or dishonest to move up in company.  You are expected to do whatever it takes to get the job done and even suggested on ""shady"" operations.  Later, when your upper management gets questioned on why things were done, you are left ""holding the blame"" and they kick you out."
bad,"The company is not as it was, where it offered careers now it offers temp and fear of Layoff. I started with the promise of advancement but now we are in fear of being let go for profits"
bad,"I learned a lot working here. However, there is no vlaue on your time. For a technology company, they give you poor resources to work with, very little opportunity to work remotely, promote those who are ruthless and outright rude, and value only the CEO's vision or the bottom line. Nothing else matters. You can spend 2 weeks just putting togther pread sheets and presentaiton for a visist from an exectuive and no other work is completed. Everyone worked in silos as well."
bad,"install and repair service drive to accommodate customer, may need to pick up supplies, and put in additional order to assist with customer. can be out all day"
bad,"I would not recommend working for the company at this time.  Misuse of the company money; buying up too many businesses and laying off loyal employees only to hire others that are younger.  Age and gender discrimination is very obvious,"
bad,A good job for the short term. I like that they have a union because Lord knows you will have to use it.  The work life balance is pretty terrible. At the end of the day it is just a job with decent benefits to get you through until you can find a fulfilling career.
bad,"This company provided decent benefits with ok pay but was terribly managed.  My job had no advancements and was laying people off theoughout the 7 years i had there before it was my turn. All this company cares about is money and nothing else, but worse then mosts companies."
bad,Empresa inestable debido al alto índice de corrupción.
bad,Show up at 8 and go home when they say. One Saturday off a month. If you want to do something on a weekend you have to call in sick or burn vacation days or just not have a life with your family. But if you call in sick it goes against you.  Micro managing at its finest. It used to be fun to work there. The job itself is easy and have no issue with it. It is the daily thought of “what am i going to get written up for today?”
bad,I was hired as a customer service assistant for an inbound call center.  My employer was Insight Global temporay agency out of Chicago.  I was hired to a new help desk for field technicians who were installing fiber optics for buisness accounts.  The call volume was much heavier than first anticipated so my training was one day.  It was a struggle to jump in however I did learn the computer system and had also excelled in taking and problem solving phone calls from our technicians.
bad,"I was at AT&T for two years, and it was the worst job experience that I've ever had.  I had an abusive boss, and management allowed it. He would curse at the employees and insult them."
bad,"If you're OK being a number, AT&T is a good place to work.  If you want to be valued as an individual, try a smaller company.  There is always a reorganization going on, and your job is always in jeopardy.  If you're a project manager, you can only work as a contractor."
bad,"I worked for Mastec.  Would not recommend that place for employment to anyone.  Poor pay, long hours, poor and unexperienced management, no flexibility in scheduling."
bad,"ambiente de trabajo nocturno, eventual, viajes frecuentes"
bad,"If you just want money and hours away from your family, this is the job for you. Management only existed to tell team members that they weren't meeting their unobtainable number requirements. To supplant this, many technicians would do several quick jobs, get dinged for one, but since the ratio is in their favor, their numbers are artificially inflated."
bad,"Way too much work per any given day; no down time: lunches, breaks, all ignored by management. The constancy of work load out shined any help from the supervisor pool."
bad,too many meetings that resulting in nothing.   too many executives who cannot make decisions.   vice presidents are chosen based on popularity rather than their experience or ability.
bad,"AT&T does not promote a collaborative,team environment. Rather it has become an unhealthy work culture as employees struggle to hold on to their jobs. The employees are under valued and treated as disposable."
bad,"The work was fun, but the way we were treated wasn't fair. Training was great, the fellow technicians were awesome, the most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers"
bad,Average place to work.  Years age this was one of the best places to work.  Today is not a place I would recommend due to poor management and high lay-off rates.
bad,"The store had a lack of management, and quite a few maintenance issues. The store needed to close down for about a Month and a lot of renovations needed to be made, and a whole new staff of trained employees needed to be put in place. Including a new store manager and a new regional manager  (My review is specific to my store)"
bad,"My direct manager was great. The rest of management sucked. They only cared about themselves and everyone else was just a number. As long as you were meeting the criteria, no one cared but the second you were under your job was at stake. Very cutthroat."
bad,"It is all about the metrics. Significant amount of micro-management with the looming threat of termination. They are hard-pressed to keep people coming to work, so the only terminations I ever saw were for attendance. Not a lot of options for advancement."
bad,"Politics & and heartless greed overshadows this company. They fire techs for nonsense reasons, demand overtime, and poison 1st level management. 3rd level (and up) management is ruthless, they foster an oppressive work environment in an attempt to control lawsuits from lackluster training of technicians and poor equipment. They'd rather fire a Technician than fix their oppressive work environment. They only care about performance metrics and process management. Yet they have innumerable service issues that the process is incapable of handling. Every new process created works against the technicians favor."
bad,"Management consistently want you to push products down on customers to the point that they get upset. Hard to provide true customer service when the customer does not come first, but the company instead."
bad,"A typical work day would be to get to office in the morning and review technicians numbers form previous day and review customer service results.  Upper management did not not always like employees with morales.  The last gentleman I had as my manager stated to me that I had loser mentality because I would not fudge numbers to like some of the other managers. The culture in Uverse was to get numbers at all cost, which sets a standard that its ok to cheat to succeed.  And with that mentality the only ones that suffer are the customer"
bad,"Hours were inconsistent and all over the place. You could be closing and then open the next day. People were shady with customers, churn and burn. Not my type of environment, I do not like working on commision."
bad,"The work can be stressful and the metrics you are held to can be unreasonable given the obstacles you face day to day. The pay is enticing, but the technician can only take so much."
bad,"By the time i left, the field had become stagnant. Layoffs were happening for both management and installers. There was nothing new was coming out, as far as updates or improvements to the technology. If you had a manager that was actually a decent human, they did not last long. 2nd and 3rd level management treated techs like animals and frequently mistreated them. Techs were suspended and/or fired for trivial things, especially if they made a manager unhappy."
bad,Management treats employees as expendable. They change managers monthly. Caustic culture. Union often unable to protect employees from outrageous claims and customer interaction. I often felt the technology was not that great because of the poor inferstructure.
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job you get to meet a lot of new people and interact. The worst part of the job management need works like a lot of work I wish the actual CEO will come down and see what they do and how they treat the employees. As an employee you can't speak up for anything if you do be ready you will get retaliated and pushed out or lose your job. Typical work day it's great and pretty enjoyable as long as a manager well let me rephrase that a bad manager it's not working that day. Usually when a bad manager works there's constant lying or bending the truth a little to customers about promotions so they can hit their quotas per day. If you don't believe me go ahead and ask customers of AT&T. What I've learned when I was there is that AT&T has too many bosses and not enough leaders Point Blank. Don't get me wrong the company does have a lot of good things going for it but managers need to get better trained and look after cuz who's looking at them for what they do...
bad,changed work orders per tech request via email. Learned to utilize computer skills to accomplish changes to be made in an efficient and timely manner. Management was helpful sometimes for questions about what the final outcome would be for the customer. Very stressful environment. Some coworkers were difficult to work with. Most enjoyable part of the job was to help the customer receive the utmost care and satisfied with their experience with out company.
bad,"sólo te ven como un numero, jamás se preocupan por el capital humano."
bad,"As an install tech you do not have the proper tools or materials to complete the task correctly"
bad,"The pay is fair for the work being performed by technicians, however there is no notice for daily overtime. You will never know when you're going to be leaving work. There is also an abundance of micro managing that never stops."
bad,"AT&T is not the same company that it used to be. When you get a job at AT&T you think that you will have long term job security. This is not the case. Whether you join the union or not the company is not as stable as you would assume a company of this size would be. I have worked for the company twice, and they do not take care of their people. The second time I worked for them they laid me off and I had to sue them for unemployment. Overall the pay is good and the work is rewarding, but you never know when they will lay you off."
bad,"The management was always looking to catch you breaking ridicules policies (3 days off if you didn't place your traffic vest over you steering wheel after the day). They would give you times to complete a job that would not be possible to complete. You were always micromanaged. Your off days would be a Sunday and some other day in the middle of the week, never two days together. You would normally work 12-14 hours a day 6 days a week, typically 60-70 hours a week. You were always worried about management firing you because your numbers weren't high enough. Not worth the money."
bad,"the expectations of the job are to make your manager money. yes you make money but hitting your sales goals and a $1,000 a day goal is highly unlikely."
bad,AT&T would be a wonderful place to work. If management would interact with its frontline employees more. This company has a hard time communicating with one another. Processes and procedures tools  need extreme revamping.  Mainly medical insurance for a family is too expensive high deductibles for individual family members not much of insurance is covered by the employer. AT&T has enough employees to by far have the best insurance coverage pay raises As well as changing to a positive work environment. Not my job get set a lot. There is a disconnect between management and employees due to Union.
bad,"Management can care less about their employees. They are self-centered, back stabbing, money hungry individuals. Worse job I’ve ever had...hands down!"
bad,does  promote a fair work environment. the work environment is scattered and teamwork is lacking.work is lacking. training is not provided on core products that are supported
bad,"Especially at the Merritt Island Store the employees were constantly demeaned, ridiculed, degraded micro managed by the management team.  Each level degraded the next down to the sales team and support team.  A hostile, hateful environment where the sales people finally just turned a stone ear since they were going to be blasted for not being good enough and not doing enough.  Ridiculous pushed to sell more resulted in false sales just to meet the ever increasing and hard to obtain sales quotas.  One example:  Sales person sold a bundle of services that included home phone service.  The manager repeatedly asked that sales person why didn't they sell the customer a land line service on top of the bundle!  The sales are never good enough for the greedy corporate AT&T."
bad,Poor management system. Hear-say can get you fired without any proof. The main goal is to sell Directv. They do not care how you do it just as long as you meet the managers sells target for the month.
bad,"The name looks great on a resume,  but sadly the workplace environment is all about a number and a focus for the month and never feels like people are there to encourage growth.  I understand sales but it is simply high stress and low reward."
bad,"At the moment that this review is being submitted AT&T has announced the layoff of 40k people.  Granted the company runs fat, however that is how they do business.  If you are in the legacy telcom side of the house, the job sucks.  AT&T is focused on content and user experience more than anything and Im sure that that side is great."
bad,"AT&T has a very good salary compensation, but the culture there is disgusting with management coming to work smelling like alcohol and marijuana. Rampant violations of state & Federal laws pertaining to racism and gender identity. Work versus personal life only exists if you are related to someone higher up in the company. You will be retaliated against for reporting management for company violations of Code of Business Conduct. Be very careful if you choose this as a place of employment."
bad,"You never know what your day will be like when you get to the shop.  The pay is decent enough to keep a person there, and the discounts and benefits are decent.  The company routinely runs out of equipment or supplies, but they do provide uniforms.  The higher level management continues to tell everyone to prepare for the future, then tell us they don't know where the company is going.  You are able to get degrees and discounted tuition.  Work and family life balance are often thrown out the window.  Certain departments are forced overtime and can work long hours.  The work load is designed for the number of people working to work at least ten hours per day most of the year.  Job security isn't too bad.  It is a Union Shop.  It is also lucky to have that union to protect you if you end up on the wrong end of a write up.  You do get to work outside, which is nice.  You should rarely your direct supervisor, so you get to run your work independently.  Going into people's homes is always exciting.  I would say the hardest part of the job is dealing with the company itself.  The corporate end seems to just plow over the field workers and not look ahead.  When one section looks ahead and plans, another new idea comes along and saves $.03 per unit and the entire trajectory of work changes.  If you like problem solving, this is the place to be."
bad,My grandparents and their parents worked for AT&T for over 30 years...I got 20 in before they said we really only want sales driven people to push this company forward...we are not really interested in taking care of customers...customer support should be outsourced...so we were surplussed.
bad,"no work life balance , management is cut throat. Pay is very good , but you don't have a life. Come in at 8 and get off when ever they tell you to leave"
bad,"Work day 9 to 5"
bad,"If you were hired in years ago you're good. New hires are treated horribly. Management doesn't think, they just do for the most part. It's always about meeting numbers and not looking at details about what impacts those numbers. Huge disconnect between upper management and the ones doing the jobs."
bad,I worked for an authorized retailer of ATT. No comments on the corporate company. I did found ATT corporate to be very helpful when needed by us at the Authorized Retailer.
bad,job always stress full  never enough equipment very dangerous environment managers  always threating employment status. the pay is good but not worth the stress
bad,Very micromanaged getting worse all the time and they do not care about their employees. I would not recommend this place for a job sorry but I just wouldn't.
bad,AT&T needs to give more to their customers. It's a hard sell when you don't believe and you genuinely know that other options are better. Get more creative AT&T.  Support from management was not compassionate. I was only able to last 8 months. If you're not motivated by numbers and love customer service. This job is NOT for you.
bad,"AT&T bought out DTV and is ruining the DTV brand daily. Management doesn't care about employees and we are all just a number to them. The culture here is to utilize FMLA if you are sick, therefore almost everyone is on FMLA now. The hardest part of the job is knowing that you cannot actually help the customers due to the way AT&T has changed things. So basically we just tell customers what they want to hear to get them off the phone since we really cannot help them. It's sad that DTV is being ruined by a company that COULD make great things happen, if only they cared about more than their shareholders and profits."
bad,"it hard to advance within.  Theres a lot of out sourcing here at this company. Theres really no movement for current employees here, it is best to come into the job that you want than to just get in and work your way up."
bad,Advancement is a matter of who you know rather than what your capabilities are. The company could probably do with about two less levels of management. Low level management turf war is so counter productive to this company its really sad. They could be so much more efficient by not having level after level of 1-3 line managers that fight against each other politically versus working toward the common good of the company.
bad,Directors/Management would tell you one thing then do another. company would continually keep cutting personnel and not communicate the final vision for the orginazation.
bad,"A typical day is starting with booting up the old antiquated systems. taking 50 or more calls per day. the culture is semi divided, but overall for the long term people the work relationships are like family. Managers are driven by high expectations, and you know it trickles down hill. Micromanagement is an understatement. Once a month free lunches, daily contests if you are lucky to get paid out on."
bad,"The pay is good, but your working all day at the store if your full time. 10-7/8. If your part time then you’ll have better flexibility, but you’ll be making less."
bad,Nothing else to say about this employer. Things have drastically changed over the years and not in a positive way. People constantly worry about whether they will have a job year over year.
bad,This is ONLY a job to get you to your next level this is nothing to stay at because they want more and more and more it never enough! There is no work life balance
bad,"They don't promote from within. Their competitive structures are not competitive and they somehow get worse every year. The products management wants you to sell are the products you don't make money. You are held accountable to selling products that they tell you is good for the company, but these products won't pay you. The goals are set too high and there is no time to sell, when most of the time you are cleaning up billing issues or installation issues. It's a mess and unorganized and management does not listen."
bad,The union reps were terrible. if you weren't in the union you were threatened by some of the union members. So much ugliness in the environment. It was absolutely awful
bad,"Unless you're willing to give up every weekend, have mandatory overtime added while you're on your days off and then get written up for not knowing it was added while you were out, then don't apply. You will work every weekend, you do have a mandatory quota to meet for sales, after 3 months of not meeting this quota, you will be fired."
bad,This job gets more stressful everyday I work here. They set you up to fail. Always trying to write you up for any of 1000 things. They cut management jobs every year. I have been forced to do three times the work as 80 percent of other techs with the same title for no compensation. Forced overtime. No advancement opportunities left from this position. Bogus bonus opportunities. The work you do is never good enough
bad,if you like to be micromanaged and worked like a slave. Long work hours terrible work culture and unfair restrictions on workers.. No room for growth or room for ideas
bad,"En un día común te puedes encontrar a toda clase de gente, amable, agresiva, desesperante, etc. Es recomendable tener mucha calma ya que además de clientes difíciles, se agrega la dificultad de una empresa pésimamente administrada que genera sus propios conflictos y tiene poca importancia en el capital humano."
bad,There were times that I felt valued and challenged as an employee and there were times that I felt I had absolutely no fulfillment within this role.  A healthy work-life balance was not possible.
bad,"No job security, they will surplus your job create a new name for the same job they let you go on and hire new people at a lower rate. Change compensation tracking month to month to insure you don’t earn to much."
bad,"for at least my department and site, advancement was giving on who you know bases not qualifications or experience. job required a lot of away time with hardly any comp."
bad,It used to be a great place to work but the upper management is now just worried about financials and no longer cares about/ for the people that work there.
bad,extresante y piden mucho en el sentido que te pueden dejar sin descanso porque no has realizado las ventas
bad,"I think the title says enough.  The only thing positive I can say is that there is a Union contract.  If there wasn't, it'd be far worse for employees with low wages, high job turnover, no benefits or safe work conditions. Even with the union, the company found a way to violate contract language and layoff more than 1500 employees just before the 2017 holidays."
bad,My experience with AT&T was not a good one sadly. I applied for the job and got an offer right away however they offered me a pay scale much higher then what I would actually be paid after accepting the position. I then started the job and began my training. I was treated so poorly by AT&T that I decided it was no longer in my interest to continue my employment there.
bad,"The chaos, the theft, the ignorance, the lazy.... this job is the worse....  ATT needs entirely new infrastructure if it wants to compete. The management is lackluster and lazy... everyone steals from each other, and top management makes too much money to care. Besides the fact management is in bed with the union, whats the point of the song and dance every morning. Forced to attend daily union meetings where they complain and whine, while you watch employees steal your inventory for the week."
bad,"Wouldn't recommend AT&T at all, very toxic work environment. Switched departments a few times hoping it would get better but in some instances it got even worse. Very cut throat."
bad,Bellsouth had been purchased by ATT and the company changed completely. Print usage was down and there simply was no way to move all the sales to digital. They could not fulfill everything we were selling.
bad,"The coworkers are typically pretty great, but management doesn't seem to be in touch with what the workforce is doing. They make decisions based on numbers and efficiency quotients often at the cost of employees and morale.You're never good at your job because no matter the efficiency level there is always ""something to improve on"". There is no gaining an understanding of your job and doing it as the expectations are constantly changing. The customer support systems were designed for efficiency of numbers not customer service or experience. Coming from a company that was customer focused and and treated employees with respect to a merger with this company was a major culture shock. Additionally being a tenured employee (12 years) amounts to very little. Union contact will get you pretty decent benefits medical, dental, vision, paid time off, etc. However, in my case cost my thousands per year in shift differentials and change in bonus structure. Not to mention the raise structure of the union contract determined I was ""above raise cap"". If you're a newer employee and not looking for a career or don't mind being management and having to take the chance of moving whenever the company determines your job is needed elsewhere, this company may work well for you. It simply was not structured well and did not provide the growth opportunities I needed to advance professionally."
bad,"We were always getting yelled at for not getting sales done or not reaching a goal. They were always on our backs. They never taught us how to do a sale. so when the higher people would come in to see how we were doing. they would want us to lie, or they would take those people that couldnt do good off the floor so they couldnt get talked to.  they only taught us how we should answer the calls. they management didnt care about us."
bad,AT&T’s mismanagement is some of the worst management I have ever seen in a company. Always placing the blame on techs and stressing out the people who work for them.
bad,"Company constantly in a  state of instability due to the never-ending cycle of mergers and layoffs due to bad decisions by leadership.   Example:  repurchasing legacy baby Bell companies was a focus of leadership, when deploying fiber optics to increase network capacity in preparation for upcoming boom in internet streaming."
bad,"I was under the impression this company was top of the line, and boy was I wrong. They pay pretty well but it's at a sacrifice, a huge one I might add. This company sucks the life out of you with no remorse. Their rules are set up to make you fear losing your job, and that's all that was preached..I wouldn't recommend working here to anyone!"
bad,"It was an ok job. I went from the Kiosk to a key opener of the store within a month. However, I think they were trying to push me out. Hire a new guy & promote him to the manager before me. I left before any of this happened"
bad,the management of this company changed several times within the few years I worked there. every new CEO wanted more from the designers for less pay. the environment became stressful to work at.
bad,"If you are a new graduate or starting your career, then AT&T is for you!  If this is not the case, AT&T has difficulty actioning out their claims for continued career development and training to those who are Sr. employees."
bad,"It has admittedly been some years since I worked here approx. 5 years, but from what I understand not much has changed. I worked there for a little over 8 years. I didn't really mind the customers as most things were out of their control. I knew too many people who were on medication for high blood pressure. depression, anxiety who were not on it prior to working there. There are high expectations placed on the reps with little regard to the effect on them. I quit went to a less demanding..but higher paying job. Most if all of the people I know who have left are much happier. I was there long before they began cutting the hrly rate so I was tenured and received pay at a higher rate. Still wasn't worth the stress lol. The benefits at least at the time that I was there were great tho! So there's your plus."
bad,We were trained to not tell customers full details and leave out important information in order to make a sale. I got to the point that I felt this job was making me become a dishonest person and that is not who I am nor who I want to be.
bad,"If managers did not recieve their monthly bonus, they would discipline technicians for it. "
bad,"AT&T is evil. We all know that, right? There is nothing I can say here that will convince anyone that AT&T is not a pseudo monopoly portion of the oligarchical conglomerate of other cell providers and ISPs who gouge their customers and feed on the souls of the innocent."
bad,Poor management overall on all sides and not sure what's next for each employee.    Advancement for someone is not really a sure thing with at&t.  Management was not people friendly.
bad,"Horrible management and  fraudulent "
bad,"Sometimes in life you hard and give it your best but if a company does not want you than it's really nothing you can do about that. Like no cell phones in class I'm adhering to it, I'm trying to focus and learn and training was filled with rehires and it was just not conducive for learning. Then when hit the floor that environment wasn't professional at all it was a nightmare yet I still focused came to work on time, and left and went to break on time. I think AT&T is really over whelmed with the responsibility they have and it shows."
bad,AT&T has released thousands and thousands of US based employees since 2005.  AT&T provides tools full of defects that are mandatory for surplus employees to use for internal job search.
bad,"Large company that does not seek to advance employees except in large hub cities such as Dallas, Atlanta, LA.  Only 3 level of obtainable management with large pay scales.  You can only get a promotional raise three times in your career. Salaries range from 60-140k.  If your salary falls in that range, there is no way to get an out of cycle merit raise.  Raises have decreased every year ro a paltry 2% last year.   They will have a hard time retaining world class talent."
bad,Heart monitor tracked that my heart rate would raise 20 bpm upon arrival and not go down until I had been home for over an hour. Constant stress!!!!!!
bad,"It was truly unbelievable how a giant bureaucracy like ATT could function at all.  This organization seems to see itself as eternal, simply falling forward under its own gigantic weight.  Every management decision seems to be a cynical attempt to lay off salaried workers and skim that ""savings"" into the Exec Level performance bonus.   "
bad,"hated working here - management was unhelpful, short breaks, angry customers, too many different systems to navigate, not enough training to prepare you for all the scenarios."
bad,"This job is very tough. It pays very well, but you have to climb telephone poles, maneuver through attics and crawl spaces. Incredibly physically demanding. You have to deal with customers who are upset and want to cuss you out. The culture is do your job perfect, don't break any rules, or your fired. This is an entry position, so you better move up fast or you will age faster than normal due to the stressful environment. You will learn a lot about networking and technology. You work by yourself, very hard to get help on any job."
bad,This company itself is not good at all to work for. The hours are demanding and so is the work. They expect the best quality but don't pay their workers accordingly. The hardest part of the job is the constant changes of rules and safety requirements of the company. They are very strict and don't forgive if you mess up......DO NOT WORK HERE!.................!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,"The work was easy but was made difficult by the ineffective managers & corporate environment. Sadly, all of the bad stereotypes for technology companies are present here. If you're lucky to land on a good team or are the correct minority you can get things done. Most workers are H1B visa holders or rejects from video game companies."
bad,"Was lead to believe when hired that there would be numerous chances for advancement.  After five years there were only 3 chances and those positions were filled before the job was posted for other employees to apply.  There is zero work life balance.  Management can will recall off days with only a 12 hour notice even with you have a vacation scheduled and paid for.  Different departments do not talk to each other in order to resolve issues.  The technician is ""at the bottom of the totem pole"" and management is very quick to remind employees of that at every chance possible.  Company has become too large and no longer cares for the employee or the customer.  They only care about the bottom line."
bad,"AT&T (Formerly DIRECTV) was a typical corporate environment that offered average salary, no career advancement, and minimal opportunities to drive change."
bad,I learned nothing from atnt. I realized just how much scams and fraud goes on behind the scenes. I would not suggest working here to anyone. Please dont apply here.
bad,"The atmosphere is great, great co workers, customers are always fun to talk to, if you been in customer services you know, not ALL customer's are friendly. Beside those, it's an enjoyable position. The only problem I have working in AT&T is the management. Would say 2 out of 8 management is good to work under."
bad,AT&T can be a great company to work for I was very successful and enjoyed most of my career. There are a lot of great individuals that work there that give it their all.
bad,"The job in itself can be pretty stressful, but also can be fun with the right attitude. Generally, the management's duty is to provide support for the Sales reps, and help them achieve their personal and store/district goals. There are some managers who do very well in this aspect, but usually there is one in every five managers that does so. The sales goals are not necessarily unrealistic, but things tend to get more difficult as you realize that your job is to sell product and quote it as you are told (not as it actually is), and you can provide no actual support without involving other parties who will rarely do what is right for the customer. In most sales jobs you are given all the information about the product, and your goals, and then you go and get it done. With AT&T, there is a no-tolerance policy when it comes to sales pitch, or giving the customer correct information. They will tell you that you HAVE to tell them something is free, even though it is clearly not, but it's advertised as FREE*."
bad,"After the acquisition of DirecTV by AT&T any sort of feeling of organization fell apart. Mass firings aren't new in a take over of this magnitude, but the company made the mistake of gutting tenured DirecTV employees that had catalogs of useful information."
bad,spring mobile management or higher ups do not have any sense of structure but at&t as a company is good. do not work for spring mobile there hiring process is terrible and they do not train there staff properly.
bad,"A typical day at work would be taking calls from customers, normally upset ones, and helping them. That was not the problem with convergys. The calls where fine, nothing someone couldn't handle. Now the metrics and goals they set for you where a different thing. You could be over 100% for 11/12 metrics but that one metric you were not hitting, you would be hounded constantly for. They expect you to be perfect, and in reality no one is perfect. They also have a very unfair metric system. Your job is  to stop people from canceling there service, but when someone dies, moves away, goes into military deployment, etc. and you have to cancel their service they still hold it against you. Not a very steady job..."
bad,The hardest part about the job is going door to door sales. besides that its a great place to work if you like commission base jobs. Great place to work.
bad,"AT&T does not hire qualified leaders to run their businesses. Franchise businesses are even worse and they need to provide more training. Also, they are shutting down several stores due to poor production."
bad,"At&t formerly known as Southwestern Bell has really changed. I understand the landscape of corporate and/ or industrial work in our country has changed. This company went from a family environment that cared about the companies customer's and it's employee's to being a machine with zero empathy. I also understand that executive management has to answer to stock holders when it comes to the bottom line that being generating revenue. It shouldn't matter when your bottom line is never in the red, but always in the green and a portion of your stockholders are your employees. It seems they have forgotten about the stakeholders/ stockholders in the seats that built the company. The company was the leader in providing services to there customers. Now they just provide line items to customers. It's a different ideology on the day to day scheme of things than it was when the company was Southwestern Bell. Oh yeah Southwestern bell acquired At&t. The human touch and feel has been taken away from the job and it didn't have to be. They are simplifying the network, so they can rid the company of the knowledgeable seasoned veterans. Americans will see in the future that this will allow for your private information to be stolen and used on a much more broader scheme. I believe a lot of Americans feel employees or ex-employees whine about things, but Americans must think and understand we shouldn't have to lose what you have earned from the pioneers to evolve to bigger and brighter future. Scrutinize the marketing and propaganda that is put in the media. If former employee's and low tenure"
bad,"IT was before att i saw alot of 20-30s lose job row I stayed for 3 yers which was unusual  finally they omitted internet dept. It was at the end of 3 yrs the time to get rid of high paid call center employes's"
bad,"Management was no help at all. Work hours and days off are not worth the pay. Get hurt, they get rid of you. They don't respect new employees and have a very high turnover rate."
bad,The structure to improve was not available worst place I have ever worked at. Management never available. Training class was basically talking about video games.
bad,Merit is meaningless...only thing that matters is their buddy.  A lot of good people got let go because they don't have 20 year friendships...terrible
bad,"Continual management turnover. Constant fear of surplus. Continual management change and shifting ideals. I was the only employee on my floor. Training was offered, however, the opportunities to implement the skills learned were often not timely."
bad,"sales leads sparse, compensation poor, overworked, severely harassed by management, can lose job at any second for any common mistake. constantly having to make up for company billing issues."
bad,"its an below average work place, very poor payment and job and work life balance was average , no job security or advancement , job cultured is very divers but very much uncultured and and unprofessional"
bad,"Worked as a sales rep for the phone book. Unfortunately the phone book has been outdated and gone away with by many business. Year after year the sales rep took beatings as companies pulled their ads out of the phone book. There was no money in it anymore. Years ago you could easily pull down $120,000"
bad,"They will pit you up against your own peers and make you feel small if you are to fail in any category of their sales metrics. You could be ranked high in one metric but it doesn't mater if your store is missing in anything that makes you or your manager look bad that month. My direct supervisor wrote in my action plan that I had to have at least 3 employees on discipline at all times or I would be on discipline. I did not believe in success by fear so I was ""laid off""  due to restructure. AT&T used to be a company I stood behind and believed in, until their corporate greed took over, and they were blind to what made their company a top choice employer. They continue to negotiate lower wages, and benefits leading to national strikes with the communication unions. AT&T is quickly becoming a national retail conglomerate that only cares about share holder earnings, and less about the employees that actually run the company."
bad,"The leadership is horrific. One of the district managers ruled like a dictator. After SpringMobile acquired Cellular World it was horrible. Pay was cut significantly, and we were very micromanaged. I don't know about prime or any other authorized retailers but never work for spring mobile. The leadership you never actually tell us how we were getting paid."
bad,"- Wrong info given on benefits and pay"
bad,"Does not value employees, worked there for 5 years felt undervalued.  Management seems to want to fire everybody and is playing a constant game of gotcha."
bad,"this job was not what I expected, the management as horrible and everyone at my job was stealing from one another. I wouldn't recommend this job for anyone"
bad,It seemed like everybody in management was real stiff and rude. And the S.F.Giant's staff were rude as well. They were way to ticky tacky with everything. It seemed like you were gonna pass out from everyone being so stuffy and stiff.
bad,"You start at 8am and never know what time they will let you go home as a premises technician. It could be 7 hours later or 12 hours later. If you have family plans that you don't want to request the day off for, you may never make it."
bad,"We had a 5 week training class and that was the best part of the job. Our instructor was amazing and we all became super close. Once we went on the floor and started taking live calls, the ""help"" never came around and weren't any ""help"" at all."
bad,typical day is working from 10am-8pm with a one hour lunch. constantly micro managed even if you are a top performer. They do a very good job at increasing work duties and responsibilities while simultaneously lowering wages. They are only happy to please stockholders and if you don't like it they will show you the door. great sales experience but not somewhere you want to be long term.
bad,a typical day at work here is nothing short of a struggle... the policies of one department typically does not work well with policies of another which in many cases leaves the client with a bad taste in there mouth at best if not without service
bad,"-High pressure"
bad,"If your expertise at the moment happens to be in information science, network design, or microwave device design, you should be able to find a job. Otherwise, be prepared to get retrained, a lot."
bad,"AT&T started out as a good place to work, it was retail sales management so you're scheduled 40 hours but probably put in between 45 to 50 with a spike every so often. However, every year after 2008 the hours expected weekly grew, I did not choose the word expected likely, because it was not a suggestion it was an expectation. I did not choose the word expected likely, because it was not a suggestion it was an expectation. By the time I left AT&T the minimum I was puttin in weekly was 70 hours and it still wasn't enough to complete the tasks expected at the store level. Upper management stripped away the assistant manager positions, took away back office staff and placed everything in the hands of the sales managers, meanwhile compensation grew at  one and a half percent for the bulk of management staff. This was explained that it was not because it's all the company could afford but because that was keeping in line with the economy and our competition as far as increases were concerned. Literally they use the excuse it's what the other guys are doing so we will too.  Literally they use the excuse it's what the other guys are doing so we will too. When a sales manager attains top 1% of the company (whic I did, earning their Summit award) and get a 2% raise for it there's a problem with culture. The raise was an insult and a demotivated. In my opinion AT&T did not value it's people, the people existed for the company, it was not a symbiotic relationship it was one direction. It built walls in families, I watch people lose marriages, quality time with their children, all the things"
bad,Ever since taking over DTV things have gone down the hill in a hurry. every thing that was good about DTV is now gone. they have outsourced all call centers. cut employee pay in half and now have changed work days so that you have split days off.
bad,"Great and first but becomes tedious, work life balance is terrible. Commission goes down while cost of benefits rises."
bad,"I took retention calls, which were people who were already upset. Tried to save the customer by offering promos, but customers were so frustrated that it was hard to work with them."
bad,"Always ""downsizing"".  Constantly laying off good, seasoned Management employees in favor of inexperienced, less expensive labor or contractors.  Not employee friendly."
bad,"I worked for one of their call centers and it was one of the worst jobs I've ever had.  They have ZERO work/life balance and couldn't care less about family obligations, the need for time off, or illness.  You spend your entire day hating life while there, being micro-managed on every single thing you do.  The only reason I give them 2 stars is because the pay is decent for our area, but it takes years of torment to reach a livable wage."
bad,Potential earnings good but difficult to keep up with product and technology changes. Constant change to goals and compensation structure. Customers a challenge but generally appreciative of efforts to assist them. Union work environment with combative management.
bad,"With 10 years at DIRECTV, I'd always had great managers, good pay, excellent benefits and perks. People were cared about and bad leadership was quickly remove, in my experience."
bad,"AT&T sells a helluva product that I believe in before I worked there and still do.  This place is ever changing and they expect you to be a Jack of all trades and a master of the one they hired you for.  That being said bad customer service happens because they require you to ""play it where it lands"" and can get customers into trouble when somebody is unable to correctly determine a course of action for a customer."
bad,Consistently asks employees to give false information to customers on plan costs in order to switch customers off grandfathered plans.
bad,"If you don't know anybody most likely you wont get hired. In order for you to move up the ladder you must be able to rub elbows with the right regionals and district managers. it don't pay to put time and effort and skill into a company that wont even help a pregnant employee get a chair, as its against company policy to have chairs on the floor!"
bad,"this requires 20 words or more to describe, my time there, but that will do no good before at&t took over Directv was one of the best places to work for, they care about their employees and would go above and beyond to work with your schedule, if they hired you and you made it through training you were family. period. and that's how they treated you,  if you did mission work that was fine show proof, and your job was there when you came home, if you had children and need schedule changes, no prob we will do reduced schedule and you can come in late so the little tyke is taken care of, Directv cared. At&t took over and that stopped, all of it, mission work? good luck you can reapply when you get back, kids? ""we understand good luck at your next job"" there was little or nothing bad about directv, i enjoyed my job, under At&t i felt almost like i was being attacked"
bad,"AT&T recently bought out my company DirecTV. They changed EVERYTHING and did not give any notice. All the managers started digging up things on people from years back looking for reasons to get rid of people. They changed the attendace policy as well as the hours. They changed the metrics we had to hit, they came in and it felt like a complete take over. I loved working for DTV before they were bought out. Employee incentives stoped, at one point an At&t rep actually told us to drop out of school and take online courses since the hours were changing. I couldnt believe that."
bad,Tech skills did not improve as job duties were mainly on troubleshooting poor and not competitive products.  Never able to pick the desired work schedule due to lower seniority in the company.
bad,"Did the same thing over and over everyday, troubleshot poor products that are not competitive, tech skills did not improve after working there for over 10 years."
bad,no comment I wish not to comment on this company for personal and professional reasons. I am also not aware of how this comment will affect me.
bad,"no opportunities for advancement.... nothing dead end job, nothing but lies and disappointments... you work more than what your paid for and it just a bad decision to work at this place."
bad,company vehicle and gas card but had to work 6 days a week and averaged 14 hours a day with no overtime as you were paid by the job not hour
bad,The company I worked for was a privately owned AT&T branch and was not very good. The managers did not care about the well being of their employees nor did they care about advancement opportunities. We were there to do a job and if we did not do it they would throw us out like the trash.
bad,"Very poor management. New hires (technicians) don't last even 6 months, managers are being fired.  I believe the company's goals are to contract all labor out in a few years."
bad,"This was the best paying call center job that I have ever have.  I was able to get a raise 3 times in a month in the last year."
bad,"the type of job is awesome in my opinion. i loved it. the company was a nightmare. morale is extremely low, wages are not high enough to deal with the constant ""abuse"". incentives are childish (stale candy and chips for good work), everyday all day all you hear is how you can and will get fired. many requirements and policies imposed on reps are unrealistic, and the job is made harder by forcing the rep to script unnecessary things causing customers even more frustration. its not a place i would recommend if you are looking for a great place to work. but if you just need a job go for it!"
bad,"ATT University continues to show a high turnover and lack of consistency in management. Designers have had much of their power wrestled away from them. The level of control has been neutered. Instructional Designers are now ""copy editors,"" that transcribe information from the Project Managers and Clients."
bad,"Everyday is a daily struggle where management tries to get you to quit your job. If they pinpoint you and don't like you for whatever reason they make it their goal to pressure you into quitting. Constant coachings for everyone, consistently telling everyone they are doing a bad job. It creates a super hostile environment. The coworker environment becomes bad because everyone is in such competition to prove to management they need their job they everyone fights over sales a bickers over everything. "
bad,"Sell Sell Sell or you're fired i worked at one store for a year in a half and say over 20 reps quit or get fired leaving only 4 people to run the entire store and the managers did not try to hire someone they took their time because management was never there there they were always on ""important lunches"" or vacation. The customer is always right and your managers never have your back i quit and its the smartest thing i ever did i wouldnt recommend this company to my worst of enemies,"
bad,"Sucks to work for ATT, after you bust your behind off to meet and exceed the required quota, they fired me just cause a stupid FB post that a low life ex coworker call me for.. great benefits and pay, horrible people that don't care to mess w others work and management sucks!"
bad,This company started off as a good place to work. But as time went on and the company began to change how they dealt with their customers and employees it became a very cold place to work.
bad,"Your typical day will consist of long hours as well as working over 9 days straight.  Some of the hardest parts of the job is the upper management who have no clue about what's going on.  There's no work/life balance.  By the time you receive a day off, you will be resting."
bad,Horrible place to work and no models to follow because of the unprofessionalism.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone and especially when they deduct money from your check do a company error
bad,The workload that At&t forces on Sales Consultants is insulting considering the at risk commission. I was with company for 5 years and made more money in years 1 and 2 selling half the products. I was a top 5 seller in the state of hawaii and my pay was consistent but my workload doubled over years 3-4. Year 5 i decided to make the transition to management and lost money. Overall the benefits are good but pay structure is terrible. I would never recommend any friends or family to work at at&t
bad,"Pay and benefits were good for a while. Everything else is awful. Now they are reducing compensation and increasing funny business in regards to commission payments. No support to help keep customers satisfied, dwindling support for administrative  and sales duties, increasing quotas... All lead to virtually no work / life balance if you want to stay on top of things."
bad,"I enjoyed my time employed at dynamex. lots of experience gained during my 3 years. forklift experience, Inventory, floor leader, dispatching, loading and unloading trucks, and skill palletizing. no benefits but they did help me build a resume with the many positions they allowed me to experience."
bad,Absolutely no life/work balance if you are in management. You will be required to carry a company cell phone and lap top everyday-no real off days. You are obligated to take all calls/texts on  your off days and even stop what you are doing and power up your lap top unless you are on vacation.
bad,"A typical day of work consists on installing and maintaining subpar equipment on a dated infrastructure while being  held to unnecessarily high standards created by advisors and managers who have never done the job.  The first level managers, many who have no idea of the roadblocks we face in the field (who, to be honest, were hired because they new the 2nd level personally) are in charge of the Premise technicians.  They will cheat and engage in unethical behavior in order to make these unreachable numbers (including intentionally misleading, overcharging, and blatantly lying to customers) so as to try and gain an advantage and move up the corporate ladder.  The higher-up executives either don't know about this, or don't care, because nothing has been done about it for the several years I have worked there.  This is a typical day of a premise technician; there is very little reward, and the stress of the day-to-day aspects outweigh the pros."
bad,"AT&T is interested in money and how quickly they can get it and how hard can they squeeze an employee to get it. "
bad,"This was a terrible experience, co workers were nice but area managers and business managers were all douche bags. The wanted you to fear them instead of build a strong relationship...they were all rude"
bad,"The people, including management, make this a fun place to work.  However, AT&T (at least as far as their call centers are concerned) is a horrible place to work and it actually has little to do with what you would expect, the customers.  It has more to do with their lack of quick response to their employee's concerns, ridiculous policies and procedures and ineffecient metrics that effect promotions and bonuses."
bad,"A typical day was taking inbound calls from customer having issue with their directv service.  You have to troubleshoot with customer, many times they were frustrated and upset. yelling and cursing  before you can even send out a tech and you had to follow a script it was just time consuming and time wasted. I would not recommend working for directv. I think I would have rather be a techican and hang on poles and on top of houses."
bad,Very disappointed. Was recruited from Southern Company for my skills and experience and yet not able to do the job I was hired for. Intense internal rivalries make work environment hostile. Left due to vast difference in how the work should get done
bad,"A typical day at work would require a sufficient amount of customer service.  At AT&T, I learned that there are many different types of customers and learned how to take care of every single one of them.  My coworkers are a good form of support but my manager on the other hand, is very disrespectful. However, I do enjoy working for AT&T when it gets busy and when we have productivity to reach. There is really no difficulty in this job, besides the language barrier."
bad,"Upper management is constantly eating into people's pay and benefits."
bad,"Extremely company oriented! Not much in the way of employee appreciation, as far as what is expected from the employee. Required to work in all kinds of environmental situations, such as weather, confined space, etc and employee is held to the corporate beliefs with no regard to safety or well-being. Circumstances require employee to work in un-safe environments, with regard to the employees safety, and health, with absolutely no regard for their well being."
bad,"The company pays well,  although it refuses to work with employees seeking to better themselves. promotions are rare.  Seniority based system with a decent wage, but very stagnant."
bad,Move up quickly or get stuck. Stay positive or be negative and maintain professionalism. That is all I have to say... good luck!
bad,"AT&T is a company in the throes of death. Like some big behemoth going through spasms of confusion and mismanagement."
bad,"An awful, impersonal company to work for. Management doesn't care about employees. Pay has been steadily declining every year."
bad,"Local management was great but central management wasn't as supportive. Loyalty didn't count for much as many over qualified/under paid resources were laid off even they managed to stick around during hard times."
bad,AT&T sold my division to cerberus capital and the job went downhill fast
bad,"A typical day with Prime Communications is that of frustration. Prime Communications is a third-party retailer for AT&T Wireless and when you have any questions about the products and services that you are required to sell, you usually have to call somebody outside of Prime Communications to get an answer. When you do have questions that Prime Communications can answer you get the run-around and have to wait anywhere from next day to a week for an answer when you need that answer within hours if you ever even get the answer. You have a base hourly pay and you also make commission off of what you sell, but if they feel like they don't have have to pay you, then they won't. When they don't pay out commissions it is a huge fight and waiting game to get what you worked for. There is plenty of room for advancement within the company because of the high turnover rate. Prime Communications is constantly firing employees. One day you could be the top seller within the company or the most experienced manager and the next your job is on the line or you are being fired with no proof as to why you are being fired. If you are looking for a career with AT&T, then Prime Communications is a great stepping stone into the business. However, I would not recommend Prime Communications as a long term career option. Start there, then get out and go to AT&T Corporate."
bad,To many loop holes to making money. Every month there is a different incentive.
bad,"The senior leadership at at&t expect management to have no personal life and dedicate their all to the company. You are not rewarded for hard work, and the merit increases are laughable at best. "
bad,This was a great company to make money of you are really active and push at it. Management did not help the employees learn and grow.
bad,"The position was advertised as a customer service position, but soon as I got to training the only thing that was talked about was sales. Now that I've been working for the company for a couple months, it seems like me and many others were mislead when it comes to the job functions of the customer service position."
bad,The particular department I worked in didn't have a very good culture. Most people are looking to leave. Your job is constantly being threatened.  Honestly glad to be out of the place.  I was actually told that if you have to skip your child's birthday party to get something done for the company then oh well.
bad,AT&T Has a lot of positives and negatives first work schedule is near impossible to plan life around. Schedules are on a shift bid seniority. A lot of people that have been around for a few years take best shifts leaving nothing but 12-9 or 11-8 shifts not very family friendly. There is also a strict point policy in place that makes needing to attend to family life almost impossible very hard to attend to a sick child/ child birth ect. Secondly there are no opportunity for advancement and the spots that do come open are usually give to the employee that can brown nose the best. At the time of leaving AT&T all sales incentives had been taken away and the only way to get any type of incentive is to have customers log in to the AT&T app for unneeded reasons. AT&T hit second with JD Powers in customer care for listening and assisting the customer and sadly this mentality has been lost to forcing reps to pester customers to log in.  Overall there are some great people that worked at AT&T and that made the stress of the job easier but the business side of AT&T has made this job overly stressful. I wouldn't recommend AT&T Customer Care call center just due to the insane stats that need to be met.
bad,The upper management is awful. Most are uneducated and lack leadership skills. They honestly have managers who didn't graduate high school.
bad,"call center on calls all day"
bad,No room for advancement. Upper management always found ways to make sure you didn't get paid bonuses
bad,AT&T does not care about its employees or customers.  Its all about numbers.  Poor Management overall.  Was SO much better when it was BellSouth
bad,little respect for employees overworked and underpaid worked almost 7 days a week.
bad,"Typical day consisted of taking calls that last about 3-4 minutes each. No customer contact, reviewing test and determining if technicians were done with their current jobs."
bad,I had a great time working with my peers but had a really hard time with managment.  They did not give any guidence and very hard to work with.
bad,this company does not take into consideration that realistic things happen in life such as sickness rather it be the employee or their immediate family member. they under pay their employees. give their employee five sick days that are paid but not excused.
bad,I Would have to say I loved talking to the customers and I enjoyed the people I worked with but the whole system was crumbling.
bad,"Listen to customer call details to ensure accurate resolution in a timely manner. Don't take what irate customers say personally, they just want their problem resolved."
bad,"Management is a clique of bullys"
bad,"Management was just as gossipy and dramatic as the employees. My team leader, literally bullied me. Called me horrible nick-names when she thought I wasnt listening and gossiped with other employees about me as well as other members of management... seriously! How old are you?"
bad,"typical day was LONG looking on average about a 10- 12 hour shift open to close so it became very tiresome and definitely no work life balance. I learned how to control my temper and hide my emotions because at&t customers tend to be spoiled and think that a sales representative can move mountains. my co workers were some of the best people ive met but keep an eye out usually the nicest person to you is watching your every move and is waiting for you to mess up. hardest part of the job was dealing with an inefficient manager who was hired solely because she had the degree and none of the experience which mad it very difficult to seek guidance from someone who knew absolutely nothing and also did not want to do her job. quotas were a major part of the job as well. If you did not meet your quota as intended you would no longer remain apart of the company which makes you a very aggressive person and can even affect your morals because you find yourself selling an iphone to an 85yr old woman when all she needs is a flip phone. So long story short money is great but at price. no work life balance and constantly looking over your shoulder if these work for you go right ahead.I also forgot to mention that calling off and even dreaming about being sick was not an option. I had strept throat, the flu, and an ear infection at the same time and I was still at work because of their horrible point system. you have amazing benefits but don't ever think you will be able to go to the dr because you always have to work. at&t also  does not provide sick or personal time instead you have 7 points"
bad,This turned into working for Cingular Wireless when they bought out AT&T. Not a good company to work for.
bad,"AT&T | Global Solutions is an authorized retailer of AT&T products and services. They are based out of the Atlanta, GA area and are owned by Universal Systems Inc. They have a history of bending the rules to yield higher commissions and expect their employees to follow suit or get left behind. When I worked for them they only looked out for themselves and had little care for their customers. "
bad,"AT&T doesn't care about you or your life. There is no way to be able to maintain a personal life, go to night school, spend time with your kids or anything at this job. AT&T works you until you drop, and watches everything you do, asking you why you didn't do it fast enough or good enough. I have never worked a ""union"" job for a company that seems to view it's employees as such a burden, not an asset."
bad,"Come in on time can not be a minute late and start loading the trailer."
bad,they had issues with managment and its just high turn over bad pay
bad,"Working 10+ hours each day and doing this all while standing. You must be aggressive to meet the monthly goals. My store was very micromanaged by direct store manager as well as upper management, which made for a very stressful job, never knew from one day to the next if I was going to be on discipline. I worked too many hours during the week (8:30 am-7:30pm) and every weekend which took time away from my family."
bad,AT&T is an environment that is not productive to their customer service reps.  They have metrics that are established to create a stressful environment and the management is not supportive.
bad,Overall a decent place to work. However a rough management and culture. I would recommend working elsewhere if you can. In the last few years they have reduced pay and benes and increased quotas and job scope.
bad,"Sales! Personality is a must. AT&T has slow days and busy days especially when a new phone would launch. It was required to be knowledgeable of the services, devices and the ability to identify customer needs "
bad,"Helping the customer with their account maintenance. I also assist the customer will billing inquiries. Multi tasking using the various systems to ensure a resolution for the customer, while maintaing a positive attitude and polite tone especially when receiving opposition from the customer. Promoting the different services that the company offers the customer, Educating the customer on the self service options that are available to them. Educating the customer on using and navigating our website if they want to monitor their accounts.The hardest part of the job is there isn't any consistancy with the information between upper managment and customer service agents. The most enjoyable part for me is the satisfaction that I am helping a customer resolve an issue that they wouldn't know how to resolve on their own."
bad,"The hours varied, at times mandatory overtime was implemented within minutes of shift end, and time and consideration was not always given to make adjustments for personal life (daycare on the day of) when the overtime was mandated. "
bad,in charge of approving or declining usage of cell phone abroad.  responsible for making sure customer had best phone plan and phone that would work abroad.
bad,Very political! You would have to brown-nose your managers.
bad,"It was very stressful to work for At&t. They were TOO strict on attendance not only by missing a day, but by being late up to a couple of seconds from break. Management did not know what they were doing and I decided to move along and resign."
bad,"Co-workers are (mostly) very helpfull. Each task (installations and repairs) are timed with no regard to how the customer wants the job done, or has been ""promised"" by Sales and Tech Support (i.e., the work will be ""free"", even if it is a billable expense or ""it will only need a couple of wires re-routed"", even if it needs the whole house re-wired). This leads to difficult customer relations on the job site. Outside work has to be done, regardless of weather conditions. A great deal of the ""inside"" work is done under (crawlspaces) or over (attics) the house in heat and cold."
bad,"This is a very hard place to find job security, clear direction and a culture that values employees."
bad,"The prevailing management mentality is that they own you, mind, body and soul."
bad,"I worked for AT&T for over 2 years as a Residential Sales Consultant, although I have a Bachelors and Masters degree it seems as of the company doesn't open opportunity for growth for you to move up and pretty much everything is all about politics. You are emotionally and mentally abused by disgruntled customers because of binding policies that the company sets in order to make them pay a lot of money for services and products. There are ever changing rules and goals which prevent you from getting your bonus, with little notice. If you want to work for a company that you have to walk on egg shells everyday, due to you can get wrote up or fired for anything....apply at AT&T!"
bad,"This job is commision base as well as Salary, The stressful thing about this job is try to me quota. This company have a three strike system so you go to work on pin and needles. The hardest thing about this job is meeting quota."
bad,"the company as a whole is good, it takes some getting used to, expect to be put to the breaking point daily and knowing that the hours will not be there when you need them to be."
bad,I have found the the company benefits are standard and it all depends on the manager or business unit you work for.
bad,its ok the benifits are good management could be better attendance policy is the worse
bad,Its an ok company to work for. Pretty good pay and bonuses. No job security!!! But you do get free Directv!
bad,"sentarse hacer las llamadas. aprendi a trabajar bajo presion, la direccion era buena pero un supervisor sin ningun tipo de consideracion, los compañeros muy bien solo que todos al final se fueron. la manera de dirigirse y pedir las cosas, lo que mas me gustaba era al principio la relacion con los compañeros"
bad,We had manager's but they were never there so we basically ran the store ourselves. They reduced the pay eventually and also increased the company's quota
bad,"union based employer , sales enviroment and also incentives."
bad,co workers were great as were the customers we collected from
bad,"At&t Uverse is a company that lacks in quite a few key skills. Number 1 being management. I say this because when you work somewhere and rely on your sup's approval for quite a few things, yet he does not answer his phone. That can make the job more than difficult. Number 2. The amount of extra responsibilities that the company requires of you is very overwhelming. When you are required to hold your quality to the same standard as your production there is a conflict in the 2 that are blatantly obvious. Quality is how well/neat your work is. Where as production is how quickly you can get this work done. They require your quality to be at a rate of 3% or lower ( and that is per jobs completed). They also require you to have a productivity rating of 104% or higher. Basically that means you have to be more than perfect to mkeep from being on the (hot seat). Now i would have to say that At&t has a very nice product in Uverse. The service is unlike any i have ever seen. They just need to work out the major manager employee kinks and i think all will be fine."
bad,DIRECTV call centers are a difficult place to work. They have strict guidelines and rules you must follow or you are on a path out the door. They are management heavy and don't allow for upward mobility unless you are in their click. I compare working at DIRECTV like going back to high school. Yuck...
bad,"When I started at this company in 1989, it was a great small local phone company which was brought out by Southwestern Bell, then became ATT. The values for its employees and customers were at the ver top of the latter. Once it became the mega company that it is today, it started caring less and less for the customer and definitely less for its Management employee. I have learned that Mega company such as ATT is all about making sure the investors get all the money and most Management employee have to work like slaves to get a small increase in pay for doing most time triple work. Most of the co-worker I have had the pleasure of knowing/working with were great. We worked together to make sure our deparment ran smoothly as possible. The hardest part of the job was that you were most times required to work long extra hours for no additional pay. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I the company offered great incentatives and awarded the best with money and trips. During my last year as a Management employee, I found out that I no longer had a job when I came back from being on vacation and had received a Certified Package stating they were getting rid of my job. Which in fact they didn't, because the work was distributed to others in the department."
bad,"Starting out with this company was wonderful, customer service was our profession and we were allowed to actually give our customers good service but as I worked there the values of the company seemed to change to leave the customers hanging. Any issue the customers had was deemed as their own fault."
bad,Keep to yourself and make the sales quota. All Directv cares about are sales.
bad,"This job was fun and horrible at times. This is a phone based job where you sit at a computer and answer the phone. I enjoyed helping people. I did not enjoy not being able to help customers due to the emphasis on sales. Management could not keep up with the constant changes and seemed to be there more for themselves than for their team. I learned to be patient and that I could create the outcome of any circumstance or situation, by my attitude and demeanor."
bad,"Don't like working for this company at all, and the reason for that is because of the way this company is ran. Nobody is ever on the same page. I'm actually surprised that this company has been running for this long. This company would be in really big trouble if it wasn't for Apple."
bad,"There are a lot of attractive qualities that might intrigue you to work for this company but you'll be sorry once you are here. It is a fear based environment where the managers and directors will literally threaten you with termination if you don't deliver unreasonable results (you will be working with a lot of third party vendors and if they have issues it somehow becomes your fault for not harassing them enough to get their systems fixed.) As a former employee of this company I have experienced working with some of the most unprofessional managers I've ever met in my life only to find out that the directors that they report to were even worse. Expect a lot of foul language, anger management issues, departments that are all one gender or race, and vice presidents who don't care about the staff at all, only the bottom line."
bad,"This job was decent to work for, but the main concern I felt I dealt with on a regular basis was work/life balance. There wasn't any balance for employees."
bad,"Not the most challenging place to work and grow the skills. The strategy does not enable the team members to grow and think outside the box."
bad,"Work life balance is really poor, the benefits are good, management is poor and do not lead, very high turn over rate for employees, union is disappearing"
bad,"They want you out there from 10am-9pm every day except Sunday but they won’t pay you until you are on your own. They want you knocking on people’s doors after hours, after dark, and even after the customer has said no. They’re pulling a gun on you? Still pitch your sale."
bad,Found it difficult to keep work life balance in place. Management was somewhat supportive. Working on newest technology was a struggle. Getting clear direction was a challenge. Projects would start and abruptly stop based on direction from executive leadership.
bad,"No work/life balance, never know what time you're getting off work. Job isn't secured. No advancement, no respect. Don't expect anything else but the money which you're killing yourself for."
bad,"Very good pay. But expect to sell your soul to this job. Very micromanaged, has no leniency when it comes to emergencies and you will not be recognized for anything that you do - only criticized. Your job will be threatened weekly for things that are completely out of your control - which managers would never understand because they get to show up whenever they want to and sit in the back basically refusing to help their employees or their customers  Your life could be in danger due to physical or mental health and they would much rather fire you than give you the time you need to heal  Oh, and I can’t forget that they protect employees who steal from the company (with proof) and sexually harass other coworkers just because they “preform well.” (speaking from experience). This company has a lot of great benefits and good pay but the expectations, job threats, and management as well as HR is all complete and utter BS."
bad,"Not the best place to work, but it's work. So you just want me to fill in as much info as I have regardless if it's of any value.  You just want to see words"
bad,Management leaves open promises when hitting sales goal. They say they are flexible with your schedule but they are not. Not a good experience. Play favorites. Not recommended.
bad,"AT&T call center is a tough place to work. From my experience they don't care about their customers and care even less about their employees. The turnover rate is high here. Within my first year of working there, a little over a 1/3 of the employees who were hired were fired or have quit. It is a mentally exhausting job. Part of that is due to how much they company micromanages. Good parts about the job is it includes three small raises in a year until you reach a cap of $22 dollars an hour, which can a minimum of 7 years to reach.  Two 15 minute breaks are included along with an hour or 45 unpaid lunch. They have added a pool table and ping pong table for use on breaks. There is also an entertainment room to use."
bad,"I was there for 21 years and  my manager is stupid and a liver also buys unnecessary equipment from company budget , supervisors are ignorant PERIOD ! Netwok Service division ."
bad,This company is sale sale sale. That is it. I worked in Business Care for 9 years and the company turned into a place I hated to be so I left. You don't have time to service the customer because you have to shove accessories and upgrades down their throat and dont forget DirecTV.  The pay and benefits are really average for the area they used to be better. This is a big company that just wants stats out of you.
bad,Everything was great here besides upper management. I feel as a whole a manger can bring down the whole building with it and when people lack certain qualities of empathy remorse or compassion
bad,"This is an Ok company to work for, it really pushes employees sometimes Making it to stressful. Lots of room for bonus but doesn’t give proper tools to advance yourself"
bad,"As with all work environments, there is room for improvement.  I personally had a great manager in Vernon Mullins however, he was an abnormality.  Great compensation."
bad,Cell phones aren't that important to the company. The only thing that gets pushed is DirectV sales. Doing upgrades only gets you $3 per. That doesn't do much to drive sales reps to maintain the customer base.
bad,Was great under directv at&t changed so much that it was no longer where i wanted to work as i was very stressed by changes that were out of my control and in a negative way.
bad,"Upper management has a lack of business direction. Company constantly takes over smaller compiles, increasing debt which results in a constant lay-off cycle. Some lower management are decent people, but most of them are scared they are in the next lay-off cycle , constantly stressing metrics that are beyond the control of technicians. Technicians are left to clean up customer service issues caused by sales and poor technical support."
bad,"Poor management, no chance to advance, no job security. As a premise technician you are given a list of jobs to complete daily. You are expected to complete each job on your own with little to no support. You are rated based on completions, time to complete, customer surveys. Training is not provided as needed. If truck breaks down, or anything else goes wrong, it counts against your job performance. It is a ""union"" job but the CWA local 6360 is pretty much worthless."
bad,"I worked here for a year and it was just awful. I mean the pay is amazing but the overall job is really really awful. There are SO many 'fine lines' and you are expected to not cross them but also you are supposed to advocate for your person on the line. There is so much change (and I don't mind change) but there is so much of it so fast and so often that I just got to a point where I had no idea how to do my job. The ""up"" trainings are garbage. They read to you what is on a power point have you play a couple games on a computer to test your knowledge and then tell you to have at it. To say I didn't leave there almost every day beyond stressed out would be a complete understatement. Now if you want a good paying job with awful managers and mandatory overtime with no notice, this is the place for you."
bad,"Mandatory OT over indefinite time periods. "
bad,It seems that everything AT&T does is in an effort to eliminate employees. They will sacrifice customer service to cut jobs. The company executives continue to waste money expanding away from the core business services that have made AT&T a major player in US business for over 100 years.
bad,"At first the job made you seem like it was easy to move up and that you were supported. NOT AT ALL!! Management was incompetent of their own jobs, was not at all considered to move up to being barely floor support-even though im well qualified- and management continuously questions your actions even though they are totally justifiable. I started out as retention and then 5 months into my job they changed us to being just customer service WITHOUT TELLING ITS EMPLOYEES. Reason: we were giving out too many adjustments (THAT WERE TOTALLY JUSTIFIABLE). They are completely unorganized, and you are just a number to them. The customers are absolutely horrible, and the management always took the customers side, even if the customer was completely irrational! The money is not worth the stress at all !!"
bad,I worked for At&t for a year or so. I was there at the time they were going through the Direct Tv and At&t merger. They did not take care of the technicians. We were under paid and over worked.
bad,"Being a premise tech is hard work but impossible if you don't have the right leadership behind you. The reason I left ATT was because of management. If you don't play the favoritism game with the managers, they will try everything to get you out the door. x2 if you're a minority."
bad,"If you want to work odd hours on call give up your life and family then this is a good fit for you you will work from sun up to sun down some days more so than not. As you move up in the company the worse it gets. Remember as an installer, all your customers love you as you move up the more customers hate you"
bad,"All call centers are not the same - this is one of the worst except they have great benefits and pay well.  Most everyone will be terminated within one year - smallest infractions.  PS - Not a disgruntled employee, just how it is."
bad,"At first, working for AT&T was great. Great money to be made. Now, the company adds so much pressure to sell at all cost. There is no work life balance for managers and managers have to do EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING."
bad,"Micro Managed daily, poor field management. No advancement. Poor work life balance. No support from company in field.Constant abuse. Unset hours of work."
bad,I thought the job was going to be exciting and a great change for my life. Once I finally got out on to the floor I found that everything was quite different. Unfair expectations and the sense that my employment was never secure led me to only working for them for one year. I would not recommend anyone to work for them.
bad,The job isnt that bad but the biggest opstacle is mangment and upper mangment.. your treated more like a disposable work horse rather than a person.. unrealistic goals but managment seems to forget what its like to sell. They try to force you to mislead customers then your in trouble when managments instructions backfires..
bad,"Culture - Toxic, backbiting, every man for himself. And blame someone else if you didn’t hit your target. Best of luck, I’m glad I got out when I did. Oh and forget about your last commission check/ "
bad,The Management is ill trained and rude. It is composed of people that were great Rep but dont mean great in Management. The systems are slow and always not working correctly. The training is outdated and not sustain by research but theories of how things should be. The management talks about how terrible the customers are and about the Reps in private chat groups. People wear PJs to work. The customer service provide is told to lie to make the customer feel good so can get a good survey instead of really resolve the customer issue so dont call back. The call routing system transfer calls to the wrong departments. The app never is working correctly. The location is outdated that is not clean.
bad,"Ive worked here for around 9 months. My manager is the worst. He leaves the store constantly while still clocked in. They take sales from each other all the time. Everything is very strict now. Its so bad working there that im taking the time to do this review. Im not getting any sort of maternity leave. "
bad,"The worst management team ever. Management changes every couple of months . Your job is always in jeopardy if you have bad month. The schedule is ridiculous, You have to work every weekend and work nights for at least 2 or 3 years to get an opening shift but that's not a guarantee. Stay away"
bad,"some managers are good others are not. a director interviewed me and said that I needed an education and I graduated from college which said to me that he wasn't interested at all. needless to say, those who were hired some have no degrees. racism still exists"
bad,"It was a awful place that didn't care about it's employee's, you were just a body to fill a chair. The management was awful! They rejected my FMLA after having a Dr's note on my post-patrum after having a baby."
bad,"AT&T likes to market itself as caring to both customers and employees, however the company's actual practices often go against the very company goals they claim to be aiming for."
bad,"If you enjoy looking over your shoulder waiting for the axe to fall, or being at the mercy of bean counters this is the job for you. Unrealistic and unachevable goals dominate the landscape."
bad,The money does not mean anything. Plus I have heard they have reduced the commissions you can earn greatly so now its really not worth it. No money and no leadership.
bad,It’s a UNION trash hole. EVERYTHING is seniority based. Can’t fire employees so in your first 5 years expect to work every night and weekend. While the garbage get the best shifts. It’s the reason good employees keep leaving. Direct management is terrible as well. I don’t suggest it unless you need a job and will leave after 6 months. All the customer service reps are now outsourced so customers can’t understand them and they also aren’t QAd to meet ethical standards. Your days will consist of people calling in and either having lines added to account for commission sake or outright lied too. Customers can only call to cancel. Yet they will hang up on you so you can’t cancel or be told we can’t cancel today our system is down. It should be investigated throughly.
bad,Good pay and benefits but not worth it. Terrible management. Worst management of any company I have worked. Nothing they do makes any sense. Managers use safety as a weapon. They treat write ups like trophies for management. No home life. Forced 6 day work weeks. Care nothing for customers. They’re only concern are metrics.
bad,"I've been in the DirecTV side of at&t prior to the buy out. Now I make 20k less than I did 5 years ago."
bad,Not sure what else you need me to write over here. Not very happy with AT&T as they replace its employees like a bag of tea. No regard for folks who have been productive for the company.
bad,"Benefits are great - Health, AT&T Services, Retirement."
bad,"Advancement not merit based and good performance is not recognized. Bad culture. Good ole' boy atmosphere where advancement and preferential treatment given to whoever got drunk with mid-management most recently. Good latitude to make your own schedule as long as you are productive. Mid-level management are often un-educated and make risky, poorly planned changes that often lead to failure, with little oversight by upper management. Job security is non-existent, though they say they try to keep people from being laid off by moving them around...I did not see that at all."
bad,"The job is easy, fun, and there is always something new to learn. Managers are not entirely necessary and are eager to discipline to justify their own positions."
bad,AT&T was not the company for me. Hours were outrageous and their was no work life balance. Just wasn't the company I thought it portrays itself to be.
bad,"I do not recommend working at AT&T. They pay well but you sacrifice work life balance, and if your lucky that is all. It is a very toxic culture and I don’t recommend it to anyone."
bad,"Lots of politics.  Promotions are based on bureaucracies of the current regime.  However, the current ARSM team does not seem to be going anywhere.  With that said, it's a ""dog eat dog world.""  That's probably all that needs to be said."
bad,"The AT&T brand is well known, but the management is disappointing, particularly for those in sales.  It's trial by fire and you will get burned. They hire a ton of sales people, burn them out, suck the life out of them, terminate them and then on to the next batch.  You are just expected to know how to use tools/software with no real training or support. You are asked after the fact...why didn't you use a certain tool to gain business.  How would you know if no one tells you it's an option? Managers are always in a panic and all over the place regarding goals and team policies.  Feel like we are losing quality sales members because of the lack of real training, transparency and courtesy.  Hope to move on soon...the stress is too much!"
bad,They only care about the company and not the employee's. It was a very hard place to make the company happy and the customer too.  They wanted you to sell no matter what.  You were to sell internet to old ladies with no computers so their grandkids would come and visit them more often.
bad,"AT&T was my first job in my programming career. I'm very grateful for the opportunity and the skills that I learned as well as the work friends I made. However I found the culture to be rather indifferent to the experience of the junior developers. The management I experienced would be, at times, unable to help or hostile to asking for assistance with a problem."
bad,"This was supposed to be a junior position, contracting. Turns out, I was the only frontend developer on my team, responsible for the implementation of the entire interface. I had zero mentorship or assistance. I was basically thrown off the deep end and told to sink or swim. My boss was often sarcastic in a bad way. The office was gray and fluorescently lit. I was not allowed to work from home ever. Workplace culture was cliquish and generally not inclusive. Contractors were treated like second-class citizens. Management was disconnected from the developers. 75% of my time was spent waiting for managers or other developers to get back to me. The product was boorish and poorly designed - no one cared about it at all. The only way to move up is to spend 20 years of your life working on projects so dull you'll question your will to live. I wish this was hyperbole."
bad,Not a company they used to be it was always a pleasure going into work now it’s just uncertainty regarding the job managers are looking for you to slip up so you can be Terminated.
bad,"They try to rule your life. They don't care about selling phones or helping with your phone problems, They will force you to see DirecTV and no one is coming into AT&T for that. They will push and prod at you until you can't take it anymore and will belittle you for not being cut throat. They do not care about you. They care about their money."
bad,"Union stinks, if you put in the years and you are a garbage employee you get 1st dibs for jobs to escape your drearyness.. also so much manadatory overtime with no say in it... Which sucks.. if you just got hired don't expect to have Saturdays off for 4 years and have garbage vacation days .."
bad,"My typical day was 2 hours admin work followed by hours of drive time followed by hours of field work followed by documentation of field work followed by more admin work.  We were expected to be a jack of all trades and a master of none.  I learned how to do the job of 3 while driving half the day.  I learned that prioritization of duties is key.  The majority of management has been promoted through a cut-throat culture of ""I'm better than my peers"".  Most make a name for themselves by terminating employees before helping them.  The hardest part of the job was the amount of work that was required.  It was not enough to attain all metrics.  The expectation of the workplace culture was to ""make time"" after hours or on the weekends to complete extra tasks.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and working with an amazing crew of technicians."
bad,"The company I started for is not the company now.  And they said a lot of things like planning for 2020 which really didn't matter in the long run since I was ahead of the game.  They didn't care how good of an employee I was or ability to learn or change when they did layoffs.  I used to feel valued, that I had opportunities but things with the company in the last 5-10 years kept getting worse.  Lots of hot air coming from leadership with no real answers to the supporting employees."
bad,"Management does anything to push sales especially DTV.  They hold phones behind closed doors until we try to force customers to buy something they dont want or need. Every frustrating, not every customer is the same or needs the same things.  Pulled off of the sales floor multiple times a day for an hour at a time for counseling on selling things to people that they didn't want. Even if something was morally wrong we had to do it or we could be written up and let go, however if we got in trouble for being morally wrong management wouldn't have your back!.  Putting in 60-70 hours a week at work, work is more than a second home, management should have your back and help you not make things worse for all individuals.  Pay is nice and that's what keeps employees until they finally can't handle to stress anymore."
bad,The only good thing this company offered was the bonuses for sales.....  Basically if you have kids or difficult schedule or any type of life that caused you to miss work they are not understanding at all I had court three times in six months dealing with a courtesy battle because my ex husband wouldn't sign our divorce papers and was being investigated by CPS but I was told by my work that because I Wasn't served a  subpoena that it wasn't important.... Any company that can tell a single mother that fighting to retain custody of her children from an abusive ex husband isn't important enough to miss work for is morally and financially corrupt. For a company that prides themselves on integrity they dropped the ball it also took them 2 months to send me my final bonus check and it was short 200 bucks they were supposed to Fed ex it 3 days after my termination date.
bad,Very disorganized and was there 3 years and they laid off 6900 people over 3 months. My boss was great but there was still a lack of communication in upper management
bad,"good job for transition to a career. not a career job anymore. long hours, local management tries to bend rules to accomplish numbers. Too many numbers chasing techs."
bad,"Getting a good manager is going to be 50/50, half of them are good and half of them are crooked shysters.  They will tell you to sell directv to customers that have directv now(at&t streaming tv service).  When a new secondary priorities come along that serve the customer no benefit they will have you force it on the customer making interaction times longer.  When doing upgrades you are told not to set up the phone for the customer even though in training you are told to do so.  Basically if your customer is not buying anything new then you are told to rush through the interaction.  The commission structure is constantly changing to the companies benefit making your pay check smaller as time goes on.  You are coached to sale to get the number and not to secure the sale with directv.  If a customer cancels service within 6 months of installation then you get charged back for the commission you earned on that sale.  Manager just want the number to look good with there boss even if they know that there is fraud going on with the sale or make promises they do not intend to keep,  so the sales rep makes nothing on the interaction, and then when it cancels will get disciplined for a bad cancel rate.  They really just want you reasons to fire you when they buy a new company so they can recoup the loses faster.  "
bad,A day at ATT is dealt with very Irate customers and a multitude of systems that are ancient.  Loved the people but the overall position is a not something I would enjoy.
bad,"The place is making so many cuts that you were never sure of your job status.  My job was creating automation software to make job cuts and my organization itself was facing cuts.  You can learn a lot and there was some room for using innovative technologies, but the lack of fulfillment and feeling that you did not have a job next week was too much of a drag."
bad,"Working hard can become compensation, provided the team as a whole remain dedicated to each other's success. Otherwise, from the new hires to management, it is a do not hesitate atmosphere as that can be the difference from making the mortgage on time, or not."
bad,"All I am going to say is make to read all of your paper work carefully and have EVERYTHING noted. Whether it’s paper trail through email, recorded something. These managers LIE! I was used for my language skills told I would get paid for being bilingual and they used me for over a year and did not want to pay and LIED and said I wasn’t an bilingual employee when their was proof. Shady shady business."
bad,"At first I was great but then management shuffled around, favoritism was pungent, sick days were write ups and points. Result getting fired due to r aching all sick days and going over limit of points. 10 sick days but even w dr note you still get a point... after 8 points you’re fired. I was on short term disability then fired. Union was not helpful even after fighting for une benefits which att decline, union never stepped in to assist me. Lawyers now involved with lawsuit"
bad,They put profits far above people. you get reprimanded for Quotas you can not control most of the time. plus you get to fix others work while being questioned on why it takes so long.
bad,"They make sale incentives and quotas nearly impossible to hit unless you find ways around the promotions to do shady sales which management pushes you to do, they high five you and take pictures with you after the sales to send to their Management to get recognition for themselves. When the sales you did come back to you that were ""shady"" they do not have your back when it was them pushing you to do it in the first place. So you either do what they tell you or you would get a coaching and then watched and pressured in every one of your sales transactions from then on. Thankfully that was not the case for me as I was great with sales and meeting my quotas, but I had seen a lot of people get fired or quit because of things like this."
bad,"Constant layoffs. Discouraging telecommuting. Work/life balance hard to achieve. Average expected hours 11-14 hrs/day. Stagnant, not much career growth."
bad,"Work culture was not flexible, employees were not encouraged to take time off. hours in a technical support area were often long and the culture did not like time off."
bad,Big company that has been experiencing shifts in workforce and consolidation.  Growth opportunities are based in specific locations in 10 key markets.  Emphasis is on new and emerging media and technology divisions.
bad,"The management team see employees as expendable cogs in their machine. The work with customers however was rewarding, I just wish the company culture was geared more to retention."
bad,"AT&T was a great learning experience about how and where to create efficiencies in a world full of inefficiencies.  Some great people doing some really great things overall, just that the company is way too big to be able to move fast to do almost anything."
bad,"no opportunities for advancement, your work day is spent monitoring literally your seconds that you are both on and off of the phone. As well as simply pushing sales."
bad,working with large service accounts. had about 2000 accounts that would be under my control.  Worked with security and most important was protecting the accounts.
bad,"my years with McCaw Cellular, AT&T wireless and Cingular Wireless were great. I held several positions that were challenging; managers who mentored and trusted. I loved going to work every day; I was productive, allowed to make decisions, was very well respected by my peers; enjoyed the cross functional interactions.  The last 3 years in Construction and Engineering were awful; my director and manager used a management style that goes against all the things that AT&T claims."
bad,"First line Management is very understanding but second and third line Management have issues. In the particular field I work in, we are downsizing and we can't get the supplies necessary to complete our jobs. Customers are the real victims. And we get the brunt of the hostility."
bad,"Cuando entré a AT&T fue una buena experiencia, la verdad es que me gustaba mucho laborar en la empresa, pero conforme iba pasando el tiempo cambio muchísimo la estructura y ya no era lo mismo trabajar en ella."
bad,Having worked there for almost 10 years they laid off ALL current managers and replaced them with cheaper and younger managers to save money. The only people left when I was hired is one that changed to a different job
bad,"Made enough money to pay my bills, but commissions are always cut and targets are raised. Work / Home life was not a respected aspect of the job. The way to get days off was virtually a feeding frenzy."
bad,"The atmosphere was childlike with a culture of pushing sales and convincing customers of associate care by lying to them about similarities. The equipment and programming is good enough to stand on its own merit and value. The customers do not need to be deceived to feel a connection, the truth suffices but deceit is encouraged at Directv to close the sale."
bad,"This was one of the poorest moral companies to work for, management moral, lack of compassion,and work/personal balance.  The union is no good, the system implemented isnt made for advancing ones career, but rather keeping one stagnated or terminated. Management is constantly changing, micro management culture, mainly with team leaders who haven't done the job directly."
bad,terrible management and mandatory overtime . I wouldn't go back personally. this wasn't the place for me. you can move up if that's the road you choose.
bad,Go into you work station bring up your programs review emails and then log into the phones. There are managers around but not all are there to support employees as they should. It is a call center environment with a cafe area for food and seating to eat. There is a free coffee center with public computers. The hardest part of the job is following a script that is not efficient for all situations and being like a robot instead of a personal approach. The most enjoyable part of the job is being around your coworkers and speaking with customers that appreciate all the work you put in to help them. I learned that there are always going to be changes and you must adapt in order to help the company reach their goals. Keep an open mind and try your best to fulfill the job requirements. As long as you are willing and open to change you will go far in customer service field.
bad,Management is ridiculous. You spend the majority of your time being harassed about numbers that are mostly out of your hands. The only good thing about this job is benefits and pay. Neither was worth the stress that was given on a daily basis.
bad,"I worked for AT&T for over 16 years. I don't  understand the scope of AT@T or  where the company is going.  I really love the culture of AT@T. I received so much negativity from management.  Co-workers  wore very negative.  When I was originally hired with the company, I thought the company was the best company ever."
bad,"A very stressful and pressured job, Its about the numbers and sales. Not a fun work environment, management is about sales not customer service and whats best for the customer."
bad,"Hired or train the supervisors much better, the manager i had on my crew was coming from another department (inr) so he didnt have any idea how things were working as a premise tech, every time I would as for his help, he would only tell me to get help from coworkers."
bad,"Worst job ever and that has nothing to do with the actual job. Management is terrible and low to mid level managers brow beat and threaten their employees as a motivation for performance. Most techs have little to no support from their bosses, have to deal w/ crazy unattainable metrics and are treated as they are children requiring the completion of meaningless tasks that keep them from accomplishing their real jobs."
bad,"AT&T is commitment is to themselves only "
bad,"The culture is not a good environment to perform your best, the wireless business is micromanaged by senior leadership that came up through the ranks on the wireline side of the house. You are not appreciated as an asset to the company rather a liability."
bad,"It's a phone company that acts like a small bureaucracy. It's not very collaborative. People silo in their job until it's time to retire. No chance for growth or development unless you are lucky enough to know the right people which is rare in a company this large. With a company this large and with little growth in telecom, your job can easily get moved to another city or region. You must develop skills that will make you competitive and survive any outsourcing to contract positions or movement to other business units. Though the pay is fair, it does not grow with the cost of living unless you move from a higher paying region (like California or New Jersey) to a lower cost region like Carolina or Texas."
bad,AT&T is usually focused on one thing and that's the bottom dollar. You can work there for years and they will find a way to let you go so they can outsource your position for cheaper wages. Management is only concerned about how they look and the numbers for their office. Lies are a regular thing when it comes to management. The job is tough but does pay well if you are good at it and very patient! Not everyone can handle being on the phones all day while being yelled at by customers and micromanaged by so many people. Overall this job gave me a lot of job experience in many things but the environment is harsh. Retaliation from management is a common thing in workplace. Best advice I can give is to keep your head down and do your best to meet your numbers. Its all about the numbers.
bad,"Managers only got to their positions through sales, most have no idea how to effectively lead a team. Pay started out great, then the company got cheap!!! If you don't mind being harassed for sales constantly, you can make a decent living."
bad,"I did not enjoy my time working for the company. Everybody was lazy, lying to the customers, and selling these fake products. My pay was very low. I will never work for AT&T again."
bad,"ATT has been around for a very long time and for that reason any advancement with them takes around 10+ years of experience.  "
bad,My experience with AT&T was a rollercoaster but am proud of what I was able to accomplish in my 4 years with the company. It is tough to keep a work life balance due to short staff issues and among many other things. The workplace if handled correctly can improve but it with the focus on many irrelevant matters make it difficult to handle and enjoy.
bad,"The only thing I liked about working at AT& T was my coworkers, everything else was awful down to the horrible work areas and awful management, I would not work here again if offered the perfect salary."
bad,"This is not the place it use to be.  Good ole boy network, full of favoritism.  Experience and education means little if you don't think and act like the Director and his boot lickers think you should."
bad,"In Mobility, the majority of  Management had no college degrees.  It was like being in high school again."
bad,I really appreciated the employment but to be honest it was a bit out of control for my taste. You would never have known I was unhappy because I would show up early and leave late. I gave my job everything I had while working at at&t.
bad,"Working for at&t is great if you have the right job title, or else its horrible and stressful beyond belief. The managment asks us to consistently trespass, or be in risky situations, that if caught may result in job loss."
bad,"Extreme cooperate culture, politics, brown nosing will get you places."
bad,"Good pay but days could blend together when it was slow. Which would introduce managers coming up with clever ways to keep us busy. Usual roleplaying or just taking online tests. Very goal oriented as far as hitting certain numbers and metrics. Despite what most people may think this is not as much of a cell phone store anymore as it is an entertainment company. What that means is focuses will usually be very high for selling entertainment products like TV, and internet. Once you work your way up in seniority your hours will become decent, but that can take a long time. All depends on when other employees get promoted or leave the company."
bad,It was a call center environment. Everything had to be done their way and there was no other way. Very strict atmosphere and a lot of micro management. Not a fan of the environment.
bad,Very difficult job to have a life outside the work place.  Start at 8am and you don't get off till you clear the load and finish your last job.  Mandatory 6 days at the will of the company with only a 48 hour notice.  Work 10-16 hours a day.
bad,"overall was a great job to work for. wasn't getting paid enough for the work I was doing. also wasn't able to switch shifts with anyone if needed to =, to get the day off."
bad,"definitely would not recommend this job to anyone,too stressful,management do not care about the employee's and are very cut throat. worst job i've ever had"
bad,"Learned a lot about customer service over 10 years. Very demanding job trying to meet the needs of customers and the metrics of the company. Without cheating the numbers, you can not possibly meet the expectations of the company."
bad,"I worked at DirecTV before the AT&T merger. Management had no idea how to train us to use the AT&T side of the system and it was overall a mess. Management didn't care about guest satisfaction as long as you sold equipment or managed to prolong their cancellation of services."
bad,Job is brutal and a giant stress pit. no such thing as work life balance. You are required to work long hours in every type of weather to please very difficult to please customers. Not a job for everyone.
bad,Great place to work for individuals whom are highly self motivated and not discouraged by others work ethic. Management tends to focus on the flavor of the month when setting goals.
bad,typical day was being harassed by distraught customers. I've learned conflict resolution. Most of the management was stressed and not easy to go to with concerns or questions. The culture was not inviting and the hardest part was getting a few minutes to collect yourself after a difficult customer encounter. The most enjoyable part was winning prizes after converting a customer from another company.
bad,The Company doesn't care about the employees. It easier for them to use a revolving door and hire new people then to cultivate their employees and make them stay for a long time.
bad,Standard desk job. I was hired as over the phone tech support but ended up doing more work trying to sell people things with no commission. There was really no room for advancement as well
bad,"No set time on what time is quitting time, changes daily. Everything is judged whether how fast you do a job or if you can complete the job you are graded on every day to day activity."
bad,"The company feels split. Have your team leads want to watch you grow and move up while others only care about your numbers to boost their monthly commissions. I understand there are metrics to be met but when you tell a new hire there is growth opportunities but it doesn’t matter how well they exceeded their goals, they stay on the phones and do not move up that is not fair and it lowers their potential."
bad,"Work was not difficult and tools provided to assure you can do well. Rapidly changing rules keep you on your toes. Local management has a severe lack of managerial training, none offered to them. Promotions seem to be based on popularity and not ability. Since DTV merger, workplace moral has significantly declined despite effort from company to change it. Best part of the job was the people in office and those we came in contact with on phones. Worst part was the lack of concern for employees and lack of real ability to assist customers with problems"
bad,"This review is only in relation to working in the U-Verse division of AT&T. I can't attest to the quality of working environment in any of the other divisions."
bad,"schedules changed every single month, with shift bids. Stats did not play any role in it, Team Leaders were not always available to get assistance and were usually out walking the floor talking with other management about personal things that were job related."
bad,"there is 0 chance of upward career advancement if you work for the same type of job. "
bad,"not a good place to work, they try to monopolize your time with manditory ot and constant schedule changes. unfair bonus practices, too much demand added to employees without ever increasing pay"
bad,"AT&T is quite cut-throat and very much dog-eat-dog."
bad,"My experience at the Ocala call center shows a disregard for the individual with no work/family balance. They are only interested in nitpicking performance standards, keeping employees on constant disciplinary measures, and managing by intimidation. AT&T spouts a good line to draw you in, keeps you there with false promises and a generous benefits package, but just doesn't understand the importance of valuing their employees as individuals. The lack of positive reinforcement, constant twisting of company policies to create disciplinary actions and continuing false promises for improvements in the working atmosphere shows they only regard their employees as expendable resources. Very HIGH rate of turnover - not due to the job itself, but due to the management of the work center and the workplace culture that is driven only by the $$ put in managers pockets."
bad,"Your commission is based on how happy the customer is with the company as a whole, not how you performed.  Hard to advance unless you are friends with someone that makes the decisions."
bad,"Worked here less than a year and everything is stacked against you as far as your work performance metrics go. Very little incentive to promote to other positions despite what I was told when I took the job. Managers are only worried about their numbers looking good and not so much worried about quality of work. If you like being micromanaged, then this is the job for you!"
bad,Buena capacitacion y ambiente laboral tranquilo y estable. mucho tiempo de dedicacion y el sueldo bajo.
bad,"I love my coworkers, but management makes the job more stressful than it needs to be."
bad,don't expect to go to school and work. Don't expect to pick our own hours and yes there is mandatory overtime whether you can work it or not. HR does not care about your well being
bad,"The pay is decent (actually higher than many call centers in the area), but that is the only advantage of working for this company. They recently got rid of all schedule accommodations for students, eliminated the hourly shift differential, and reduced the health care packages provided to the bare minimum. They no longer allow you to accrue PTO, instead you have a set amount of days and once they are gone there are no other options if something comes up. "
bad,"Pros: Pays well considering the position. Good benefits. Union. Job is not hard. Get to be by yourself most of the day."
bad,"was not at&T was outside salesman with silver first but indeed would not recognize it"
bad,"when working for at&"
bad,Pay is higher than most retailers but time costs are far more than others as well. Retail store environmental mindset is cut-throat and is very unrewarding. Management in RGV region needs to be replaced by new blood and fast.
bad,"Very stressful job. The management ask for a lot from their reps and are very fake people that only care about themselves and not their reps.Overall, just not worth people's time"
bad,"Some managers are allowed to create toxic work environment that drills down to employees "
bad,The pay is good but the stress level is too much. Anything you do at work is never good enough. It is about how much you can get done and less about customer satisfaction.
bad,"As a contractor I was in a position that was 5 days a week with 10 hour days. We had a great manager but back then they didn't have much say in how we worked, time off if needed ect."
bad,"If you are not on the inside, you are on the OUTSIDE!  Horrible for advancement.  Salaries are not competitive.  Union employees have FAR better benefits than Management."
bad,"AT&T had a high turn over, promotion was hard you had to work non stop to prove yourself you are constantly being scrutinized and tested managment was very unfair."
bad,"was a good place to work but was very stressful, the products offered were outdated and the company refused to update the equipment and provide their member's with proper customer service."
bad,"While you might apply for a customer service position, more than half of your role requires sales objectives and can result in termination if not met."
bad,The job is challenging and has personal rewards when you can complete a task. Management is not strong enough to help employee's. Problems are dealing with unfair management decisions and lay-offs.
bad,Initial training seems comprehensive but is almost pointless when in the field.  Definitely a management vs. employees atmosphere.  Expect to work long hours with little to no help; sink or swim basically.
bad,"Very stressful, a lot of pressure to hurry up & work unsafe, management looks the other way while advising how to cut corners and then reprimands you, stating lack of quality. Always send emails confirming that your work was done as advised by manager. Make sure you email your manager with his confirmation, so he can not take action against you. In other words make sure you cover yourself and make all your work his decision, do not take matters in your own hands. Document all your work."
bad,"Management talks to Employees any kind of way. No room for Growth. Managers at At&t make the job more stressful then it actually is. The pay needs to increase based on the amount of Systems that we are required to operate. Which is currently 32 different systems, Technology is way to far advanced for At&t to still be in the stone ages with their in-house Technology/ Systems."
bad,"There is no work life balance. The environment is competitive, you are ranked against your peers. Managers are help accountable for employee actions regardless of preventive measures. It is not a healthy environment."
bad,Many problems with making employees feel valued and wanted
bad,"They expect way too much from employees and seem to fire as fast as they hire. Everything is by the book, cut and dry. Without regards for the the tenure of the employee or how good an employee is."
bad,"There are exceptions but management is incompetent for the most part because of the union."
bad,"Twice a year nearly every department goes through a surplus, you spend months wondering if you will have a job. AT&T does not understand cost control measures; therefore, they try to fire themselves into prosperity. I do NOT recommend AT&T as a good, reliable, or healthy place to have a career."
bad,There should be more job security in a company of this size.  They are quick to close the doors on a call center the moment they make their next big acquisition.
bad,"Directv was a great place to work until AT&Tmerged and took over. the pay is not the same and the quality of service to customers has changed. if you work there, try to move up off the phones, if not you're not going to want to stay."
bad,"Huge management turnover, constant abuse to managers to break them down and in turn attempt to break employees down. Bad work life balance, no paid sick time. Very bad for anyone wanting to keep self esteem high."
bad,Typical day meant stressful day.  The culture was always very sad and depressing until a visitor came and then out came the bells and whistles. The hardest part of the job was coming to work everyday.  The most enjoyable part was going home.
bad,"ATNT bought direct TV and the management still hasn't gotten over it, making a very toxic work environment.  Also mandatory 6 days a week and mandatory travel makes family life non-existent."
bad,"While I have definitely had worse jobs, AT&T does not give you a good work/life balance. The goals are strict and the management in my store is not very good at what they do. It is commission, so if you're good at talking people into stuff they do not need it might be a good fit."
bad,Job security is rapidly declining and call center employees are treated like prisoners in a panopticon. The premium for 'company sponsored' health care has reached the point where it is almost as cheap to get the identical plan on the open market. After 15+ years I had to make the decision to cut my losses and pursue more satisfying ventures.
bad,"In my years at AT&T/ DIRECTV did have the opportunity to meet other people and get a lot of knowledge about the company, systems and products. The only thing that I appoint at is that in the process of acquisition AT&T make people feel unsafe and that all the responsibilities had been removed form they hands... we were without the tools to make our work right. But beside that I loved my job."
bad,"No, highly stressful. "
bad,"Schedules are by seniority, meaning, new hires will work every closing shift and every weekend shift.  Training is a long process, and does nothing to prepare you for what is actually going on in the store.  Management is a joke.  Schedule is supposed to be posted a month in advance, but is usually posted 2 days before the following work week starts.  They no longer care about phones.  they only care about selling Directv.  Store is always shorthanded due to lack of moral and poor management."
bad,During my time there it was very fast paced and very stressful. The management team would not assist in taking over calls when it was beyond the crs ability to assist the consumer. Often times breaks were forfeited because we were in constant que
bad,"Scheduling is a nightmare, technicians are constantly crossing each other to get to job sites. Management does nothing to help or to boost morale. Everyone within the company is just out for themselves."
bad,"When I first started with AT&T, they had a great culture and seemed to actually care about the employees facing their customers every day. that all changed with the acquisition of DirecTV. Since that moment, it has been nothing but DTV this and DTV that. Hit your goal in every metric BUT DTV? You get written up. They only seem to care about TV sales, even though our pay structure is still heavily weighted on phone sales. goals keep going up every month but the pay structure changes with it to make sure you are making the same amount of money with double the required effort from the month before. "
bad,The call enter jobs are the most difficult. You have outrageous goals that you must obtain monthly or you will be fired. I was so stressed at work that I only looked forward to my off days and vacation times.
bad,Used to be a great place to work. The company is consistently cutting commissions for retail sales workers. Surplussing management making it very difficult to promote.They could care less about your personal life. Constant micro managing. No sick time so if you have to miss work due to sickness or medical reasons your punished by a strike being placed against your attendance weather its excused or not. They messed up a good thing in the retail stores over the last 2 years and its only going to get worse.
bad,"The first level managers are not leaders.  They expect you to know how to problem solve when you are just out of training.  Not every first line manager can solve the same issue themselves.  Also, instead of working collaboratively, they are not very helpful and sometimes annoyed that you ask for help. Overall, I think Senior Management needs to get involved and correct this issue."
bad,"If you're in a management position you are expected to give 110% of your time to the job.  You don't have family that counts, personal time doesn't count, nothing but that job to them...if you dare take time off you are frowned upon.  This was in my department...it may be better in others.."
bad,This job will suck the life out of you... Don’t care about the well being of the employees at all...It is supposed to be customer service so you would think that would be the main focus but clearly the main focus is sales sales and more sales... Offer sales and then resolve customers issues and complaints... That’s definitely not how a customer service position is supposed to be...
bad,"They don't develop you. They have a strong ""bench"" in place if you don't work out. They don't believe in coaching. If you don't make it in 3 months you are forced out even with 17 years with the company."
bad,Era  simplemente  normal el trato de  empleado a empleador
bad,"Was told the job would be something else and turned out to be a nightmare of high pressure tasks. I managed to stay employed for six months although it was a challenge to stay that long."
bad,"Finally couldn't take it anymore:  This is a company that doesn't belong in the current century: Bloated, fragmented, stodgy, incompetent, uncaring, dysfunctional, and hellishly bureaucratic are words that come to mind.  How does this company even function?  I've worked for far better run companies out there so after 11 years at my job, I say adios.  My mental and physical well-being is not worth this needless torture."
bad,After working hard for many years decided to leave due to poor/bad leadership experiences.  Endured for several years before made decision to leave. Stress level extremely high - mostly due to leadership changes every 6-18 months!
bad,While AT&T has good compensation/benefits the work environment  is stressful and it is very hard to advance. Management will promise you something then not follow through.
bad,"The problem is how much you makes them money they need more and more until the point that you see your self working like slave,and they never appreciate what you did.Always they change managements."
bad,"AT&T wireless is a very fast paced environment.  I am grateful for the opportunity to have worked on the implementation side of wireless.  The corporate culture in the office I was in, is one of negativity and blame, and no real teamwork.  "
bad,Great start for someone with mediocre sales skills straight out of HS or college. Not recommended for someone with an extensive sales background or high standards of living.
bad,Don't know why. Want to know why. Confused as to why. This makes no sense why I need to do this. Can you please take this off the list of requirements?
bad,I really loved my job and my employees. The company really did compensate well with good benefits but part of the problem was working to many hours each week which was my own fault.
bad,A typical day at work consisted of me being yelled at by angry customers who were being over charged for something they did not want. Ultimately if you are not a sales person this would not be a good job for you.
bad,The pay rate is good compared to other jobs. The job piles more and more work on employees with little or no training. No place to advance. Many of the employees have been working in the same positions of many years. When you reach top pay you will likely be terminated.
bad,Initial training was very unorganized. Not enough equipment for all employees and current equipment was outdated. Unfair treatment with veteran employees and new employees. When managers are need for task out of the hands of the technician they not approachable nor easy to get in contact with. Criticism is given with no insight for improvement. Growth is very limited so technicians are controlled to keep doing the grunt work.
bad,"The benefits are amazing, but it's not fun trying to talk people into buying something to meet quota.  Customers even tell the employees that they feel they are walking into a user car dealership.  Management.  Work hours are not friendly for families and the schedule is never the same from week to week.  Lowest score rating for a CEO in the Entertainment/Cellular industry among employees."
bad,"Was a bad experience straight from the beginning.  My trainer was very professional nor was she pleasant to be around.  Always threatening...verbally abusive.  I had spoke of what was happening and it was just pushed under the rug.  It happened to more than just myself as well.  Was horribly ""anxious"" when going into work everyday as well as counting down the hours to leave.  It didn't get much better when we had went out to the floor.  I had worked at VZW for 7 yrs doing the same job and more...excelled in my job there but DirecTV made it difficult to even make it to your goals and then would have a team meeting everyday at the beginning of the shift to let everyone know how good or how bad you were."
bad,"pay was good at first, but slowly decreases every year with commission, management can be good or completely bad. more of a phone technician then sales person"
bad,Dishonest company. Only took care of staff that generated revenue for the company. All the rest were treated as expendable. Huge focus on work ethic in training videos but never actually encouraged or rewarded if practiced.
bad,"Organization does not care about your time, its all about them. They try to force you to sell a product that does not work very well, and when customers come back to complain the managers don't want any part of it. Favoritism is a tremendous problem with the company, they constantly change the pay structure and it has almost always proven to take away from the sales people. Wont go into specifics but the attendance policy is a joke as well."
bad,This is a pimp relationship. These people want to work you like dogs and have you working all day. The commission is better than most places but you have to sale your butt off! Managers are awful BTW. But God bless them anyway!
bad,Att tends to put 4 different job titles in the same position and pay u for 1 job title. Then they give u 2 hours to do a 4 hour job and question u about why it wasnt complete in 2 hour even though they know it can't be done..and lots more
bad,When ATT took over Directv they outsourced or automated most jobs and eliminated a lot of positions. customer feed back became very poor as well do to out sourcing and shady tactics in sales
bad,"Great first job at out college. Pays well. Then the started changing commission structure, make less and less money but work harder and harder. Little to no room for upward mobility. Don't care at all for your college degree."
bad,"Att was the most difficult job I ever  worked, its not the physical work, its the mental part especially the micro management. The pay is really good and the benefits, but its very easy to get fired."
bad,"When you start you are promised high compensation for your work.  After meeting the ridiculous goals created by the management, one way or an other the company still finds a way of stealing the money you've earned."
bad,"Company salary continues to decrease and there is no family work life balance. Week are monitory unless you request them of 30 or more day in advance, you are subject to come to work at any given time, even if you are scheduled off."
bad,if you love yourself and family worst place to work. they will work you to the bone and the CWA is not a good union if you decide to go work here don't join its just giving away money
bad,has become a very unhappy place to work. upper management promotes a hostile work environment. Excessive nepotism. Upper management talks about reps to other reps and tells personal issues and work issues to reps and their friends that also work there. Excessive childish behavior.
bad,"If you work for AT&T in a call center, prepare to take an impact to your health and mental well-being.  Antidepressants are common and when doctors find out you work for AT&T, they seem to proactively suggest an antidepressant."
bad,I loved my job and my customers. Multiple turnaround with new hires and job requirements. My hours and job location was wonderful. Benefits were solid and never the same day twice.
bad,"AT&T works hardest at regaining monopoly power."
bad,"ATT Compensates very well in order to exploit its employees to the maximum and keep them from resigning. Theres an upbeat fun facade of an environment to convince you that the job is relaxing and a great place to be, in reality you are encouraged by management to place items on customers bills and setup services unbeknownst to the customer speaking to you on the other end of the line."
bad,"At firts you don't learn anything , Manager are not their to be your friend even when you ask for help. yeah at firts its great but then same employee's like to put you down"
bad,"If you're just starting your career, this will help give you the necessary skills (within sales) to give you experience.  Once you get past 1-2 years, though, I would start looking elsewhere.  The wireless industry is a thank-less one, and doesn't provide the benefits that one would want as they progress in their career."
bad,"I was thankful for the good money I was making here over the many years I was there.  I was good at my job -- it was hard work but I did my work well.  Local management played favorites & there was office politics and bullying.  It became all about big money, and my job was outsourced."
bad,"Being a Customer Service Representative Sales Agent is one of the hardest parts of a job. Dealing with customers which are not so happy about their billing, but we would have to twist everything in a good way, to have the sale at the end of the call. This is where I truly learned how to make a sale over the phone! The management there wasn't so good. The morale in the contact center wasn't good. The most enjoyable part were our pep rallies when we would start the week off."
bad,worked as a technician for 4 years had more then 6 different supervisors mandatory overtime daily was supposed to work 8 hours a day but was forced to work 10 or more hours a day management is only concerned with the numbers and themselves worst place i've ever worked
bad,"I was always worried that my Badge would not work when I tried to go through the front door in the mornings. They fired people left and right and I was always wondering if I was next, even though I was meeting all of my metrics."
bad,"bad management"
bad,"The company changed with the culture and morale for the employees. Directv sells you a hope and a dream when walking in the door, however if you look at it as a mind over matter you may survive."
bad,The company is only looking to keep employees on a short term basis. They want you in and out before your 3 years before you can acquire a pension. You will either be pushed out for performance or a reason will be made up to release you.
bad,"Top Management has no management or direction. They keep hiring new people, bring them and provide little training. Once hired the new people really do not have a direction to start."
bad,"At&t is slowly going down . Laying of people, and its not as stable as I thought or as other people think.They always change. As a matter of fact, thats the only constant they change. Just played off 80,000 people and a lot of managers. They are paying less and less a year. Benefits are pretty good .The only Draw back is the lack of life balance. Everything is unionized so people that get hired will get the bad shifts, working late nights and non stop weekends, for the first 3-4 years."
bad,The people i worked with were great. The job is stressful and it consumes your life. The goals to hit are near impossible and if you don't hit them you are reprimanded and asked if you really want the job... Not a job for sensitive people.
bad,ATT is a good company as far as pay but it is a fortune 100 company and they generally look at the bottom line and you are just a number or a stat. Company has no job security
bad,"At&t used to be a great company to work for however they are not willing to sign a new contract agreement for their non management full time employees, they want to remove our sick time pay as well as eliminate commission for their commission based employees. They also did cut backs on managers so a lot of assistant managers have gotten laid off and the cutt backs continue. They are eventually leading to ask all fulltime employees to go part time. They cutt back on over all commission unless it's for direct tv. Management sucks, reps do their managers job and managers plot to fire people for no reason. Higher management doesn't care for their employees either. This is a no retaliation company that often retaliates on their employees. It was once a great company to work for but not anymore. Only thing good is the benefits and there is definitely no work life balance."
bad,"If you are looking for a base plus commission job that you can make a lot of money and are willing to have no life outside of work and can put up with abuse then this job is for you. "
bad,"Erratic hours, lunch breaks at any given time, constantly monitored and criticized, unrealistic sales goals to hit commission goals, negative work environment"
bad,AT&T's Middle Management has a huge disconnect between First Level Management and Upper Management. Advancement is based on seniority and external/internal education is rarely considered in promotions or lateral movement opportunities. Benefit package is fairly reasonable.
bad,My typical day would be getting to work at like 7 or 8 in the morning and setting up the equipment and the drawers. Once the doors opened up it was busy from start to close. Most of the time I would work 40-60 hour weeks depending on who was on vacation.
bad,"My biggest criticisms of AT&T are:"
bad,"Started off great, but pay has dropped precipitously year after year.  It's retail, so hours are terrible.  Work life balance is nonexistent.  You will get a lot of vacation, but you can't use it to spend time with your friends or family during holidays.  Promotion is nearly impossible unless you know somebody.  I make less managing a staff of 10 people than I did when I was the one being managed.  AT&T is firing about 30% of the entire workforce to improve their cash flow.  Your job is not secure."
bad,It was the worst 10 years of my life.  Everyone is always angry because of the greedy crooks they are.  I will never ever again go back.  I cried many days. They gave a .50 every 6 months because they know they have to to keep you there.  But even after making 17.66 an hour it couldn't keep me anymore because of the most horrible stress you had to deal with day after day.  Not enough days off and nasty managers.  Not all of course but most since the ones above them were cracking their whips so in turn they had to crack their whips at us.  Just an awful 10 years of my life.
bad,"Peers are great hard working people. At&t has become corporate greed and doesn't care about its employees at all. Micromanaged and even with some of the best numbers in the territory, someone was still grinding on you about something. Nothing is ever good enough and there just looking for the next person to come take your spot. Doesn't give chance for advance at all, best employees do not matter, majority of the bad employees are the ones they promote it seems like."
bad,This is an entry level position with very little growth opportunities. The training is lacking all skills are brought to the job or learned in the field.
bad,Very stressful job great benefits and salary lots of perks but non stop calls and noise lots of pressure from management to sell products at all cost.
bad,Silos everywhere make sure you network any chance you have. Internal job postings are not easy to access. Sr. Management is not in touch with reality
bad,It was difficult to see a company have poor integrity they have customers calling in regarding billing issues however it’s really a sales office with representative who is told to answer the questions as quickly as possible and then attempt to upgrade them to higher services and to overcome the objections at least 3 times. Even if they want to cancel or close a account just not great treatment of the customers
bad,I dealt with harassment. The problem was never taken care of even though it was reported properly. Upper management sets unrealistic goals for the team leaders. There is more focus on team leads building their skills instead of the sales agents. This is the reason production goals were hardly ever met.
bad,"After Direct TV merger very unstable place to be.....impending layoffs and management chaos.  Job eliminated.  Trend seems to be to hire younger (cheaper) workforce while continuing to operate a company full of redundancy, red-tape, processes that don't work; with little value placed on employees."
bad,"AT & T was a company that had great opportunities if you had access to them.  I was in a union job that had no opportunity for growth and that was very frustrating for me.  The hours remained inconsistent my entire career there (17.5 years) and could range from an overnight shift, split shift, afternoon shift and a rare day shift (on major holidays people with more seniority didn't want to work) and every day had a different start time regardless of when you finished the day before & included weekends. Days off were always inconsistent as well.   I learned how to effectively deal with very difficult people, (customers and management) and enjoyed the variety of people that I met and became lasting friends with.  The most difficult part of the job was dealing with certain types of customers who don't realize you are trying to help them process their call so they can communicate with someone, and the best part of the job was the pay, benefits and vacation."
bad,"Management shows favoritism. Co-workers are exceptional. The hardest part of the job is the metric system. AT&T expects you to resolve a customer's issue under 8 minutes while maintaining a human connection which more often than not results in a call lasting longer than 8 minutes. Bonuses are contingent upon customer opinions of the representative. Example: customer calls in because they can't get service in their home. Representative completes all technical troubleshooting and problem still exists. Representative is then required to complete a ticket which could take 3 days before the customer gets a call back. Meanwhile, the customer calls back sometimes more than once and/or is without service, and gets a survey on how they feel about the interaction with the customer service representative. This results in a negative survey from the customer and the representative is ""punished"" for it."
bad,"Goals you meet are unrealistic, management definitely out to get employees, pay is not accurate to work, home and work not balance, company does not care about the blue collar worker."
bad,The corporate world becomes too much when you boss literally has no say in anything he does. The lower and middle management is awful. This company needs some serious revamping.
bad,"We were told the customer comes first yet were measured by statistics and metrics that nothing to do with customer service. There was virtually no room for advancement. Our schedules changed on a weekly basis, and as schedules went by seniority there were people whom had never had a whole weekend off in years."
bad,Not a growth opportunity. Everyday was the same. Learned techniques for solving technical computer issues.  Schedules were random had to bid for it.
bad,"High pressure job, Great employees, ok benefits not as good as they used to be, lots of overtime a plus, pay not as desirable for new employees"
bad,"I worked for AT&T Mobility for 13 years. Although not a bad company to work for, it did not do much for employees. I worked long hours and for management that only cared about results that would help the  director or VP achieve their performance objectives. It was disappointing to see software product teams led by management with Finance background and with little or no knowledge of software development."
bad,Great place to work with commission and base pay.  Inside sales and have to work all weekends and holidays for retail business needs.  Work life balance was great and not much mandatory overtime.
bad,"The management at Red Skye Wireless was always breathing down your neck, treating adults like high schoolers and not letting us take care of our customers seamlessly, always stepping in and making the customer feel uncomfortable. Ultimately it lost me a lot of sales."
bad,"As of right now a lot of long time employees are looking for new jobs, if they work for the Boise call center.  After the AT&T merger everything has go down hill."
bad,"the pay is low and expected to much.. job is very stressful, other companies like don't expect as much and pay a lot better"
bad,"While working for AT&T I learned how to multitask better, work the systems software that was given to me and educate customers about available products. It was a very hectic atmosphere, fast paced and upbeat. The hardest part of the Job was persuading the customer  to buy product. I enjoyed talking with my customers and learn about different people from around the world."
bad,"830 am to 5 or 6 pm Be Ready For Long Hours, I Learned Alot About Technology On Mobile Devices And The Pros And Cons Of The Makers And There Soft Ware"
bad,"abusive management"
bad,"Weekly pay, great promotions for future customers. Every day i mentally prepare myself to take on any objections. decent.management but overall great Supervisor"
bad,Compañerismo y pocoa comunicacion con altos mandos; a conversar con el cliente interno y externo para ayudar a dar soluciones en el menor tiempo posible siendo el problema solucionado; falta comunicacion con los empleados; muy buenos compañeros de trabajo; la parte mas dificil es saber si el trabajo que se realiza esta bien o mal visto desde el punto de vista de las jefacturas; me gusto el compañerismo y colaboracion
bad,Our Company was bought out by a bigger company and they didn't rehire everyone back. So they basically kicked us out of a job.
bad,"Mucha gente amable y cordial, pero que no tiene skills para hacer las tareas encomendadas."
bad,"no comment on job conditions"
bad,Work place culture was horrible. The managers showed lots of favoritism. It was really had to reach their goals and expectations.
bad,"management promises are not kept"
bad,"Very stressful job environment. From the get go they wanted you to be literally running out the door in 15 mins. Management harass everyone to the point of the day you lose your job, you're thankful. If you get injured, forget it. Theyll do whatever necessary to not pay. Numbers game get played hard, management is not there to help, but to fire you. Since we had to drive their trucks, every little incident becomes your fault and you get suspended, even if someone rear ends you while you're stopped at a red light. Pay wasn't so good either, at max $20 something an hour you would grow a head full of white hair. Union is not gonna do much once the chopping block comes to your head, shall I continue?..  good luck."
bad,Great paying employment and excellent benefits. Training provided. Talk to a diverse customer base. Great co-workers.
bad,"Typical day is working until all the jobs in the pool is complete, which could mean that you work all day long. Co-workers are great and will help you when they can"
bad,"Company leadership wants one thing, but metrics on managers force them to do just the opposite. AT&T work management policies stifles intelligent knowledge workers, wastes talent while asking people for more. Further frustration is created by the way AT&T carves up tasks to the smallest portion in an attempt to make it like an automated assembly line. They expect people to own and improve the process, but the process is so split up that there is nothing deterministic about it. It all seems to be aimed at replacing the highly educated, very experienced workers with cheap labor off the street they can teach singular tasks to and have them do repeatedly. An example would be in system installation and configuration, most companies have a system administrator who installs and configures the OS, then installs the utilities. Not so AT&T. The break the OS install and configuration down into many pieces. One person runs the installer, somebody else configures networks, others install utilities like backup and monitoring, then pass it on to others for configuration of those parts."
bad,"worked here for 1 year. I loved what I did, hated the att expectations. Lots of stress amnd pressure to meet your numbers every month terrible equipment and network conditions. out of 3 guys I hired in with at my garage, 2 were fired or quit in 3 months. I left after 8 months when I found another job."
bad,I work 14-16 hours a day so it doesn't leave me time to finish college or spend with my children...I wish that AT&T cared about the people that supply the service to the customer so that EVERYONE can get a check!
bad,"The job paid well and teaches you interesting and cutting -edge technology, but the union and company relationship is broken. The culture is also very negative and everything is based on seniority. A lot of labor, especially if you're in a city with gigapower like here in Austin. Plenty of overtime. If you're looking for a job that will have you working all day, and does not have a set time to get off, with plenty of hazardous situations, this is it. the job is not for everyone. If you're used to construction or the military, this job is an easy transition."
bad,"This job is door to door sales and is paid on 100 percent commission. If you do not make a sale, you will not receive any compensation for  your time or gas."
bad,It is all about the numbers. You do have a lot of red tape. Benefits don't help. Scheduling issues like nothing else. School comes last to them. Will mess your hours up.
bad,"ATT has great benefits, The management is a whole  story on its own, The company says that they are there to protect there employees , in cases of misconduct or discrimination. but when it comes down to it and they are asked to investigate, they do not do anything, and instead of letting go of the person that has committed the problem they let go of someone that does not have one step of discipline or any tardies or absences."
bad,"Overview I participated in every avenue of this site project including support to their legal counsel. My skills, background and experiences were a great contribution to AT&T's site project to its completion."
bad,job did not offer advancements to sales reps. Job title responsibilities included but were not limited to answering incoming calls and setting up direct tv prospects with direct tv.
bad,"the very best thinga about the job was the free cable , all jobs have their corks but this one takes the cake , you are simply a number never an asset"
bad,"Working at at&t was a rather fun experience but the management really sucks the life out of the job and eventually you're going to wish you never even started. The benefits are amazing, but that's about it."
bad,"A comany that has constant change in sales roles without clear expectations."
bad,"When you begin the first week with pole climbing certification. You meet others that have met the pre qualifications required. Which in it self alone is an accomplishment. Everyone excited to be apart of a very reputable company. After the last climb you feel on top of the world. The training after that was very swift. Read hear, take this test, sign here, and here is you certificate. Next.. Most of everything you learn will be out in the field. Even after the training you really haven't a clue because it is a lot to take in at once. The turn over rate is extremely high. Most of the managers pestered technicians. We work long hours and very rarely run into the same problems. So constantly being challenged with no personal life. While trying to reach unreasonable objectives and in unreasonable time frames. Largest communication company in the world. Within the company the communication ability is very poor. I feel I have wasted enough time with this well marketed company that shows no care to the ones that are building it. So I will respectively end this review now."
bad,"This company does not recognize loyalty or respect for employees. The employees are simply a number. Area Managers were always playing games of bad guy, good guy and giving the wrong messages to the sales representatives which made the managers work more difficult. District Managers are cut throat and untrustworthy. You don't have enough fingers and toes to count all the non-sense that comes out their mouth. Human Resources are useless and equally conniving. Virginia leadership is a joke."
bad,"From the day you complete training, management begins the process of looking for a reason to terminate your employment.  You will be measured primarily on a scorecard which consists of all aspects of the job weighted differently with an expected total of 100 points, if you do not meet 100 points you will be disciplined up to termination."
bad,Unrealistic expectations. Poor management. Owned by investment bank with no real future plan except to sell. Consolidation taking place. Obvious they are looking to sell the comapny
bad,"Even though the pay was outstanding, you are nothing more than a number to them that can easily be replaced. Family life, and personal illness for example mean nothing to them. If you are sick, you had better find a way to get well quickly."
bad,"Great place overall but You do not get paid enough for anything. Instead of hourly its pay by job which is a terrible thing especially when its slow. i went from making $2,800 to 600 every 2 weeks because they over hired and we dont get compensated."
bad,this is a job that is open to advancement. I liked this job overall. Here I was an agent that assisted with billing issues and making sure that the customer gets all that is needed in that call.
bad,"This company is going down hill, they are eliminating a lot of positions. Management is horrible, and customers are leaving rapidly."
bad,Employees were fun and great to work with.  Especially enjoyed training on new products.
bad,"Once you complete the 3 months of everyday training, you begin work in the field. Thus you become responsible for the company's truck, tools, equipment, iPad, iPhone, and everything else you touch. You will climb telephone poles in freezing rain, crawl attics in the heat of summer, find dead animals under crawl spaces... and all this for a starting wage of $8.86 per hour, and the scale is such that you remain under $10 per hour for more than 2 years... Granted once you are there 4 years you get to about 21 an hour, but still, the amount of work and responsibility required for the compensation does not match. If considering working of this company make sure to negotiate your wages up front, even tho they say there is none, refuse the job, they will call back."
bad,"The work/ home balance is non existent. Management only care about making the goal. The daily goal is unreachable. The main concern of this company is making money. Customers are not of importance."
bad,"I made commercials for clients everyday."
bad,"AT&T was a very stressful environment with low morale."
bad,"On average you work 10 hours a day. Management has the daunting tasks of enforcing official and unofficial policies which usually contradict each other. The official policies are there to protect DTV, Inc while the unofficial policies are there to, wink- wink, nudge-nudge, help the techs with their productivty. "
bad,It's a sales job....the more sales you make the more money you make
bad,Corporate is  the best option versus third party contractors
bad,"The managers in the sourcing organization in Middletown, NJ tend to put on a facade that they are trying to turn their section into the next Google, but their implementation never quite reaches the way the promise sounds. Many other employees in the section feel the same way. If you end up here, avoid it or move somewhere else fast. The company, overall, seems like it is a bit below the aptitude of those they are trying to hire, though."
bad,Do Not apply not what it use to be. No work life balance. Pay is great . Management is inexperienced and are very hard to work for.
bad,"Working for DirecTV was my first sales position. Working for them influenced me to change my college degree entirely. I performed on an above satisfactory level, but i did not like my job to be left up to a game of chance."
bad,Fast paced working environment. True to life call center experience.
bad,"Maintain, monitor and perform work as needed for numerous global accounts around the world. Familar with numerous different ticketing systems and monitoring software, as well as responsible for training and staffing of global NOC."
bad,"I had high hopes when I landed the job as a AT&T U-Verse Premise Technician. Knew I would be installing and repairing in home services as well as climbing telephone poles just as the old school lineman do. They were paid very well for not having to deal with customers and inside issues. Premise technicians deal with both outside and inside tasks and are paid half what the lineman are paid and do 2x the work. This is a prime example of major corporations consolidating work into 1 position and not respecting the workers that keep the services up and running. While doing so in dangerous/extreme situations. They expect you to complete your work as they trained you but in a unreasonable set time limit. If you do not, they hound you like its your fault. The metrics they have set up to meet every month is ridiculous. All it does is create stress on the workers, then the workers miss, forget, or skip required tests or quality of work to meet these metrics which in the long run costs the company money and irritate customers due to the fact they have to take time off work so that a repairman can come back out to fix what should have been right the first time. All because the higher ups that set these metrics have know idea what it takes to complete the install/ repairs correctly. They don't care just as long as they keep making their millions sitting behind a desk barking out nonsense directives. If you need a job temporarily this could be for you but do not plan on spending much time with your family and to be compensated appropriately."
bad,Taking inbound calls. We had quite a few employees but we all worked together.The most enjoyable part of job was talking to people from all over
bad,"Benefits are excellent, salary is good. Every day is different and the work is challenging but enjoyable."
bad,"At&t has a reputation for long-term career minded employment opportunity, however with the recent ISP with phone and television, management is severely lacking. A rare manager familiar in the Information Technology arena promotes an enjoyable working environment, however huge management turnovers prevent this highly needed placement. The hardest part of this job was long working hours, shift work, mandatory overtime with lack of support tools to perform the job causing reduced moral amongst employees in my area."
bad,"Typical day is filled with extreme stress....older workers being forced out and new workers start at a fraction of the previous pay scale.. no time for development, training....or job performance reviews.....was a great ILL BELL< AMERITECH company...but ATT is he worst.."
bad,Management is always looking out to get you in trouble or find a reason to make your work life harder. No support from management.
bad,"We should show up at 8 am for our meeting. This would take 10-20 minutes. We would then load up any equipment that we had ordered from the day before, get our first assignment, call the customer, and head out on the road. We would spend the entire day doing installations or repairs, depending on what came up in the queue. Our shift technically ended at 4:45, but I never got off before 5:30. It was usually more like 7:00. If you don't have a technical background, even with the training they give you, you're not going to succeed in this field."
bad,it was o.k. companymi had nice co-workers my supervisor was very cool. training was very engaging
bad,"I worked as a customer service rep.  When I first started at this company the job was pretty good. After the years went on, the job became much worse, they kept added more and more job duties until it became unbearable and I finally quit. Even though the pay was very good it just was not worth all the stress."
bad,"decent pay no job security specially if seeking to promote , you can promote but when budget or company does bad management (new) first to go seen so many people promote to get booted out"
bad,Regular schedule. Mandatory 6 day work week during peak times. Company truck and tools. Company provided extensive training. I learned quite a bit about telephone and internet service. My coworkers were great for the most part. There was a diverse workforce. Climbing poles and crawling through attics in the summer was rough. Working 70 plus hours a week did not leave much time for family. I did meet some cool people. The union wasn't very effective. Physically and mentally exhausting. Hard to get time off.
bad,For a company to be so large they treated the employees like they weren't important. I could have just been the area I was in though.
bad,"the overall experience working with this company has not been all bad.  the politics the behavior of the management staff. the favoritism within the company or aleast this branch. i was force to step down from my supervisor role to agent because i wish better my education "" stating that i did not bid to my accommodation"" in the same instance making whole work week changes for others. hiring new people to fill the position and giving schedule that will work with my  work/life balance. was not anything usually just start earlier on the days i have school"
bad,"typical corporate atmospher, employees are awesome management and upper managment leave a lot to be desired"
bad,"VXI is a call center with various campaigns. I worked for the largest one which was DTV. I was a supervisor for 2 years. This is a fast pace work environment with extreme varying pay. management is sub par and upper management doesn't care. If your a focused person you do have the opportunity for promotion, but that is sometimes not worth the extra work."
bad,Learned  about telecommunications.  More skilled with computer systems. Enjoyed the family atmosphere of with co-workers
bad,The Job is OK but the company is not good at all they work to make the job harder then it needs to be.
bad,A typical day at DirectV consisted of driving to customers home and installing satellite tv. I learned that if you don't like tight spaces then this is not the job for you. Management was ok and the coworkers where ok. The hardest part of the job was crawling into tight spaces and into attics. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting customers and providing them with a quality service.
bad,Unable to flow work and personal life together. Unable to move within the company.  No leverage or flexibility.
bad,"Ok place to work, but not quite the right place for military affiliated families."
bad,"A typical day at ATT Mobility would be described as back to back calls, you must finish the call you are on prior to adhering to your daily schedule but held accountable for adhering. You are scored by surveys from customers-are they willing to recommend the company is the hardest to achieve. You have to meet certain goals or you will be placed on warnings then eventually can lead to termination.  They do have mandatory overtime often so the work/life balance is horrid. The center climate is different from day to day, its very loud in the center and sometimes hard to hear customers. Customers are sometimes rude, swear at you, scream at you, etc.  and you have to stay on the call. The entire job is stressful. The only good things I have to say about ATT Mobility call center in Boardman, Ohio are they do have good compensation and benefits and sometimes you talk to very friendly customers that make you laugh/smile."
bad,"Hired on as a Premises Tech to install internet & cable TV. Training was a joke. 7 weeks of wasted time that doesn't prepare you for any of the things you need to know in the field. A week of pole climbing using shoe-spike harnesses they don't even stock at the garage. A week on how to train the customer to use the remote control, but they don't allow you enough time to do the training at an install."
bad,AT&T is not the company you want to work for its like you have to make changes to fit at&t. I wish i never worked here. This company cares only about there money not there customers or the employees. I will not recommend having service with them or even working for them. I told all my family members to leave at&t alone and to never go back.
bad,"Was fun to work for AT&T, but I will not work for Fair's AT&T (Authorized Dealer) ever again. Nor will I recommend any of my friends to work for them. They were not loyal to their employees. I had a store that had mold on the ceiling and leaks all around the store. They postponed trying to get me out of that location for a long time. I had customers complaining that I had to be in that store with the visible mold on the ceiling. I also was I an area where a lot of our customers didn't want to drive to, so my sales were hurt by that. I have been told that the company I worked for did go bankrupt, so I'm glad that no one will have to endure that situation."
bad,Your co-workers are your family and you will learn to work well with others or sink. Sometimes the products being installed were defective and peers would make the employee at fault and not their defective products for why the job would take to long to do. They do not compensate well for the good job done and hard work.
bad,"I worked as a sales rep for almost three years and in that time I had a new manager every six months. While I performed well, the constant changing nature of the job caused a lot of stress and at times became difficult to meet sales quotas. As things kept changing it became a daily occurrence to go against my moral fiber just to attempt to sell the products the corporation wanted to sell. When I started it was about getting the best solution for the customers needs, but when I left it was more about pushing services and products on people that didn't need it just to make more money."
bad,"It is draining, the job compensates for experience now, but if you already worked there, you are making significantly less than new people, and the duties of the position more than doubled.  They claim they have ways to work around your schedule, but It is hardly available, and if you are unfortunate enough to need FMLA of short term disability, they pull a lot of stunts to get rid of you.  They have you promote self service, which puts you job in jeopardy, but also the self service is confusing and has caused a spike in calls.  The job Is like a prison, the particular call center I worked in anyway, they did little to boost company moral, and it was a drag.  The first call center I ever worked in with no music, no winnable contest."
bad,"Very good service provider, good customer service just lacking vision. The cellular industry is not at a very good place right now for new growth,"
bad,"Since I have been at AT&T, I have fine tuned my customer service skills, my multitasking skills, my computer skills, and my typing skills.  In addition, I have learned how to, isolate and resolve customers' simple technical phone or  T.V. problems.  I am grateful for all that I have learned and gained from AT&T."
bad,"Will spend 95% of the time on the phone taking incoming calls."
bad,Answered calls from customers that wanted to disconnect service and provided them with discounts and rewards for loyalty to retain them. Also handled many billing issues. 
bad,"Do Not apply here unless you are very good at sales this job is not worth it, you are just another number and it is a time suck, "
bad,It was ok to work as a contractor for att but they did not focus on the well being of their contractors. It was ATT's way or the highway.  Had to practically be a robot in order to meet all requirements to receive the bonuses. 
bad,Company did not hire associates as needed which made my workload double and be almost impossible to handle
bad,"One needs to research online complaints to really understand how it was to work for this company. The compensation was all over the board with white people getting paid much more than others. Even those with fewer qualifications. The management was inexperienced. Managers were openly hostile to employees. There was racial abuse. The company has racked up quite a few EEOC complaints. Blacks had far less job security than others. Blacks would be routinely fired on the spot for trivial offenses whereas white associates weren't. Blacks were often passed over for promotions."
bad,"The pressure to sell was a little extreme for my taste. Management was present but a little to pushy for sales. They took the job out of it, and turned it into a competition.  I did learn new things about marketing, and I met a lot of great people. Wish them the best."
bad,"As a call center your getting on the phones providing customer service.  The management was not very great, they only do nice stuff for you if you brown nose.  If you don't and need a day off with a at lease 60 day advance you might not even get it."
bad,"Customer Service in Oakland, CA was unpleasant at best, life-threateningly stressful at worst."
bad,"Standard call center, demands a lot from you, schedules are ridiculous, high turn around. The people are nice, but managers are typically around 20-30 yrs of age and look down upon the younger generation. It is a constant ""popularity"" contest. However, if you are just getting your foot in the door of working (16-18) this would be a great job to show you what job NOT to get."
bad,Largely a friendly environment. But management is inflexible. Excel skills are much in demand and I learned to push mine to a high level.
bad,At&t would be my last choice. I really don't have much to say about the company. This was not one of my best experience. I would not go back to this company if I had a choice
bad,I assist customers in selecting great products to fit their needs.
bad,"Besides my coworkers, the place was ridiculous! The management was the worst management a company could have. Especially the two center managers. When I say Ghetto...it doesn't even come close. There was no professionalism whatsoever. The team managers were ""ok"" The only thing that was okay was my peers but even then they were okay. My suggestion would be if you could avoid working here then do it. but if you need a job then go ahead but don't make that place a permanent position! I gave that place 6 months of my life and that was way to long!"
bad,Would recommend job for current college students looking for decent pay and compensation who have a passion for wireless technology and sales driven pay structure
bad,"My day consist of telecommunication with sales and monthly quotas to meet, I sell AT&T products to multiple customers while mulitasking on twelve different systems at one time. The hardest part of the job is being micro managed. The most enjoyable part of my job is talking to the customers and making them feel important."
bad,"Pay and benefits was the only thing that kept me there as long as I was. A typical day included inbound and outbound calls pertaining to delinquent accounts. Management was basically non-responsive. Direct management was moody, never there, when she was there lacked any experience or knowledge of the her job or team members responsibilities. Concerns about inadequate leadership were brought to the attention of upper management by myself, co-workers, and her peers on numerous occasions to fall on deaf ears. Company lost many good people due to mismanagement, disrespect and neglect. There are many good managers in this location if only they were allowed to treat people as people instead of assets alone, only needed to make another dollar for the company."
bad,"Team environment, assisting customers with cell phone issues, processing payments, activated cell phones, issued rerates to billing issues"
bad,"AT&T could have been the place to retire from, but they outsource their jobs to other countries after making billions in the United States of America. They run their company with the Employer's Market attitude. In other words, they outwardly express that you should be elated to be an employee of their company despite some of the unrealistic goals that are set. There is a high turnover in employees that proves their insensitive outlook on human beings. They are only concerned with numbers."
bad,"Instalation and repair of telephone along with U-Verse systems for all customers, service and repair."
bad,I love the business setting however the company does not allow me to express my values to the extent that I want. I am a very goal minded seller and I leader searching for a company I will feel valued.
bad,"It's a great job with great benefits and opportunity, but it isn't for everyone. It's long hours, the managers micro-manage everyone, and they have fairly high expectations right out of the gate after training. Training is 8 weeks paid. If you can handle the long hours, the micro-managing, and make your quota numbers then go for it."
bad,"A typical day would be to help customers, help the sales reps make the goals of the day. Track all metrics and assist the team to increase sales. I learned that if you want to get promotes you need to kiss up. Hard work may not be noticed. Managers were strict in some stores and lazy in others. Area Managers were always playing games of bad guy good guy and giving the wrong messages to the sales reps which made the managers work more difficult. District Managers are cut throat and untrustworthy , you don't have enough fingers and toes to count all the non-sense that comes out her mouth. HR is useless and equally conniving. The hardest part of the job was the long hours. Many times I would close and have to open the next day. The most enjoyable was knowing that my ability to learn and get the experience I need would help me get a better paying job."
bad,I hated working for Directv. The hours are terrible. You have to work 6 days a week and the money is not as good as the time you have to put in. DO NOT WORK FOR THEM.
bad,They are like working for a country. Too big and bureaucratic and they dont care about the customer.
bad,"lots of stress and anxiety. they pay well because that is the only way to keep employees at this stress level. give unreachable goals and set timetables that does not allow for great customer service. no personal interaction with employees at all, just guide lines to follow."
bad,"When it was BellSouth Mobility employees were valued and recognized for their contributions. The merger to Cingular Wireless began a downward spiral slowly alienating its domestic workforce. Increasingly since the aquisition of the remaining AT&T assets and subsequent name change, AT&T has increasingly relied on outsourced call centers and reduced domestic staff. Equally AT&T has a history of closing company owned retail locations citing poor sales then allowing 3rd party agents to open, often leasing the same property and sell AT&T services. Frequently paying those agents more commissions than AT&T pays its own sales people. Absurd stats and nearly unattainable goals are put in place tremendously sacrificing customer satisfaction and pressuring its sales and customer service forces into attrition by termination or voluntarily quitting. This way AT&T does not have the negative publicity of wide spread layoffs."
bad,They fast track their management teams and instead of moving people up that have been there for years (I have not) they fast track college students through a training program. These people do not have the knowledge to run their own store.
bad,"Company used to pay very attractive commission and they took that away which was nearly 20 percent decrease in my income, took away free coffee, hot chocolate, took out every other light bulb in the office/call center. Took out Human Resources in our building, Also when I moved up in management, I made less money because the benefits for management cost a lot more than the union jobs there, AT&T tell everyone they are Union friendly, however they were very bad to bargan for and although they made double digit gains every quarter and billions of dollars in profit, AT&T said they had no money to give us raises because to the economy. They really screwed me over by not placing me back into my rightful postion after choosing to step down from mangement, however they were able to hire 20 + more poeple for the same job, (Jerks) and after 10 years tenure they let me go due to me being sick. Oh, they had very serious employee turn around, at times they would hire 60 to 90 employees a month, and my first year in the call center they had 98% employee turn around."
bad,Management pushed dishonest sales tactics to reach sales goals.
bad,"Career Advancement is political, and nominating for jobs internally are really null and void."
bad,"Hated every single minute of it. The training was great, but as soon as you got on the floor it was horrible. Everything was way to micro-managed."
bad,"Management was great, questions were always answered and issues were always resolved if any."
bad,"AT&T is a proud company. Depending what organization that you get into will determine how happy you will be. Some organizations in the company are overly focused for the bottom line. They will slap any warm body with a position despite the lack of knowledge just to fill the position only to later use that person as a scapegoat when things go south. On the other hand I know some people who have found meaningful work, more often, dealing directly with customers. Even that is bottom line driven though. If you are entertaining a position with the company just be sure that you know EXACTLY what the position entails, EXACTLY what is expected of you in what timelines, and to whom you will report."
bad,"Directv offers many entry level opportunities and is a great place to break into the corporate environment. The best part is anywhere you go after that is sure to be a step up. Seemingly too big to really care, you are simply a replaceable cog in a giant machine. Pay is okay, if you are living with mom and dad, but insufficient for anyone trying to support a family. The job is not difficult, however does require one meet strict call metrics and abide by an unwavering attendance policy. The most enjoyable part of the job was the day to day interactions with both customers and co-workers."
bad,Prem Techs have little to no work/life balance. Monthly scoring of your performance is inaccurate and misrepresented. Healthcare is the poorest I have seen in a long time. Lots of unnecessary stress.
bad,"Research is probably one of the worst departments to work at. Clock watchers, hourly micro management, no breaks and hardly anyone takes a lunch even. Would not work here unless i was a Director or above."
bad,"This post is only in relation to at&t relay center not at&t as a whole---the hours are awful, you have no life!!! The pay is even worse than the hours and there is no opportunity for advancement"
bad,atypical day at work would be a meeting in the morning then you have to go to your terf and make sales.
bad,The business closed down. There was a lot of unethical activity going on and now it is closed down
bad,If you like working in a call center with lots of calls and order on how your day will go down to the min. then here you go. Advancement in the company is by who you know and not what you know
bad,When your new to a company you want to learn as much as possible. When you have coworkers and managers scolled you for helping what you didn't know was your coworkers customer and to have be told you could do good if you worked at McDonalds if you want to help everyone is a bad place to work.
bad,"A typical work day consisted of taking about 40 calls. I learned about both the wireless and landline side of the company and how both of them work. Management did not know what they were doing a lot of the time and depending on what manager you go to, depends on whether your answer would be correct or not. Was sometimes a hostile environment, there was a lot of outside drama that people brought into work making it very uncomfortable for a lot of people. The hardest part of my job was feeling as if I let my customer down. The most enjoyable part was when I made my customers happy."
bad,I learned how to interact with people at all levels within the company. Also how to listen to the customer and do what I could to accommodate their requests.
bad,"Work there ONLY if you have no children or outside responsibilities going on. I have worked a couple of customer service jobs and this one by far was not worth the $$, which wasn't worth the drive or the stress. Benefits are spendy for a family, bosses are the worst about call avoidance, and if you have any personal issues going on, forget it, your out of there. You are a rump in the seat, selling programming to people who really don't want it. If you do not meet your quota, your out of there. Every day I spent there was making me mentally and physically sick."
bad,"This is a high stress level job that will leave you worried every month on meeting stats. The stress and worrying about your job makes you question the pay for having to deal with such. You must adapt quickly to change from one day to the next. This location has ""clicks"" of lazy, unprofessional managers. It has extremely high turnover. The benefits are decreased year after year. Unfortunately with the economy being so bad, this would be a job opportunity but, I am so blessed to not be working here any longer."
bad,"If mandatory six-day weeks with 10-12 hour days are your thing, this may be the company for you. If you like being burdened with rules and regulations that make no sense, you will like it here."
bad,Working as a CSR under multiple supervisors and managers is just like being in high school. It is full of drama and rumors. If you are willing to play the game it is a great place.
bad,"I worked at AT&T for two years and my experience was great until a change of management. I went into AT&T not totally sold that it was the right fit for me as many say that there is no work / life balance. I decided to take the opportunity as the manager who hired me assured me that my education would not take a side note to my full time position at AT&T. It was tough for about a year working full time and going to school in the morning, however the manager was then transferred out and the new manager was not so accommodating. She told me on numerous occasions that I could not go to school and that I should look into an online degree."
bad,AT&T is Horribly Managed
bad,"customers always upset and 9 out of 10 calls someone is yelling at you, your required to take those calls as a ""supervisor"", and very hard to move up in the company"
bad,"they would overwork the productive people while letting the others slack off because they were not allowed to say anything to them union"
bad,"At one point, I enjoyed working for AT&T but now they have cut the pay down drastically and the management is always changing. The commission is extremely low and you are expected to put in twice the amount of work for lower commission."
bad,Started out good but at the end company didnt care about their employees but the bottom line.  Pay wasnt bad but overall attitude was.  Wouldn't ever go back.
bad,"AT&T professionals were treated relatively well, but consultants who performed the same tasks, often with greater skill, were never given the opportunity to become FTEs.  Without warning, consultants were furloughed or reduced to part-time status even in CRITICAL Information security areas."
bad,"Frequent Layoffs, very stressful quotas, long hours, sales pressure, lack of recognition for hard work, pressured to push sales and increase sales production daily"
bad,Installing high speend internet tv and phone services. Troubleshooting AT&T products educating our customer. Installing fiber communication troubleshooting insternet services.
bad,"The pay is good, the managerial culture is cut throat. Numbers and metrics take precedent over all else.  The pressure placed on managers is definitely transferred to technicians.  Start work at 8am everyday but there is never a set time to when you'll be home as there is a work load to be cleared every day.  Recommend this line of work for bachelors, if married or responsible for children this will definitely be a tough position to hold."
bad,"I was miserable working at AT&T. The pay is good. But that's it. There's so many responsibilities and the rules are always changing so you're always at risk of possibly getting fired all because management does a poor job of getting everyone educated and trained on new policies, since they change so quickly. Home life doesn't exist. You'll spend your whole entire day here, even on weekends. The work culture is cool, because we had a lot of potlucks and work events. Great pay but not worth the headache. Super happy I quit."
bad,Even tho they say customer service they focus on sales only   Poor management.  Lots of favoritism and once you have been there for 5 years they look for reasons to get rid of you
bad,"Company cares more about their shareholders then employees, they do anything to maximize profits. No job security for their technicians, can lay you off when ever they want."
bad,The position paid well due to it having a Union force. I enjoyed working with my coworkers. The hours were very long and management treated us like numbers instead of people. Very very stressful position working for at&t. Very high priced services and rude clientele.
bad,The management sucked in every part of the company ATT stands for At This Time things changes all the time. They pay people to be in charge but the people in charge never know what they are doing.
bad,There was a division for sure although i loved working with the sales reps.  I would not work in this capacity again due to the politics associated with my position.
bad,Resultó buena empresa donde desarrolle conocimientos nuevos
bad,"You are a replaceable money making monkey and nothing more to them, while they preach they care, they cut pay/benefits and then tell you to be great full you even still have a job, it’s about the bottom line for Share holders, not employees or even customers"
bad,"I think the summary says it all. AT&T screws employess on one hand and customers on the other to fund overbloated salaries for incomptent executives. You better not fall behind on your stats or they'll ""bring you a box"", as they jokingly refer to their taco bell turnover rate."
bad,"Enjoyed my job, but management was terrible. They don’t treat you as a human. Would I go back, only for the money. Terrible environment, poorly trained managers no growth from certain positions unless you kiss major tail."
bad,Even though you have available time off you can not use it. If emergencies arise you are still pointed and/or terminated. All they care about is attendance regardless of time off needed and/or you have available.
bad,"In my short time with AT&T as a manager, there have been too many changes without a solid plan for the changes.  There is a lot of putting a plan in place and adjusting to the variables and things that do not go right after.  The medical benefits are great.  The pay is competitive, but feels low for the amount of expectations placed"
bad,"My total review of the company seems well at first, but the management was weak and lacked structure, I was looking for this job to be long term, but I always keep my options open."
bad,"Too many layers of management "
bad,When I worked at AT&T the manager was all about selling home security and Direct TV to make her numbers look good...and if you were not selling those items then she tried to get rid of you.
bad,"A typical day at work would be trying to manage employees that do not like to listen. When you go to area manager they do not listen either and it becomes a problem. Then you report to corprate and they say they will handle it and then they don't. So the employee continues to give out customer information and does illegal sales over the phone when nothing should be done over the phones and then I quite and they get shut down. typical workplace culture is usually friendly and nice, the most enjoyable part was helping customers save money and be happy with their service."
bad,If you work for T long enough you will be laid off or outsourced no matter your function or importance.  T is all about increasing the quarterly dividend - employees and customers be damned.
bad,"I can't wait to retire from the company!! Management sucks and employees are not treated fairly. Too much gossiping from employees, to managers to upper management. Always looking for a reason to take disciplinary actions against certain employees. ATT is not family oriented at all."
bad,20 years of service leave it at that. It takes 30 years for full retirement but they felt they needed to downsize  for shareholders seniority rules boo
bad,La administración de la empresa va en decadencia entras motivado y después de 1 año ya te quieres salir
bad,"Management sucked. Ruined the job for me, the entire team was toxic. Took all the enjoyment away. I would love to work for them again, but never again as a sales rep."
bad,"This role is definitely for the young at heart and physical capability to lift 80 lbs. of weight required, also will  working under a time constraint to complete work quality work."
bad,It was difficult to balance work life and personal life working here.  Unfortunately statistics and sales percentages are far more important than actual customer satisfaction.  Poor support by local management.
bad,I appreciated the opportunity to learn and be a part of a great company. I really felt that there were a lot of good things that out weighed the bad. Overall it was a ok experience.
bad,The management was all about sells. There is no customer service involved at all. Either make a sell on every call no matter what or you will be talked to about it.  At & t does not care about customers just making a sell.
bad,The particular office in downtown Dallas (HQ) where I worked was a mess. Very disrespectful people and it was just the worst company I have ever worked for in my life.
bad,"Tiene áreas de crecimiento y el ambiente es tranquilo para laborar, pero hace falta apoyo de los supervisores para lograr metas de produccion"
bad,very stressful very cut throat. lots of hours you dont get paid for.  times get stressful and management isnt very supportive.  very little training given and discipline is handed out daily.
bad,"everything you do is scored and it need to be at minimum of 95% or you get in trouble, not enough money , too much pression, work list of the week is crazy the amount of account it will drive you crazy"
bad,"The company has a good compensation plan and THE BEST BENEFITS!! However the center i worked in was terrible. Everything contradicts itself, and some mgrs dont know how to help since they dont stay up to date with policy changes. 99% of the mgrs get irritated when you ask for help. The amount of mistakes that comes from all departments is ridiculous."
bad,"... it’s probably because you can’t find a better job in the area. It’s a sales +commission deal. If you’re the kind of person who thrives in that environment, you probably aren’t uncomfortable with doing the kinds of things required to make your sales goals. In my case, my managers asked me to tamper with people’s credit check info to make sure we were able to meet the goals. I left because I was uncomfortable with this and other not-so-legal practices."
bad,Productive communication company that covers part on the US wired and all of the US wireless. AT&T has installed one the largest fiber optic network across the US.
bad,It was ok  management was terrible  never know when you’re getting off work if you like long hours and hot temps with very little supervision  it’s right up your alley
bad,N/A. Overworked underpaid. A dinosaur stuck in  the past with no room for reinventing itself. It is stuck is the past with completing financial tasks and not looking into the future for better more efficient methods.
bad,"company doesn't value employees worth, managers are young with no experience and no people skills. new employees should never think they would retire with 30 years"
bad,Great pay but it will suck out your soul and they will fire you and not even  care how long you have been there or how good of an employee you are. It is all about quantity not quality there and how they can save money.
bad,"Don't waist your time. The job started off with high expectations and I felt lucky to be a part of such a huge name recognizable company. But each year on the mobility side, the company expected more from the employees but gave nothing in the return. In fact as the company expected more from their employees they managed not to compensate at all. For example health insurance cost went up each year  but we were given less coverage. Commission was uncapped then they capped it. We were able to track your sales then they took the tools away for that to. Everyone including directors was sleeping with their employees and when you complained there was either retaliation or they turned a blind eye. Employees became irate, morale was down, and employee's felt sick and walked on egg shells all day believing that they was going to be fired any minute. I wouldn't put my Worst enemy through AT&T mobility department."
bad,The appearance of the culture greatly differs from the actual culture of the company. Upper management is difficult to talk to . There is no work/life balance
bad,"AT&T does a reorganization at least twice a year resulting in what's called a ""surplus."" What that means for an employee is that you get to stress out at least twice a year for weeks as to whether or not you will have a job or not. It is not based on performance or tenure. It is nerve wracking and does not in any way foster a positive working environment."
bad,"I had a decent time at AT&T but often I felt like the management has an agenda that wasn’t shared with the employees. Goals set were often organizational but not individual and mandatory training took up a lot of work hours without overtime, having no impact on my actual job."
bad,Very stressful place all about the numbers don't care about the customer the employees were fun to work with but the upper management always looking for ways to get rid of you
bad,Schedule is never the same if they run out of work they send you home with less pay. If there is too much work you could be working till 11 pm at night.
bad,"My typical day is extremely hectic, stressful supervising a team of 5."
bad,when i first started i was with Directv and the work environment there was good. We regularly had group functions in and outside of work and you got to know your piers on a personal level. With ATT unfortunately that is not the case. This company makes you feel more like a number then an important part of the business.
bad,None I DNT like it very unprofessional it was t a good job to wrk for everything was not good late nites no way home job DNT care about you or family.
bad,"This job started out great but then they started to give us wire techs way more work in the day and expect us to make the appointments on time. They also make it very difficult to replace old tools or add new tools that will help with work. Tools were always easy to order if needed then they removed that privilege. The managers are required to order the tools we need, they have been overworked and they do not have the time to order. They also make it very difficult to replace old tools or add new tools that will help with work. They expect fast work in 100-degree weather."
bad,There is no PTO time until 6 months on the job and no sick time available. Pay is good but no work life balance and the job is very stressful with no breaks to truly take care of your mental wellness with dealing with customers anger and verbal abuse daily from customers and some staff.
bad,"My Career at AT&T was very rocky and uncertain, I entered my last position at AT&T as a technician and towards the end of my career due to many reorgs, layoffs, large amounts of employees quitting, and the unawareness of management my job duties and responsibilities where that of four or five people, I was literally in charge of things that I was not avidly trained to do nor was I comfortable doing."
bad,"Terrible managers, age discrimination and they find a way to force you out if you have gray hair. Forced out male employees are being replaced with female employees."
bad,Wasn't for me . I don't take joy in trying to finesse people out of their money. Definitely good for people who like to sell things people don't need.
bad,"Managers were more concerned with making money than helping their employees. There is not a real way to advance in the company as a LSR. Good pay, bad environment."
bad,"Decently compensated job. However the company always changed policies, and management. Being that you go in with lowest seniority, work life takes up about 90% of you life due to scheduling l preferences."
bad,Don’t expect to be treated fairly or have any type of home life.  Hourly employees are treated like dirt by this new AT&T and would rather lay people off than pay better.
bad,"Was a great place to work at first then, the benefits cost went up and the comp. went down, and they’re never satisfied. Also they fired a lot of people that did installs and still are for about a year now."
bad,"Los encargados son muy soberbios y no les importa mucho su equipo de trabajo, más aparte de exigen mucho (resultados rapidos) y te dan poco para trabajar."
bad,Big company vibe that cares more about the company than it does the employees. I feel the employees should be better accomodated. Employees are secondary
bad,"it a good compensation but for the amount of work they require you to do for this job isnt worst it. have to learn like 6-7 different system (program) and listening to complaining about how att fool them in to there contract is very depressing ( retention is the worst) and definitly no work life balance for people in school , kid etc"
bad,The pay is not worth the work. The work-life balance is sub-par. The skills are not readily transferable. The older you become the less valuable u are.
bad,Since AT&T accrued the most debt of any private company ever the company has really taken a turn for the worse. The hours are not set in stone and you never know when you will get to go home. They are not providing adequate material for the job. The job is very stressful and you will be required to follow new guidelines weekly. The pay is good but overall there is no growth opportunity in Austin and the job just generally isn't worth the trouble.
bad,I was there for nearly 3 years and capped out at 9.50. I asked and was always given the runaround. The management team was horrible. They only cared when the head people were coming for a visit.
bad,"STAY AWAY, not worth the money.....  if only the management weren't so over bearing things might have been different but the entire company as a whole is extremely corrupt and corporate your in a constant fear of your job. Even with a union nobody is safe"
bad,"AT&T has many positive aspects such as benefits, pay for a non-degree person and freedom on the job. The downside is they do not care about their employees, work/life balance is not existent, and employees are not given any extra pay or incentives for having more skills than your peer."
bad,"I have worked in large companies before, but AT&T's culture was the most non-inclusive, separatist, and non-progressive I've ever seen. They did not have active ERGs for women, ethnicities, or any lifestyle preferences, As a working mother, I was disappointed to find that there were no lactation rooms. Professional development has to be 'approved' by your manager, so if your manager didn't agree with your career interests they would deny your growth activities - and you had no recourse."
bad,Greed based company. Work life balance is not conducive for family.  As a field technician you are not allowed to leave work till they tell you that you can can go home. Great benefits and paid time off.currently laying off employees that work in the field so job security is quite low currently.
bad,I am not going to say anything bad about any former employer. There is a possibility that someone may read it and I would not like to get into that situation.
bad,Working with at&t was stressful. New rules daily. Training didnt touch on most of the stuff like fibre optic .but the managers would write you up for not knowing stuff or not completing a job within a given period of time
bad,Terrible looking call center. Stressful environment and unrealistic metric goals. No room for advancement and the site was often dirty. Average pay and difficult calls.
bad,"If you love door to door sales this job is for you! I wouldn't recommend this job to my worst enemies. The job is very stressful. You sit in the provided company car going door to door on installs from AT&T techs who are there to install wifi, tv services and they don't like you interrupting their work space but you have to pitch and attempt to sale wireless services. The management can not afford to have a work/life balance and you have to call them after every interaction and see why you didn't sell anything and what you could of ask or do to be better on your next visit. Salary gig and they expect you to work after your shift to get leads."
bad,Layoffs are prevalent every quarter. Positions are removed and yoyr.given a choice to find a new position or be laid off. Not the best long term company.
bad,Absolutely no job security even though you are represented by a union.  The company is constantly downsizing and there is very little chance of advancement.
bad,"If the boss doesn't like you, you'd better hit the top in every category every month. phones, tablets, hot spots, home security, accessories, business lines, business apps, DirecTV, DirecTV Now. Missing just one, could mean a write up even if the entire sore or district missed the target and you were the top performer.  It was great in the beginning but by the end I was glad to leave."
bad,"Store is dead. They say “uncapped commission” but thing is, you have to even make it with no customers. So youre getting base hourly with is 9/hr. Not enough for anything that anyone has to pay for. On top of that any commission you do make gets taken, because in order to get your commission you have to meet your monthly goals which will never happen, because of no customers. If you make $100 and only get 5% of your goals guess what?  Youre only getting 5% of your commission. No money there, unless you wanna make your life into thinking about AT&T 24/7 and harassing people to buy stuff, even when they dont wanna hear it. So since there’s barely any customers you sit around THEN get complaints on why you dont have sales. Place is unreal. Just get a good paying hourly position elsewhere."
bad,"often worrying about weather or not i will have a job next month, or even when i will have time with my family. company is hardheaded and unwilling to negotiate"
bad,Never know if you'll have a job next week. The bigger they grow the less they care. All about the bottom line. Your only a number to them. over 500 of my position surplused just in CA yesterday
bad,"although it paid ok and good benefits, always had to look over your shoulder and wonder when it was your turn to get laid off. no based on performance. based on serniority."
bad,"They dangle the carrot in front of your face for lead Tech position while you have performed the job for 4 years, and then tell you to prove that you are doing all that is claimed."
bad,"Not paying good"
bad,"If you are a driven sales person, you will find success. Be prepared for constantly changing goals and initiatives. Upward mobility can be a slow process with many setbacks, and you should be willing to relocate."
bad,Managers are inconsistent and micromanage you until your pushed to your limits the eventually want to quit. They say they are there to help you but fall back on their word and just talk about people instead of keeping your work life a positive experience.
bad,"Basically I would assist the customers with billing, payment and or tech support. I learned how to process payments and credits. Management was horrible and so was the workplace culture. The hardest part of the job was dealing with management. The enjoyable part was creating a great relationship with the customers."
bad,"I did not like working for AT&T call center. It was long and stressful days. Some days were mandatory overtime , which was fine, but management did not take in considerations of prior plans."
bad,"Job is okay for young people, but not for someone with a family or that is trying to have a good work/ life balance. Management could be trained better or game-planing with reps better as well."
bad,"Sales driven job . Customer service with everyone.  You have to be able to work well with others. You have to be used change, memory is a must , to memorize all the different plans and prices."
bad,"Dissolved entire AdWorks. I was only there for 6 months and the division was losing money quarter over quarter. They eliminated the entire unit,and decided to start over from scratch."
bad,The main issue I had with this company is having to work on the weekends. It didn't matter how long you worked there it was expected to work at least one if not both weekend days.
bad,Att where I worked needs to listen more to their employees needs and offer a more stable environment and not focus soo much in disciplinary action. Also some managers favor more women and people who are the same nationality.
bad,Much better companoes to work for on the tech side terrible managment and forced overtime no life and work balance they expect u to work like a slave the work isnt bad and neither is the wages and benifits but terrible work environment
bad,"When you first start working for AT&T you have these high expectations about the company. Overall poor management, low compensation, and stressful environment."
bad,"As a premium technician, they are laying off many workers, it is a fast pace and stressful job. The union (CWA) has a contract that is up for renewal for a year which we haven't bargained yet. Att expects techs to go above and beyond the contract without any addition compensation. Horrible comparison to work for. Like the stock though for investments."
bad,AT&T is a good place to work for college students looking to keep the bills paid. There are very few opportunities to advance and you are basically stuck being on the phone and talking to customers.
bad,Going to work everyday not knowing what the future holds in terms of job security is a real bummer. Our CEO publicly stated he want's to fire 2/3rds our workforce. The union is useless and has been with out an updated contract almost a year since the last expired. Management has a quota of techs they need to fire if not enough fired they will continue to do layoffs.
bad,Not good enough didn’t like it horrible experience from the moment they hire you they try to fire you not good advancement rude people no good training
bad,"managers do not seem capable of there jobs, no moral, policy and procedures have way too many loop holes.very inconsistent training and answers to questions about the job and policies."
bad,My manager was very rude and very drunk. I was called stupid at work so yes I walked out on shift. My manager didn’t take me serious and he didn’t care about his employee.
bad,"The pay is GREAT but its not worth the stress and depression of the job. Management doesnt want to do their job, the AM that is on site on care about sales numbers. This is NOT customer service AT ALL it is strictly sales and IF you can help out the customer in the process lucky them if not the comoany does NOT care just sales. Your customer could be calling for someone thag recently passed and they want you ask if they would like broadband so they could stay connected from heaven. This place is like a sweatshop. They pay you a nice amount to use and abuse you. They show favortism and top sellers can do what they want no rules apply to them while those who work just as hard but isnt as lucky with sales is trash to them. This place is always hiring because they DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU PERIOD"
bad,"You can give it your all and perform well in review after review. You can save the company millions of dollars, paying your salary until retirement. Unfortunately, this will not secure your job."
bad,company is corporate driven and places little value on employees. Training is minimal and expectations are high. Same amount of work is expected from someone with 1 year compared to someone with 10
bad,"As an AT&T Wire Technician you learn so many new skills and meet so many people! But the conditions of the company change so much. The rules and perks for technicians change and they continue to make things harder and create more ways for you to be terminated. The job can be very stressful and challenging at times, but it wouldn't be that bad if management wasn't so pressed to push you harder than you can go. There was a time where we could do our jobs peacefully and only dealt with management when we needed something or we weren't doing our job well. The money is nice along with the perks and discounts, but the stress will distance you from everything, including family. This job is more for a single man, but for the married men, unless you hate being at home, this isn't for you."
bad,Its a meat factory.  Got a pulse? Hired.  If union contracts are in negotiations and you sneeze?  Fired. It's a very hostile environment with no integrity.
bad,Management always pushed upselling to customers.  Always had to work a weekend day and never knew when I was getting off work.  Pay was per install so never knew what each paycheck would be.
bad,"Management was apathetic and did not care for the goings on of the techs home life or needs of their families, what mattered were meeting arbitrary and ever changing number scales.  The numbers were near impossible to maintain as many of the causes of lower numbers were out of the techs hands.  This did not stop management from trying to come down with punishment on techs though.  The union here is a necessary evil.  They protect mediocrity while protecting some who really are just trying to get by."
bad,This department is terrible to work in. No time for personal life or family with required overtime. Job scope is subject to change at anytime without warning and does not provide any compensation for additional skills or changes.
bad,"Very stressful"
bad,"Typical week, 5/6 day rotating week. Massive workload. Training programs improved since I got there, but they really throw new people to the wolves, 2-3 weeks of in class setting training then 2 weeks with mentor in field then you're on your own to install, troubleshoot and upgrade old systems by yourself. Very steep learning curve even for someone who is a quick learner. "
bad,"Good company , lots of technologies utilized, but lots of vendors connected to lots of people working there. For some folks only inter-personal communication skills matter and not professional ones. Some folks hardly follow any ethical guidelines and yet they are in good positions ,thanks to their personal relationships."
bad,"At&t was an awesome place to meet great people and work with some of the brightest individuals I know. My co-workers were like family and worked well with each other from helping with customer transactions to also help one another get certain sales to maintain our monthly goals. "
bad,"A few managers were great to work with, however, most are more worried about their bonuses than actually training you to become better. You have to make a sales offer on every call, even if they are calling in because of a disaster in their life (death, etc.) This is a job that burns you out quickly."
bad,"Directv was wonderful and treated employees like family, but once AT&T took over everything changed. "
bad,"not impressed, toxic workplace, reduced workhours, management did not care for employees. more towards sutherland as an employer. learned a little to make me ready"
bad,AT&T company culture was very stressful. They treat every employee as though they are disposable. I know many individuals that had health issues due to the high stress environment.
bad,we had to wait for the company to release the work for the day.we would sometimes work as a team because the jobs would be bigger then what one tech could complete in the allotted timeframe.
bad,"The job itself was relatively easy.  I have many years of customer service in the Pipeline Pigging industry so I had no problems talking or trying to help customers out with their phone issues or billing issues."
bad,"Started out good, union contract ended and so did the good money. By the end the business was completely different with a different motive behind it. Not a place I'd like to be."
bad,"AT&T is a perfect example of a company way too in over their heads, ever since they took over directv, its been nothing but bad decisions on managements end, just when you think its going to get better the next ridiculous policy comes out making things only worse, morale is at an all time low, our office had some 160 technicians, in the past year over half have quit because of bad decisions coming from company decisions and management decisions, AT&T also made the opportunity for advancement crystal clear by keeping just the bare minimum of employees on any level by cutting a lot of positions in the company and over working the rest without any indication of hiring or giving the opportunity to advance your career."
bad,This  job is were I received all my customer service skills also my computer skills. This job was the first time I worked with different computer systems.
bad,I was hired directly into a college new hire program in Tucker GA and while I had a lot of fun and made friendships that will last a lifetime the management was not great.
bad,"They let me create a department and then made someone else a manager of that department, and kept me as a regular employee and I managed the team while the manager booked appointments for his dance studio"
bad,You will work crazy hours and 60 hour weeks. They promote within a lot but they will work you like crazy. The benefits aren't bad but the promotions work like high school.
bad,"Good place to start and learn skills, but they treating people poorly . "
bad,"Company used to be a good place to work for but things have drastically changed. No room for advancement, union without a contract, no pay increases, plans to reduce work force,..."
bad,"No regrets leaving this place. I gained nothing but stress. First and only time I will ever work for a union. Training took way too long, hard to advance when you take no pride in your work. "
bad,"Constant nagging about sales. It was a great place to work when it was customer service, now all they care about is selling ... NO MATTER WHAT. Too stressful and cut throat for me. Upper management is terrible too."
bad,"Good life/work balance. Outstanding team mates and team approach to getting the mission done. The balance between work and home is great. 100% virtual, running projects all over the world on the IBM network."
bad,"Stressful and management wasn't open to ideas.  Be sure to ask a lot of questions about reviews, attendance, promotions, career opportunities. Be sure to ask about training also"
bad,"Good training. Good team work. Cafeteria was good. Coworkers were kind, caring, and helpful. Several discounts for employees. Option for pet insurance was nice!"
bad,Management is done from the tippy top down. Employees who actually are face to face with customers have no say in anything at all. Expect to be micro-managed and driven insane.
bad,"ATT bought out DIRECTV and as soon as that happened,people were let go and dropping like flys . Directv was a great company to work for but when ATT took over everything was different. The ""family"" feeling was gone and they just treated you like just another employee"
bad,"It's hard to find a better paying job for someone with no experience in the field, the benefits and discounts are good, and the people are great to work with. With that being said, the stress that comes with the job just wasn't worth it. Almost every manager there either didn't know what they were doing/talking about, or they were just terrible to work for. There were unrealistic expectations for almost every metric. Poor customer service from AT&T as a whole leads to upset and frustrated customers who take their frustrations out on you just because you're there and the people on the phone in India aren't. The hours are unpredictable. You can't plan to do anything on a day you're working because you never know when you'll get off. I can't recommend this job to anyone with a family or a social life."
bad,ATT is a large international corporation and you will advance if you can fit within the corporate mold.  Not much room for individualism or for not being PC.
bad,it is a numbers driven job with high turnover and unrealistic goals was not unusual to see 2 or 3 people fired in a singel day for not reaching sales goals for one month
bad,"Worked as an installer. Long hours, driving 90 min away to find a customer cancelled install and no pay for it. Long hours not equal to pay. Stressful job. Only benefit was free satellite if you are allowed to install it."
bad,It was very productive it was a growing experience I learned very important situational skills also learned important social skills I am a quick learner so that helped me a great deal in training
bad,Company is designed to be able to get rid of you at any given time unless you're a perfect human being that doesn't forget anything ever. Completely dependent on who/how your manager is as a person. Micro-management and fuels their technicians with scare tactics of being fired daily which is the only upside to having a union but the union is a sham and doesn't care for you unless you're actually friends with a steward or rep.
bad,"I worked for 4 months as a Sales Representative door to door and had so many applicants but very few that qualifed due to bad credit, no qualification no money"
bad,Ever since they got rid of the SSR position this job is super hectic for any ASM or RSM its not the same. I loved this job as an RSC so if entering the company I highly suggest don't rush think of advancing unless you are lucky to go to corporate. Even then you get burnt out very quick. They keep you stuck with good benefits but you can get that anywhere.
bad,"It's not the worst job if you need something that pays more than minimum wage, but it's far from the best. It's stressful and the management is awful, the culture is cut-throat, very few there will think even once before stabbing you in the back or throwing you under the bus."
bad,There was always outside the building and that I had to pay for parking. I had to work a mid shift. Then it would be dark at night walking to the car.
bad,Every supervisor is different some are good and some are bad. I had a bad one. No work-life balance. Pay is decent but not worth it to work there. I would not recommend it.
bad,"call center work, tough selling environment. customers call and complain, yell and disrespect employees. hard to sell with unhappy customers, if able to make a sell compensation for sells are really great."
bad,I was the top performer for them. It was Cingular wireless first then At&T took over. I worked very hard and fast paced. I was very competitive because of commissions. I lived on commissions based salary was low. There was lot of favoritism going on and I was not part of it.
bad,the  job  have become  very stressful and  the  moral  was very  low  no  consistency  at  all  and  my  loyalty  to  a company  for  18 years  i  view  as  being un appreciated
bad,"A typical day at work consists of installing and repairing network services.  Customer interaction and education,  Also operating a company vehicle. Troubleshooting and utilizing test tools to better serve customers."
bad,"I worked here for many years. Coworkers were awesome. I had a lot of fun. Initially, I made a lot of money. Commissions later changed. They were unattainable."
bad,"Very little job security, even after 20+ years at the company.  Company doesn't value managers with high employee ratings and keeps the ones that are only good at managing UP."
bad,"very cut throat, they treat you like a child with all the roll plays and coachings. the management sits with you and watches your every move and micro manages what you say or do."
bad,It's OK to work for them. Nothing interesting to share. It's a job with telecom company and you are expected to do the work. Management styles can vary a lot.
bad,"I thought that working at att was alot of stress and all the rules changed when they took over Dtv. didnt care how they affected the employees, pay rate, or how they treated them."
bad,Never in the same place always moving from job to job but great if you like being outdoors.management is ok. Learned a lot about fiber placement. Working with a crew is the best and worst at times. Hardest part is working on the poles climbing is easy staying up is hard. Best part is being outside
bad,you will never see you family.. too many hours. They have way too many expectations that are unrealistic. Very late and long hours. Did not enjoy having to come home and still work on my work ipad after clocking off.
bad,"I was really looking forward with working with AT&T. The pay is awesome and benefits also. The biggest problem is the switch they do after hiring you.I was offered customer service and placed in loyalty. I was told that managers help develop you for current position and promotion others, not true.  They have some employees that have worked for DTV for 10 years plus so there is no opportunity to move up in the company"
bad,The hardest part of the  job was the numerous service calls. Going to customers homes that were promised services that the company does not provide. Hard work was not appreciated by management.
bad,They make anybody a manager here. The training portion of the job is 2 dreadful weeks long. The actual training on the floor with customers is a joke.
bad,"A typical day consist of you clocking in and being hounded by managers about sales goals, Directv pressure and how to get them to sign up. I even had a manager say ""When a customer walks in IDK why employees think phone sales, they need to think DTV sales. We are no longer a phone store."" Why do we sell phones for then?? Payout is horrible for anything but DTV even though almost none install (you only get paid if it installs). "
bad,ATT used to be a very good company to work for. They have cut off a lot of benefits and the Union do not stand behind when you have 18+ years and you have a meeting saying you are being Surplus. Att makes a lot of money and they don't consider us when the CEO and managers get bonuses.
bad,"The Premises Technician job (or IEFS Technician as its called now) has some good points.  This job comes with good benefits.  You also are working and managed by yourself most of the time which is nice.  As long as you are where you are supposed to be and doing your work efficiently you can minimize the stress this job can have.   Many of the customers encountered are nice and grateful for the work that is done.  That about sums up the good points."
bad,"Decisions are made with no regard to the field, managers are forced to just go along with decisions and push them down. They don't like push back or questioning decisions. The environment is adversarial between union and non-union with both parties to blame."
bad,"The retail channel at every cell phone company is changing because the retail field is changing.  That means several cutbacks and changes in commission structures (which usually means a decrease overall).  There is poor communication between departments at AT&T, and it is nearly impossible to get anything accomplished, which is extremely frustrating day-to-day.  This is a classic corporation that favors corporate greed over employee satisfaction, although they will pretend very well to care about employees.  If you can stay out of retail, do it; retail won't exist much longer at AT&T."
bad,"The call center was originally Directv, then bought by AT&T. Downhill from there. Received no raise in 14+ months as an AT&T employee. Company was strict and very metric driven. Focus on customer satisfaction was non-existent."
bad,"I was ecstatic about being contacted and offered this position.  The gentleman that contacted me had great confidence in me for this position.  "
bad,Micro-managed by area manager who did not have any people skills. Needed coaching in writing up reviews. Treated his subordinates unfairly. Had favoritism. EEO violator. Weak HR. Strong politics.
bad,"Stressful work environment.  Must be able to sell, sell, sell to (Direct TV and/or Internet) to customers that are irate when they call.  Does not matter how long you have been with them, if you don't make a sales quota, you are replaced with younger generation"
bad,I did not enjoy my time at his company.  The management was overbearing.  You weren’t allowed to go to the bathroom unless scheduled.  You had to get FMLA for a cold if you didn’t want a write up.
bad,"my last  manager made it well worth it, the hours are to long and the training sucked, The customers are not serviced properly and teh ideals of teh higher management really sucks.,"
bad,At&t will pay you more then any other retail position but it will cost you dearly overall so it's something to do for a few years to change your circumstances but unless you are able to compartmentalize your morality on a grand scale it's an unpleasant company to grow with long term.
bad,"they only care about sales, hence they won't care to write you up if don't meet your quotas. you expected to be on the floor and offer all product and services and push certain products."
bad,I hate it. Every one i know has been fired or quit. And i mean hundeds fired. We lost 46 just last month. We are counseled about what we did wrong every week sometimes 2x a week. And you have always done something wrong. There are so many rules and regulations and policies u cannot do any calls witout looking up what you need to know.
bad,"When you work for AT&T, they have their own guidelines, their own set of troubleshooting tools and scripts that you can't deviate from. Not every troubleshooting issue is the same and sometimes requires some ""out of the box"" thinking, which they didn't allow."
bad,"Here's the deal with ATT.  All they care about is money. As you can see, they are becoming a monopoly again. Buying up competition, and cutting jobs to pay for it. People say it's a good place to work, but if your department contract sucks you have no cushion for the eventual surplus fall. There is job security if they are constantly surplusing people."
bad,"management blows, they target certain people and if they don't like you, then you are targeted. With me it was age discrimination, but misconduct was used in my termination. I left my company phone home. With my prior managers I had no issues. New manager came in to ""fix us""(didn't know we were broken). All of a sudden my vehicle doors weren't locked and so forth. He was an admitted ""sneaky SOB""."
bad,"received 75 to 100 calls daily regarding questions about the bill. I would explain and the educated the client about our products and services and sale the product."
bad,Was there for almost 5 years and it went down hill every year.  Commission decreases every year some time by almost $500 a month.  Unrealistic goals for our store that cost every team member.
bad,"they have bad hiring rate looses employees frequently no actual direction and management needs management skills no one was organized  work ethics describe are not work ethics applied account ""hiccups"" everyone is on it one way or another thatch why management hardly derails"
bad,company this big was hard to make a difference.  my role was only for few months do did not get the experience it fully.  I am sure it would be a good company to work for.
bad,"I hate to write a bad review about the company I work for but I also have to be truthful. AT&T does not have much a future in Michigan, so there are very few advancement opportunities. The attendance policy is very strict. You do get 80 hours of vacation time and 56 hours of personal time off, every year but there has to be time available in the schedule for the day you choose. You get 40 hours of sick time but unless your sick time is FMLA approved it will be a chargeable absence, meaning you get paid for it but you also get a write-up. The company doesn't invest in employees who don't generate revenue. For example, sales reps get a lot of incentives but employees in tech support rarely get anything."
bad,"A typical day @ ATT Rantoul, Il.  walking up to poorly kept grass and spider webs hanging from ATT sign. Seeing 35 cars outside in cracked and weed-filled potholes throughout the entire operational daily hours 7a-9pm. This is 2 story building located on abandoned Airforce base but the 1st floor was taken out of our lease agreement so downstairs one side of building in the corner they have new 10 trainees and another side scarcely spaced out there are about 50 reps for morning or evening shifts."
bad,"Commission rate decreases every year while you still have to sell many things you don't get paid for like accessories 2% before tax."
bad,The hardest part of the job was working with an Area Manager that was never held accountable for anything that person did but held others accountable.  The most enjoyable part of the job was team members because always had a competition going against the next team which brought a lot of excitement to the job.
bad,"I enjoyed working with customers and doing my job, but the management was very bad. You are judge on you time and QC of your job. The job of the first line manager is to write you up no matter how much you had satisfied customers."
bad,"Customers are rude, managers unhelpful. Paid a living wage for the area, but not nearly enough for what you do. You, along with every other employee are expendable. Would not recommend."
bad,"Cons:"
bad,"The pay and the benefits with this job is great, however there is no job security.  This was a very stressful job, they were so focused on sales instead of providing good customer service to their customers.  Having to wonder everyday if you have a job was very stressful. Management did not care about the employees and to be told that your center will be secure one month only to be told the next month that the center will be closing for good, giving minimal options to relocate at such short notice very unprofessional."
bad,"The company has a solid reputation, but unfortunately the current culture is one of misinformation and dishonesty. Employees are held goals that unrealistic and out-of-touch with consumer wants and needs. Very hard on work / life balance."
bad,"Didn't like being in sales, didn't always believe that we were offering the best to our customers.  More focused on sales than taking care of customers."
bad,dont work here unless you need to make cash in a matter of 5 months . worst job I ever worked never ever work here againl. This job does pay very well. High turn overate
bad,They don’t allow you to have a voice.  Say yes sir and yes ma’am and you will do well.  All jobs are predecided on who will get them.  Play the game and you will do well
bad,"I worked at the call center for 2 years and it started out extremely fun and productive but overtime they changed their dynamic and become focused slowly on how much money you could make for them. Their people were no longer important to them. SALE SALE SALE i all you needed to do and when you were falling a little short within a 14 day period, they not only reprimanded you, you were asked to resign or were constantly told ""this just isnt the place for you""....it became a very discouraging place to work. Turn over rate is very high."
bad,It is a fast paced stressful environment that can quickly swallow you up.  The days are long and they are filled with many stressful situations with a lack of proper guidance for the employees.
bad,"at work typically, i did worked on the store until actually customers came in. the foot traffic was very slow and the way they run they business is very shady."
bad,"Have to work constantly, at least in a high volume store. Managers only focus on driving numbers. No focus on career development, integrity, or operations.  Extremely unprofessional system of coaching. Company is very focus on growth in the industry, but do not have the infrastructure to support the sales. At least not regarding the home solutions. Environments are very aggressive. Very competitive in store and across various channels."
bad,I worked on the land line side of at&t. Due to technology advancements land line phone and internet are becoming antiquated and the company does not want to train us in new technology.
bad,"You are just a body with AT&T.  The company policy is that once your shift starts, you have no family or emergencies.  You belong to the company and you better have someone else take care of it.  If there is a personal emergency, they wont let you know.  Your family cant contact you. You are pressured to sell with no concern for the customer' needs or budget."
bad,"Very unfair the way they treat their employees, I don't miss the stress assisted with the job or company. They don't give an employee a chance to be sick if they can't move from pain they are still expected to be in a chair taking calls"
bad,"you answer phone calls and help att customers with their bills, my manager didnt really want to help me make my phone calls better, wouldnt answer my questions about accounts"
bad,"I worked for AT&T for 9 years and when I first started I was so sure I would make it a career when I finished with school. I even participated in a Management Development Program, shortly around the time I graduated the program, the company began to change. They were focused more on quick promoted and weeding out those who had been with the company longer and were receiving max pay on their hourly. Management at my particularly were people who had spent less and less time with the company and were intimidated by the tenured representatives and began making trouble for us. Once I made my mind up to just transfer out of the area, the manager was putting a stop to every request but telling me she had no idea what was going on. I eventually had to leave the company. AT&T has gone through rounds of surplus and from what I understand it could be coming back around. So be careful! From my experience, I wouldn’t recommend AT&T because the higher ups really don’t care about what’s going on at the store level and unless I get a solid connection with one of them, you could be stuck in a sales rep position with higher goals for yourself"
bad,It was a very stressful place to work. Management changing requirements from month to month so you never knew what you was suppose to do. I did learned many aspects of customer service.  I learned how to handle an upset customer with ease.
bad,Dead end job. Unless you are an AT&T employee you will go no where with this company. Don't waste your time and life for this company. Put your time in with a company that respects you as a human being.
bad,"Employees are set up to fail. Unreasonable performance metrics. Company doesn't care about your health. Manager forced me to stay home due to Pinkeye, forced to file FMLA, FMLA doesn't cover contagious diseases, disciplinary action was taken due to my absence. "
bad,Working hours can be too extreme making a work/life balance not good. AT&T puts too much pressure on a technician to make unreasonable numbers! AT&T is not a place for just anyone to work!
bad,Those who work in a commission based role can find the job very stressful and demanding.  Sales reps tend to be cut throat as the commission structure is always changing.
bad,"Over the many years working there, I was promoted to service management with an exemplary background in network and technical services. Was able to provide my customer 24x7 service resolution and advanced problem solving for all issues."
bad,The sales managers will try to sell you on how great the company is but just ask anyone in the stores how long they have been there and if they enjoy their roles. In my short stay at AT&T we went through 6 managers. This is a less than 7 month time frame. Also went through roughly 12 reps as well. So if you are a good sales person avoid like the plague. If entry level I would still recommend going elsewhere.
bad,"Not interested in giving details on employment with with AT&T. Bellsouth was an amazing company to work for and truly appreciated their employees. Bellsouth had the ability to trained management. Bellsouth managers were fair, knowledgeable and worked to make the company number one in customer satisfaction."
bad,Very demanding a lot of hours and this was direct tv not Att I did get to travel a lot with this company to perform my duties they did treat us well for traveling
bad,"Manager's pay check attached to tech's performance metrics, making for a very stressful work environment. But very ""satety"" oriented, very safe work place"
bad,"The job starts out great, management is super stressed and causes stress in the building. They have no training in keeping the moral going, your treated like a number and if you aren't exceeding the sales expectation you might as well keep your things in a box because you will be walked out quicker then you can say sorry."
bad,This company takes you through a lot just to become an employee and it doesn't pay that much. it is an inconvenience for people with family because they aren't allowed to have their cell phones on hand
bad,"If you must miss a day, for example, if your child is sick, you get a point for it. 7 points and you're gone. No ifs, ands, or buts about it. The schedule is built in a tool, so even after 15 years with the company, if the schedule builds a certain way, you still cannot get your requested days off. It's, ""sorry charlie."""
bad,"Management plays the role of lying to use you and favour their family and friends. All they care is generating sales, sell direct tvs and outsourcing to Sutherland global service in windsor, Ontario runned by uneducated staff."
bad,"cut-throat environment, will work hard for commission, Long hours in the office, will be held accountable for not meeting quota. "
bad,"No worklife balance constant stress"
bad,"Constantly declining commission. Not a good moral. Culture is to keep knowledgeable performers in their positions, and move low-key fraudsters around to higher positions. Managers of all levels will know about bad practices, and will sweep it under the rug. When things hit the fan they will throw you under the bus."
bad,at&t lost it's customer service quality & switched to a customer quantity & money driven policy. The employees get paid vaction but any unforseen situations are still punishable with a sort of 3 strike rule.
bad,This company was a retailer for ATT and it was mainly harassing customers to buy a phone or add a phone line that wasn't needed. Very high quota and not good compensation.
bad,"very stressful work environment, the agenda of this company is to downsize, they care absolutely nothing about the employees. If you don't have at least 22 years with this company they will come for you at the next layoff"
bad,Stressful and my department was poorly managed. They seemed to count every keystroke. The salary and benefits were great however. The work culture was stifling and back stabbing.
bad,I started as a installer with Directv and after 4 years became a supervisor. I was a very hard working supervisor for 4 years and felt like an important and responsible asset to the office I worked at. Once AT&T took over they had a surplus and I was one of the unfortunate people let go without any explanation or reason for me being chosen. I felt like I was one of the top supervisors and many of my peers would come to me for help on a daily basis. It seemed as if AT&T was only concerned about saving money and not the quality of the people that work there.
bad,I did not approve.  I will never work for prime communicatios again if they were giving away free money. Worst management ever and alot of shortcuts that damage the business and atmosphere.
bad,Startek Business Process Outsourcing in no longer in operation at the Decatur Illinois location. Very stressful environment with lots of turnover. Management was very poor.
bad,"Every year in November there are layoffs. AT&T killed the culture of Directv. It is a dinosaur of a company laden with rules and bureaucracy, useless but mandatory training - the list goes on"
bad,"Each year it's another change in focus and more people laid off.  Due to dwindling margins, reducing expenses is the path to profitability.  Relocations are a way of life here as well."
bad,"DirecTV initially was really nice to work for.  It had a fun atmosphere to it at times and wasn't quite as stressful as some of my previous jobs.  Unfortunately, after a buyout, things changed considerably.  Most of the enjoyable aspects of the job went away and it became very metrics based."
bad,the job was okay however having to deal with customers who have no intention of purchasing as well having a boss that requires so much made it hard to perform
bad,Job was enjoyable working with large companies but poor management decisions resulted in losing most of their customer base in a short time. Attitude seemed to be you are lucky we still employ you.
bad,"Boring... Nothing to do at the job. They do not assign much or the interns to do and was at an office with no life or many learning opportunities, Could've been better,"
bad,"i was trained for 2 days and told to go sell , no in the field training and the manager only cared about numbers and not in finding ways to help you achieve them"
bad,"Status the customer about their internet service.  Scheduled dispatches when needed.  Transferred to repair or sales if needed.  Fix orders that would not flow through the system, so the customer can get there orders completed."
bad,poorly managed company with zero work live balance and no room for advancement unless you suck up to the right people. hard work and loyalty are not rewarded so they loose good employees to menial garbage
bad,When contract negotiations would come to the table the Company constantly would attempt to take away current benefits and push for more task with pennies for compensation. Taking away tasks from the old timers and giving those tasks to the new guys for far less pay.
bad,Directv used to be an amazing environment to work in with happy employees and helpful management and AMAZING trainers. All of the changes make this a very stressful job especially once my position was re-evaluated to be considered leadership and am not union covered.
bad,It seems like all they care about is their new entertainment and first responder network - they let wireline take over wireless and the culture was ruined.
bad,"Pays really well and the benefits are great, sales department is cut throat, sales goal where ridiculous, and you lose money if customers cancel. Management is thirsty for sales and could care less if customers understand what they are getting into."
bad,I never liked how every time we called the manager for help they never picked up. Or the time when I couldn't call the boss because I was in area with no signal. Lost and stranded because they gave me the wrong addresses. This job was terrible and I would never work there again.
bad,"discounts on uverse cable, phone, internet, digital life, cell phones, accessories. orange points. If you worked in sales and are used to meeting tough deadlines youll make it"
bad,"The money and benefits are great, and if you can morally stand the company laying hundreds of people off every time they purpose a merger, then it can be a good job for you. Job security is at risk because of this, and the room for advancement is only there if you are willing to relocate and take a role that can be surplussed at any moment. There is no accountability held to the Area Managers and above, so all the stress falls on the Team Managers to try to get their teams to perform. All in all, I could not put a price on my happiness in the end."
bad,"Horrible Management, work hours and Demands are awful very stressful no help for struggling techs upper management always trying to fire you. Good Benefits and Healthcare that's it pay is NOT fair for all the work you have to do"
bad,"It was more about getting people off the phones than it was about resolving their problem. That and who appealed to management the most. Cingular was better culture wise, but at&t remerged and changed all that. Just about everything negative you've heard about at&t is probably true."
bad,Att (cingular) call center was a pleesant entry level job. Workers can learn excellent customer service skills. Punctual attendance is a must. Union job
bad,"Do not rely on anyone to help you, AT&T is union based and that is who you need to rely on. It is their job to aid you any way possible. If you have a working family i.e you and your spouse work this is not the job for you. you miss 8 days and your gonna be walking out that door."
bad,"Did not have experience in the industry and thus didn't enjoy working for AT&T."
bad,"Inbound calls from customers if having issues with products such as television, internet, and phones, walk customer through steps in trying to resolve issue, if your steps didn't work can receive help form coworkers."
bad,"I cannot state enough how bad it is to work for a company that labels you as just a cog in the wheel that can always be out-sourced or replaced.  This company rules by dictatorship and looks for ways to fire employees.  And if you can survive, as I did, you leave with early retirement as soon as possible."
bad,The management was poor the upper management didn't understand what the reps on my level job was to do really.  A typical day is getting calls in all day from customers reporting trouble on the land line services so pretty much lots of customers were upset when they got to a representative so as a rep you have to try & make the customer happy with the commits for dispatches way out due to storms.
bad,Management was never there and if they were it was only to steal commission. No real training and the expectations are a joke.  One year 2 people had an awesome year so now they have 3 people doing the volume to make a decent paycheck if it were only 2 people working there again.
bad,the company was very stressful and management needed guidance. raises unfair. Working there was hard on a day to day bases. proper training needed for management
bad,"Poor Management from 2nd level up in the Southeast. Can't keep Managers. Upper Management micromanages everything. Their only concern is safety so they can meet their goals. No training, No customer service, support or concern for that matter. Poor Culture. Low Morale is a constant."
bad,Really didnt like working at this facility. It was very unorganized and there wasnt really any room for advancement. No guaranteed lunch breaks breaks would get cut short at any given time
bad,It sucked monkey knuckles everyday that I was there.  I tried to give it the best I had and only ended with disappointment from a culture that failed many of its employees.
bad,"A typical day at AT&T consists of me coming into the office, logging into my phone, listening to my voicemail, checking my email, organizing my worklist, and then begin to make calls to my dedicated customers."
bad,Hard for women of color to advance. The company doesn't respect that women are care givers and need to have a life outside of the company. Its required that we volunteer our time outside work hours for advancement.
bad,"This company has a ton of potential. In the state of Michigan or in the Midwest region the instability, nepotism and racism made it an unbearable place to work. There was very limited room for improvements after the environments changed and six sigma was pushed out. Ideas were controlled by a group of staff that had no desire to truly get to the roots of the issues."
bad,"Not a bad place, but need to be in lime light to get the attention."
bad,Most of the executive leadership were 15+ years with AT&T or grand fathered from the Bellsouth merger. As such they were not very open to new ideas to embrace and get in front of current technology trends and changes.
bad,It was a job that used to pay well. How ever the commission structure changed and the contract that At&t and the union are working on have not changed. Even with strikes and job walks outs the blood thirsty CEO has no remorse for there retail employees. There is a high turn over as well and layoff rate.  Management is not on your side. When I first started working working for At&t the culture was great. There was a ton of support from managers. Then came budget cuts and managers moving to different states.
bad,I have been with this company for 13 years.. Started off being a great place to work for.. Pay and benefits are decent.. Not really family oriented anymore...I've started to simply feel like just another number...Not appreciated or treated like an adult at all...Throughout the years things have drastically changed... Currently this job is emotionally abusive with unrealistic goals causing stress levels to be high and creating a hostile environment to work in.
bad,"Company is fighting yesterday's battles and lacks strategic vision.  Recent acquisitions put AT&T squarely in the last decade, fighting over businesses that the big tech companies have passed over.  Passive-aggressive environment where leadership only hears what it wants, and promotes the status quo rather than innovation."
bad,DirecTV gave me valuable knowledge on how call centers work. Taking high volumes of calls assisting with any technical issue a customers had. DirecTV provided all the tools to complete your job however call centers are just not the place for me.
bad,"I've worked at 7 call centers....And this was the absolute WORST one! First off, they say its cust.Service, but they only care about u making sales! Training is only 3 wks which is not enough time to learn all the information they shove down your throat on a daily basis (the trainers are terrible too). There is no help in place for new employees once you come out of training. The managers listen to calls all day and the so-called floor support takes calls for 4-5hrs/Day, so they're not available to help either! A lot of the team leads are messy, not helpful, show favoritism and very unprofessional!! They make a weak attempt at boosting morale by playing loud music on the call floor all day...And it only upsets the customer even more. I had high hopes when I started there but quickly came to realize how awful this job was."
bad,I dont know where to start.....no future...they advised us to get our resumes ready. That department is in Kaos.....I am exhausted ...every company should provide a safe environment to work in.
bad,"Fast paced, stats/numbers oriented, and sales focused.  Benefits are great though the expectation is too high to achieve all in one setting.  No Servant Leadership.  Management is horrible with no integrity when it comes to internal issues unless your meeting all the metrics, and it seems you just get a pat on the back.  Self expression of any serious opinions, complaints, and or issues seemed to get turned around back on you instead of taking ownership to resolve issues, it just gets pushed out the door."
bad,"typical day is heavy workloads , big demands. Management  continuingly wanting me workloads and shorter timeline. Work culture"
bad,"out bound calling at 6 am is not for me clients are rude sells low .."
bad,It was my first company as a fresher and AT & T was my client.I worked for Tech mahindra about 3.5 years on Production support profile.It was very peaceful environment to work upon
bad,It was very rewarding to work here.  I gained a lot of useful experience that I have utilized consistently since my time with the AT&T. Lots of hustle and bustle.
bad,"The location I specifically work for is a franchise owned by GameStop. The company is constantly making changes in compensation. The management is selfish, completely rude and unprofessional. I regret applying to job. Over 30,000 in cuts for the company and the reason is because of the poor expectations they have for employees."
bad,"Worked a minimum of 60 hours a week, too tired and sore to do anything on days off. the money is OK but absolute no work life balance, if you have a family or social life it's not for you."
bad,"Horrible management, not really much space for advancement like they say. Work more than you have to especially off of the clock. Extra work with no compensation"
bad,The lure of this company are the pay and benefits but after several years it does not offset the miserable working conditions set forth by the company
bad,"its comissioned based corporate sales work what else can i say, i loved it but it wasn't something i wanted to do forever so i got a college education and moved on"
bad,It was a fun place to work for awhile.  Once they started with home security it was all the focus was.  The home security was a disaster.  The installers never did a good job and customer were always complaining about the product.
bad,"Already did this review. If you can handle all the stress, cussing, screaming, etc from customers and corporate, go for it. If you have kids that are constantly sick, don't even think about it."
bad,"Call center environment that was very difficult to manage in due to the culture that had been created before I arrived.  A  lot of upper management that was set in their old ways, eventually led to their closing."
bad,This was the worst call center I ever worked for. Not to bring AT&T down but the poor management and staff are what are going to drive this place to the ground. I made a few good friends while here but as far as a working environment it needs improvement.
bad,The balance of work and your life will be ruined. Very stressful at times. Management is horrible depending where you at. Employee policies are terrible. Compensation sucks
bad,"Run away! Do not apply, once you get hired your life becomes super stressful. They are down your throat with selling directv to customers. Ever since they purchased directv, they do not care about anything else. The company is heading in the wrong direction."
bad,"This job was a good job except for the employees. it was actually thru Vxi and the people runnin git knew nothing about the company, I do not believe we had the best training"
bad,you come in you sell you make money you get coached rinse repeat.you get a company phone where customers can call you. some managers are great teachers some are sharks.
bad,"To sum up working an att call center is stress on a level of 10.5"
bad,This place was great until they were bought out. It use to be Cingular and it was awesome. They don't value family and all they care is about meeting their goals and expectations.
bad,"They have no real presence in our market place. Primary niche is  re-selling AT&T Corp services in Canada for the purpose of leading multinational carriers into our market.  "
bad,"No work life balance. Huge turnover. Not a lot of opportunity to grow. We are all numbers in AT&T. Laying off employees. again, no work life balance.l"
bad,Es una empresa que dice ser una cosa y es otra. El empleado no tiene voz.
bad,"maintained infrastructure of telecom plant, installation and repair of telecom services for residential and business services, maintained company tools and testing equipment."
bad,"Poor management and accountability, I would not recommend this job to a friend. This is a large company so there may be locations with better treatment but the turnover and long history in my location with no improvement does not inspire confidence in this company."
bad,"They always say ""protect the family"" but this company only cares about themselves. Will throw you under the bus in a heartbeat. Be careful and beware if you ever go to work for this company."
bad,"They are ready to drop you in a second even after graduating 3 month training course and graduating with flyin colors"
bad,"I was a technician for a year, DIRECTV-technician exactly, in sub-contractor firm and I can say, that it was one of the most terrible periods of my lifetime. Managers (let's call it like this, 'cause it was some supervisors and boss, that's it) were unprofessional, rude, provocative and unorganized - we got full pack over there. You can respect a little amount of help from some of them, but the majority don't care at all, so if you stuck or something, just count on yourself. "
bad,"Stressful environment"
bad,"I had 3 different supervisors within 2 months, so that says a lot. Other senior people on my team that were supposed to help to help the new people were hostile instead, which made me not want to come to work. I never was happy to leave a company till I left this one."
bad,"This is my second time working for AT&T. The first time was after SBC Global (aka AT&T) acquired my company at the time, Pacific Bell. I continued to work for AT&T for a total of 14+ years before being downsized. The second time was after AT&T acquired DIRECTV, my employer for the past few years. I really enjoyed working for DIRECTV as it was a very innovative company that ran like a well-oiled machine. I learned a lot at the company, but I feel like the innovation and corporate culture took a few steps back with AT&T at the helm."
bad,"Typical day is lying to customers and pressuring average people to buy things they aren't interested in. Management doesn't protect its workers due to workers having a union and management doesn't. Workplace would be decent if management would be secure in its workers and treat them like people. The hardest part of the job is maintaining your composure from staff, not to mention people who hate the company that view you as the company and not an employee who follows policy. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping, meeting people and the cash is decent. Good luck on your journey."
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"Ok Company, Good Union, However Management wants everything quickly, & efficiently & if something goes wrong in the field no mater what happens you the technician are to blame."
bad,"Un trabajo muy tranquilo."
bad,"AT&T recently took over DIRECTV in the last year, and since, the culture change has effected a lot of people. "
bad,This job was very demanding and working in retention every call was an unhappy person on the line.  The best part about the job was even though they were unhappy I got the chance to make them happy and improve their day and life.  I enjoyed the customers and making them satisfied with AT&T.
bad,It was a third party company called convergys. No room for growth it was a call center. Always short on hours.. I'm ready for growth
bad,"Your value as an employee isn't based on your effort or diligence. AT&T uses a completely bogus rating/numbers system that sets every employee up for failure. The management has no idea what the job is like, because the majority of them were just ""placed"" in the position and have never actually done the work. They are not on your side either. Everything is all about the ""numbers"". AT&T employees at my location are all looking for new jobs. No one is happy. The pay is the only plus to this job, but it's just not enough to keep people."
bad,"Management is great, training is good... the biggest downside is that you're held to foot traffic when you're working in the store and unless you're in a ""store of the future"" a lot of times the foot traffic is minimal and your breaks are too short to go out and generate new business so your hands are kind of tied."
bad,Can improve on company employees culture. Work / Life not a priority. Must improve on Manager ranks. Project management typically.
bad,"Used to be great. Worked there for 8 years selling cell phones. Towards the end, management started caring more about making money than their customers and employees. I've had several ex co-workers quit already and many more planning to leave."
bad,AT&T Mobility could be a great place to work if not for the politics and blatant favoritism that leads managers to retain and promote their buddies rather than those with actual knowledge and talent.
bad,no respect for employees. employees work hard but the director was not a good leader. worked by threats. secretary was just as bad and had her nose in all the business and never handled her duties.
bad,It was fun to work with my coworkers and laid back at first and then it turned into a prison like workplace. I did learned a lot of computer skills and business ethic.
bad,"La empresa es muy injusta en cuanto a los puestos requeridos, además de que el ambiente de trabajo no es bueno"
bad,"The work is not bad, you have to be able to deal with people and handle irrate customers at times, but management is the big problem.  Too much back biting and unrealistic rules that change from week to week."
bad,"It was a call center job where I was barely paid over minimum wage and work conditions were questionable. All we were trained to do was say sorry we can't do anything, here's some credit, please bother someone else."
bad,"I worked for an authorized retailer not actually AT&T.  A lot of promises were made to get me to accept the job, but once I came on board there was no follow through with anything that I was told.  Training was not made a top priority and as a ne employee I was left at the store by myself many times with no help whatsoever.  There was constant turnover in management.  I did enjoy my co-workers, but they felt the same frustrations that I did."
bad,its a telecommunications companh with millions of customers. fun company is located in Atlanta. I would not recommed this company to many layoffs
bad,At&t was demanding as well as rewarding. Learning the products and services available was gratifying. The company culture was difficult at teams because of the commission sales system in place.
bad,The environment of work was hostile due to the management poor skills. But overall the employees were very positive and great working and learning team.
bad,What was once a great career has deteriorated into work overload with no real possibility of advancement. Stagnate compensation for many years with unrealistic objectives. Sales have become the catch all for a multitude of problems and gaps in how customers are serviced where 90% of the available selling time is instead used for constant billing and service delivery issues
bad,Great opportunity to start but the current culture of cutbacks does not promote job stability. I have been through 5 re-organizations in 9 year with this company. This role was a 5 year focus and was restructured within months of this organizations creation. Focus and goals were all over the board. they used the term; were building the plane while flying it. Their constant focus on sales tactics while being a marketing and advertising organization confused most of the teams. Very poorly ran organization.
bad,"Great Leadership and management"
bad,this place was very stressful. They didn't care how you made the sale as long as you made it. I never want to work sales again. The money was good but it was to stressful.
bad,"Typical day at work is to provide customer service to every consumer that walks into that door, but most importantly to upsell everything we have and somehow tie it back to why the customer needs it. I learn every day how to deal with different people. Management is very strict and pushes every sales rep to the limit to sell everything regardless whether the customer needs it or not. My co-workers try very hard for the most part but is discourage most of the time. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the stress and the most enjoyable part is just the wages we receive."
bad,On a day to day typical work day was easy and great. Had some great challenges which I overcame and learned from. Had a lot of customer Service experience that I built.
bad,Ever since the Directv buyout AT&T went down hill. We as prem techs lost all our hours and the Directv techs were getting all the install jobs. It doesnt matter how much you get paid per hour if you dont get any hours. The company just kept everyone in the dark about everything that was going on.
bad,"When the Company was DIRECTV they were an amazing company that cared for their employees and customers. I worked for Directv for almost 3 yrs before and ater the merge. When working for Directv we felt like family they always showed the emplyees they cared. After AT&T took over it was all about micromanaging and the money the company could make. The employees and customers no longer matter. Customers are being force to pay for a Tech to come to their home when it could be fixed over the phone. they now have to deal with overseas tech support that dont know what they are doing, they are not given discounts like they use to be. Employees dont matter its all about the company. they dont care about you having a life or family you cant plan vacations no more"
bad,Was a great company to work for in the beginning but with the new changes they made it clear they do not care about the retail employees. They cut everything from income to benefits while adding that none of us would have a job by the year 2020.
bad,"This place is great for those who do not have a family or outside responsibilities. This job is ideal for those who need much supervision and generally do not wish to contribute anything but their time, no creative ideas are accepted."
bad,I loved my time at AT&T I was there for 3 years and learned a lot from that job that I can apply to future jobs. while I loved my time there I had to part ways because of my new born work life balance was not there.
bad,Overall this job I can definitely say was not for me. The job was extremely easy to get however I now understand as to why this was so. The pay was extremely low for the torment that you received from the customers calling into the center. A typical day would include sitting on the phone for 10-12 hours a day updating customers accounts and solving customer issues. The co-workers were friendly and easy to get along with and would help out when any questions arose.
bad,They don't care much about their employees or customers. Very expensive but service is worth it. Worked there 8 years if i could do it all again i would not have stayed so long.
bad,"A good training ground to learn discipline and understand how to be a part of the BPO industry. The support and training materials may be sufficient but sometimes every agent's performance depend on how the leaders handle their teams, specially when every they don't get the pay they deserve. this will only result to poor performance and employees tend to look for another company that will motivate them in improving their performance and give the best customer service."
bad,"The call center was located in Indianapolis, IN and towards the end of 2013 the call center shut down. but it was smooth go in log in make outbound calls to people and business who were having issues with internet"
bad,ATT = At This Time.  The company has ADD at the retail level.  They need to learn when to so no to a good Idea.  In retail you have well over 20 goals and about 6 different channels of the business being you boss.  They also recently changed the commission structure to where less than 10% make their commission targets.  I switched to ATT from another cellular provider when I moved across the country and took a $20k pay cut to do four times the work.
bad,"Aprendí a lo largo de los años diversas actividades que me enseñaron diferentes rubros, a capacitarme en muchas disciplinas, a trabajar tanto en grupo como individualmente, incluso a dirigir grupos, organizarlos de acuerdos a las tareas a desarrollar, ser proactiva, resolver problemas urgentes o a largo plazo, seguimiento de las mismas. Lo que más me gusta es trabajar, especialmente en un grupo armonioso y complementario, con el fin de llevar adelante tareas para el bien común de la Empresa, Edificio, etc. Tratando de conciliar las diferencias entre miembros, y adquirir logros que satisfagan tanto a los colegas, a los empleados como a los superiores. El superarse día a día y dar lo mejor de uno mismo, considero que es una meta posible y gratificante, tanto como una meta laboral como personal."
bad,"This was the most stressful position I have ever worked. Almost daily or at least two or three times a week someone was let go. Along with that the director insisted that we meet with our supervisors daily for ""discussion"" time. We all called it Detention Time. Even if your call had been perfect and you had made a sale in one or two areas, you were always asked how you could have made more sales. These were from calls of people who were calling to cancel their services with AT&T. It's very hard to sell more to people who were wanting to leave. Most of the ""successful"" sales reps crammed people with products that were not wanted."
bad,"learned a lot but very unorganized, working in all types of environments, physically demanding job."
bad,"When I started with the company, I was under the impression that this company held itself to a high moral standard and was against sleazy salesmanship. However this was not true. They expect you to shove services down every customers throat and essentially sign people up for services they do not know about or need under the impression that it is one ""personalized solution"". If you do not obey these commands they will discipline you until either termination or you quit. The commission structure has all but diminished since my start two years ago. They constantly demand more and more by increasing the goals and cutting the commission for hitting said goals. They also promise $2,000 tuition reimbursement per year which is the main incentive on which I took this job, as I was pursuing completion of my degree. They, however, do not allow you the opportunity to have time off for the classes and will not change your schedule to accommodate education"
bad,Goodjob to get intro of customer service and you can earn a decent living doing it. it also improves conbfidence and customer interface
bad,"I really like this job but the stress it brings to my life makes it not fun. As a prem tech you get paid hourly but you must meet their ""numbers"" requirements. you get graded on a matrix system and things that are out of your control decreases your numbers then your boss will have a talk with you and make you feel like your about to loose your job. Techs have gotten robbed and often you work in dangerous environments."
bad,"Co-workers in other departments, particularly in Sales, tend to be untruthful, as well as pushy. Most other departments do not want to take responsibilities for their actions and upper management do not tend to care."
bad,i should not have to enter the review information for the same company more than once. i hate that the system can pick up the previous employers however doesn't recognize duplicate entries
bad,"Company was bought by AT&T and was a complete 180 degree change. Leadership unprofessional, they will work you all day and night with unknown time of getting home and they don't care. Single and want money and no social life its good job for you, family with kids, you will never see them."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job are coworkers, because you spend most of your time working it becomes a second home so you make great friendships. Management is constantly changing and people are constantly getting fired. The company continue to grow therefore they pay the employees alot less. Expect a lot of micro management. You deal with customers all the time: upset, angry, sad, crying, and normal customers. Expect on every transaction to sell over 10 products otherwise you will eventually be written up. You can move up easily as a manager but management now has no skils and creditability. too many politics involved in this company."
bad,Daily Inventory Work and also making the daily commisson sales. Helping the Customer to appreciate the great service AT&T has to offer
bad,Managers didn't manage. They need to work on that. Each day was different and they didn't help or want to be there for the direct reports.
bad,Not a job or career for adults with children. Bidding system that always makes you work nights. Management staff lost and not aware of what is gong on.
bad,This was a great company to work for 10 years ago. About 4 years upper management changed and it became a boot camp. Commission was restructured which caused big pay cut.
bad,svhvuyg nh wsuytvhguywtrdyg7q bv xygwshygyqerfhttyh I didn't realy like working wit6h maceys the hours were not good for living alone and paying rent alone and no hours means no money
bad,"While I love technology and everything about it. Working for AT&T was not my favorite job. Demanding hours even at part time and stressful conditions caused over 13 employees from the store I worked at to either move, or find positions with other companies within a year time frame."
bad,"Company don't care about employees. Everyone replaceable and they don't hide it. The entire call center was expecting our yearly breakfast at the mar riot with corporate only to find out they shut us down. Just like that in that moment we can not return to work,"
bad,"Work is solitary, with plenty of opportunities to make on the spot decisions. Customer interface is continuous and sometimes not pleasant. The company lacks all situational reasonableness. Management lacks any experience or management skills and attempts to hide these deficiencies with intimidation and threatened job security.  I have been here almost 5 years and believe the stated 60% turn over is a conservative number. I have seen people terminated for ridiculous offences and others quit because metric based performance numbers are skewed to failure which in turn leads to extreme stress that often leads to health issues. This performance based metric is skewed by using a chi square testing that eliminates the top and bottom 20% of sample, which of course eliminates all data sets that face any obstacle while on a job as the upper end of data is removed and the lower end has a hard zero to eliminate any positive skew on results. ATT's belief is that if they hire first level mangers who don't  even know what a chi square test, they won't recognize this blatant manipulation of statistics."
bad,"I left my position after 18 years, because the work environment had become toxic to my physical and mental health.  The office is so highly micromanaged that no one can do anything right.  The upper management wanted nothing more than to get rid of our office, because we had been part of the pre-merger AT&T culture, and we we paid better and had better Union contracts than our SBC counterparts."
bad,"Management was scattered to say the least. Put me into management with no training and expected minimum of 80 hour work weeks on salary at 24,000 pay ."
bad,"DVS new company awarded the contract coming in making significant changes."
bad,"I have no idea in which direction they move but it does not look nice."
bad,"AT&T offers great PTO and tuition reimbursement. But you have to request your PTO at least a month in advance, wait to see if someone with seniority wants it first and deal with all the ""black out dates."" "
bad,"Good place to work compensation wise IF you know how to work the system and get ""creative"" with your bundles. If you want a good deal purchase Digital Life or DirecTV. Too many politics and ""who knows who"" system. Honestly the only way too move up is if you are someone's good side. If you are one to keep business to yourself, head down and willing to keep working as they wish (ethical or not) you will be successful. True creativity and positive sales tactics no longer in place. Good place for a short time job, NOT career. No such thing as work life balance."
bad,would have liked the job allot more if there weren't bad weather conditions you had to walk in and also try and gain commission which is the way you got paid for the first 3-4 months.
bad,"Starting out, AT&T was a good place to work. I enjoyed working with my co-workers, and the management staff was awesome. If you're a parent, however, AT&T will be hard to shuffle your life with your work. You'll start out closing every day (which some shifts start at around 11am and end when the last customer is out the door, and the cash drawers are counted) You may leave at 9pm, 10pm, or later. You'll have no weekends off until 2-3 years after your employment. "
bad,"It was in an independent family owned office. There was no space for advancement. I did like the Quite working environment. "
bad,Company is very inefficient and feedback isn't accepted. Most poorly managed company I have worked for. Not a suggested place to work at from me in any means. Schedules change several times per year
bad,"Having already worked for AT&T California in the residential services division, I had the expectation that AT&T Mobility would treat their representatives the same...wrong!  Management didn't care that you were not receiving qualified callers to sell their wireless services, if you didn't make quota you would be talked down to and make to feel inferior. This part of AT&T has a high turnover rate and it's because they treat their representatives quite bad if they do not make quota, no matter how well they treated each potential and existing customer calling into the center.  I would not recommend working for AT&T Mobility to anyone that values their self-esteem and ethics."
bad,"Enjoyed the job and the company, however needs better managers that will stick to their word. decent pay you def have to work your butt off to get commission because the customer to employee ration wasn't nearly enough. too many sales members in the store at one time"
bad,The managers dont have much to do so they micro manage employees and want you to push the dumbest services and devices on customers. And great is never great enough. They only care about making themselves look good and  will turn on you at the drop of a hat. company will also change compensation plan at a moments notice and lie and say you can make the same if not more money when you can clearly tell they are lying
bad,Sales and numbers game. Retail stores with bad hours. The locations don't always have the best managers and it is hard to advance under the wrong management team.
bad,"I didn't really like working for AT&T.  There was little opportunity for advancement at the call center and one had to deal with rude customers every day.  Oh not every day was bad, but there were more bad days than good.  Management was not very flexible, but there were options in case of emergencies."
bad,"They new about a manager sexually harassing woman and did nothing about it. until finally he was caught doing it to customers. they don't value their employees nor is it easy for advancement. If you start at retail store level it is very difficult to move up-at least at the Cricket Corp. owned stores. "
bad,"The benefits and compensation were great, but the overall atmosphere of the business was not good. The management was overwhelming, negative, and unsupportive. I'm in school and they did not work around my school schedule. They also scheduled me during my finals and told me I could look for a new job if I didn't show up those days."
bad,The culture is very cut-throat and there is a prevailing feeling that more cuts are just over the bend.  Not at all secure.
bad,"No job security, layoffs are always on the horizon. Work long hours to try to keep up, but its not appreciated, you can still be surplused."
bad,"Work with Treasury staff to identify and implement process improvements to support business requirements, leading to ongoing and continuous improvement in the process."
bad,"I installed equipment for DirecTV"
bad,"The best thing about working here was I was baptized in the most stressful work environment I have ever seen. The mood in the building was awful. The company lied in regards to compensation, pay raises and promotions. At least one person got fired everyday I was there. Everyone had a very negative attitude. Two of my coworkers attempted suicide IN the office."
bad,Not a fan of AT&T and working in their billing department was not fun. It felt like we were trained to rip people off and I'm not a fan of taking peoples money without their permission.
bad,"I report to customer homes throughout the New Orleans Metro area and buried permanent wires underground.  Sometimes I have to trench as much as 300 feet around properties, gardens, pools,etc.   The management keeps us working nonstop.  Management has told us that AT&T is all about getting jobs done.  Family or personal life doesn't matter. The hardest part of the job is working long days with only one day off every two weeks.  The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people and talking to the customers."
bad,Effectively De-escalate hostile customers while providing the best customer experience possible. Thoroughly educate the customer of their billing. Provide basic trouble shooting for cellular device
bad,"Constantly adding more and more responsibilities and job requirements while decreasing the amount of time to effectively perform your job and make the numbers. Advancement can only be obtained by becoming a ""teachers pet"" and that is still few and far between. Promotions are rarely accomplishment based and more of who you know, what can you constantly do for me mentality. Only mostly young, inexperienced in management skills technicians get promoted. Though most have great work related knowledge, management skills and people skills are NOT REQUIRED! And if you question them in any way You Will Be Blacklisted Period!"
bad,"Long hours standing "
bad,Very busy days at work. Different managers on the floor so sometimes different information was handed down. The hardest part of my work day was dealing with aggravated and mean customers.
bad,"The job is great, they simply do not care about employees family time or life only the bottom dollar. It is very hard to move up in the company. "
bad,No real pay. Hateful customers. No real teamwork from the different divisions. Advancement is only to enter a even more stressful position with no real benefit
bad,"A typical day at work was that we had to answer a certain number of"
bad,I enjoyed helping customers with there everyday needs and giving the the options that could provide entertainment for them and there family to fit there familys budget
bad,"AT&T Mobility has the main offices in Atlanta, Georgia and Dallas, Texas. If you are not willing to relocate because of family your promotion opportunities are few."
bad,Job started off great they had a big facility and then downgraded to a smaller building laid people off they no long open.
bad,"Cingular wireless was an incredible company to work for.  When the company transitioned to AT&T, no one was happy, including customers.  During transition, many angry customers who had already transitioned from AT&T to Cingular wireless were livid with the fact they would once again have to go through this process as Cingular customers to AT&T.  Many plans changed, many policies changed, and many employee benefits changed.  Our Union was very lackluster in resolving employee complaints about treatment in the work place and the company itself was not interested in appealing to the newly acquired employees, even refusing to match wages with their current employees as we were being paid less under new company structure.  We couldn't even have family photos on our desks any longer, or anything non-work related as they put it.  The most difficult part of the day was the stress of unhappy customers and not having proper answers to provide them about the many changes occurring.  The best part of working for Cingular was showing up for work, and volunteering for overtime because we did right by our customers.  I couldn't find a great highlight to working for AT&T."
bad,"Handled heavy phone volume, set appointments for service calls, upgrades, and installs. Data entry, filing, completed orders, handled pre and post customer service satisfaction, quality control, bilingual English-Spanish. not many co-workers just 4 of us got along just well"
bad,"Not a great company..back tracking work, shifting directions on company goals, very unstable middle management."
bad,The co-workers I had the honor to work with were great and we got along as a team. Management was unreliable and there was no room for advancement. The company as a whole sucked on fairness to employees.  I quickly became aware as to why there is a high turn over.
bad,"The AT&T call center is a very high paced, and high stress environment.  Calls are constantly coming in, and if you are not prepared for the sheer volume, it can be overwhelming.  Unfortunately while the pay is very good with benefits as well.  At the time that I was there, managerial support was hard to come by or nonexistent."
bad,"•	Responsible for all intake and execution of  global promotional offers with in AT&T’s B2B online channel Premier "
bad,"This place was a pretty bad place to work. The managers were good people, but the pay and hours were horrible. I wanted to move up in the company and there was pretty much no oppurtunities to do that at all. Thats why I left the company so quickly."
bad,Would not recommend working here. A lot of turnover and unfriendly staff. They will not work with you on your schedule. Mandatory overtime.
bad,"I worked for at&t, which turned into southern bell, then to bellsouth , then to AT&T last again and I retired at 30yrs..the culture is the new culture... when I worked for at&t I felt I was like ""married"" to them..because it was so good of a company to work for.. Now... it is just like any other company."
bad,This retailer was a tough company to work for.  They routinely participated in shady business practices and expected employees to follow suit.
bad,"Depending on your managers, the job is either really fun or really bad.  I've had a lot more bad managers than good ones.  They do something called observations on you, which is basically them hanging out next to you watching everything you do and say while with a customer.  If you don't effectively bridge into pretty much every product and accessory they sell, you can be docked during that observation.  If the manager wants to, they can ALWAYS find something you did wrong.  I have had several situations in which I know I am being observed, and consciously try to bridge to everything and demo all of our products, but he still docked me because he didn't like the way I bridged (Didn't build enough value before offering it to the customer. Ridiculous!).  Attendance system is really draconian.  More than 6 days per year and you are fired. Job security is laughably absent,  I always feel as if I am teetering on the edge of termination and I am one of the top salespeople in my store.  All but 4 or 5 people out of 15 in my store are on some form of discipline, I don't know if there is anyone there not looking for a new job. The worst part of the job is knowing that it all depends on the character of a particular person of higher rank than you, and there really isn't anything you can do about it."
bad,What I enjoy most about my employment with AT&T is meeting new customers.  Being able to come in contact with so many different personalities is exciting and it really allows me to be able to understand people more.
bad,"Customer service for sales and service, update and post to customer accounts.  Answer phones general office duties assist customers with learning phones"
bad,"Extremely poor management, they would find any reason to write employees up.  Pay was great but you will receive continuous store updates and goals by text message from 5 am to midnight."
bad,AT&T cares very little about their employees.  They want to portray that they are a compassionate company but they are not.  Every decision is based on the bottom line with no concern of making an ethical decision for their employees.
bad,productive and Fun workplace. fast paced enviorment high volume call flow. helping customers set up with new services and helping with their problems
bad,"120 plus hours a week. pay will not add up to how long you been away from home.  management does not communicate with anybody, nor do they care about how long you have to work. But they will be home by 4pm. got a problem after that? don't bother calling a supervisor, they do not answer when they are home."
bad,A typical workday involved opening or closing the assigned store since I was a floater I had to go from store to storeon different days of the week I couldn't get settled into one area hardest part of the job was completing the assigned tasks given to you without all tools you needed.
bad,"This place is a great overall company to work for. (If your not going into retail). I have noticed in the store where I am working out of in Rockwall Texas has a horrible working environment."
bad,they allow you to take fmla without knowing if it will be approved or not so if you take it and its denied ultimately causing you to go over your points and them to fire you
bad,"You must have seniority to have a decent schedule, you deal with ridiculous customers that still think cellular companies will beg you if you stay with them."
bad,Lack of work. Was a contractor for a year hardly developed a thing. Bad for the skills
bad,"Supported various types of cell phones and their operating systems from Android, Apple, Blackberry and Windows."
bad,bad company to work for. bad management.  poor training.  never knowing when you will get off makes your social life disappear.
bad,The job was fun and challenging and the customers great. The managers are push hard by the top so all they care about is the numbers.
bad,"poor management many levels up lead to wasted resources, time, money, and loss of interesting challenges or employment security. Only have decent pay and benefits due to union requirements, but likely wont be long before union is gone, along with benefits"
bad,"The employees at AT&T DSL were brought in when AT&T bought Prodigy.net and converted their workforce into DSL support. The offices are in a nice locations, lots of parking, but the break rooms are now bare, where they had a variety of vending machines and kitchen space allocated for lunches and events. Feels like a ghost town compared to other businesses."
bad,"A typical day for this position involves a lot of customer interaction, sales coaching and customer co-ordinating. There is also a list of inventory duties, including receiving and transferring inventory, performing daily deposits, weekly inventory audits and more as needed. The best part of the job is the people, both within the company and the customers. The hardest part of the job is the people, both within the company and the customers. It's gratifying to be able to help someone, employee or customer, but it is not always possible to do so. I have learned a great deal about managing people and myself, about how to motivate effectively and setting realistic and achievable goals."
bad,"better communication, management, high turn over due to being very strict. better training."
bad,For the most part this was great and enjoyed work with everyone.
bad,"I was there a yea 10 work experience student, thus the opportunities at a highly skilled workplace was very very limited."
bad,"Travelling around 10 to 12 hours Daily"
bad,The mobile phone market is saturated and the opportunities are not as vast as they use to be. It use to be fun and exciting but now you have to carry around product until you sell it ect.  I really enjoy working with customers and technology aspect.
bad,"a typical day at work was stress, and pressure and management were bullies. "
bad,It was a good paying job...excellent benefits...hard to advance.
bad,"Prem Techs are measured on several different metrics. Failing to meet any one of these in a month can result in discipline. Failing to perform within the top 80% of techs, regardless of metrics, can result in discipline. Failure to adhere to extremely high quality standards can result in discipline. You can make good money, but do not plan on this being a long term career. Most Prem Techs do not last more than a couple years. In four years I went from the bottom of my seniority list to third from the top. As a Prem Tech, your days are numbered, and you feel it from day one. Very high stress."
bad,"Managers are horrible here in Baton Rouge. I have asked other offices about their practices and they agree."
bad,"Was a wonderful place to work until SBC took over AT&T and adopted all their management policies, then it just became another J.O.B."
bad,"I was not as impressed with AT&T as I had hoped. It was a 'bag & tag' mentality, referring to getting new customers. It reminded me of an 80's mentality to getting new customers. It didn't matter how you did it, just do it. Customers would call in to address a cellular issue and we were expected to sale Uverse-TV and internet services on 'every' call, no matter what the customer called in about. If you did not you were 'disciplined' for this. I saw Team Managers/Supervisors quite literally yell at their staff for failing to mention these services let alone sale them. Their is a quota and it is expected to be met. I am a soft-seller, not a hard-seller as is expected. You are to deflect any and all denials for service and push forward, and I mean 'push', until the customer either accepts the services or hangs up. ('Who cares what the customers' think, just make the sale' is something that I was told!) I feel this violates customers and is not in the best interest of the company nor of the customer. AT&T gave me the impression it considered its TV and internet growth was more important than maintaining customer loyalty and goodwill."
bad,"Super busy, lunch schedules were unfair, management did not listen to harassment complaints."
bad,"Attendance policy strict, call center, sales, A typical day at ATT is having on a headset talking to customers doing sales and taking complaints. The monthly quotas is set at the beginning of the month and has a deadline that must be met at the end of the month."
bad,I only worked her part time. It was a 3rd party agency that called on behalf of AT&T for collections of past due long distance bills. of course they were darn near almost impossible to collect.
bad,"Administrar la linea de ensamble y obtener el resultado de produccion."
bad,Nothing was typical in that call center. I had three different supervisors & 2 different managers in the short time I stayed.
bad,"Not much opportunity for advancement"
bad,"I miss my co-workers, they were the heart and soul of the job and made it most enjoyable."
bad,I learned a lot working here. I really learned how to talk to customers. The managers were very nice and helpful.
bad,"The AT&T call center is an unnecessarily stressful environment to work in. Your performance is completely subjective, based solely on the random customer surveys that callers receive. If a caller is upset at a store employee or Apple or Samsung or their kid or whatever, they can take it out on you through the survey and there is nothing you can do about it. The stress of having people calling and screaming at you for things you have no control over to begin with is enough but when you compound that with the stress of losing your job over arbitrary numbers it almost becomes too much. Couple that with the fact they employ the point system for attendance. You are allowed 7 points for whatever reason after that you're gone. The managers attempt to defend it by pointing out all the PTO you are given, however you only get it incrementally over the first year, and if you wake up with a stomach bug one day, even if you still have 10 PTO days remaining, chances are 99.999% there is no time available for that day resulting in you having to take a point. There is no way around it. Dr.s excuse or not, they don't care. Most of the managers are not on your side, they are not supportive, even though they will claim to be. I would not recommend working here."
bad,"Work is good and pay is great but LONG hours with no advanced notice, you never know if you will be working 8hrs or 12hrs on any given day. Work/Life balance is pretty much impossible. If you need to make an appointment at 6pm you better request the entire day off if you want to not miss it. Management micro manages to the point where you will get disciplined if you stop to use the bathroom if they decide to watch you that day. "
bad,A typical day at the job is coming in and we get together and tell each other our goals and how we can better our sell when working in te field
bad,"Once you logged in you are getting incoming call. Some calls are for payment arrangements, transfer service or order new service. But more often, the calls where from irate customers. No time to socialize until breaks with the co workers."
bad,"Technical Service Rep for a Satellit company. Answered calls from customers, assistedwith the correction of bills and equipment problems"
bad,"•	Troubleshoot customer’s smart phones and data cards, ensuring optimum capabilities."
bad,"Miserable time there, do not recommend for anyone.  Company pushes revolving door theme to the max.  Employees are just numbers, expendable and easily replaceable."
bad,They are always higher for prem tech do to the high turnover rate. That should tell you  anything you need to know about it being a good place to work.
bad,Many changes in work processes.  Time limit on calls to assist callers.  Requirement to sell on EVERY call even angry customer calls made the work sometimes challenging.  Scripted calls didnt allow for personalized conversation - everyone sounded like a robot.
bad,ATT has no concern for the employee...no work/life balance..bad relationship between union and management..unfair compensation ...TERRIBLE company
bad,"I was a Prem Tech with AT&T, the pay was great, the benefits we outstanding, but the job itself was extremely stressful. Good managers that help their employees are few and far between. Don't get me wrong, there are good managers that work there, but the majority either do not know the job enough to offer any help, or just dont care about their employees. "
bad,"Customer   help  desk  services, handles inbound/outbound calls and responsible for dispatching calls to field. Taking complaints from customers and problem resolution within assigned customer  accountants working over the phone with customers while entering and translating comprehensive information."
bad,pay was ok. But they put me on a team where everyone left by 3:30 and i worked till 9:30 so most of my days were spent by myself with noone to help me with anything.
bad,"I get to communicate with each customer that comes into the store, so this make my day busy and interesting, never boring."
bad,"In this position I was responsible for gathering data from trouble tickets and inputting them into an access database in which I also helped to manage and maintain. Managed five employees work flow and quality as well as responsible for creating and updating, and running semi-monthly and monthly reports to be sent to corporate headquarters.  This information is used by corporate to track and flag equipment issues for further investigation."
bad,A typical day is answering calls in the billing department. A typical call center job
bad,"As a Prem Tech at at&t you are given great freedom and great responsibilities. My personal experience though has made me feel that you are set up to fail. The numbers you need to reach are unrealistic. In the area I worked in, several technicians have been robbed at gunpoint. This job would be best if you are in a safe area. However, in order to be successful you need to be comfortable working 11-12 hour days. Not a good work life balance."
bad,contract position was short lived due to corporate changes
bad,"A typical day at work you teach people to use their phones, take payments, explain warranty procedures etc.  You to try to sell to these people as well. .  A lot of people believe they have a defective phones but most of the time it's user error.  This would be great if the market wasn't so saturated but the company is now pushing other items such as digital life, tablets and wireless home phone.  (Whatever idiot came up with wireless home phone anyway?).  you do all of this with a bullseye on your back do to the unreasonable survey process.  A customer can like me and dislike AT&T and it all falls on me.  Or they can push the wrong button on the text survey and even explain the mistake in the notes but we still get dinged.  There all kinds of different punishments if you miss targets.  You have to call all of your customers back from the previous day even bill payments.  Makes a lot of sense considering the customer could have already gotten a survey for you.  Also you have to stand at the front door now and open the door for each customer that comes in.  We are in a strip mall so there are many false alarms.  So we are idiots running for the door all day.  Management will also take pictures of you without your permission to prove that you were looking somewhere other than the door.  The worse the numbers are the worse your life is.  Management can't come up with anything that will actually help so just new punishments are assigned.  It's something new and worse on a daily basis.  It's an extremely oppressive environment.  There is no room for advancement unless you want to"
bad,"Unfortunately I was not as pleased with AT&T.  Being one of the nation's largest wired and wireless provider, the stereotype of feeling like just a number became evident; I was not valued or appreciated.  In addition, many customer complaints or problems were not able to be handled at the retail desk.  Giving an irate customer a 1-800 toll-free number to call was the worst thing I would ever suggest, however for AT&T, that was corporate policy."
bad,"Constant traveling for minimum wage, co-workers were difficult, as was management."
bad,always award or great work and allow you to be self starters.
bad,"A typical day at work included answering inbound customer phone calls and resolving or assisting whatever it was, exactly, that the customer was calling about in the first place. My particular position also included the opportunity to upsell on every customer call. "
bad,I arrive at work 20 mins prior to shift begging in order to be well prepared for obstacles that may present themselves.  I've learned how to communicate with people from different walks of life.  I closely interact with my co-workers. We are a small nit family.
bad,"Answered the review on the previous page for the job at AT&T, tough company to work for when it came to selling yellow page advertising when the internet was getting larger."
bad,"Fast paced store manager position. We were the highest traffic corporate location in the state. High sales produced every month. Responsible for ten sales people, five temp employees, one sales support rep, and one assistant store manager through the transition from Alltel to AT&T. I'm proud to say we have no turnover during this time too. In 2009 I won the ACE award which is given to the top 1% in the company per position. "
bad,"Started as a good place to work, then upper management started getting greedy. Very stressful. "
bad,great pay and the opportunity to interact with different people daily
bad,Ok group of people to work with. Not the best management team.  
bad,"I love my co-workers, at this call center the turnover rate is high . If you ever worked there you will understand why. The benefits and pay is great buy the stress is high. I love the ability to solve the customers issues and being appreciated when you have resolved them."
bad,A typical day at work was highly stressful. The environment of the center was fast paced and sales driven. The co-workers were a lot of fun to work with.
bad,"Dia a dia pouco dinamico. No período em que trabalhei prestei serviços a outra grande companhia o que me possibilitou conhecer um pouco do perfil de uma multinacional. "
bad,"Terrible company to work for. People only call when they are mad, which is EVERY CALL"
bad,The uvese part pays really well and has great benefits but the management is strongly lacking in people skills. They threaten people all the time with write ups and termination.
bad,"Weekly meettings to discuss new or existing products, take inbound calls from existing customers and assist the customers from anything from upgrading a device to explaining a bill. I've built my customer service skills, I've learned that most products are produced to benefit the company, not the customer. The hardest part is the mandatory OT, the way in which workshifts are assigned, and not having an explanation for a customer as to why a service or product is not more accomodating to/for them."
bad,great great
bad,i would go in and relsolve customers issues or explain what is going on to cause the issue and give them an estimated solution day.
bad,"The job isn't hard in fact it's very interesting and dynamic. But AT&T telecom/Wireless isn't what it used to be, there is no job stability, or loyalty to the employee that got them to the top and built this network from the ground up."
bad,The office I worked for was horrible...if you lack self esteem then this is the perfect job for you.
bad,"From my start in 1996, the company was THE place to work, it had created a friendly, professional atmosphere and it looked out for it's employees thus creating a group of ""company gun hoes"" that could not have been more proud to work in such a wonderful place. After 2000, the company took a turn that eliminated most of the perks but still we remained convinced that this was only a temporary thing. 2010 marked another sharp turn from customer service to sales, at such point, ""the customer"" no longer was center stage, SALES was the one and only drive, employees were replaceable commodities and gone for good were the days where one felt proud of the company for whom we worked. Although there were an unfortunate turn of events for many employees, still today I can appreciate the no matter the outcome to myself, I still have great respect for AT&T."
bad,"Viajaba vendiendo por toda la provincia, disponiendo de mi vehiculo, cuyos gastos corrian por mi cuenta. No tenia un salario fijo, y al momento de liquidarme las comisiones eran con gran demora."
bad,Great technicians to work with. Management has little to no experience.
bad,Productive and a challenging place to work. Very good team and management. No office environment as almost everyone works from home. I would like an office environment where there is interaction between you and your colleagues which will help in my knowledge improvement and better performance.
bad,"• Sold products and services to new and existing Bellsouth/AT&T customers based on needs for the services and benefits or the product or service via phone, email, and internet. Products sold : Landline telephones, Cellular phones, DSL, Directv, U-Verse and customer provided equipment"
bad,a typical day at work was you go in the office get the coffee started then you would get all the mail open it and see what needed to be payed and what didn't then you would help any one that would come in the office to apply for a apartment then there was times where you had to answer the phone and the messages and then go and get rents and then go to the bank and lunch then you would go and do maintence orders for the maintence man. i liked the job but it was not a spot for me to be in
bad,Set up a booth in different stores.
bad,"This job will give you just enough compensation so you will not leave, but you don't have much chance at advancement unless you know the right ""people"". Otherwise you will stay on the phones for more than five years while others come in and are promoted within 3 months."
bad,Worked there for two years. was a great place to work as fare as pay and benefits. There was no job security however. They will fire you over anything. On top of the fact that this was a highly stressful work environment. On average I took about 50 to 70 calls a day. On highly volume days you could easily deal with about a 100 customers.
bad,Atmosphere was great but unfortunately no chance of relocation
bad,Data Entry/Customer Service
bad,"Revolving door, too much stress for what the job is. Co workers are awesome."
bad,very strict rules to follow and very harsh discipline if not followed. Management would yell at you in front of everyone. Very crowded working conditions.
bad,"I worked harder than I ever got paid, sometimes getting charge backs for the simplest omission even after spending over 4hrs on a job. At times, I only took $250 home at the end of the week. It would be better working at McDonald's instead of suffering in the heat and risking falling off rooftops. It was not worth my while working for Mastec. I did learn few technician skills, thru other technicians"
bad,Working for.an authorized retailer is not.the best.choice benefits arent available until after a yr where im.currently working
bad,"AT&T brings you in with high hopes and false expectations. Reality hits once you are employed and you have no life outside of work. As a manager with AT&T, you are on call 24/7 and expected to hit unattainable sales goals. Your supervisors do not value the time and effort you give to the company, which is unfortunate. I would not recommend AT&T as an employer, or service provider, to any of my friends based on my experience over 2 years with the company."
bad,I worked in IT at AT&T.
bad,"Racism in virginia, no room for advancement, hours are unfair, relocation is unattainable"
bad,Irate customers. Customer Service . Fair. Kept to themselves. Billing. People.
bad,"The hardest aspect about payment processing for AT&T is meeting the production requirements on a consistent basis. However, with focus and great time management, one can get the job done."
bad,Most people know AT&T because we are forced to know. They know it because people read about how they raise prices and basically do everything it can to rip the customer off. Well its not different when working for the company. The management is very unorganized and force you to lie to customers. Customer surveys? Well they will write you up if you do not get AT&T a high willing to recommend score even though your personal score with the customer may be through the roof.
bad,"unstable hours to work, no transportation available, pay per hour to low, lacking major employee moral, no benefits available."
bad,Pushing sales after helping someone with a phone problem isn't what i call making a living. But if you like talking on the phone... go for it!
bad,"Is a fun place to work and you learn different things everyday, however it is a very strong micro manage environment. Management do not respect the sales reps and never recognize what you do right only whats done wrong. Co-workers are very friendly and we work as a team. The job is very easy. I love my customers."
bad,"The local area management tried to implement shady sales tactics, I only hope that one day the corporate big wigs catch up to them, and sincerely hope it is not already a practice of entire company"
bad,You do a lot for a very low pay. I think should company should pay more.
bad,"taking calls from upset customers with billing, equipment and serviceing issues"
bad,"After 25 yrs of service pushed into to early retirement, Im to young to retire. They bring in contractor from other countries to fill these postions at a cut rate, they don't have to pay vacation,benefits."
bad,"good if you can get in, some dept not felxible , some dept very good. some manager need to be go and some need promotions ."
bad,"At&t was great to get up close and personal customer service experience. At first the job was fun it was like going behind the curtain and seeing how a major corporation works from day to day. It was fun to get to talk to new people with different problems everyday. However, most people call customer service because they have a problem not to say how great you are. If you enjoy or can handle demanding customers that are sometimes yelling at you on a day to day basis this job is for you."
bad,"I came to AT&T Mobility as a recent college graduate, and accepted a non-negotiable rate of 10.63 per hour. Shortly thereafter, AT&T raised the rate to a negotiable pay scale based on qualifications. The top end of the spectrum is $14.61 for those with 4 year degrees. Instead of raising the rest of our pay to be commensurate with our experience and education levels as our CWA contract dictates, AT&T has steadfastly remained of the position that the original $10.63 hiring rate was actually non-negotiable, although my memory serves me that several people walked out of our original group interview when told that the pay was non-negotiable. That being said, I have been there for several years, and all of my podmates who have been there for less than one year make more money than me, although they are on the same raise schedule. This is a major complaint."
bad,Too many meetings.
bad,No matter how long you have been at this company you will never get advanced to a higher position.
bad,This is a great job for someone to get there feet wet without any advertising background. The best products they have are the inet products; they range from SEM all the way to listings on yp.com. The hardest part of the job is selling the print. There aren't too many industries that still have a strong ROI on the print.
bad,"high pressure sales, great pay and benefits, good people, right idea about what the company wants to accomplish but executed wrong."
bad,same as usual not much to say. i am not sure if i should pick the positive or the negative.
bad,"I Love My Co Workers, And On The Job Training... The best Part Of The Job Is The Customers And Being Able To Establish A Rapport W/ The Customers. I Learned That At Any Given It Could be Me On The Other End Needing Assistance"
bad,This company has zero respect for their employees. If you have a family then you may want to consider a different career some place other than AT&T. The customers think that we ate horrible and honestly they are right. If your sick then there is no excused time. Everything will count against you. Your chances at advancement range from about 5-10 years if you plan on becoming a manager. The pay is ridiculous. Pay two bills and your broke. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone!
bad,to be honest this is just a job. more ideal for somebody graduating high school or in college just trying to make a little extra money or have a job until something better comes along.
bad,"I like working there, its was a nice friendly workplace. I didn't like working shift I had there since it was open 24/7."
bad,"If your looking for flexibility this is not the place. If you are someone who has children or other responsibilities, you may last a year... and if you like to be cursed out every day this is a winner for you. the managers do not back you up, and you switch shifts every 3-6 mths and will have a differnt manager every 3-6 mths. what one mgr tells you is completely different then the next. the turn around rate is constant, because at&t doesnt care about their employees, thats why they have a bad rep with customer service because everyone is NEW and they dont know what they're doing!!! Only good thing is pay is pretty good. but dont stay to long because they will cap you and stop giving u raises at about $16/hr. everyone at at&t will tell u they hate there job. guarenteed!"
bad,Responsible for hitting sales quotas and educating myself on new products and services.
bad,AT&T looked like a wonderful employer from the outside but once on the inside for me it was very different. This job has great benefits but they are truly about monatery gain and not benefiting the customer.
bad,"This is a job where you learn many different skills and meet many different people. The work environment is great. It's something that you have to get use to doing if you've never done it before. It's pretty easy once you've learned how to do the work, but you will run into different situation out in the field that can affect your production."
bad,The job was very productive I learned alot of new things. But I alsoalso feel like the job that me and my team was not getting paid enough for the job that we were doing.
bad,The job itself is stressful with no guarantee of consistent days off or even getting off in time. Always overworking employees with no regards of family or health. Management is also a big burden. The management team is always misinformed and will terminate employees to save face. Overall working for this company is a waste of time and energy.
bad,"The expectations are too much,immediate managements is good but district management r hypocrite and rude because the only thing they care is how much business you are producing, they don't understand that there r good and bad days. As a company there is not support for associates life and work balance and the worst not understanding that we are humans not perfect machines. You may be the best employee @ certain day and tomorrow they will be writing you up or worst you may be gone for some stupidity."
bad,"If you are looking for a permanent position, keep looking. No benefits, no vacation, no overtime, etc. Plus, when the time comes to bring you on permanently, they'd rather let your contract expire and bring someone else in, even if you work your tail off for them."
bad,"This job has low moral, no incentives, no appreciation for employees. The union came in and everything good about the compant went out the door. There is no sick time and the FMLA policy is so strict. There is always somone out on stress leave"
bad,They're only concern is making money. They don't care about their employees at all.
bad,Used to be a great company to work for. Now its a company with low job security and it seems there's alot of favoritism involved when being considered for other positions
bad,"Es buen sueldo, es lo bueno del trabajo. "
bad,"Si puedes trabajar bajo MUCHA presión, sin escrúpulos y buscando hacer una venta mientras resuelves un problema de facturación, técnico o lo que venga y hacer un reporte en menos de 5 minutos y no te molesta poner tu salud emocional en juego con la constante presión Corporativa, este trabajo es para ti! El ansiolítico y los antidepresivos serán tus mejores amigos! No veras casi a tu familia  y te odiaras porque ""nunca es suficiente""!"
bad,Management contradict themselves constantly. Expectations are almost unreachable. Unless you know someone personally it’s difficult to get anywhere within the company. They promote the ones who should not be leaders because of their immaturity or shady behaviors.
bad,High demand on marketing and customer sales. Work environment is not as relaxed as was when new management came in. Not much employee appreciation for all employees and the work that is done. Does have great pay and benefits but it comes with a lot of marketing
bad,"Horario accesible, sueldo poco competitivo, buen habiente de trabajo. Pero te prometen muchas cosas al ingresar si tienes buenos resultados, pero ya cuando estás adentro cambia todo, los beneficios de empleados son hasta nomina interna y aun yo teniendo buenos resultados ya casi tengo 8 meses y no me han dado ni los vales de despensa."
bad,"The company offers great benefits however you will not have the security or sanity you would need to enjoy them. Vacation, health insurance, dental, and vision."
bad,"Be prepared for extremely demanding work environment, the demands placed upon an entry level employee are extreme and the work environment is unforgiving."
bad,"Very fast paced, minimal time to complete all tasks.  Very high safety culture and care for employees in that regard.  Downsizing affects everyone......"
bad,"This job is great benefits wise and it’s so good with the pay compared to other mobility jobs but oh my goodness I hated my manager so much"
bad,Prem techs have good pay for the work but your quality of life suffers with never being off at the same time and the fact that your schedule can change with 48 hour notice.
bad,"AT&T was a great company to work for before purchasing DirecTV in 2014. The commission structure was cut in half, goals raised higher, and traffic became very slow shortly after. Your work-life balance is only good if you are pretty high in seniority which you bid on during the end of every month."
bad,"Senior Management does not follow core values. "
bad,"No real time for family, continous mandatory 6 day work weeks, not enough PTO to compensate for longer work days and weeks. Many false and leading ideas of job security and advancement."
bad,"El ambiente laboral es malo. Durante el entrenamiento tanto la gerente como el subgerente me decían que debía desenvolverme y tener interacción con el cliente, cosa que pues es totalmente comprensible y aceptable, el problema fue cuando una compañera me habla de una manera bastante despectiva y prepotente diciéndome ""Esque con tu comportamiento nos quieres hacer ver como idiotas, tú piensas que eres listo y que sabes, pero no, ni eres listo ni sabes nada, así que de ahora en adelante te sientas ahí, te callas y con el cliente no vas a tener ninguna interacción"", como si no hubiera entendido a la primera, se pasa repitiendo una y otra vez ""No sabes nada, no sabes, no sabes"", y no conforme con ello, al día siguiente va y me acusa de tener una actitud altanera y prepotente en el trabajo, la gerente comienza a decir que si voy a dar esa clase de problemas entonces no le sirvo, y en cuanto quiero explicar sólo se limita a decir que no haga un problema donde no lo hay, ya que ""aquí no es un mercado para andarnos con chismes"""
bad,"Increases have not come close to cost of living for over 20 years. "
bad,At&t stores will soon be the only At&t jobs available within a few years at the rate it's going. a center is being closed monthly. Our center closed. we were then relocated to a center where departments where closing every month around us. Even during our training class. There's just a matter of time before
bad,"working at a fortune 500 company was a great experience, it has most definitely taught me a lot. the work environment was decent and the money was great, just wish there was more advancement"
bad,"The company has involved from wireless to tv services offering customer a one stop one shop. The company pay is good but, it's a stressful environment to work."
bad,"at&t will not value your worth and?care about the work life relationship!!!"
bad,"Just don't, they are about as corrupt as you can imagine because the numbers are extremely high and cause the managers to do shady things to obtain the goals. Not worth it."
bad,"Pros: "
bad,en las empresas donde he laborado me gustado la forma del trato hacia los empleados y la forma de trabajo que se realiza en equipo
bad,every since the dtv buyout they dont care about workers or their customers.  was told to push direct tv even if uverse was availble and was a better product for the customer to pad number for the stock holders
bad,"I am not a salesman.  Was given a spreadsheet of 500 pre-existing clients to contact an encourage to upgrade their current AT & T services.  These business clients knew what they wanted, and did not wish to upgrade.  In order to sell to them, I would have had to make false promises."
bad,"Working from 8am to whenever is never a good thing for those who have a family.  Plus as a wire technician they treat you like you don't matter to the company at all, despite the fact that its our installations that bring in the revenue.  Literally everyone around you has a quitting time ( from 8am-5pm or something in the range) and you may be stuck at work until 10pm.  Will never work for these people again."
bad,"It is important to remember that you are trying to work for a company that has gone through numerous mergers. The internal systems that you use, prove this. You will deal with the problems of too many systems for one outcome that you would expect to be easy as well as incompetence from your supporting staff. "
bad,AT&T is a company that is changing with the times for the customers. The call center can be a stressful job for some individuals. The benefits are great
bad,From the time I started until I retired the company changed vastly.  Over the last 5 years I was there it became very stressful.  No direction from management and requirement changes at the last moment.
bad,Worked for AT&T over 23 years.  All performance reviews were meets and exceeds expectations.  They are really cutting jobs to save money and they are hitting veteran employees that are close to full pension eligibility.  I regret all the time I took from my family to complete projects that were not feasible to accomplish in normal work hours.  They offer a preferential placement for surplus employees but they do not enforce it.  They company used to really focus on customers and employees.  Sadly now it is all on cash flow.  The quality and reliability is just not what one should expect from a giant in the industry.
bad,There's 6 week of training where all types of information is crammed in. You have to past 3 test with 90% or better if not you may be terminated. I never experienced a job where they pull you in the office and request that you resign because of a test. Every day I was there i felt like my job was threatened. Some managers where helpful.
bad,No adequate training to help employees struggling or lacking one skill or the other. Managers are looking out for themselves and careless about those that they over see
bad,"Promotions to those whom are unqualified"
bad,"You don’t get much work life balance with this company. Aggressively sales driven to the point of working in the “grey” area most of the time. "
bad,"Good pay and decent benefits due to union contract, but work environment is willfully hostile from upper management, continuous lay-offs despite promises of job creation, with no advancement opportunities in sight."
bad,"Working here was okay for the first few months. When there is very little traffic the work environment becomes very tense, aggressive, and dull. I plan to further my education therefore I don't see this as a place I could grow at or stay at long term. Most of the time I find myself staring at the walls or at my phone and feeling like I am wasting my time. Managers harass you when you're unable to meet sales quota due to little to no traffic and blatantly ignore the fact that there simply isn't anyone coming in to sell to. That being said, if you are the type of person who can aggressively harass and force products/services onto any/every customer who DOES happen to come into the store during these painfully slow/low traffic times, then you will probably succeed at this job. I cannot bring myself to sell things to people who don't need things, or talk them into thinking that they do, and go home at night feeling good about myself. I don't get any satisfaction from sitting around all day doing nothing and then lying to people if or when they do come in just so that I can make some money and meet an unrealistic sales quota for a dead, low traffic store. I can't do it."
bad,Calls were coming in rapid speed and management was poorly trained to handle their positions. Almost felt like a boot camp however I did learn discipline through the job and I’m thankful for that much
bad,"Unreachable goals, upper management is a train wreck. High stress, no job security, the work is not bad, but hard to do job due to nothing to work with. would recommend staying away."
bad,"Training was more they provided you with materials and if you had questions, they didn't like answering them. You felt on your own from the get go. Pay was not worth what you had to do. Advancement was not common."
bad,"Work and work and meet metrics that change every 6 months with no work life balance. It is a SYOA place to work. "
bad,MY time at AT&T was a lot longer than I expected because of the benefits and pay in my area. I believe that the work environment is very stressful and we are made to feel more like a number than valued employees. I am not sure if this is the culture for all of the AT&T call centers but it was for the one that I worked in. There was not much understanding when there were family emergencies and things like that. The call center was more focused on the needs of the business than the needs of the employees and it showed
bad,Great place to work if you want to worry if you'll have a job every quater when the surpluss list comes out.  Also if you like to drink every night to try and forget about how bad everyone treats you its a great place.
bad,"The managment in the area was extremely reliant on promoting buddies of their own, not owning up to mistakes, and pushing down issues instead of working as a team to solve them, creating more chaos for reps that already had a full plate. Not to mention scandals of managers that were racist/sexist, creating more issues in lue. I left due to the fact that I had no forward momentum without moving regions, but more importantly, one could sell 250% of the goals in a month and still get yelled at for under preforming. Pay and benefits were pretty great overall, health insurance was fantastic. Sadly poor managment and need of a real career pushed me out the door. Would recommend AT&T in a different area possibly, but not where I was located."
bad,"I actually really liked the company and the compensation. They have a few different training options one is simply on line and not live, which is what I was assigned. I do not feel I learned a lot from it as this is not really my learning style. Due to this I feel like it did take me a while to catch on to some of the processes. The manager Joe at the pa-pillion store made me feel really embarrassed anytime I asked a question to the point I felt sick coming to work. The culture was such if a manager does not like you, the whole team gangs up on you. It was a lot like being back in high school again. Ultimately I left but would  have stayed for a very long time had I had different leadership. Now I am with another wireless company and now that I am not being condemned for asking questions I have become a pro at AT&T's system and feel valued I will more than likely stay for some time to come."
bad,Was there 12 years never was promoted. Instead they promise you’ll be offline and you do work other people get paid more for. Management is for the most part Drama.
bad,"You can't get too comfortable in your job as they are constantly surplussing (lay offs) almost every quarter.  They have mediocre online training options, and rarely if ever get to attend a real outside training course on the company dime.  You can get a ""nanodegree"" which internally sounds good, but has no real translation outside of the company."
bad,My personal review of AT&T are work environment as well as employees managers also wonderful to work with. Also  exceptional benefits including health and company  discounts.
bad,"Honestly, best pay I've ever had in a company BUT it comes with a price. They'll take you with open arms and treat you like gold but it will take about 3 months to realize how trash of a company this place really is. You're essentially working for the devil that has ways of telling you to lie to customers without actually telling you to lie in order to protect their jobs ( upper management.) You have super unrealistic goals, and behaviors and rules are not set to help you win but are used to make it easier for people to fire. The work life balance here is probably the worst I've ever encountered. You will never get a weekend off and you will work on your days off. This is a job that'll drive you to a mental institution. I have co workers who were placed on leave because of high stress. This is not a job for anyone with a mental illness such as depression or anxiety. At&t is in more dept than any other organization in the world. The company will make purchases of other companies that don't make sense and make management and sales reps pay for their horrible business decisions. You will get mixed messages. This is a damned if you do, damned if you don't environment. Just to add a cherry on top, this is coming from one of their best sales managers. Trust me, save yourself."
bad,The company has changed over the years. The Compnay is not a secure place to work anymore. The compnay lays off to send the jobs overseas to save money.
bad,The job was extremely stressful and i was never home. I have young kids and  they were always with a baby sitter. It cost me more to have them taken care of than I made
bad,"Deficiente contratación, Nunca firmé documento alguno."
bad,"Working at the store I got relocated to was a total mess, New store at the mall where most shoppers are window shoppers. Also general store manager and her assistant were judgmental and didn't care about there associate well being due to being disabled from an auto accident in rhe oasy. "
bad,"Are you good at assimilating corporate culture and gobbling up what rolls downhill?  Do you have no family or at least hate seeing yours? Do you like constant pressure from constantly changing managers to do everything faster, better, more and with a smile on your face?  If you answered YES to all three, this job is for you!"
bad,it doesn't matter if your good at your job or not..  you constantly feel like your head is on the chopping block.  there's no option of transferring or promotion.
bad,"I work a consistent 10-14hours days. I managed multiple sales teams.  Bettering yourself is not rewards but is recognized.  the hunt for the sales is rewarding, and working together."
bad,"Upper and lower management are never on the same page.  Managers are constantly making power grabs for people but then pass the work off or just stop doing it all together without regards to the work still needs to be done.  Workload is so siloed that it takes a week to do a task that should take 10 minutes.  Staff constantly worried if they'll be part of the next ""Surplus"""
bad,Ethics are at an all time low when keeping your job is involved. An atmosphere of cheating and numbers manipulation has set president and is basically promoted by upper management.
bad,"The management and structure was extremely poor, you are asked to do unethical things to make sales, and managers are clueless to the day to day operations of the job and what it entails, instead of trying to fix any problems the idea of leading by far is supposed to solve all work problems"
bad,"The job itself was wonderful,  it was the lack of management and the improper managaing that caused for a stressful work environment. Never had proper equipment to do jobs  people stay for benefits. "
bad,"I mean, they pay well and have good benefits.  But it's not worth it if your employees don't even want to be at work because management is exceptionally poor.  Constant favoritism for employees who will tattle on other, bargained for, employees.  Inconsistent ""rules"" between employees under the same job title.  Refusing training for employees because of ""Needs of the business""."
bad,They hire as contract employees and as soon as the project is over they let you go.  No way would I recomment AT&T for a long-term employer.  They have NO work/life balance.  They demand mandatory OT with little to no notice.
bad,"- A typical day at work... clock in for working shift and bombarded by 5, 1 hour conference calls to explain previous day/months performance while Having to sell and coach team simultaneously. "
bad,"When I started my career I was advised to be at work when scheduled and keep absences and tardies at an absolute minimum, work hard and do good work to keep a job for as long as you wish.  Over 42.5 years I did this, but was surplussed anyway."
bad,Let me make clear that I was working with a 3rd party agency that so happened to have a contract with said company. I was on the top of my team with sales but just had an issue with them hiring management that were friends instead of hiring who fit the job description.
bad,"I enjoyed my coworkers and the job itself, but there was no job security and management failed to hold employees accountable. Because they hired younger managers, it almost felt like a daycare...management was more concerned about making friends than doing their job properly."
bad,Low morale and always layoffs occurring. Pay is great but add more job duties quarterly with other departments having less work load and more compensation. Some managers are awesome but they get rid of the good managers and keep the ones that can be a bit robotic. Love the work meeting new people and the product itself.
bad,"This was a very stressful job. Each job you had to run your own cables, can't use existing cables, and complete the job in 2-4 hours by your self. If it was an apartment, it will take up to 2 hours but a house with 4 TV's or more can take up to 6-8 hours."
bad,My experience was great until my original job was cut from the company. Soon after we were assigned a new store manager who just brought the whole store down. It really just depends on who you get as your store manager.
bad,"A typical day for a level 1 manger starts at 6 am and last until the last technician is finished sometimes 9 or 10 pm. AT&T did provide some valuable Management training in my time with them. I feel their culture is driven strictly by meeting the metrics and a safety policy of fear of write ups no loyalty for time served. I have found dealing with union nonsense very hard, it has taken a formally good relationship and driven a wedge between management and technician that was not present before being acquired. Taking care of customers, resolving issues or getting service to rural areas always made me feel good."
bad,"My observation as a technician, They hire to fire. The managers would constantly drive around like they were cops/policeman, literally jumping out of vehicles trying to catch you breaking a rule or a safety violation. It was truly stressful work environment. People were quitting constantly, including myself."
bad,Stressful job. Dictator management with no freedom of speech. They alway lied to customer. Service is not good. It’s not an equal opportunity employer.
bad,The pay and benefits are great but there is no job security. Every quarter you are concerned if you will still be employed. There is no flexibility in schedule.
bad,"Unfortunately, I do not remember much of my time with AT&T, as it was over 5 years ago. I do recall being let go shortly after my training was complete due to having strep throat, like a good portion of my class had at the time."
bad,"Constantly felt like I was being observed. The company and role is completely driven by irrelevant metrics. The work is fulfilling if you enjoy solving problems and working with your hands, however many issues arise that are out of your hands that will require you staying late to resolve. Very difficult to resolve issues as you have to navigate the giant bureaucracy of a century old monopoly."
bad,"I've worked in call centers for other companies such as T-mobile, Virgin Mobile, and DirecTv, and AT&T's call center was by far the worse. Very unprofessional atmosphere, very high turnover, i started in July 2017 with 32 people in my training class and by October 2017 there were only 2 of us left. Management changes the agreed upon lunch hour to 30 mins whenever they liked and was very unsympathetic to workers who had to make last minute adjustments. Training classes got smaller and smaller from 30+ down to 9-11 ppl. Not a very good place to work."
bad,"Work, Work, Work.  No work/ home balance. However, I really enjoyed working with my employees.  I had an excellent bosses most of the time, too.  They care too much about the bottom line, but not their employees.  They lay off the employees that have been there the longest and outsource their jobs."
bad,"work life balance is okay. hard nose numbers, exceed goal or get fired. "
bad,"I loved the pay working for AT&T.  My son was autistic and I was given FMLA but AT&T did not like this at all.  I was there for several years and even though my performance was great they did not want anyone there that can take FMLA.  Even though it is legal.  So they look for anything in your calls and instead of going over it with you they will let you go.  The union also is a joke.  They have the employers back, not yours.  This is why I was approved for unemployment through AT&T because it was proved I got let go and they could not prove why."
bad,"Boring, Lots of Customers dont want phones or DTV so expect to waste your time. ALOT."
bad,I enjoyed working for Directv prier to AT&T because it was a company that understood it was a life outside of work. It was a fun place to work. After the Directv changed to AT&T the company made us feel like we were just another number and the communication was not clear cut. It was always a grey area.
bad,Frequent layoffs are common these days within AT&T.  Management is more concerned with meeting quarterly numbers than keeping quality employees.  Unstable employment is the new normal.
bad,"As stated the pay is good, but the hours are very long and little to help balance personal life.  You don't know when you will get home on any day.  Worked  mandatory six days for about half of last year. "
bad,"Not happy with the culture at AT&T.  Too many levels, hoops to jump through to get anything done. I am trying to find a new job working for a smaller company."
bad,"They pay and benefits were ok, but the managers and the sick day policy was absurd.  Also the metrics didn't seem to be stable and I could never seem to get things to flow smoothly.  There was no set time off every day, so you work till the work is gone. In accordance to the previous comment that could mean that you got off early and didn't get your hours for the day or you could be out till 10-11 at night working without any way to stop for dinner."
bad,"Difficult Management and unrealistic expectations. I was with the company for many years. The work hours are not flexible, it was almost impossible to take a paid sick day, so you would end up having to accumulate a point instead. Too many points, and you're fired. Some employees would receive special treatment and get promotions due to being friends with management. Most of the management was difficult to work with and would talk down to employees, even though employees would have to deal with lots of verbal abuse from customers. No communication between departments, Customer Service, Sales, and Support never seemed to know what the other departments were doing. Often other departments would just transfer customers to us if they didn't know how to assist them."
bad,The organization I worked in was the former telops and the core business network services offered have commoditized over the years. Declining prices means shrinking margins which squeezed comp and support resources. Not an enjoyable environment
bad,The culture at AT&T is an evolving culture. There is a plan for the year 2020. AT&T is a global company that is proactive with thinking future. Plan to be in a role for 2 to 3 years at most. Always have a plan to move forward and grow to be successful.
bad,"ATT came in and let everyone go from DIRECTV.I didn;t work for ATT I worked for DIRECTV. I loved my job. I managed all the supervisors, work out in field, payroll, HR, Handle all managers credit accounts, Handle office supply ordering and outside vendor ordering."
bad,Typically I enjoyed my work days at AT&T.  I truly relished coming to work and working with the technicians that reported to me.  The culture at AT&T is its a big company that is not worried about the little people.  Employees are not cultivated but instead hurried through like a turn style. I had the pleasure of working with an amazing group of leaders locally but anything regionally or above we didn't matter.
bad,"AT&T is a giant corporation and provides a very corporate, cut-throat environment. Not for me. Although management speaks about being advocates for the customer, their actions reflected anything but. I had high hopes but was disappointed with the company's priorities."
bad,I prefer not to answer this question and would like to just keep it to the ratings but it was not a enjoy experiences. People are over worked and its a lot if childish issues.
bad,"After 19 years of pouring my heart and soul into this company, I get notified that I was laid off along with three others in my work group."
bad,"lucrative and fun but stressful if you start to struggle, no help is offered to get you back on track, its only do or die ultimatums. constantly being told about what you're doing wrong and its up to you to figure how to better it, or else."
bad,"They want you to sell directv and if you don't you get written up.  The company is out of touch with reality.  In third quarter alone  DTV lost 350,000 subscribers.  It was a big mistake to buy it and upper management is trying to cover their big mistake by pressuring the stores to sell, sell sell directv."
bad,"Projects cancelled, layoffs frequent, never know where you are headed in your career.  Benefits good including discounted phone service.  All the best software but you will probably not get to work with it."
bad,"After 18 years,  I was laid off at AT&T ,  so I feel my review would not be fair.  The first 8 years were with BellSouth and it was a "
bad,The job is straight forward it was not terrible but the hours were hard and long. Sometimes you might not get back home until  2 am in the mourning. The pay was really good got to take care of my brothers and sisters when i eventually left. Once you do the job you literally time for nothing else.
bad,"Usually very stressful and work schedule could change "
bad,I loved my job as it was directv but once att took over it all went down hill. Att made directv so corporate instead on how family oriented it was before.
bad,Outsourcing and a disconnected company cause many problems for employees and management culture is weak and immature - which encourages and feeds into an immature employee base.
bad,"With exception of my last position, I was busy with meaningful work. I was punished for speaking up an calling out a lack of integrity on the part of management. Due to reorg and restructures, I worked for no less than five different supervisors. I had respect for only one, the rest were all ""yes"" men/women and in it only for themselves. I truly enjoyed meeting and working with my peers. For the most part, they were all good people and very willing to collaborate."
bad,"Quality is out the window these days. customers suffer which makes you suffer. your expected to do pretty much everything now, sales. pair changes, bridge taps, apps, everything. DTV ruined this job."
bad,"Forced to work 10 to 12 hours a day. Low morale.They make you feel more like a number than a valued employee. Benefits and discounts are great, but the work expectations outweigh the benefits."
bad,"After working hard for 6 years as a senior application arch and programmer, and then ultimately product owner, they offered me a salary that was almost 50% of market.   I walked and added another $15K to my income within 2 weeks.  AT&T is too big to not consider you a number (by HR), so if you're really good, don't go to AT&T unless you negotiate your appropriate salary on the front end with guaranteed annual increases, or you'll just end up making a mistake and being frustrated by their idiocy."
bad,"Good job if your young, with no spouse or kids, and don't mind working long hours 5 to 6 days a week.  If you've got a family you might want to think twice, because you'll be spending little time with them anymore.  Management tries to hold employees accountable for unrealistic expectations and metrics that the employees have very little control over.  Average tenure for a technician is around 2 years (big red flag).  Management reserves the right to cancel any days off or vacation when they feel the need to (regardless of any plans you may have already had). Covered under cwa union, but union upholds unnecessary company policies more than they fight for any employees rights."
bad,"The typical work day is long and stressful.  Most days are very busy but non-productive.  The job is hourly plus commission but the majority of customers visiting the store are sent there from customer service or franchise locations for bill analysis and tech support.  These things pay no commission and do not help you meet you monthly sales goals.  If you do not hit your goals you can be written up and eventually fired.  In general, store management up to territory level management either encourage or turn a blind eye to unethical behavior as long as it makes the scorecard look good.  It's very hard to move up from store level unless you are willing to operate unethically.  The only thing upper management values is high sales numbers.  Leadership, ethics, teamwork, and hard work mean nothing.  Also, the company uses a point based attendance policy.  No paid sick days.  If you, or a family member, are sick you have to take a point.  After you run out of points you are fired.  The amount of points you can use is as low as 8 in one year."
bad,"Honestly The integrated Solutions is a joke for this company. Goals are way to high, and they will do anything to push for sales. Very unethical, they want you to prey on minorities knowing they will default on contracts. Resulting in commission already paid to be taken away"
bad,I have no comment regarding At*T.  As I am no longer employed with them my option is not relevant. If you want to work there go fort it doesn't matter to em.
bad,"the days off you get are not beneficial for the work that you do. The pay is a little on the light side for the amount of work that you have to do as a wire technician you are doing 2 peoples jobs instead of 1. You never have a solid answer on what time you will be home. You are constantly hounded about your numbers even if you are doing great. Just because you are doing great and have your numbers, if the managers numbers are bad you are doing poor. Do not expect to be able to go do a bunch of things in the year as they will stop you from using your vacation and personal time between the months you would really want to use your time. Some times you are lucky if there is enough work for all of your coworkers and AT&T is starting to do more and more lay offs."
bad,"Over the course of the 5 years (and before my tenure according to my long term comrades) AT&T has continuously made it known that the shareholder dollar is much more important than it's workers welfare.  The shifts have gone from 8 hours over 5 days to four 10 hour shifts to cut overtime to a sheer minimum.  My group of guys were forced to start driving and hour south to work each day, a 45 minute increase in commute time each way.  Both of which have collectively taken 4 daily hours away from our time with our families and two of those hours are unpaid.  All of the small things that made us believe that AT&T was thankful for what we do (breakfast for zero quarterly safety incidences and the occasional donuts and coffee) have been eliminated, as well as simple ""thank you""s from our superiors.  The speed and productivity requirements have all gone up as well as an expansion of our scope of work and knowledge with no provisions or willingness to compensate us for our ever expanding skill sets EVEN IN THE WAKE OF MASSIVE TAX BREAKS FOR WORKER PAY RAISES as granted by the current POTUS.  And these things are all products of a calculated maneuver by AT&T to get around the union determined wages which are easily $10 more an hour for the same type of work. The overwhelming number of overseas call centers is alarming as well. The company is hardly hurting for cash and it is absolutely unreasonable for the company to not share its successes with it's employees which is evident in the 28.4 million dollars that the CEO made last year which is 13% more than he made the previous year.  My"
bad,"Being a Premise Technician at AT&T has been the worse experience of my life. We have been working 6 days a week, up to 12 hours a day, for months now with no end in sight. They haven't hired a single technician in close to 3 years, while technicians are quitting left and right. "
bad,kind individuals who sincerely care about assisting you to make a smooth transition onto the AT&T Marketing team. Door to door sales with a very rewarding atmosphere and opportunities.
bad,"Outside of the management at this franchise AT&T that I worked, the other employees were usually great. However working at a franchise it was really annoying dealing with customers problems that we couldn't deal with due to the lack of permissions we had. Also, there were a lot of things that managers kept from their employees because they believed that they wouldn't be able to do it correctly. It was demanding, understaffed, and typically a stressful environment even without customers because there was a constant urge to increase sales or get fired."
bad,"I was hired as customer care representative. Moved to retention where the main concern was to retain the customer. After AT&T purchased DIRECTV, the position focused more on sales. This job is very stressful, 70-85% of employees are on some type of anxiety and or depression medications."
bad,"i got laid off after 18 years, upper management is horrible, i only liked working for local management. there was no level of advancement in the company"
bad,"I worked for DirecTV for 20 years, I was laid off after the merger."
bad,"the company views you as a number, nothign you ever do is right you never get told good job  for anything you do. even though you are salary you are expected to work at least two hours of overtime daily with no compensation. you are threatened with your job on a daily basis"
bad,"The company played favorites, unprofessionalism, overworked to the point where some employees had strokes. They stated they cared about there employees but t honestly was about the bottom line."
bad,"Upper management cares only about the numbers and has no regard for their employees or their customers. While it was a great place to work when it was AT&T Wireless and Cingular, as soon as SBC purchased us, the quality of management and their care for their employees and their customers disappeared."
bad,"Constant battle for a numbers driven system. Upper management hasn't any clue about the trials and tribulations technicians face on a daily basis. Constant threat of losing your job."
bad,schedules selection by seniority so after 5 years with the company you will be working on Saturday this is a job for single persons plus this. They can force you to work 6 days week. Options to get upper or different positions are really hard to get so must likely you will be working like technician forever. Higher management  changes rules and metric target every month making really hard for a lot of tech reach the target
bad,Management was more interested in being friends or their personal lives then helping agents improve. Give aways were done from a third party organization that were quite lucrative.
bad,all about numbers and quantity not quality. union contract was not very well for the division i worked in and union steward were working with managers. all about favortism
bad,"For all of their rhetoric, this company truly does not value their employees. In my position, we are constantly forced to work overtime  and the company shows absolutely no remorse for the hours they are forcing us to work. They are also no longer investing in their Uverse platform, i.e. new and updated equipment, which is leaving us struggling to fulfill orders for customers. They want to proclaim how great their services are, but it is very difficult to back that up when they are only providing archaic equipment for their Uverse division or trying to force people to DirecTv."
bad,Very poor middle and lower management. They really do not care about their employees to the point our director actually told us they do not care. Bottom line is their bottom line.
bad,"I worked at this call center before it was unionized, it was a bit more of a stressful environment at that time.  I was in an advanced position and it was very demanding.  While the pay was very good compared to the rest of the market, it was very demanding."
bad,In my opinion when working for AT&T you're nothing but a number to them.  When I asked to purchase my own chair for work they denied me that request and the chairs they gave me hurt my back.
bad,The managers they hire are awful and they team up with employees under them to try to get rid of the ones they don't like. Management should be audited and fired for their poor performance in leadership.
bad,Commission and salary wasn’t up to par with other markets. Company needs to improve the work environment so the team is happy to come to work. Micro management needs to be reduced.
bad,"The job is demanding and can be difficult to meet all metrics every month. The money is great, it definitely depends who your boss is to really enjoy your job."
bad,Company has treated me well and the salary is good but the expectations rapidly grow as the company terminates employees. The atmosphere continues to decline on a daily basis. There is no work life balance.
bad,"AT&T is rapidly downsizing for a goal to meet at 2020."
bad,"I was only there for a few months, but it was ok. Working phones was sort of stressful, but it was part of the job. I would work for them again if I could."
bad,change culture and direction but still need to improve management and company culture. hard to compete with high tech company. not fairly  treated all employees.
bad,There is no job security with AT&T they have a bad quarter and begin liquidating employees. If you work for them always consider it a temporary job and you will do well
bad,"This is not a job for the thin skinned. One thing is for sure if you can handle a lot of pressure, bad management, and the stress of losing your job daily, you will make a lot of money working here."
bad,"They tell you not to work off the clock, but you have too. Metrics are set at a level too high to reach, 99%, which you have no control over. People not being home, unplugging their DVR within 30 days of you being their, even though you replaced a remote only on that visit, someone cutting a cable, TV input on the wrong one, dead remote batteries, etc, are all the last techs fault. The tech should have known the batteries were going to die, or that they weren't going to be home for their appointment. I'm sure upper management wouldn't work for the company if they had to live by the rules and contract that they basically forced on us. They need to be on 'undercover boss' to get a clue."
bad,"We all have seen people who work hard and care about the job they do get fired for small infractions. You are constantly on write up for little things or a performance plan. The result is that it feels like Management is looking for a reason to fire you. I’ve never experienced such a toxic environment. You spend many waking hours of your life at work and it should be stable and have some level of comfort if you are trying your best and care about the work you produce. We have all said, when you’re called in to talk to the manager you may as well say your goodbyes because it’s possible it’s your last day. The stress of that makes the pay and benefits not worth it. The job itself is interesting and fun. You get to meet many new people in their homes and you have the opportunity to make their day. You must be very flexible to work here because you can’t leave until your last job is done and no more jobs are waiting to be dispatched. You cannot make after work commitments period."
bad,"The place I worked isn't even open anymore. It was annoying, almost as annoying as writing this review. Answering phones and trying to convince poor people to buy stuff isn't my thing."
bad,"Working with local and same-level reps was fine, but middle managerial incompetence resulted in half-aware and indifferent monitoring and refusal to conduct basic business functions."
bad,"En la sucursal en la que me encontraba era de las movidas conforme a clientes, se abría a las 9:30 , buscaba clientes y por supuesto atendía a los que llegaban ya sea a preguntar o por algún tipo de problema nosotros estábamos para ayudarle en todo lo que estuviera a nuestro alcance de no ser así lo asesoramos para que recurra a la instancia donde se le resolvía el asunto que tenía. La salida era a las 7:30 pero al ser vendedor tiendes a salir después de tu hofario."
bad,"Over worked, unachievable expectations, the time given to achieve work in poor conditioned neighborhoods was not reasonable. Along with the fact the managers knew what was expected in detail at each work site would not ""met the numbers"" to preform duties and quality work."
bad,"I learned to give great customer service. Asking the right questions to my customers, so i may know what may be useful to them and offer services that will best suit them and their lifestyle. Providing a complete solution for the customers so it may be easier for them and provide piece of mind to the customer.  "
bad,"I maybe did two hours of actual work per week the entire time I was at AT&T. If you like coasting and getting promoted a little bit each year and earning a decent salary for doing next to nothing, then this is the place for you. If you actually want to learn something new and be challenged, look elsewhere."
bad,Due to consolidations and layoffs I would not recommend AT&T for a place to work.  Management at AT&T is unfair and ridiculous.  Their decisions make no sense at all.
bad,"They are such a huge company they throw money at problems instead of stepping back and taking a smarter approach to solving things. They are constantly changing which I understand is necessary for a communications company but sometimes it seems like the direction they are going is backwards instead of forward. The most important thing to them is their profit and shareholders, not the quality of life for them employees"
bad,"My time with AT&T wasn't extensive, but during that time I did find a lot of the people I worked with were great people.  However the overall culture of AT&T was somewhat bothersome.  While the benefits you receive are nice and better than I've had with other companies the lack of job security there was more stressful than anything I've experienced.  While I was there for just over a year there were 5 different rounds of cuts that were made that I could have potentially been a casualty of and the last one I did get caught in.  That feeling of having your job almost constantly on the line was one of the reasons I had started looking for a new job even before I was eventually cut."
bad,"Great work atmosphere as long as you have a great manager and assistant manager,  You must have great customer service skills and lots of patience in order to deal with different characters daily.  You must be ready to work nights and weekends but you can work your way up by seniority.  If you are single this would be a great place to work.  One thing you must remember, this is retail and the best time to make money will be nights and weekends."
bad,Nothing to say there is no job security you can not trust management to make there own descions. They tend to call hr all the time. The positive it is a union environment try's to keep a happy balance
bad,The quality of the company providing good customer service has dropped in south Texas. I got surplussed what has put me a though situation.  If the infrastructure was up to date then this would be a ideal company
bad,Starting in this position under directv was a blessing ending under at&t was stressful. every day was like waiting on a chopping block. Management was rarely on the same page.
bad,"day at work was lonely and not fun. Ididnt learn much, management was not around, workplace culture was boaring, staying motivated ordering merch for the customer"
bad,"24/7 role with too many conference calls, escalations at all hours of the night as well as weekends, with limited ability to positively effect outcome of those escalations.  Note a role I would refer anybody to."
bad,"No advancement or collaboration, and really poor management in the department I was in. Management is all over the country lacking vision and open to new ideas since you never get the sense that you actually know your superiors."
bad,"Expect to work erratic schedules that will vary from week to week. Can start as early as 8AM or end as late as 10PM. Have your vacations planned out months in advance because the schedule is set for the month and there is no altering it. The pay (when I worked there) is decent for the work. They do have a habit of changing commission structures annually, however and it's pitched as ""not a cut, you just have to sell more to make the same"". Time in/out for shifts and breaks are closely monitored and very stringent. They ARE unionized so it's almost impossible to get fired from there but punctuality is one of the things they can get you for which is why it's so closely monitored."
bad,"When I first started with company everything was awesome, Pay was nice and plenty of overtime. Recently the company has been doing a lot of lay offs in different departments. The company laid off thousands of employees. Management is cut throat they do not care about the tech whatsoever. All they care about is themselves, the local union is a complete joke."
bad,"Overly competitive and compensation continues to decline. There is little to no money invested in development, just the standard cookie cutter sales training."
bad,"AT&T is really SBC. AT&T was bought for the name only. AT&T was about to go into bankruptcy when SBC bought them out. Part of the package was to keep many of the same management members that led AT&T into bankruptcy. This led to very poor management practices. Atmosphere became toxic, leading to the loss of many experienced technicians."
bad,Extremely long hours with little room for advancement. Management micromanges. Very little time for family life. Company pays good but not where it should be for amount of work performed.
bad,For as much as the assistant manager has to do it's not worth it. You have to know everything the manager has to do but they don't give passwords or the tools you need to be successful. Personally my managers were not manager material and the people I worked with took my sales a lot. Having to make 50 cold calls over the phone a day was stressful and very disheartening. Just not what I would like to do and was not paid enough.
bad,your under payed and not job security. how would you feel if your manager walked around you with a clipboard too high pressure. don't recommend. lack of skill of upper management.
bad,I would only recommend working for directv/att call center if you  can work through negativity and love money then it will make the job much easier. You have to be able to keep a clear mind and have plenty of patients. Come to work to do your job and keep your personal life at home. I love the job but only for the money and the perks you get with working for them. It's not a career but it will get the job done
bad,"If you like sales, and customer service is important to you, stay away from AT&T. Management will consistently and annoyingly push you to be deceptive in your sales tactics. They will also find any way to give you a negative mark for your sales. They breathe down your neck, and will sit in on almost every interaction you have with a customer. All that matters to management is that their numbers look good at any cost, whether it be deceptive sales tachniques or just plain throwing you under the bus. A good thing to remember is that management is corporate and the sales staff are union. You are replaceable and unimportant to them, so long as they have good numbers to report to their superiors. Commission is a great incentive, and there’s plenty of money to be made, so long as you behave like a good little automaton and give management their “expected behaviors”. Benefits are awesome. But at what cost to your integrity as a sales person and as a human being?"
bad,"Stressful work environment, difficult to deal with and copious amounts of micro management. Job security is also non existent they're closing stores to open authorized retailers, so they don't have to pay benefits."
bad,"The work/life balance, needs to be improved.  Expected to work magic with the lack of tools and equipment that is needed to do the job efficiently and correctly."
bad,"Good job, no family time. The pay was great, however, there was absolutely no time for your family due to the hours you'd work. The management at my particular location was sub par."
bad,Everything is micromanaged you get blamed for quality results on install or repairs that your not at fault. Spend most of your time there trying not to get wrote up for something minor.
bad,Very difficult to work. Culture changed greatly from when I was employee to being contractor. Little support. Just get it done.
bad,when hired on at&t I was excited I knew this was a good company to work for.  I was excited and during the interview I was told about all the room for advancements boy was I wrong I liked the work I did it was long hours but I didn't mind cause I knew my hard work would pay off when they bought direct tv and went with a all in one tech basically more bang for their buck too much work for just one person and taking away jobs from one title not hiring anymore of them and pushing us everyday to take on more jobs of other field techs jobs phasing them out and I just lost interest in the job where the company was going for the tech which left not much other than management just not for me I wanted to move up to different technical fields within the company with more pay of course but they made it impossible but the managers the offices are great and where techs so can relate but att as a whole it not a good company to work for
bad,the environment did not need to be as stressful.  management by intimidation is not successful.  no surprise the center closed.  it is a shame that so many had to take anti-anxiety meds to deal with life there
bad,"After 20+ years of loyal, dedicated, employment I was forced out.  My skills were #workforce 2020, I had many years of ""exceeds"" performance, but the incompetent HR system combined with the lies and hypocrisy experienced was disgraceful.  Leadership talks out both sides of their mouths - ""employees are our most valued resource"" while callously discarding outstanding employees with bogus excuses.  There are exceptionally talented and caring people still with the company, but their hands are tied by the misdirected mandates pushed down from upper leadership.  Leadership does not walk its own talk.  At the same time they are letting go thousands under the guise of ""surplus"", many of who were #workforce2020, the company is putting out recruiting campaigns.  How much more productive it would have been to have evaluated the surplus employees who were fighting to stay and applied resources to retain them.  Instead the company spends more effort on processes to eliminate these employees and get them off the payroll.  The corporation's  priorities are twisted and backwards, and the company values are not what they once were."
bad,"Poor leadership, lack of direction, no care for people"
bad,"Att has changed in culture since merging with directv. It has a pay structure that changes at least three times in a single year. They have begun creating goals that have proven to be attainable, which affects your pay and ultimately your job. The attendance policy is one of the strictest you may encounter. The sales consultant job has a high level of stress."
bad,"As long as you perform, you will be okay but ""life happens"" doesn't matter to them. It doesn't matter if your spouse is dying, you better be at work. A simple 2 day family emergency ended my employment and there were no prior warnings or statements made."
bad,great place to work just no benefits or time off for sick days you never see your supervisor or and team member  everything done on your owe you can never talk to anyone
bad,"In my personal:"
bad,"Learned a lot about the entertainment business."
bad,"There is never a set schedule, they tell you there is but they expect more from you even when they ask they still hold you to their standards of forceful ways.  "
bad,"i have nothing to say good or bad about the company. When it was Direct it was a excellent company to work for, but now I don't feel valued as a employee. I have been capped out at a rate of pay that is not enough to make ends meet. We are tangled up in a"
bad,"Great job wrong call center. Everything ATT stands for is great but the management has to follow through with those commitments as well. The training did not fit with what we would be doing on the floor, was not paid what was initially offered, managers had little to no knowledge of anything other than metrics.."
bad,"There may be parts of AT&T where people can grow and make progress. This call center is not one of them. Best advice - if they still have tuition reimbursement, use it and get out of there into another area as soon as possible. So disgusted by this experience that I don't even feel like explaining it.  No matter how positive, cheerful, or determined you may be, the management in this place will eventually make you hate the day you walked through the door. "
bad,"Fairly good place to work, however you must have the emotional mind set in order to work it successfully. Complaints are the primary form of customer contact, resolving technical issues is secondary."
bad,"I started as SWBT, changed to SBC, then to AT&T. When began 1998, company was social, trusting, encouraging, supportive, and educational. AT&T is poor in training and support. Low moral. Encourages customer care but does not provide an atmosphere for it. Appears to be focused on job elimination, lower pay, and less benefits."
bad,I learned how to deal with angry customers and work on a computer. I also learned how to multi task by answering the phone and notating the accounts at the same time while working in multiple open windows.
bad,"You are expected to work with out proper resources, or lack there of.  You are constantly doing busy work because the resources are very limited.  Often times you are given directions that are not put in place to work correctly by senior management. Senior management seems to not have a full understanding of what is needed to move there agenda along. They choose not to try understanding or listening to front liner's. You are constantly in a battle of doing great work with little directions or resources."
bad,Changing environment and culture no one is happy there anymore. Do not care to elaborate further as it would not be appropriate. It is definitely a high stress environment but their benefits are second to none.
bad,This job requires a lot of focus on sales and nothing else.  They do not appreciate a work life balance.  They expect long hours and cut throat sales processes.  The pay and benefits is Awesome!  but is money worth more than your family?  It is not to me.  They look at you as a number not a person.
bad,Very competitive and extremely stressful jobs.not forgiving for any downfalls. Pay and benefits are great but not worth the hassles and missing out on children.
bad,"Did not actually work for AT&T, we were a contractor but AT&T branded vans, uniforms, rules and guyed lines. If an AT&T management camt to our office we were told not to talk to them, even if we knew them."
bad,Employees are treated poorly once out of training.  AT&T's policies and procedures are not customer friendly and change with the wind.  unrealistic expectations leave employee moral at constant lows.  Stats are adjusted to prevent exceptional bonus payouts.
bad,"I work with a some of the nicest people but they don't come to work very often which means I have to pick up there slack on a daily basis. I am apart of a small team of 12 individuals and if someone stays home, it affects the people that came to work."
bad,AT&T is a great Corporation to work for in regards to pay and benefits. Yet working on a very stressful work environment. Under pressure by management.
bad,"This was not an employee orinated working place not respect of employees personal issues, very poor performance rating, the managers knowledge and availability to handle escalated calls was nonexistence in most of the managers. The required working hours was very hard and the performance expectation."
bad,This company switched to ATT and it caused many changes and issues in the company initially. Long retail hours and very little assistance from the head office.
bad,The actual work was enjoyable mostly. The environment of the workplace was challenging. Derogatory treatment of employees and lack of support was a problem.
bad,"You are on the phone all day long.  Most of the people who call are calling because they have an issue with their phones.  Customers can be very cranky.  Management is hard on employees--you have to meet your quota for them to meet theirs, so they ride you pretty hard.  You have to sign in early and may have to stay late if you are on a long call.  Pay is decent, but turnover is high due to high demands of management.  A woman died in the restroom because she needed medical help and management and security would not call for help--told her to get back to work."
bad,money to be made if you like working.way too much micromanagement. days are long and inconsistent. way too many managers . you might have 6-7 jobs per day.
bad,Just started working here it is an ok job looking for something new don't like getting paid off commission even though you get to meet new people everyday
bad,"Bad management thats trained to fire you if you don't meet metrics, good pay but not getting a lot of hours my last days there due to directtv merge and also get slammed with lot of fiber installations"
bad,"Pay for job was on the under side of the scale. 2 months straight of training led to complications. "
bad,"Not the worst company to work for if you like old world communications products with new world competition."
bad,"high turn over rate with little post introductory training. lack of work life balance with mandatory overtime minimum of 14 hours per week. ignores contracts, doesnt take customers needs seriously"
bad,Walking into work and having to meet high sales goals. Being compared day in and day out to others. Meeting some goals is not enough always being disciplined. Unrealistic amount of sick days per year. No benefits or help for those who've been there under a year. It's not longer a cell phone company rather an entertainment company with DTV.
bad,"They say that they want you to provide the best customer service possible.  However, if that ""customer service"" doesn't involve selling and/or up-selling the customer, you will get in trouble.  Sometimes the customer just needs help with their current products...but AT&T doesn't understand that."
bad,"The pay is good and competitive with great benefits, but the work life balance is truly lacking and it is a very stressful job, job security is extremely low. Turn over rates are high."
bad,This job was def. not for me.  Commission style so if you're a monster shark you'll do awesome. I hated it.  The commission tiers is what is sucks about it.  You can sell phones and tablets all day long and still not make money.  Direct tv & home security is where you really make money but not many people go to ATT to protect their house.
bad,"team assessments couching and developing every day, management was not very influential or positive. upper levels of management never really involved in the work force environment."
bad,I worked for spring mobile and it was a learning journey. They believed in promoting with-in the company. the pay was not the best and the paid 8.25 and hour.
bad,"Was let go with severance after 12 years of service. I understand big business but I survived 4 re-orgs in 6 years that always happened at Xmas time. In the sales organization you never have job security or work life balance they speak of constantly. Made less commission the last 3 years despite workload tripling. Direct manager was very good, however those directly above at Director and VPGM level are completely out of touch with what goes on in the field and only manage off reporting. Loved working there for 10 years but the last two were a totally different culture with no job security and management who you couldn't trust in our market. Severance package was fair for my tenure, and pay was good even though more difficult every year."
bad,"Learned good customer service skills."
bad,"Worked at DirecTV before it was bought out by AT&T.  At that time morale was low, management was poor, the hardest part of the job was the attitude of management.  One day you would be given one instruction and the next day another instruction on how to handle a complaint."
bad,"Enjoyed talking with customers. Supervisor should not be a supervisor. Don't take care of their employees, not enough pay for what those techs do out there."
bad,"If being treated like a number is what you like then ATT is your place to work.   Co-workers were ok, but there were personality conflicts. Some co-workers will leave intentional landmines if you get on their bad side."
bad,This is a FUN work place to be in and it can become very exciting at times. as long as the head team managers pay more attention to the team members and assist when they need to needed to retrain in areas that may need improving specially if you are making your sales but your numbers are not as high in other areas. now on the bad side it is real easy to loose your job and do NOT know a real reason why and they could suspend you on any note and never call you back and you are wondering what happened.
bad,"I held out as long as I could, but the sales pressure and the way management speaks to direct reports is disrespectful and intense. Constant beatdown conference calls. However, the sales compensation pay is great."
bad,"it was very fast paced. with lots of demands and little reward. I liked getting to know all the new equipment and helping customers. I liked how they promote from in. i learned the most from this job, how to satisfy customers and match the right person to the right product. Hardest part is overcoming no's."
bad,Not really the best place to have a stable flow of income.. The atmosphere was great an the people were very energetic but overall it did not benefit in terms of long term growth
bad,"The job was actually fun and rewarding most days. Expectations were often unrealistic in that as an installer for equipment, the technician must also be required to sell a product for example. Management often overlooked value of an individual over their spreadsheet performance. I felt like an 'us against them' mentality as far as employee to management. Many incentives were removed when AT&T acquired DirecTV. I felt smothered and unable to be myself while doing my job, which wasn't the culture when I was hired on at DirecTV (the independent company)."
bad,"I love my job because I interact with different people. However, in the company there is a lot of politcs. I work in an authorized retailer and I feel like I'm being abused. I was managing a store as if I was an assistant manager for 2 months yet I wasn't getting paid for it. Now I'm getting paid for a $1 increase. The company does way too much money to give me a poor raise. I have a bachelors and i'm considering leaving the job as soon as I find something better. Too many problems for little pay."
bad,"just a death battle of no ethical standards."
bad,no job security. all IT staff is outsourced or contracted to cheapest bidders and employees are kicked out. company has no more innovation. upper management all went to the same business school of cost cutting regardless of impact to staff.
bad,"AT&T was a very challenging job and stressful job at times. A typical day included taking multiple calls, assisting customers with their accounts. Changing rate plans, adjusting bills,ordering new devices and equipment for their home and wireless needs, and numerous other duties as assigned. Management was very unprofessional at times. My co-workers were easy to work with, for the most part it was a team environment.The hardest part of the job was saving the customer from leaving the company when they were frustrated and fed up and convinced they should leave and take their business elsewhere. The most enjoyable part of the job was when the customers were totally satisfied and I had retained their business."
bad,"Some days stretched 24 hours"
bad,"Management isn't steady. If you aren't ""buddy, buddy"" with the higher ups, kiss your job or any idea of advancement, goodbye."
bad,"Hit your goals and do exactly what management tells you to do, whether you feel it is ethical or not. I really have nothing positive to say, unfortunately, and current employees would agree."
bad,Company needs some diversity and the HR staff is part of the diversity problem..  When an issue was brought to HR they pretty much ignored the signs or problems that could occur from not having a staff of individuals that were versatile
bad,"I was a inbound call center where I was tied to a phone.  I didn't enjoy the job at all.  Very strict, not a fun place for me.  I didn't like sitting in a cubicle."
bad,job pays excellent the company does not care for their senior employees anymore 15yrs service and I cant wait to find no job even
bad,"As a loyal employee in management for Directv I can say that I loved working for Directv. I wish I would have stayed a little longer but from what I seen at the beginning when AT&T took over it was enough for me to part ways."
bad,Expectations are extremely high for little compensation. Management is very unprofessional. However scheduling is flexible.
bad,"Merging company making a lot of changes which has made it an unsecured company to work for, constant changes since the merger."
bad,"The pressure is that is placed on all levels is the sales side of the business is really unrealistic and that breads unethical behavior on the management and subordinate side of things.  The pay is awesome with awesome benefits and timely raises. OUTSTANDING! however the burn-out rate from the unrealistic goals destroys even the top seller's eventually.  For example, the Kennesaw Sales Centers in GA were both high performing locations and used to pilot Uverse.  Those centers went from 1 to none.  They totally closed those centers and rightfully so."
bad,ATT Does not care about you. Its all about the profits. They will work you until they meet the expectations of that day. Over the years the Benefits decreased while the costs of them went up. I would not recommend working at ATT if you have a family.
bad,"extensive experience copper & fiber networks"
bad,"Laid off the entire work from home staff so they could outsource to India. Working split shifts from home was nice, but the customers were awful and they gave little to no room to allow them goodwill credits"
bad,"Great Pay...No room for growth, no advancement. Met some awesome people. "
bad,It was a great salary but you earn every single dime.  There is a lack of balance (work/personal life).  There is disparity of treatment.
bad,"Typical day was dealing with angry customers, I learned how to make angry customers happy and the management was always there to help when needed. Co-workers helped one another and the hardest part of the job was having to deal with the angry customers who insisted on talking to supervisors without even saying a word."
bad,Hectic for the most part and scrambling to find missing information to do your job. Tools are supplied but not always accurate.
bad,This is a good entry level job but is not a long term career.  I wish I would of attempted to move out more quickly but I got comfortable and it ultimately cost me.
bad,"Very challenging dealing with customers that were irate. People love TV more than I thought. Trying to relay messages through management can get challenging. Dealing with traffic was hard, especially when your route is in five different cities. I became friends with a lot of customers because I delivered and or fixed all the issues during a service call"
bad,"would you like fries with that?  if it wasn't for the union, this job would be fast food pay and expectations of leaving.  Promotions are not had without becoming a sales manager."
bad,"Procesos apenas creandose."
bad,"friendly people"
bad,"A great company if you don't have a family. I've been with the company for over 7 years and in having that much experience you would think i could at least get the days i want off. When i first started working for the company it was okay because I did not care about a work life balance but as the time went on i eventually had a wife then a family. THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT YOU. You have to give at least a month notice on plans you have because they have to put in the schedule, but if they want to change you schedule they have to give you at least 24 hour notice. Im sorry for the rant."
bad,Hardest part of the job is the micro managing that is done constantly.  You are definitely just a number to this company. The companies outlook is we pay you enough money to treat you like a child.
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is working alongside my colleagues. Other than that you have poor management with lack of knowledge who is so caught up in the politics that forget about their employees and productivity.
bad,"Managed averaging 261 projects on monthly basis for AT&T for the construction and engineering department. "
bad,Typical day is being  there for the customers to assist with their services and guiding and troubleshooting issues. How to troubleshoot equipment and start and stop services. Management tries to give feedback for better opportunities. Co-workers work hard. Hardest part of the job is the hours. Most enjoyable part of the day is end shift.
bad,This was a consumer sales position with a small affiliate that covered 5 states in the Midwest.  It lacked many of the resources of the parent company and experienced a high turnover rate.  The work week ran 5 to 7 consecutive days and rarely allowed for a free weekend.
bad,"long days, low pay, no room for improvement. customers have high demands and employees have no empowerment to meet their needs or expectations."
bad,Management care's only to meet schedule at any expense. Nothing exciting to work here. There is not much scope for career advancement unless you probably are one of the 'favorites' and could do better than the actual work.
bad,"The company does not provide much of an opportunity for work/life balance.  With the constant right sizing in this company, there is no sense of any kind of job security.  Many very talented people are let go each and every week of the year.  This makes for an unsettling work environment."
bad,"I applied for this job Aug.13th and got an email Aug.14 about scheduling AT&T's Testing Session for Aug.17th at 10:00AM. There were two parts of the test, each part I passed, and I know this because the instructor told me that I did. Then several hours later I got a email saying ""While your application made it through several steps of the process, another candidate has been selected for Call Center Sales Representative that had a bit more of what we were looking for"". I'm just mad they told me I passed both test and I qualify for the job just so they can email me denying me for the job position."
bad,Definitely a top down leadership model with very little responsibility given to frontline sales team. Store managers are held accountable to sales performance numbers and must work within labor union.
bad,"This place would be great if management knew what they were doing. Unfortunately for AT&T anybody that sells enough of a one product can be looked at as a shining start and promoted to manager, that's great if advancement is your thing. Unfortunately AT&T takes a cookie cutter method to training managers and it's like connecting the dots management.  They sit and watch and observe you, only to tear you down.  "
bad,"Temporary employment only this is not a job you want to look into as a long term situation. It's a mentally draining job due to the repetitive nature of the calls, but mainly due to drama filled mgmt. The Team Leaders and mgmt are awful, petty and childish.They are not supportive and too busy making the work environment intolerable than focusing on improving employee and customer relations. It's like being in high school but 20xs worse because its your livelihood on the line with moody supervisors."
bad,"This job is all about selling Uverse products, it is not for people who do not like the stress of meeting a requirement each month.  It is very stressful, you are coached daily about how to change the customer mind and how to bully the customer into signing up for the products.  "
bad,The pay is too low and the work environment is hostile.  You're treated like a robot.  There are no benefits.  Would not recommend to anyone.
bad,Management pushed for sales of credit line and provided no commission. Didn't listen to employees' needs. Never learned names of employees.
bad,"I started in the Great Plains (Omaha area) market as a Retail Sales Consultant. The team there at the store was awesome. Managers motivated on a daily basis, and made the job very enjoyable. I had to relocate due to personal reasons. The managers believed in me so much they reached out to the market I was relocating to just to get me to stay with the company. "
bad,"I fell and injured my back and was laid up for four years requiring surgery and and much recovery time."
bad,"AT&T realizes that major changes need to happen in order to transform into a ""tech"" company instead of a phone company. With that said the changes have been super slow and the employees have not be prioritized in the transition. Lots of employees are leaving with bitter attitudes towards the company."
bad,"For a single person with no family ties, its a great place to work.  If you have a family then don't be prepared to see them regularly.  If you want to plan an evening then don't.  You never know when your off work and will have to work evenings.  If you can accept that then its a good job with good benefits and pay."
bad,Great money but money does not compensate for bad management and unfair work environment. Only job I have ever had where everyday you get the impression that the company wants to get rid of you.  Management goes out of their way to make you less productive.
bad,"Finding talent people is upper most at AT&T, straight from the source.  Just like many other big corporation tries to get as much out of their employees as possible. Over the past two years they increasingly try to get as much work out of their employees as possible, while at the same time trying to pay us less and less and lower our benefits,"
bad,"A typical day at work consists of employees who go on constant bathroom breaks and customers who curse at you all day long."
bad,"My current position is very flexible, but the compensation practices are very poor.  When you are a skilled manager and are paid at or below the minimum compensation level where other managers who are hired outside of the company are paid more than you in the same or lesser position."
bad,Excellent benefits and work culture. Management is two faced and terrible. Horrible work life balance. Long hours on a headset taking calls. Punctuality and attendance are detrimental in keeping your job. Great room for advancement.
bad,"Start of day is making sure you have all the equipment necessary . Driving to jobsite do installation or repair , call in report completion of job . Repete this process 8 to 10 times ."
bad,the training received is all about ATT's5 key behaviors and 7 step selling process. when you get on the sales floor there are 2 or 3 assistant managers there who will pop into your sale. the top manager is in the back. when you get done with a sale the asm's will pick apart your sale and write coaching plans to help you improve your sales. they will want you to commit to numbers and the discipline you if you if you don't hit them
bad,"On the sales floor, our job description was to sell any and all AT&T services (cell and cable alike) while assisting customers to use their new devices. "
bad,"I feel that sales is not for me and obviously that is all AT&T does. The compensation was fair, but the work hours and availability requirements were unrealistic for me as a mother. It is a retail job, yet the management was literally non existent during my staffing there, leaving a chaotic and hostile work environment, I also felt i was expected to compromise my integrity in order for selfish gain of the company."
bad,The work was simple and quick to pick up. The compensation felt good enough. They do not treat their employees well though. There is little room for advancement and most management are rude and disrespectful.
bad,"The job is cool, and the commission and pay are alright but there is no job security and you could be fired for any reason at any time. I showed up on time every day, worked hard, and was doing well for this company and I was ultimately let go for reasons still unknown to me. That being said; if you don't mind working sporadic hours and enjoy working with technology I would recommend this job, just be careful who your managers are."
bad,"Directv is a good company to work for only a short period of a time. The longer one stays though, the less job satisfaction. They don't seem to invest a great deal in keeping long time employees as much as they should."
bad,"The companies goal is to turn over as many employees as possible, if the management attempted to train to save the job would be a bad job to retire from."
bad,It felt like they paid you so much that they can treat you however they wanted. They use fear of loosing your job to motivate you into selling.
bad,"ok job but pay structure was way off from what i needed"
bad,Most of your days and nights will be spent here with no time off. No time for family and personal life. You also have no control over vacation paid and requested time off.
bad,"As a sales customer service rep your held to a high standard on your call flow. With trying to retain the customer from disconnecting their service, you also had to try and up-sale with the same time your also have an average handle time. This company has great benefits, the pay is great but their management team is horrible. Your pretty much a robot day in day out! They will also find a way to fire you even when your absences are protected through FMLA. Their very shady when it comes to their employees. Your pretty much a number to them. They don't care if your sick, or a family member is sick. All they care about is a number. Very stressful job and very low morale in the office."
bad,As a direct tv contractor you have your freedom and are able to work with no supervisor.
bad,Me considero una persona responsable y honesta  con las capacidades para manejar dentro de la ciudad.
bad,I have been employed at AT&T for almost 12 years.  If you want a career here you had better hire on through one of the many Leadership development programs or you're likely not rise quickly or high through the ranks.
bad,"The Call center was not a relaxing environment . While on the call with a customer two employees were arguing right next to me . Its highly stated that you are to wear office attire "
bad,"not as good as it sounds"
bad,"I am not pleased with this company as a whole due to the constant changes that are taking place. I have really not learned anything, because training is constantly removed from schedules due to the lack of personnel taking calls. There are managers that are great at what they do, but some of the managers there, At&t could do without. I don't have any problems with the co-workers, I enjoy talking to them and we help one another. The hardest part of this job is having to constantly work under command and control circumstances. We do not have the ability to pick the shift we can work, the closer's have to stay over the end of the shift to clear the queue and not really any group events to enjoy or learn more. I am not happy at this company, people are constantly leaving and turn over rate is very high."
bad,inbound customer service and sales.  Stressful environment given a lot of irate customers.  Strict sales quotas.
bad,The company is failing its commitment to brand and to people that put their effort in making this company successful.
bad,"Working on this project for AT&T and State Farm has been very educational. This has been a new and different work environment than what I have been used to in the past. I enjoy the people I work with and have met while working here. The office is laid back and flexible, which I definitely enjoy. The hardest part of this job was learning the technical terms and items used by the AT&T Technicians. But, due to the fact that I worked with the technicians daily, I was able to learn the terms fairly quickly. There is not any room for advancement or growth within this department. After this specific project is completed, the entire department may be executed."
bad,"The training process is no longer through any group, but now haphazardly from coworkers.  Any education advancement is now solely up to the individual for payment and area."
bad,"I did my job very well and i cared about it and my customers. My typical day at work is start to finish and that could be 8-10-12 hours. There could be a lot of driving involved in most days also.  I learned how to deal with a lot of difficult situations. All different kind of customers, houses, yards, crawl spaces, attics, and animals.  My management has improved over the years but still have a lot to improve on.  The hardest part of my day is having a big install or service call with a lot of digging, running cable, going in and out of crawl spaces or attics while checking emails talking with the customers and dealing with the heat, cold weather or rain.  The most enjoyable part of my job was having the customer smile and really and truly thank me for going above and beyond my duties to fix or install their services."
bad,"Typical day in att Management would consist of what we call prioritizing the fires. What is the most important  situation to attend too. Management would be considered a reactive body to respond never to plan or stay ahead of the game. Politics is heavy in att Management, what is communicated is always in the spirit of logic but never intended to be implemented into action. The work environment among peers and counterparts is do what ever it takes to survive department cuts or transfers while working anywhere from 50 to 60 hours per week no overtime."
bad,Working at Medco I learned how to file insurance for patients.
bad,It was a great gym with good employees. Overall I would say that was a good jobs. The pros and cons were balanced. It was a fun working environment.
bad,A typical day included answering customer questions about billing and selling telecommunication products to customers.
bad,"This company compensated their employees very well but was a very gruelling environment with very strict guidelines that were monitered within an inch of your life.  With that being said I have mixed emotions about how employee's were treated.  I enjoyed the sales and sales training very much and the environment was uplifting in certain ways but not nearly enough to maintain sanity.  My co-workers were lovely and our coaches were awesome and motivating, it was truely the daily gring that could not be denied that came from corporate that killed the elegance of working there.  The easiest part was keeping a positive attitude regardless of the environment, the key to embracing even the most difficult circumstances is indeed the mindset of the person."
bad,"I had a great experience in high school, but working for AT&T was like being bullied in high school. The management would pick their favorites and let have privileges and get away with anything, but would punish and micromanage others."
bad,"Management is constantly changing, as well as, pay structure, usually not for the good of the employee, reaching and exceeding goals not acknowledged but points out more ways to make the company more money without increasing employee compensation. Higher leadership always threatening jobs even when company goals are being met."
bad,"Good enough is not enough at AT&T....all that I can say is that it can be very stressful, even if you are trying to do your best, you will still get written up. The schedule changes on a weekly basis, it's hard to make plans, appointments, etc."
bad,"I worked for them when after I had back surgery and couldn't walk very well, it was about the only place hiring at the time and took it as a (until I can walk again job)."
bad,"AT&T has a horrible attitude towards employees who work in the retail environment, even though those employees bring in the most amount of money. Even with a bachelors degree in business and working on your masters degree, they don't even batt their eyelashes at you for consideration in the corporate side unless you've been a store manager, which you really can't become unless you're one of the top sales reps and become an assistant manager first of course. They're extremely political, its not about your qualifications, its about how ""in"" you are with district managers. They'll yell at you, swear at you, tell you you're worthless, etc. if you don't surpass your goals by at least 400%. If you aren't tracing to be well beyond your goals within the first couple of days in the month they create a mandatory training with short notice on a saturday morning. Don't even think about going to the union about it, because although there's a ""no retaliation"" rule, they'll just find ways to fire you. Don't think about suggesting new ideas or having freedom of doing things your own way, if you don't follow things exactly how they want them, they'll attack you with insults and make you feel worthless. Communication from management to employees in non existent, levels of management are certainly not transparent and well enforced. Union does nothing to help."
bad,"AT&T is a fortune 500 company with wonderful benefits."
bad,"The only thing I'd have to say about working at AT&T is that they do have good benifits. Other than that, the management levels or not great, and scheduling conflicts with everyday life. Not very understanding when it comes to emergency's, such as sickness, or injury's."
bad,Horrible place to work if you have a family! They do not care if you are sick or if your toddler is sick you are required to be there!!! They seriously hire two people to DRILL their attendance policy in your head weekly!?!
bad,"Good hours"
bad,I was a regular employee who went to work and did his job. For that I came in on time and stayed late and I got fired for nothing.
bad,"Long hours, no Work / Life balance.  You'll give up your personal time for a decent salary; the more overtime one works the less one takes home. Managers are horrible with no professional background, they are hired from within the rank-and-file; they seem to forget where they came from, horrible experience."
bad,"Great pay and made some great friends, unfortunately due to lay offs the entire site is closed now."
bad,"constantly adding things for you to do before closing out a job, but they don't increase the time you have to get it all done. Everything is your fault just about."
bad,"A typical day at AT&T was attending the customer with their needs, answering any questions they might have and just overall great customer service. I worked here while i attended college to become a Medical Assistant and the manager was very flexible with my schedule. My co workers and i always worked as a team and made work enjoyable."
bad,"Its a good starting job, if you can move up in the company that great!"
bad,"AT&T Mobility is a restrictive work environment, with rules that change often, and little leeway for absences, even for legitimate illness."
bad,"The phone company used to be a fun place to work, management was at ease. You could laugh and have fun.  Lunches, parties etc. A typical day at work was logging on and taking calls all day.  We did get 2 breaks and a lunch period.  Hardest part of job was the training lots of it.  Initial training was 12 weeks.  The fun part was meeting new people as they came and went-transferring to different departments then retiring."
bad,"very stressfull 40 hours a week, management wanted everything to be a certain way"
bad,"You'll work 50+ hours a week, which is a lot of overtime.  If you're single, this is a great job.  But if you have a family get ready to not see them much.  Typically you'll start picking up customers immediately.  Though a lot of other things will be required of you,other than selling, you will not have the time to do any of them, such as training, product research, etc.  While management talks a big game about the culture of the company and integrity, as long as you're selling, they look the other way."
bad,"Talking to different people was a learning experience, every day was unique, after assisting a customer my day was done if he/she left the line with a smile. The hardest part of the job was dealing with micromanagement."
bad,"Not a recommended place to work if you plan to do other things. The management are treated poorly and like everything else it is a domino effect trickling down to the employee. I worked in the residential dept. Handling everything from home phone to internet. The environment is fast paced and lacks training. The competition is fierce to work there because the pay is very good, there is much disregard for quality and respect to humanity. I started in a training class of 31 at the end of the training only 14 remained out of these 14 only 9 survived the nesting period. The training scarred me and the rest that made it to actually work for life.  Aside from the training and the management, the work environment is normal for a call center."
bad,Working for At&t was a good learning experience but was a stressful environment. I  didn't feel they valued or was concerned with  their employee family life.
bad,a typical work day is 12 hours and a long wait for schedule change
bad,"Productive and fun loving experience, good co-workers, time flexibility"
bad,I did not enjoy working split shifts and having to always worry about stats.  I felt they push customer service but not the way I would call customer service.  I like talking to customers and listening to their situations.  I found it hard to push something to someone when you really knew they are only going to call back to change it in the future.
bad,My position within this company was a retail sales manager.  This company was extremely autocratic and manages by the book and to the numbers. There is little flexibility to develop your own personal style and compliance to their own is mandatory.  Praise is in short supply as well. 
bad,"I loved my job however the management team is horrible and unethical. I learned many new skills in a technical environment with awesome hands on training. My co-workers were helpful and aided each other and myself without prejudice. The hardest part of the job is working in extreme weather conditions; extreme heat/cold, snow,  rain and/or high winds. The most enjoyable part of the job is the challenge of repairing services; I loved to troubleshoot and isolate problems within our technical system and fix them. I also liked the fact that everyday was something new and a different set of situations and people everyday."
bad,"Working for AT&T is ok, like the kind of work but their management sucks. Managers are scared of their next line up managers. Had to give a star sad because they don't deserve one."
bad,"At&t is all about the numbers with the best customer service, only problem is they have unrealistic goals. Management tries to push the employees but the traffic is not there. Competition is very rich with other low cost companies so quotas should be low but they are higher. They want employees to hustle customers but a lot of times it back fires when the customer comes back upset."
bad,"Good company to work for. Worked through Sutherland Global,"
bad,Did not like commissioned based selling did not like having to push things on people. Did not like management style of fear mongering from the top down.
bad,"I worked here for over 8 years and you are stressed by Managers to be perfect in every action in the call center ,stressed by customer as they scream at you and call you trash and berate you. Yes CS work is stressful but AT&T is beyond all that is common sense .I was with the company when it was Cingular, TOTALLY different company. They cared about there employees and customers ,AT&T cares about only numbers and $$$$$$$$$$$. If you like being moved from inbound to outbound and back again and then both also moving from team to team all the time and being berated by managers ...this is your place. Pay is some of the best in the area to be true,benefits were better as Cingular but ok. I left after 8 years of HELL.I last made over 16.00 per hour.Sometimes money is not worth it when it destroys you health due to extreme stress and destroys your soul.If you are not in a mangers good graces they can rid of you in one form or another. Ambulance's were constantly at this place,it was the running inside joke,""wonder who will drop over now"" Aviod this place."
bad,Do one thing wrong and you too will be thrown under the bus....
bad,Customer facing one-on-one sales of cell phones and tablets
bad,Great place to work if you are in school or don't have any college experience. The pay is good but the management is no help. You won't succeed unless you are popular.
bad,"typically handled inbound calls from the hearing and speech impaired callers. i learned american sign language and the alphabelt. management didnt really do much to help us advance in our skills, everything you learned you learned on your own or from other co workers that had already experienced it"
bad,"I worked with AT&T for a total of 7 months, Where I ended up being terminated because management would not take responsibility for their actions."
bad,Disperatity of treatment
bad,Culturally the place I worked at for DirecTV was dead. Gulag comes to mind.
bad,"Typical day of work is going to desk, put a headset on and take incoming calls using a call flow chart to the tee. When observed, if anything was missed, we were put on work performance plans leading up to termination. To call the Pasadena call centers micro-managed, would be an understatement. We were not only listened to by managers, there was also another team of people listening for further quality assurance. The training was top rate. The management was untrusting and hostile. My co-workers were wonderful. We all empathized with each other and what we had to deal with on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job is working under the difficult expecations and the constant scrutiny and threats of losing our jobs. The most enjoyable part was the compensation and co-workers."
bad,Configure Linux wifi boxes
bad,"This company was a Diverse environment, with a comfortable work ednvironment. Friendly and always willing to lend a hand."
bad,is okay if you can travel to different states.
bad,"The crew was GREAT. Sales reps believed in Great customer service. The best part was coaching and developing my reps and watching them move up in the company. The sad thing about Att was the politics that went on. The only way you moved up was who you knew or who you went out drinking with. Its also sad when upper management knows who these certain managers are what’s going on and nothing being done to correct the issue. These managers can get away with anything ex: drinking on the job, stealing, leaving work when ever, Area Managers knowing and not doing anything about it because there friends and the best part Area Managers calling sales reps to pick them up from a bar because they couldn’t drive home. Att will look for anything to get rid of employees that been loyal and been with the company for many years."
bad,"Would rather not think about working here. It is an OK place to work. High Stress, Manager is hot headed"
bad,"My Typical day started a t 7:45 AM and would not end until after 7PM. This was everyday. The rules changed everyday. I don't have a problem with that. But I do have a problem when the rules change to try to trick people up to make mistakes. I was 1 of the 5 top sellers in the building of over 120 people so I wasn't picked with or bothered. But to see what management was doing to my co workers turned my stomach. And the union didn't do anything to help these people. By the end people with 20 and 30 years of service under their belts where coming in and quitting. The work environment had gotten just that bad. I had to spend extra time on the line with my customers explaining what all the background noise was. It was managers screaming, laughing, running around the office barefoot and yes, even using profanity. Let's just say that I was grateful when my husbands job relocated him and I had to move out of state. I will miss the compensation tho. Looking at the salaries that are being offered. I am going to have to take a massive pay cut. But for the peace of mind I will get, It is worth it."
bad,"It wasn't the fact of being in a call center I minded. It was the core guidelines and policies that really bothered me. Besides half the call center getting the other half sick all the time (and it making it back around again) because everyone was afraid to call in, the policies they had towards their customers was just disgusting. All you really could do was say ""I'm sorry about that"" or some variation and had few tools to actually address the issue yourself. Although the top levels of the company were completely out of touch, the actual site management and lower management were pretty cool, especially most of the team leads."
bad,I would say try to gain as much knowledge as possible and leave no later than 2 years of tenure. Compensation in job promotions never negotiable and always give the minimum.
bad,"Upper management thought all problems could be solved by managers working insane hours and taking on roles that were indistinguishable from our sales reps. They all appeared to come off of the same assembly line that deterred intelligent problem solving. Fellow store managers were all hard workers but for seemingly no reward - culture was such that motivation was rooted more in trying to stay off of the radar than trying to actually excel. Despite claims, upper management did not care what potentially shady measures had to be taken to achieve sales numbers."
bad,Great place to work. Also with great co workers. U have room for advancement if u work at it
bad,Not a good place to start a career. Full of couch potatoes waiting for retirement. The company pay lip service to diversity while managers practice red neckism and supremacism
bad,"Answer customer/client requests or inquiries concerning services, products, billing, equipment, claims, and reports problem areas."
bad,Working at att was stated that their was remove for advancement. Which there was not!
bad,This company is definitely not for people who are looking for a career. Job security is very low.
bad,"I really love the people I work with. The pay & benefits are great, but not a job for those with children due to non flexible hours."
bad,"I loved all the people that were above me, great people to work with, always willing to help, but the stress of call centers isn't for everyone. Especially when its day in and day out. It is hard to move up unless you have been there for 3 plus years, which is hard when you are still trying to do school and work at the same time."
bad,There was no coaching in the retail side of AT&T. I worked for the company for 10 years and was coached in other aspects of the job but once I went to the retail store the coaching stopped.
bad,My time at At&t was filled with days of repetitive work that was made more difficult by corporate policies that changed daily. The same rules did not apply to other call centers. I saw too much coporate inconsistency and greedy policies that did not result in the customers best interest. Working there cost me a lot physicaly and I don't expect that justice will ever be done. A truly greedy and ucaring company.
bad,"My summary says it all. The company is too big for it's own good. hard to find reporting, management didn't seem to really know how to support you, and high demanding expectations that take away from family values/time. Couldn't of gotten out of there faster."
bad,This company pays well but that is all I can say for them. Performance policy forces technicians to sacrifice customer service in order to meet company standards. Days off rotate and are often canceled with as little as 24 hours notice. Six day work weeks are normal and overtime is forced. If pay and benefits are your only concern AT&T may be for you. In my opinion its not worth it.
bad,"This organization did provide flexible scheduling, however the opportunity to advance is missing."
bad,"I work as a premises tech. for AT&T. Working for this company has been a nightmare. Before I go any further I'd like to say that my supervisors have been nothing but kind and helpful so far, unfortunately we are all subject to rules that degrade the work experience."
bad,AT&T has a great image but is always changing the way they do things internally which took away from my core responsibilities.
bad,A lot of micromanagement with this company now. Workplace culture has shifted to losing good employees to outsourcing unfortunately. Attendance is so important there that i did learn to be punctual and on time for work and meetings.
bad,Enjoyed working for this company although they didnt see it the same way. Company gose though quarterly layoffs and doesn't put employees or customers in  consideration
bad,"Pay is pretty good, benefits are decent but be prepared to be treated like sheep. Management does not care about you or your life and the company expects you to live to work. I saw my family more when I was in the military."
bad,At&t has opportunity. It has its flaws its typical call center issues but nothing major. It has decent pay and incentives. I made decent money the monthly incentives came in handy for sure.
bad,"Pros:  Pay and perks good.  Unlimited OT.  Lots of bonus oportunities.  Great conrodery with peers.  "
bad,No te pagan tus comisiones en tiempo y forma y te piden que apoyes en el horario amplio lo cual no viene en tu contrato.
bad,"In an atmosphere where managers should be on your side, the management team there couldnt care less about you. They look to push you out of the door faster than it takes to hire you. It constantly feels like you are never doing well enough. You're always told what you've done wrong."
bad,"Overall the company has poor training, poor management, and unattainable goals. One of their systems is difficult to use and they send you to customer’s homes alone."
bad,Management is not bad but seem to have no sense of direction. Morale is not good because of all the layoffs and minimum lack of confidence provided by upper management.
bad,"Everything is good if you're lucky to get on a good team with a good manager. However, constant reorgs and the threat of quarterly layoffs, make for a very insecure atmosphere. Compensation is mediocre at best, and there is a push to get away from working remotely. It used to feel great working there when I started 6 years ago, but its all gone downhill since the frequent layoffs started after the DirecTV merger."
bad,Great job to learn about being a technician but the company makes the job so unenjoyable. Good to learn the crafted and take the knowledge to better yourself.
bad,Pay and health care is fare. Hours are long and you will not know when the shift will be over up to 13+ hours at times. Management is unmoving most are out to improve their own status no matter what the cause is. Upper management does not know what its like to work in the field. Metrics change on a whim and are hardly reachable.
bad,when I first started at At&t I was really excited and then you start to realize it’s not it’s cracked up to be once you really figure out everything with the company.
bad,"At AT&T, I increasingly felt that I was more a cog in the machine, rather than the valued employee they liked to say I was.  It wasn't just me; rather, this was true for most of the front-line Customer Service and Technical Support people there.  At AT&T, there is always the lingering sense that you could be fired at any time.  That does not make for a good, productive culture at work."
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"You get compensated very well at AT&T and you get the best benefits you could ask for. In return, you have to deal with nightmare scenarios, push products on people who don't want them, and live under constant stress of being asked to come in on days off, work 11 hour shifts, or do things outside your job description. I don't recommend working here."
bad,"I liked working at AT&T for the first few weeks and I what I really grew to love and appreciate were the people that worked there. BUT, I feel like the company had changed all of them in a way to where all they focused on was cut throat competition and it made them turn through a terrible transition."
bad,"AT&T is very old school in terms of micro management & lack of flexibility in scheduling or telecommutes for most employees. They often promote based on need to fill quotas rather than on merit or knowledge.  CEO makes an obscene salary & bonuses, accomplished by constant layoffs, outsourcing & shady customer treatment. You may find yourself working for a great manager or a total incompetent & that will make all the difference in your level of job stress. The money, benefits and some great people to work with are the only reason to work for this company. Once you approach age 50 they may well find a way to force you out & replace you with someone who will work for less. If you want to work here, always keep feelers out for your next job. There is no loyalty to employees so don't give any or you will be sorely disappointed."
bad,"Good people to work with, pay is decent. However, job security is terrible. You work with the sword of Damocles over your head constantly. Thousands of people have been outsourced or surplused in 2019."
bad,"Sometimes you will have to 6days a week for months,for no apparent reason.its more money.You'll be too tired to spend any of that extra money.when time to request vacation time,its base off of seniority..the people who been there the longest gets first dibs.example,if you wanted to take off a week in July,someone in higher seniority will prevent you from obtaining that week of vacay.its crazy..really you cant  schedule your vacation whenever you want to."
bad,There is no life work balance....they pay well and have great benefits....but that isn’t all life is about.  As a tech prepare to work 6 days a week 54 hours a week for 9 of the 12 months.  The policy changes faster than the technology which means you are constantly in a battle to meet metrics that’s aren’t really attainable.  The management (first line) is great because they know your struggle but you are nothing to everyone above them.
bad,"No life balance in this role, worked 7 days a week more than 60 hours a week. Workaholic at that time, then I experienced life balanced and I evaluateed that my BIG earnings were not that high according to the hours worked there."
bad,"I value my skills that I received from AT&T. Unfortunately every employee is truly just a number and is treated like it. I attempted multiple jobs within the company trying to seek the positive culture that the company portray. Unfortunately I found out that the culture is old, toxic and needs revamping from the top down."
bad,"Overall could be a good company to work for, but would definitely need an overhaul in work life balance.  Retail is hard on employees personal lives as it is, but AT&T adds stress on top of that with difficult sales quotas, unscrupulous management tactics, and a disinterest in the well being of employees in their personal lives and finances."
bad,Everything based on number not on work and cust service. Some nanger more worried about numbers and not how well you do your job and how you interact with customers
bad,"Lots of stress, IBEW labor union was a disappointment, integrity and honesty was not present,  Customers were cheated and lied to by sales persons in order to get contracts signed and did not find out that the services they thought they were getting was incorrect  and then management did nothing to resolve it.  There was no investigation and customers were stuck in 2 year contracts unless they had $480 dollars to cancel contract.  Customers were cheated 80 percent of the time."
bad,AT&T is not the phone company I hired on 20 years ago. It has changed to a management by numbers organization. Its culture has changed from caring about its people and customers to the numbers of whatever report is important. Its good if you are willing to change and move around. I was fortunate to get full retirement the  fifth  time my office was  downsized. I am grateful to had the experience more grateful to move on to a new career with the skills I learned at AT&T.
bad,"There's a lot of products and services every rep is expected to sell. So, there's a lot of sales quotas each person needs to achieve and is expected to achieve. As a Sales Lead, you're managing your own sales quotas to set an example while coaching and leading a team of retail sales consultants. There's a lot of competition in-store, and with other stores. It's a lot of hard work and the hours are long."
bad,Sales sales sales all they care about now is sales. Micromanagement is abundant. Unfair. The only time you matter is when you make a sale. It just was no longer for me.
bad,"Working virtual was the best part of working for ATT.  Working with customers was a great.  Visiting and helping with their tech needs was exceptional.  Working with management was sometimes good. "
bad,"Nobody knows what their doing, they lie to the customer, you get hired for one job and end up doing 4 others so they can keep costs down, the customer told me I should get out, she had never seen such a CF! Money is good ( for the job your hired for ) but beware , you’ll do 4 jobs and the money won’t add up."
bad,"Being a retention specialist you were required to keep customers from cancelling landline phone services and internet dsl. In cases of the death of a customer usually a family member would call to disconnect service.  AT&T policy was heartless in dealing with this scenario.  And reps are held accountable via their disconnect goals.  So on many occasions you would get a call where ""the line dropped"" or I was speaking with someone else who was supposed to disconnect my service. The requirement on the call was to try to save via a discount on the service and do add ons of services that were available. Completely inappropriate in some circumstances. AT&T doesn't care as you will be written up under a call monitoring session with your manager.  Beware as at least in my view,  this among other policies I found to be very unethical. In my exit interview I pointed this type of situation is a daily occurrence, and impacted performance and required minimal goals, to which a shoulder shrug would describe the response I received. Also the call type we were taking would change periodically from a sales and billing type of call to a green call which just meant Uverse was available and you were required to sell cable then to a retention type call for saving services all impacting your goals and pay. AT&T truly does stand for At This Time. The pay was good but I'd rather be able to sleep at night."
bad,Working for AT&t can be good and bad at the same time if you like overtime then it's great if you much rather be home at 5 this job is not for you. The jobs aren't extremely difficult however they are mentally challenging. You are almost your own Boss meaning you have some control over how to layout the job however you still have to follow the guidelines that AT&t sets as a standard operation procedure.
bad,Worked here for about a year. Although there are some good benefits it doesn’t balance the rest of the disappointments I felt towards the company. They constantly change the commission base making it harder to reach your goals. Upper management favors you on how well you sell. AT&T is constantly in controversial situations making the first line workers deal with angry customers.
bad,"So I was at AT&T for six years at the beginning was awesome commission was great I made more than the 40,000 a year base no problem through the years commission has been cut down to basically nothing so now you can only really count on 40,000 a year It’s not bad if you start working with them review been there for a while you looking for a way out because you’re used to making more money"
bad,"But bad upper management, the size of the company is so big you can tell when your looked at as an asset and when your a problem. The stress level shifts quickly."
bad,"Great if you want to get in and get some experience, but can't recommend for long term success. In 6 years we went through 4 staff reduction ""events"".  Just know that going in you will have to spend a lot of free time outside of your job at employee networking events if you want to have any job security/advancement opportunities"
bad,"I was there for 3 weeks"
bad,"They offer you decent wages and benefits then after 5 years, they surplus you and don’t even offer inside advancement or transfer. ATT only cares about their executives and not the hard workers that are the face of the company."
bad,"If you want to work for a company that treats their employees like cattle and enjoy getting laid off or moved to a position that pays drastically less than your current one, this is the company for you. The management team (coaches) would constantly micro-manage the team. Things really changed when the company went from Southwestern Bell to AT&T. They incorporated all the bad from the management team of Bell South, headquartered in Atlanta at the time. Management treated everyone like a child all because of a few bad apples in the group. Being a union employee has its benefits but it also creates a lot of lazy employees that like to sit around all day and do absolutely nothing. Those same employees got very good at going out on disability and treated FMLA like free vacation because the company would still pay you your full pay while you were out. All you needed was a shady doctor to sign off on it. Everyone seemed to know who those doctors were. It's pretty sad when the company has to send out corporate security to have employees followed because of FMLA and disability abuses. Our call center was closed because of all the folks who didn't want to come to work."
bad,"I’ve been with AT&T for 5+years, and poor management is my reason for wanting to leave. The store manager, Myrtle, is racist, deceitful, petty, and just plain evil. While AT&T has great pay and benefits, they do not care about your home life at all. This company punishes you for calling in even if you have a doctors excuse. The company as a whole is going under because they don’t care about their employees."
bad,"It’s a job, pays decent and also has good benefits. However, it’s based on tenure. When you roll out on to the floor, you get the horrible schedule. AT&T does not care about you, just money. Call center work is hard, and rough. You truly have to dehumanize yourself to get through the day. Attendance policy is ridiculous, and if you’re new, you’re screwed if you miss a day. If you’re medically ill, and do all the right paperwork they’ll deny you’ coverage and can be fired for such. For money it’s a job, but not a place where you can advance."
bad,"AT&T is a behemoth of a company.  It's also one of the most messy and unorganized corporations in existence.  There is a multitude of duplicate work going on between the different organizations inside the company causing serious.  Offshoring of essential tasks is also a severe problem.  The company is ""too big to fail"" and as entrenched they are in public spaces, there's no urgency to look at or even acknowledge problems."
bad,At&t hired a manager from outside the company whom didn't know the essential job functions. My Co-Workers and I had to manage the store while selling and closing the sales.
bad,"Schedules are not flexible, vacations are rarely available during the holidays and the job is very stressful. Good benefits ................................................................"
bad,"Just as title says ok. You learn how to sell AT&T products door to door then after your pretty good at that you learn how to sell the job off as the best in the world to other people. The job itself going door to door selling at&t was enjoyable for the most part if your ok with getting 20 or so doors slammed in your face everyday. The thing is when your in the office you are told to be ""fake"" and as happy as possible to sell the new employees and I've just never been good with taking advantage of newcomers."
bad,On a team 11 people that made it past training everyone left because the supervisor we we're changed to from the original starting one was micromanaging horribly with no room to breath. we all got feedback on this sup from others that do not wish to work on his team and we never thought it was going to be so bad we would all slowly quit one by one.
bad,Paid well but you work most weekends and nights. Sales quotas are intense and management is often pressured from above to set high expectations for sales. There were many times I felt sales came above moral decision making.
bad,"When I began with the company it was amazing. Great place to work, the company cared about employees, and quotas were fair and management supported and helped you reach them. Now years later it’s all about numbers, if the numbers are not there you are hounded to get them back up."
bad,"Working at AT&T has its ups and downs. I like that I work by myself and am at a new location on every job. The benefits, retirement and pay are very competitive for the job industry."
bad,"If they ever got rid if the union, it'd be a great place to work. The overall attitude is poor, which leads to poor customer service and satisfaction."
bad,Management is difficult they are always trying to find something wrong. No positives remarks. Coworkers are fun to work with. Lots of drive time average 200 miles a day
bad,You will make a good amount of money but you won't ever have time to enjoy it. The divide between managment and the employees is astounding and the union is useless
bad,"I recall my time there being very stressful. From morning huddles sometimes taking to long, too the various issues with installing all of the services they offered."
bad,"Pay and benefits are great, stressful work environment."
bad,Horrible stress and pressure you’re submitted to. You’re basically forced to insists on products even though customers have told you no clearly more than once already. You get rated by customer and are expected to have good reviewed by them even though you harassed them and bombarded them with product offers.
bad,"It was a pretty good place to work but things have  changed in the last few years"
bad,"This is a place to learn and develop character. If you are not in a place of proper conviction and integrity, this job can cause you stress and unnecessary problems in staying the course with the best goals for your career. In other words, you need to know what you want for your career before working here."
bad,"at&t is a super great place when it comes to benefits, and the money you're making. if you work hard, you will get compensated fairly. in-home expert for at&t is nothing but being treated horribly. You're nothing but a number to them, and I have seen them fire people for stupid reasons. Youre expected to go into peoples homes and sell them phones.. when you do that, they are so happy to get the phones that they don't hear half of the stuff you're saying so when they get the first months bill they are constantly blowing up your phone, or going into a corporate store where they email your boss and cc their boss for every complaint. getting escalations is almost at least an either every week thing, or atleast twice a month. If you don't have 1. thick skin to call those super mad people back, or 2. going into strangers homes from (the north side hood, Southside, or super rich houses) and convincing them to switch to you, then this job isn't for you. You get a company car which is nice, but they track every location you go to, and are constantly checking it. so be careful. one positive side is most of the people you work with are pretty cool, because they all feel the same way you do. If you let this job burn you out, it will. you start at 8am, and work until 5-6-7-8-9-10- depends when you're done. the latest I've seen someone work until was 8-12."
bad,"Buyer Beware!  Antiquated methods, procedures & systems.  No viable CRM to track interaction with clients.  Lack of diversity in management ranks.  They lure you over with a high base salary because you are doing 3 and 4 peoples job. The company does not market their products properly in the SMB/Enterprise space.  Guerilla marketing (door knocking) ad nauseum.  Most Managers and up have been with the company 20+ years and are clueless as to how its done at other companies.  They have nothing to compare it to.  Only 10% of reps hitting quota."
bad,"Very disappointed in the company. "
bad,The DirecTV and TimeWarner acquisitions led to the expected workforce reduction along with the less than stellar performance from merging these companies into AT&T. Morale is low and the leadership is trying to pivot parts of the company to work and deliver faster.
bad,"Great pay working for Cricket side. Managers always determine how turnover is. At&t needs to pay better attention to the real workhorses like entry level part- timers that break their backs to cover management. Plenty of useless surveys that waste time asking what you need but never deliver. Anything reported to HR about management is swept under the rug. Was harassed by a manager after multitasking to help clear customers to keep the wait down because my manager decided to remove chairs so no one could sit down. Worked my tail off but was ousted for a disability and companies don't need or want liabilities. It doesn't matter how much clout you have, once you let them know that you have a chronic illness, they boot your tail out the door by denying disability and bully you into working. If you can't work medically they deny you benefits that you pay for and say you abandoned your job. They did the same thing to my mom, but she invested 29 years vs 4. They had to pay her out and some.. She told me they would screw me over."
bad,"A few years ago, I was proud to work for AT&T.  However, with the DirectTV acquisition, and then the purchase of Time Warner media, things started to go downhill.  "
bad,"For people who need to be active, the office is not a healthy environment. Management ranges from excellent to poor. Culture is very dry and dogmatic. Hardest part is staying in a cube for hours on end."
bad,"Very little possibility of promotion from within.  Poor average pay.  Ridiculously low pay caps.  Zero bonuses.  Poor decisions made by upper management.  Oppressive work environment.  No action taken against management for inappropriate behavior.  Stay far, far away from this company."
bad,"Pueden mejorar mucho en su manera de liderar a las nuevas generaciones en especial en las áreas administrativas, de staff y apoyo."
bad,First major issue no job security opt hires as term 1-3 year there is plenty of work for them to keep permanent guys the plant needs maintenance everywhere. They rather pay 1 engineer who designs jobs wrong 300k per year but will not keep 3 honest hard workers for the same cost. Upper management salaries are ridiculous make cuts from the top not bottom the job would be 5 stars if it was permanent not knowing if u will have a future brings stress
bad,"Hated working for att for 4 years, finally just walked out because they worked you till your fingers fell off for minimal pay. they always played favorites. I would not go back to save my life"
bad,Arrive early in the morning to prepare for opening. Be available to assist customers with their needs involving their att cellular account. Learned how to work in a retail environment. Management was nothing more than baby sitters for the staff. Culture was rough because the screening process for quality employees was low. Hardest part was dealing with less than respectful fellow employees. Enjoyable parts were the end of every shift.
bad,"AT&T has competitive pay and benefits.  They offer good internal training but do not take advantage of the skill sets that employees acquire.  "
bad,"I get it that upper management (AVP +)  have numbers to fulfill, but sometimes they should take a step back and realize how to make the workplace a better environment.  Take a poll with your workers as to what works and what doesn't when it comes to collaboration.  You're not Google, you're not Apple and you don't have a community lifestyle like these companies.  The Company was built on roots on access everywhere and have infrastructure equipment  everywhere as there are pieces that make the company successful and work throughout the world, use it don't try to jam pack people in a location to discuss projects and ideas when we have technology at our fingertips to be right there in front of someone else instantly.  You're missing the point of human interactivity just because you have an idea.  Not once have you visited a location to see how people work.  You should, then you'll realize that there are people that want to be successful personally and want their company to succeed.  Follow the direct manager's lead because they want their people to be successful."
bad,"I loved AT&T until they started laying people off, every year around Christmas, for the past 10 years.  I've seen so many TALENTED people let go, causing the level of customer service to dimish and create hardships on the employees left behind. It's sad to be laid off after 15 years..."
bad,"Working in an AT&T Call Center for those who have never worked in a call center before can be a nightmare to put it easily. The job is very stressful and there isn't very much support or constructive aid for you once you leave training. After the first couple months, it seems like an endless grind with goals being out of your control but demanded to be met. Management has its ups and downs. In my near two years I worked under 4 teams and I can say without a doubt that whether you get a good manager or a bad one is a flip of a coin. Some managers are perfect, helpful, supportive.. but the rest are lazy, rude, insufficient, demanding and have the capacity to throw you under the bus for their failures on top of being extremely unprofessional."
bad,"needs an overhaul on treatment of their  employees.  Needs to not be so discriminatory of employees who fall within a certain or certain categories.  Such as based on race, and how much money they make and/or have.  "
bad,Felt awesome to say I was employed with ATT at first. Then slowly changes happened and you realized how not fun this place was. Retention department now known as CLG is the scapegoat for every other department. We were held to higher standards versus the other departments. I hate ATT now and am happy it’s over with. Pay is good I guess but sometimes you really think it’s not worth the headache anymore.
bad,AT&T at one point cared about their employees and customers. Unfortunately not anymore! The benefits have diminished  a lot specially health benefits.
bad,"the management terrible, work is easy to understand, the day to day demands kinda ridiculous, not good environment don't care about their employees, just all around bad place to work"
bad,AT&T bases layoffs on salaries and not performance.  They also prefer to promote and hire from outside the company when they publicly claim to promote advancement and career development.
bad,"Agents were hanging up on people. At&T tend to make promises they have no intention to keep.  Unless the customer threatens to leave. Management, rude"
bad,"Morning Meetings, take calls assist customers, 2x 15 minute  breaks 1x45 minute lunch, Constant call volume with 10 second window between calls, end of day meeting."
bad,"this company promised more jobs if the tax break was passed but instead of creating more jobs, they let go about 10% across the board. I do not recommend this place if you want job security."
bad,"AT&T is, simply, overzealous in their sales. The management is interested only in numbers.This is why I left. The job is tedious and reacquires manipulation of customers."
bad,No future in this field. Management micro manages and too many rules to keep up with.  This field is coming to an end in the next 5 years. Not a career path anymore.
bad,"While working for this company, I've learned that working in retail isn't for everyone and, the overwhelming stress that comes with this job is not mentally healthy."
bad,"I'd been in the cellphone industry for 10+ years and finally made my way up the chain long enough to get into the corporate AT&T store locally. Words cannot begin the describe how good the pay is per-hour for my area and with an ever-changing commission structure; working for this company, your commissions payouts fluctuate often but with the consistent hourly pay, it's worth the heartache of weird structuring that the company as a whole seems to role out every 6 months. "
bad,"from truly taking care of the customers needs to, how can we (upper management) get away with paying employees less to show shareholders more money..."
bad,"This company compensates pretty well but the management is terrible. i love the sales environment but I also want to make sure my customers are taken care of. This is not acceptable at the retail locations, they encourage you to lie to your customers and mislead them. Employees are discouraged from helping customers with anything not related to sales. Management opportunities are limited and not based on skill but based on who you make friends with."
bad,"If your name shows on ""the radar"" your done. They will make anything up to get rid of you. In my case, it was their ""code of ethics"". I was accused of not checking someones ID before adding a line. Camera's within the store showed me checking and verifying the ID, however, I was let go after the ""investigation"""
bad,"Company is only concerned with bottom line.  Employees are just a number.  No longer a fun place to work.  Unless you are a software engineer, you constantly need to be concerned"
bad,"This is by far one of the greediest companies in corporate america, they will bleed you dry and crush your spirit on a daily basis; extreme micromanagement which expects  You to lie and manipulate customers into signing up for services that they don't want or need, The coaching system is a joke that is designed for you to fail You can hit the jackpot on a customer by getting them to sign up for DirecTV, insurance and cru and still get a coaching for not walking them to the door, And if you're a free thinker and you're not just a mindless robot like they want you to be your considered an undesirable, and because we are not easily fired because of Union  Management gets very creative on finding ways on how to get rid of people,  I left that God forsaken place and I'm not looking back. STAY AWAY!"
bad,"Because the company is huge, you are just a number. It seems like there isn't a lot of dynamic workflow or reasons why things are done a certain way. There is a lot of bureaucracy, and funny how the company is trying to go lean and agile with so many legacy employees thinking the company won't or shouldn't change."
bad,Recent mergers have made it very difficult to advance or maintain current employment. Many layoffs are occurring throughout the organization which make it a very volatile environment.
bad,"I began working for BellSouth before the merger with AT&T.  The BellSouth culture was very family oriented.  We all worked together and built a close working relationship.  The employee to company loyalty was exceptional and felt reciprocal.  Since the AT&T's buyout of BellSouth, it has all been about the numbers.  The company seems to care only about the bottom line and not the employees.  For the past several years AT&T has conducted 1-2 layoffs a year, small enough as to not raise eyebrows in the media.  Really crafty in kicking employees to the curb who have worked for them for years but trying to maintain a good PR image."
bad,Its a good company but the work life balance is non existent. Your calls are rated by the manager and the manager can decide to review a good or a bad call
bad,The union and Co-workers are worth it but the management is all about its self. Management looks at wire techs as expendable. They have no care about the working man.
bad,"Great work experience with customer service. But not a friendly place to work if you have a family. "
bad,Directv really had great employee involvement. They always had fun things to do. Directv wasn’t to flexible if you needed time off but they always gave away free things.
bad,"I loved my job. I answered many incoming call. I took care of all customers in a timely manner and sold products as well. we all had goals on a monthly basis. The more you sell, the more bonus you would receive. I learned how to treat, listen and take care of every customers' needs. I worked overtime for many months at a time when needed."
bad,It was hard to adjust at first because it was my very first job in the United States but it was a very good learning experience I was able to adapt easily to the culture.
bad,"You take calls and are supposed to push other products and services from AT&T onto customers, customers are irate and transferred all the time if the last agent thinks they wont get a sale. Nobody seems to want to do their job and just tries to pass the buck; also management has favorites and if you aren't one then you have zero chance to move up in the company. If you have a family the first year is awful due to the fact that you get points if you aren't at work and it doesn't matter why unless you use paid time off you get a point."
bad,they dont develop for types of calls each are different. They need notes that are clear and what is done. Plus management dont need to get compensation on sales.
bad,"They made me lie to customer also force me follow flow call  to punish me for not following  the flow that set me up to lose sales "
bad,Att lays off their workers 3 times a year which is unfair and the raises here are not that great I been here for 10 plus years and some of the newer guys and making more than me I don’t recommend this job to no one
bad,"I started with Direct TV before AT&T purchased them; I was effectively making $18/hr with OT. AT&T took over and set everyone to max 40 hour week, and they reduced my salary to 14.25/hour."
bad,"Was there almost 9 years and could not get promoted to another position although I was qualified."
bad,""" AT&T's leadership are some of the most inept, out-of-touch, and ignorant managers I have ever seen in my life. They have zero knowledge of the consequences of these massive layoffs. They are destroying company morale, and they magically think that by 2020, all their virtualization and SDN efforts will work flawlessly... Wrong."""
bad,"No work/life balance"
bad,We were required to work extremely long hours installing and fixing cable underneath of power-lines. The work was extremely dangerous for very little pay.
bad,"meh, it wasn't too great.  management was laxadazical, no autonomy, no consistency in scheduling. the benefits were sub par. no room for upward advancement."
bad,"Benefits and pays is decent. Work environment is good, great people. Management and moving up needs work. But if your driven you can make great money and a possible career there."
bad,"AT&T lays off outsourcing a lot in the IT area.  Not a lot of stability for such a large company."
bad,"I was actually with DirecTV before ATT buyout. I loved DirecTV and all the benefits provided. I even worked for a company called Prime Star when DirecTV bought the company. As for ATT, I retired from DirecTV after 16 great years. The culture was agent friendly and provided excellent opportunities for growth. Once ATT bought DirecTV all that changed. Customer service was not about the customer anymore. Thus, I retired,"
bad,"AT&T outsourced many of its employees with various companies. After working with one of those companies, the contract amount was cut and those employees were out of a job. No loyalty to the people that work for them"
bad,I would not recommend working for att one day to another you can be without a job be careful its not secure to work for them no more no more no more no
bad,"the company would be great to work for if they didn't have a ridiculous point system in place.  I felt like they were making you choose between your health and your job because there are no paid sick days.  And with the company being so large it's hard to resolve any issues, especially with payroll.  If your paycheck is messed up good luck getting it resolved, they don't allow employees to speak to payroll, you have to get your supervisor to do it.  Also be prepared to work your butt off with strict quotas and get 40% of your commission withheld and then get taxed 22% on top of that.  What good is incentives and extra bonuses when you get taxed at that rate?"
bad,"I was rated at the top of customer service and attendance for 6 years straight applied for several positions but never received an opportunity, No follow ups or details on what to do to advance. Closed call center due to these reasons."
bad,"The location itself was gorgeous, lots of trails for hiking, etc. There was no opportunity for advancement among the contractors whatsoever. Funding was perpetually lacking or fickle. My project was informed to be fully funded for the rest of the year back in May. That very next week, I was told on a Thursday that that Friday was my last day. No two week notice, no possible warning after being told that we were completely funded. Contractors are treated like garbage there, and I do not recommend working as a contractor there if at all possible. Employee life might be different. I wouldn't know. We were never allowed to transfer over to full employees."
bad,"It's like the military....  Suggestions will never be accepted on how to improve the company or its business policies.  Play their game, or else..... find another job."
bad,"I really don't have anything decent to say about this company. Stressful typical day, big company that take complete advantage of its workers. Wouldn't pay me all my vacation after I put in two weeks notice to leave, they said they have the right to prorate it if you leave in the beginning of the year. Though I was with the company for 2 1/2 years."
bad,company was great once upon a time but it has gone downhill and was terrible place to work last 10 years I was there. The company was more focused on automation and less on the people. We all were replaceable and work sourced to various locations
bad,"Management more worried about their job than the people below them!!!  The job itself is fine, great benefits,  If management would just leave people alone to do their jobs."
bad,"AT&T is a phenomenal opportunity for young professional's interested in entering a corporate atmosphere. This company helps an employee understand the political persona required for improvement, and touts a culture of advancement and encouragement For many AT&T employees the company does not deliver on its vision."
bad,"You enter the floor extremely prepared after 8 weeks of paid training, and there are a few opportunities to get small bonuses if you have good stats. The floor support and team managers can be very impatient and there are even floor support people who have very little knowledge on how to do things in the systems. If you need to go on medical or personal leave, they make you start the leave while the approval/denial is pending. If it's medical, they'll most likely deny it, so be sure to provide as much documentation as you can. When they deny it, be sure to appeal. And if they (most likely) deny that, be prepared to receive attendance points for each day you were on leave, because then they'll fire you for attendance."
bad,The company's quarterly head reduction among it's technicians always leads to increased performance requirements for those who remain.  This causes a stressed and unstable working environment.  No additional training along with the added responsibilities from those surplused and a dwindling support base on most levels makes working frantic.  Despite the media there are very few opportunities left for advancement unless you are involved with upper management.
bad,"physical job, scheduled 8 but often worked over, meeting the metrics was often difficult, time off was enjoyed but the stress of going back often hovered like dark cloud"
bad,Changed commissions/incentives a lot which lowered commission payout. Set quotas too high for how many sale reps were in that location. Managers tried to help but corporate wouldn't make necessary changes.
bad,Was a good company years ago now all about the profit and it’s never enough . Outsourced most jobs or moved them out of state. You were not a person just a number
bad,Not a career position. For somebody who is in school or just getting out of school. Great company but management is very poor all around in different channels.
bad,Politics have no place in the corporate inviornment. Worked hard only to be downsized for reasons still unknown was a top manager the entire time under position.
bad,Excellent pay but has changed over the years to a company culture of downsizing and high pressure environment. Work assignments are missing important details and have to be updated by the tech in the field without time allocation.
bad,"Nice environment to work in but the attendance policy is very strict and doesn't adjust to everyday life situations. I really enjoyed the job but I felt as if I was considered ""a number"" to the company instead of a human being with real life situations."
bad,Coming from a well established company to ATT was a huge change. ATT is no where near as organized as I was use to. It was unfair that hourly employees were union and the managers were not. Union reps did not help when needed.
bad,Working here was difficult for a family work life balance. The shifts are based on seniority therefore getting time off can be difficult. Time adherence down to going to the bathroom if tight.
bad,The company places huge amount of stress and unnecessary stress on its employees. further they rip off their customers and expect you to go along with there unfair work practices. Selling internet to senior citizen who don't have computers and just want a basic emergency phone line.
bad,The work environment is very stressful.  They do not take into consideration that employees actually have families and a life outside of their company.
bad,"Good pay, fun coworkers.  Incredibly incompetent and hostile management.  Highly unorganized work environment... nobody seems to know what's going on.  Poor communication all over the company"
bad,"The best 19 years I experienced with AT&T is with my business customers that I always made sure I provided world class service.  Always making sure I delivered superior and quality service on each and every contact in a fast paced Call Center environment.   From getting them to the right department, troubleshooting complex problems with bills and telecommunication features on their accounts, and consultative selling  products based on benefits and needs for their business.  With a fast paced environment it had its challenges on meeting sales quotas however it was reachable.  I really enjoyed working with a lot of individuals from all walks of life."
bad,"Way too much micromanagement.. cant install Directv service for people without supervisor popping up every 2 days to catch you doing something wrong. No voltage detector on you? Immediate wtite up and suspension. No hard hat on near the power meter? Write up, suspension. I understand safety is paramount to the success of techs and the company but you get disciplined for silly stuff with no slap on the hand first."
bad,"Working at at&t was a lot of fun and full of challenges.  The work was full of challenges and creativity. The pay was fair and it also offered plenty of ways to get commissions.  The company had full-time human resources or recruiting staff, but during peak growth periods, the company also strived to find the correct personal. AT&T also offered the best in employee benefits for its employees."
bad,Seemed this company looked for more ways to terminate employees than to keep them. Long hours and constantly being micro managed made it very stressful to enjoy the job.
bad,"competition for customers,very low pay plus commission, in order to get commission must meet very high sales, training is extensively each week, high sales demands, must sell a certain amount of direct tv in a month"
bad,"I was excited to work at&t, things changes really quick. I was a top performer and moved up quick within the company. Very stressfull and no life work balance."
bad,"I can't review this company as a place to work. My overall experience is, I was not happy working there. But there was good mixed with the bad. In my opinion, the company culture claims to promote innovation and creativity, while in fact discouraging those qualities. But that's just an opinion and perhaps unfair."
bad,"Very mentally exhausting and has affect on home life.Didn't get much home time. Unknown mandatory overtime. Verbal abuse. It takes a lot of ""leaving issues at the door"" and emotional control."
bad,"stressful trying to educate customer on limitations of wifi when being told they can get speeds otherwise, 10 years no where to transfer dead end job lack of motivation"
bad,"The are so strict and so scared of a law suit that no matter what happens to involve you be it microscopic or gigantic, your fault or not, they will put you through the ringer. They will look for anything, any loop hole, any discrepancy to fire you. I dont't want to say the union is useless they do try to help but because they negotiated almost all employee rights away for more pay per hour there's nearly nothing they can do to save your job. You're not even safe on your off time. Even if someone T-bones you while you're on vacation they will bring that up and put you under the microscope."
bad,They are very good at telling you about possible job advancements but not following through with these promises. Everything is very cherry picked and misleading. Although this varies per store my experience with them is terrible.
bad,I started working for AT&T when they acquired DIRECTV and didn't like a lot of moves the company made which made working for AT&T not very fun.  There have been too many reorgs where multiple employees have had 3 different bosses in one year.
bad,"IT budgets and schedules were always constrained, with no reduction in scope. Requirements always in flux. business direction missing or wildly changing."
bad,The employees get no respect and are treated very poorly. Especially premise technicians. Management is just out for themselves. They do not care about their people
bad,very repetitive job with lack of options to move up unless you are in the back pocket of upper management.  okay job to have would not recommend staying there much longer than 5 years it will wear on you.
bad,"Many levels of customer service representatives, in my case I worked in a now-defunct department that combined fraud analysis and bad debt reduction. Unfortunately, at the time, AT&T merged with Cingular leading to that department being phased out and my being laid off."
bad,"Being a PT was physically taxing.  I applied for the job thinking there would be more critical thinking skills required, that was not the case.  I also was under the impression that moving around within the company would be possible, that is next to impossible starting as a PT."
bad,The is a high stress very demanding job with low job security. This is a union company that does not provide the appropriate information to workers to be effective in the work place
bad,Its ok company to work for....Besides to unrealistic metrics and unrealistic goals they try to push. For a company so focused on quality and customer service why is they want to push you to be productive as well. I understand all the bean counters in the head offices  have never been service technicians in their lives have no idea what its like to deal with stuff we do in the field. Not to mention your employment is predicated on imaginary numbers that no one seems to able to fully explain. I was fortunate enough to have some great managers i worked for. Who were former techs and they empathized we us in many ways. The job is not for everyone. Its alot pressure; and they will lay you off without a moments notice.
bad,"NO thought at all of employee concerns doesnt care if they destroy a family. you are not a person youre a number. mangement plays favorites, targets others"
bad,"They hire you, to fire you! The company looks great and is huge, but it's a cut throat company on the prem tech part. The managers are out to get you in anyway they can. They set you up for failure, and the union is a joke!!"
bad,"I feel like the restrictions that were placed on CSR's lowered the quality of service provided to the customers. We were encouraged not to transfer to other departments, even when someone else could provide the best solution for the customer's needs. Things that were out of our control were held against as such as call backs within a certain amount of time. Many customers called back because they neglected to ask the first rep a question, not because their previous issue had not been resolved."
bad,"Because I'm still with this company i cannot comment on the work ethics. I have to keep my job until my position is surplussed out. so with that being said, att is great to work at"
bad,"There are not many opportunities for advancement, there are those for upper management but not for the rest of the work force.  The problem is the company has merged many other companies into the workforce and the opportunities are limited to finding a lateral or even an advancing position  These positions usually end up being eliminated during down sizing events which take place very 12 o 24 months."
bad,if you dont have a life outside of work this is the place for you... no job security or oppertunity for advancement...will have you stuck working the same position for years then fire you for some who will work for less
bad,everything is about meet your numbers or you get wrote up. they don't care about any one at this company only about making a dime. working there employees to the deathbed
bad,At&t is a great place to collect a check. pays great only problem is they have horrible upper management. when upper management identify a problem out in the field caused by tech or multiple technicians instead of coaching the technicians it leads straight to discipline. kind of hard for someone to make it who is not to familiar with att system
bad,There were no hours there. It was okay if you wanted extremely part time. And then sometimes you’d get full time hours but no benefits. Management changed ALL the time. It was ridiculous.
bad,"Very good paying job with great benefits.  However with the good you also get the bad.  Management candidates are picked more because of who someone knows not how much knowledge they have. Many managers can not do the job and do not understand the roadblocks that the techs face.  I was there for over 17 years and I slowly watched the customer service part of the job  disappear when AT&T purchased Bell South. Most managers are more concerned how long you are on a job not if you fixed the problem or not.  It is a good job in the sense that you have your own vehicle and are not stuck in an office all day.  Most days you do not see your boss in the field.  The hardest part of this job is the physical requirements.  You must be able to climb poles in all kinds of weather year round and deal with all kinds of animals.  You will deal with bugs, wasps, hornets, ants, yellow jackets, snakes, cats, dogs, bats, and any other animal you can imagine that someone might have in their home. If you like to work by yourself and have a good technical mind, don't mind working outside most of the time, and enjoy a new challenge every day then this job is for you."
bad,"Very poor management from Regional Supervisors down to Assistant Managers. They are not interested in your growth with the company even if your are a consistent performing sales consultant. "
bad,if you value family life this is not the job for you and you have big brother watching you like you have never heard of before and management is always looking for reasons to hem people up
bad,"Over abundance of 2nd hand misinformation given to employees."
bad,"The benefits of working for AT&T/DirecTV are decent. Free TV, company vehicle and phone, gas card, good health benefits. It comes at a cost though. Much less family time, some technicians get over worked due to other people not handling their load. Long hours when you get routed 2 hours from home."
bad,"You are required to stay at your desk the entire time - if you need to use the restroom, you are required to wait until your break.  If you need to go any other time, too bad."
bad,"commission structure has been rebuilt and it is very dificult to make a decent paycheck, a normal day is more customer service driven instead of sales leading, management pushes customers to buy unnecessary services sometimes just to meet quotas, leaving you as the face of representation when customers get upset for something you didn't even offer. Overall, it all depends on the location you work for, different market locations."
bad,"Their product, the real yellow pages, was dying when I was there and  a push was being made to become a more digitally-focused co. We were trained to sell websites, etc. but the co did not enjoy a good reputation."
bad,"This company has many areas of work and some areas are much better than others. Those out in the field really love their work and they get paid very generously with fantastic health benefits. Those in the call center have vastly different experiences. There is a ton of pressure for sales and in some cases, the pressure leads to questionable ethical practices. The call center is probably the most difficult position in the company aside from 411 operators."
bad,This division was a start up when I was there. They were in a declining market and had to change the focus. This change took longer than they thought and was hard to implement.
bad,"la encargada es buena jefa, mucha impuntualidad, buen ambiente laboral, hay mucha motivacion pero es trabajo bajo presion."
bad,"I was informed that, at the time, I was the oNLY person to score a 100 on a customer service evaluation. However, prior to taking the position, I was advised I would be paid in conjunction to my customer service experience. I had 6 yrs under my belt at that time (2007/2008) and it was all a lie. In my eyes although collections was my job; customer service came first but it was contradictory as I was encourage to be mean to the person I was trying to collect from and it was never over 25.00"
bad,AT&T Contract losses has effected many employees with new product implementation. in this case employees have been left in the dark about company strategies for the future resulting in possible employee surplus predictions.
bad,"good money working for them but they make too many changes that  force people to find other jobs elsewhere, management is poor and sow very little interest in employees well being overall"
bad,"I worked for DirecTV before the merger and when AT&T took over they started sending our jobs to overseas call centers. Needless to say, DirecTV's outstanding customer service record tanked to the worst customer service because AT&T insisted on sending our jobs overseas. Unfortunately customer's now have to deal with agents who don't know what they're doing and in most cases, the agent makes the customer's problem worse and their experience terrible. AT&T started laying off all departments and now they have the worst customer service and it will likely remain that way. The pay is decent for a call center job however I made $17.50 with DirecTV with shift differential pay and working weekends and when AT&T took over they eliminated shift differential so I started making $16.00 an hour. I do not recommend working at AT&T."
bad,Lack in career development window and stressful place to implement any new functionalities with the retired technologies. Finally too stress causing because too much dead functionalities .
bad,"Did not make good money here. Was demoted only to be told it was temporary. It was definitely a lie. Waited for months with horrible pay to be told about the promotion that was ""coming""."
bad,"Very stressful work enviornment"
bad,"Billion dollar Corporation that underpays and under appreciates its employees.  Great place to work if you like ramen noodles and NOT being able to save money for your child's college tuition . Typical day includes attempting to solve the worlds problems without the proper tools or leadership, while being held accountable for issues that are completely out of your control. Management personnel is typically number driven, bonus hungry, heartless, dehumanized individuals who have been thoroughly brainwashed to be as impersonal as possible. The Hardest part of the job is trying not to quit mid-shift. Most enjoyable part of the job is sharing war stories with co workers who share your suffering."
bad,"If you have good selling abilities it is the job for you. If not do not apply, it is a requirement to sale and if you don't sell or offer the correct way you don't stand a chance."
bad,Just be ready to have seix with someone to get a promotion.. Or wait 10 years.They will use you abuse you.. And send you on your merry way likw you were the problem.. Just ask around memphis
bad,"The job is not a bad job. The upper management is the biggest problem for the company. Even if you are one of the better employees, they will still find a way to undercut you."
bad,"Project managers are not receptive to feedback or many new ideas. The idea is that managers do not need any computer science knowledge, technical knowledge or even basic understanding of coding to assign work to developers, roadmap software release, or plan sprints. Respect is expected and demanded, not earned. Very disappointing."
bad,"This company is about making money by any means neccessary.  They know half the time that the service is not going to work in your area, yet they sell it to you anyway.  I've never worked at a company that had so many irrate customers.  The customer service is horrible."
bad,"Your reward for hard work is more work. Repeatedly made to work 12-14 hours a day. Fortunately I had a good supervisor. But Corporate supervisors had no personality. If you make one mistake, they use it as a reason to get rid of you."
bad,"Company is too big for it's own good. Too much micro managing and spreadsheet usually dictate the workflow."
bad,Its getting worse....didnt think it was possible...turn out it is...so we all might be out on strike soon...the only thing good is how much pto time I get
bad,"Good culture at the company, but upper management will force you to work a sixth day if you get behind on any goals, and managers don't make their own schedule. manager position is a joke, pretty much a sales person with tons of responsibility."
bad,"AT&T is a typical, oversized company that has a decent pay and benefits plan.  The training is better than most companies but dedication to retention of employees is lacking."
bad,The hours were really long.  The pay was not very good.  AT&T customer was abusive. I would not recommend working at AT&T as a contractor.  Full Time might be better.
bad,"coming from a top sales rep that isn't problematic.."
bad,Chances in collection daily....no consistency with management or supervisors....one manager tells you something different than other manager...management allowed customers to disrespect representatives and call us out our names
bad,"Job was easy and great hours, the coworkers were always friendly. Best part about the job. Sometimes hard to deal with customers but overall easy job."
bad,"Working at AT&T was very stressful. Daily huddle meeting, constant peer coaching and long hours. The products are always changing and you will have to adjust to all of the changes."
bad,you get a new shift around every 6 months. you have the ability to make numerous friends. The benefits are amazing. the managers try and make it a fun environment by having games throughout the center.
bad,The culture in the store has gone down the past few months due to comp changes and lowering sales compensation. Dealing with warranty issues and service all the time instead of sales
bad,Company has unrealistic goals set for their employees wanting people to kill themselves in order to make production goals.
bad,Unorganized place to work for. The management will give you a enormous amount of stops for you to complete and really expect you to finish them all ....mixing off site shredding with on site shredding is against company policy but the supervisors don't care...the turn around ratio is high....the can't keep people there at all...
bad,"after 15 years of stellar service i was surplussed from AT&T.   Overall they are a good place to be with decent benefits.   Culture at AT&T varies by what you do, for the most part its ok.   Management on the upper level is usually concerned about themselves."
bad,"They pay well, there is no room for growth at this time, a typical day deals with someone telling you to do something then hundreds of road blocks to actually accomplish the smallest task, the company itself is too large to be organized and is a huge headache because of that. I would never recommend working for this company unless you have the mental capacity of being treated like a child all day long, using programs that micromanage you, and rarely getting work accomplished in a timely fashion but getting coached to work harder."
bad,"Our division was worth about 3% of AT&Ts business so we were the stepchild, position was horribly unstable, morale was a joke, not a good place to end up but I will say their sales training is great...if you are new to sales then start here, they'll teach you how...you just have to recognize what is useful and what is useless."
bad,"The company has a very good Benefits package, However the work-Life balance is way off. I do not wish to speak badly of a company, but I have gone days without being able to see my kids because of the hours that we are forced to work. Zero consistency, and forced overtime."
bad,The company was a good place to grow and meet people of like minded success goals.  Cutting edge technology was a fun learning experience.  The pay was increasingly rewarding.
bad,Micromanaged every single day. Mandatory overtime. Great pay. IBEW has almost no power at all during negotiations. Great with suppling tools needed for job. Great benefits.
bad,Telecom giant that does not understand the balance between work and family. Job advancement is rarely possible. Great benefits and pay.
bad,Overwhelming goals in way to many matrix. Pay is good if you don't mind taking advantage of people. Extreme micromanagement is a every day thing. Every customer gets a survey and if the customer has a good experience with the sales person but not overall pleased with at&t then the sales person gets coached that we didn't do something right and that survey can effect compensation. Long hours so work/life balance sucks. Once again the only thing I like about working at at&t is the pay and benefits everything else is pretty much is horrible.
bad,"The management was under schooled and disconnected with hourly. Would not even pay for my masters degree..  21 years later, I got the out. Downsizing downsizing downsizing was the flavor for my last few years at this company."
bad,"Before the Merger, DTV was great, since the merger, there have been a lot of financial cutbacks and perks taken away. This has also greatly reduced company moral."
bad,"Sales representatives are often talked down to and micro-managed. Feedback from management is often negative and counter-productive to a healthy and safe work environment. Representatives fear retaliation from management when voicing opinions on what can improve team morale, and executing sales process to company guidelines, not guidelines created by internal management (which employees are routinely given disciplinary actions for)."
bad,This company has to be the worst one yet that I have worked for ... they hire you to do one job and you never get to do that job...working in the call center they set unrealistic selling goals that take your moral for the job down...If you work in the customer service aspect of this company the customer can never get what they need when they call in to the center because the person that works there is so worried about saying the right thing at the right time and trying to sell customers another service that they get short changed on good service because of this.... it is horrible to have so much pressure put on you... and dont get me started on how they want you to be decietful to get customers to sign up for the new services.... Horrible Company
bad,"High volume call center, heavy workload, great peers and lots of team work in the  work environment. Lots of overtime available if you wanted to work extra"
bad,"This job gave me a great opportunity to sharpen my customer service, selling, an problem solving skills, but did not allow for upward mobility. I was recognized monthly with monetary an quota awards, but always felt stuck in this dept, stuck here because I was good at selling, but I feel I have more talents that I would like to explore, an even though I was good often felt like I was doing the customer a disservice."
bad,"It's door to door marketing..."
bad,"A typical day at work is understaffed and over worked. I learned many things as there was an extensive learning program and we constantly were taking new training classes. Management is overworked, under staffed and constantly asked for more. Co-workers are great and really work together. The hardest part of the job is constantly being beat up by upper management for increased results and the terrible work schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job is growing others."
bad,"The average day is getting pressured to get sales by management.  Nothing is ever good enough for this place! You can finish top in the site, but still get criticized for something you didn't do perfect.  Put in a good 2 years for this company and feel that i'm not respected by management for my contributions.  Computers are very old and glitch constantly.  Always have to restart and throw off your calls and time for the day. Haven't had a shift change in almost a year. Pay is very good and opportunity for raises every 6 months. Many opportunities to get out of the bottom call type."
bad,"Dealing with angry customers because of something out of your control really takes it's toll.  Can be rewarding when you can offer great value to customers, but this is rarely the case. Little room for advancement and management is very over bearing."
bad,"Initially this was the best place I had ever worked (when it was Pacific Bell).  I had considered my job to be the best on the planet.  However, the entire scope of the job changed, as well as the company ideology.  The company has no respect for the employees.  At one time, employees were considered to be assets, now they are considered to be liabilities."
bad,The buy out caused pay to go way down. Some technicians have had pay cut in half in some instances.Coworkers are normally nice people.
bad,The job was unoragnazied. My fmla was not approved even thought the paper work was submitted months for my 6 week leave. The job hours were supposed to be set hours but the hours were up and down for 3 months.
bad,"AT&T Customer Service Specialist job requirements are extremely taxing and draining.  Not only do you have to deal with the sometimes overwhelming demands of the customer, but management also applies the same impossible requests."
bad,"I had one great supervisor he helped me out when I had problems. I liked the work, but the constant change in polices made things a little dicey at times. Was just not the job for me great for some people."
bad,"There is always change in the company. It use to be fun. It is not fun anymore. Please Run. If you have a family, you will not them much."
bad,Working here sounds like you can make good money but you work hard and deal with a lot of angry people and arent really paid much. The company made promises all the way up until the day they closed the doors and we no longer had a job. If you are not level 3 and higher you dont matter when working for this company.
bad,"I worked for the company for almost three years. and within the three years I had three managers there is daily change, daily learnings to complete. must sell AT&T product and services. daily, weekly, monthly.  need to work well under pressure and adapt to constant change. I herd nothing but good things about the company but unfortunately I was disappointed to work for at&t. AT&T does not value there hard working employees. the company pays well but if you can tolerate constant change, being held accountable, enjoy being in sales and various managemnet direction AT&T is for you."
bad,Very very very stressful. The management is not on the same page. If you asks question the Leads and Team Managers are rude.
bad,The culture is very bureaucratic and management is not forthcoming with negative news. All managers are not good at managing.
bad,"Compensation and benefits are good.  Work life balance is terrible especially if you are just beginning.  Management loves you when you are doing good but hates you when you are doing bad.  in my experience i found it very difficult to get promoted.  Even though compensation is good, i felt they could be paying sales reps even better due to the large variety of products you are required to sale."
bad,"I enjoyed the team members and even assisting the customers while at AT&T, however, some of the rules about statistics requirements seemed unreasonable and punitive at times.  Schedules were not family-oriented and inflexible."
bad,"Company don't have stable work ethical job.  Management needs to take communication classes, and learn how to do the job and understand the job instead finding reason to fire employees"
bad,"A professional environment that meets all the organizational goals by inspiring, speaking and listening to their employees.  I want to look forward to coming to work each day and  interact with coworkers in a collaborative and collegial manner. I wpuld like a compnay where you have opportunity to grow and develop professionally. Also, to have some kind of employee recognition aside from formal methods such as cash bonuses or employee incentives, the random “thanks for doing a great job” from a manager is a welcome form of employee recognition"
bad,Overall you will be fighting for your job from day one. The only thing that was great was the training you receive to begin.
bad,"a typical day was going to work doing daily deposit and cash count , checking in daily shipments. I learned about store resets and shipping and receiving shipments. management was ok and the hardest part of the jobs staying late hours putting out new phones.the most enjoyable was my coworkers whom I loved."
bad,I worked there from a time when they transitioned us from being contractors to employees and the transition wasn't always smooth.
bad,"Before I ever accepted another position with this greedy, over managed company, I was promised that I would not have to go back through training classes that I had previously attended and passed.  I accepted the job contingent to this and was totally lied to and then I was told that there was no mistake or misunderstanding.  I was then told that I would be fired if I did not resign.  This was the second time that I had been hired by AT&T...as the first time I was an Outside Plant Technician (O.P.T.) to serve a 24 month tour and we worked in Columbus, Ga for 6 months only to be laid off.  Everyone was sent home and told to go claim unemployment.  I have been in telecom for 23 years and I have never treated any of my employees the way that this company treats people.  AT&T does not care one bit about their employees, their families or the customers.  But rather buying other companies and football stadiums.  I will never apply here again and if you do not believe me, please feel free to waste your time and find out for yourself."
bad,poor management is the biggest problem many of them shop online all day and get upset if you need them to take over a call and most have not done the job you have and you train them
bad,"This a good job for someone with a high school education or just graduated from college.  It is also good for some who can manage their time and go to college part-time,  This is not a job for someone that is educated, unless you want to try and get into management.  "
bad,"Answer phones and assist with account changes and selling of new products. The hardest part of the job for me was that it wasn't about the customer service it was all about the sale. I felt like didn't have the option to really help the customer just to find something new to sell them. The best part of the job was the people I worked with, I made some really good friends."
bad,"Installing Satellite Dishes for customers so they can enjoy cable TV. I learned how to run cable down the backside of a wall, how to find satellite signal. I worked alone but the co-workers I did help or have help from all seem to be helpful. The hardest part would be having to Install the dished in Bad weather, and the most enjoyable part would be meeting all the different customers."
bad,I enjoyed my time at AT&T.  Learned a lot and was given numerous opportunities to grow and develop in the company.  My manager was a great manager.  She allowed me to be myself and encouraged team work and cross-training.
bad,Work/Life Balance does not exist in many store locations for management.  Pay can be lucrative but you work hard for every penny you earn.  It is fun to be around all of the different technology and see the possibilities of the future
bad,"Call center position but 99% of calls are billing complaints. Very hard to upsell when people are mad about a $5-10 Price change and have no computer to sell internet to.  Goals too high, 1 sale a day average most days even for sales gurus. They should call it customer service job. Way too many software systems to use, most are old as dirt. not worth the stress. Also attendance is crazy, miss 1 minute or more 4x per year and youre fired. Medical coverage takes 6 mo."
bad,"A typical day at ATT would be to handle all inbound calls and resolve the reason the customer was calling. For example, to obtain new service or transfer existing service. Or it would involve a billing explanation which may or may not involve disputed charges. The primary purpose as outlined by the company was to try and establish new business regardless of the reason for the call. I learned that I really liked the people I worked with and earlier in my career the management as well. I discovered in my last 4-5 years that there would be a constant state of flux. Management would routinely change our approach on calls which normally did not help us improve. The job itself was challenging as far as selling products but it was not impossible. Unfortunately, while even now I still consider myself a valuable asset to ATT, they do not agree and therefore I would say the hardest part of the job was the politics of the company. They can be a great place to work but I am sad to say that it is no longer the case."
bad,"Lots of Hours"
bad,"The job itself is great. You start at 8 in the morning. A downside is you work until you are done. If you do not have kids I recommend this job. They do not care if your baby sitter cancels. They require mandatory 6 day weeks during busy times of the year. It is mostly an independent job. Very rarely will you be provided assistance with a job. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers. You are in their home. If you are not a very friendly, respectful person, this is not the job for you. That being said the best part of the job are the people as well. If you like being challenged, working outside, driving, I recommend this job. Unfortunately, the company has so many ways to back charge the technicians, even for faulty equipment."
bad,"I would never recommend anyone work for at&t call center especially in Wichita, KS "
bad,"Nothing Good to report here"
bad,Being a prem tech at att is horrible. upper management treat you very horrible .they don't care about any tech having a personal life and the rules are set for you to fail
bad,This was a very stressful job. Just by answering the telephone you could be cussed out one minute and receive a nasty vulgar call the next. Management was okay for the most part. The hardest part of job was being cussed out and being called everything that isn't good on the telephone by customers your trying help.
bad,"Most of your day will be hitting up your assigned module, cold calling prospective clients, and working with new customers to help guide them through the provisioning. "
bad,"I've been at AT&T for 17 years and depending on the department/co-works/management, it could be considered a great place to work.  The downside is lack of advancement, prejudices, and extremely long hours without any monetary compensation."
bad,"Pays well for a call center"
bad,"A lot of work. Management not flexible. No time for family"
bad,"A typical day at work would be eight hours of non stop customer service and sales inbound calls. I enjoyed meeting people from all over the United States, east, west and midwest customers of all walks of life. The hardest part of the job was just convincing my customers to buy our products. I enjoyed my co workers who along with myself were devoted to AT&T and to their families.I really have enjoyed working here to gain knowledge and experience to advance my career. I thank AT&T for giving me the experience and opportunities that I've had since I started."
bad,"Horrible place to work, have no compassion if your family is in the hospital or not. You have to come to work all bent out of shape with a loved one dieing."
bad,very strict by the book company.  Training is awesome.  If your a single parent raising a child on your own this isn't the job for you.  Long hours worked until you finish your assignment.  Pay attention to the training because you'll need it in the field.
bad,"upon am arrival here guys seemed to be very frustrated few say good morning.My Training here was a bit challenging due to companies strict performance rating Techs were more focused on making their numbers than proper training as a result I was tossed around from tech to tech and had to pick up whatever tips were communicated in that environment. I was hired to learn cable splicing but taught more about how to be sure to cover your steps as to not get written up. the Management team was VERY poor no vision for the team, they were not prepared for new hires and a sense of mistrust was consistently present when speaking to them and through out team members. Most of my co workers on my team where nice and wanted to help out but explained that the system will not allow for proper training. The Hardest part about the job was simply learning it. The most enjoyable part was enter acting with the different crew members and learning how differently you can approach the same issue."
bad,"This job would have been much more successful if the manager actually knew how to run this location. I would work alone a lot of the time for ten hour shifts, with no way of taking a lunch break due to being the only person in the store. Between having close to no phones or accessories in stock, it was almost impossible to please the customers and win a sale. The training was a joke, working two weeks without pay and being taught a fourth of the work and how to use the system. Then to top it off, our owner/manager completely avoided the shop for two months and came in one day to close the store down. At least give us notice, knowing that we are all adults with bills that need to be paid. It is not surprising at all that this location failed."
bad,"Win-at-all-costs atmosphere. AT&T really doesn't care about keeping customers, just milking those they have for all they can. Very poor customer service is a product of the environment that focuses solely on up-selling. If you don't play the game, you won't last."
bad,AT&T was great when it was Bellsouth. Good money but bad management and the upper management only care about numbers not the employees.
bad,"Steward role for CWA union members.  Fairly active organization, however losing strength with each new contract."
bad,A typical day at the job included customer service and consulting with business clients. This job provided the knowledge of sales and how these services may benefit each business client. The hardest part of this job was meeting daily quotas.
bad,The supervisors here wouldn't help you when you would have your hand raised for 20 minutes.  Then they would get mad when you were spending too much time on a call when in actuality it was their fault for not properly training you and not coming to help when you would have your hand raised.
bad,"I would say that working for AT&T has taught me a great deal as to how important the customer base is to a company, rather than the customer alone. A typical day starts with a morning huddle where management informs the crew of the days agenda and targeted points. I then dispatch to my first job which could be a repair or install and continue to complete the job and move forward to the next. I learned to push myself for job completion in many various elements and environments. I have realized that I can be a great independent worker. I am one who is used to working with or on a team. Management seems to lack management training. The same goes for our premises tech team. We are only taught so much before released out on our own. Fear is a driving element for management to keep us moving forward. This leads me to the hardest part of the job, which is the red tape, and the lack of proper leadership. The ones that work along side me are not happy at most due to the same reasons of mine I have noticed. This tends to create a lack of interest in actually doing the job, or doing it well. I have struggled with the repair side, because of the lack of craftsmanship from other tech installs, which causes my metrics harm, and in turn, my job security. The elements, the environments and the labor are not nearly as stressful until combined with the pressure from management and the time given to complete said job. There are many perks to the job as well. I enjoy being autonomous. the ability to make the decisions on my own and still meet the expectations of the company are a big plus. The"
bad,"Lot more varibles to the than they teach you in training classes, to much on the job training that works against you."
bad,It was not the greats job in the world. most days you wake up at 6am check to see where your first job is if i t was close you go back to sleep if it was across the whole state i get dressed and then i leave. clock in when i get to my first house they clock out after i get my last document signed then i drive home. I personal worked in to blizzards and a rain storm . I can now work in any weather. No matter the circumstance the job had to get done or else you spend all day working for $20 for 12 hours of work.
bad,"It goes w/out saying that AT&T is one of the largest companies in the world with vast resources.  I was excited to come to AT&T and help build out a digital advertising business.  However anyone in the digital space knows that for businesses to thrive in this environment it must be nimble and flexible.   Unfortunately AT&T is extremely risk adverse and therefore does not empower individuals to act on sound ideas.   From a culture perspective I was used to something more vibrant and dynamic.  AT&T is not  that.  The people are nice and helpful but very much set in their ways/processes.  Punch the clock, do your job well, go home.  Again, I think AT&T is an incredible company but needs to stick to what they do best as a Telcom company."
bad,"I was working with vibrant team, and the management is not good."
bad,"Management was not very good, there was no work life balance you are expected to be available all the time. Pay was very well."
bad,"Okay job, but you can't move up in the company.  If you don't like talking on the phone, I doubt this job is for you."
bad,"Each position at AT&T is heavily influenced by the management chain for that organization.  So a typical day will either be completely nuts and disorganized if management doesn't know what they are doing; or very organized and process oriented.  "
bad,"Overall the AT&T Mobility call center in Oklahoma City, OK is a good place to work if you are satisfied with ""having a job"". They do offer great living benefits including health care, dental, vision, and retirement account matching. They also have ""give-aways"" as an incentive to meet performance statistics. "
bad,I would only recommend AT&T as a short-term solution for cash.
bad,"AT&T is a great company to work for with great benefits.  It was exciting to work for AT&T as it was providing innovation to the masses thus I really was proud of that fact.  Most opportunities for advancement are mainly in one of the hub cities (Dallas, Atlanta or San Ramon)."
bad,"I learned a lot at this job,  The company is not a progressive company in terms of how it treats its people.  The life, work balance is terrible."
bad,"The work environment is very slack. They expect you to work as they throw balls around which creates a high amount of distraction. Also, the training they give you is extremely minimal and seeking help is a challenge.,"
bad,"A typical day included lots of meetings and conference calls."
bad,"Sounded awesome coming into training, based on white glove customer care, sales come second in training. Asking questions and helping customers with issues, while better their relationship with the company. DO NOT BE FOOLED. Day 1 in the store you are expected to sell, sell, and oh yeah SELL. No matter if people need the stuff or not, to hit these quotas, you have to borderline exploit people into some of these products. Shove it down their throat, and if you don't and try to be a decent human being,  you are scolded and disciplined for not doing so. Training is great, but they don't prepare you for this job at all. If you follow training and help customers the way you were taught, it's extremely hard to get the sales, which you then don't get paid, on top of the onslaught of ""Why didn't you's and You have to's"" until eventually, you either need an exit or they make you exit."
bad,"standard 3-level support"
bad,"It was a call center. Opportunities for promotion were almost nonexistent. The pay level was stagnant for years, until a new union contract was finally negotiated. The work was stressful and repetitive but the tools needed to do the job often did not work properly. Computers were slow and applications crashed frequently. "
bad,I have a great work ethic on getting job completed and satisfiying customers needs to their expectations but at AT&T they don't care about any of that. It's all about numbers not customer's needs and EVERYBODY looking out for themselves w/noone helping you at all.
bad,"I provide support for e-mail accounts, such as Outlook, Outlook Express, and AMT Yahoo. I also support customers with home phone and cable services. "
bad,"- Offering solution for customer's daily life with cellular devices and home and business solutions "
bad,Work was very busy talking on the phones all day. Pay was not great at only 9.50 per hour.
bad,Steady pay check and call center environment good training.
bad,"The company is solid, and pays its employees adequately."
bad,As a contractor you have no benefits and no rights like a regular ATT employee. Would not recommend it to anyone who has a family life or going to school.
bad,"I was happy with my compensation; however, I didn't feel the company valued good employees there was a lot of talk among employees regarding this."
bad,"stressful, inbound calls retaining, billing, customer service"
bad,Sold cellular phones and home services. Preformed credit checks for all services. Stocked and cleaned the kiosk daily. Opened and closed register making nightly deposits. Customer service and problem solving on customers accounts. Helped customers figure out the best cellular plan for them and their budget.
bad,Fast advancement due to HIGH turnover. Turnover due to very confusing and low pay. Quality of life was great. No long hours/days
bad,Bad work environment
bad,I understand the difficulty of working within a union environment. Managers and craft are discouraged from having an open door policy.
bad,Job was a quantatative type position with small emphasis on quality. Learned testing and ticket platforms through courtesy of co-workers on the job...Very little organized training.
bad,"You are on the phone all day and are only off three times during the day: two 15 minute breaks and lunch. You have to deal with customers and the way the talk to you. You are expected to sell products/services on EVERY call, even if the customer initially called in to remove services. There is no opportunity for advancement within the company unless you are willing to move across the country."
bad,"The job started off great. I learned more about muti-tasking than ever before. As a finance rep they allow anyone to inturrupt your job flow incessently, until well everyone else is taken care of. In this position you are to make executive decisions, due to the fact the managers do not want to effectively make any decisions that are not absolutely necessary. Co-workers talk badly about eachother everyday, and bring the rumor-mill into your office multiple times a day. The pay and benefits make everything worth it to an extent. Everyone is out for themselves, so beware of even your closest, seemingly friends. If I could do it over again, I'm not sure I would choose to work for this company. Due to the fact, that upon my dismissal process, because I was highly upset about loosing my job, my managers worded things just right, so as to look like I volunteerily quit, when prompted by the unemployment services. They then changed their statement to say I was fired due to disaplinary action, which is true. I just wordered why they tried to say I quit, when that clearly was not the case. I liked the freedom of my job, but I was sadly let down when it came to Management. I feel like that they played favorites. Unfortunately, I did loose my job due to disaplinary action. I was late on multiple occasions. I feel like they kept me until their audit was complete and inventory counts looked good, and then that very week, I was late one final time after 3 written warnings, and they cut me loose, and caused me to not receive unemployment benefits."
bad,After working for AT&T for 6 1/2 years I was fired for 2 unexcused absences in a 12 month period. The attendance policy within the call centers are a joke! The performance reviews are also ridiculous. They are not caring when it comes to missing work and will not take doctors notes. I had FMLA and felt like I was being punished when I used my FMLA. The only good thing about this company was benefits and the pay.
bad,"The job looks and sounds real good to the naked eye, but reconsider if you can. If you have no other choice, good luck."
bad,I was under the impression that I would be a customer service representative. As it turned out I was put in a position of hard sales.
bad,The typical day at work would be a high call volume day!!
bad,Changes in the past few years of way they treat employees caused me to resign after 11 years. If it is a core contract job they are offering jump on it cause that part of the company is still bearable and pays well but stay away from uverse.
bad,"My typical day at AT&T as retail sales manager is to manage and train sales representatives to make most of their sales by solution selling. Provide customer service to every customer entering store. Scheduling, training, coaching, observing sales representatives to promote and sale AT&T home and wireless products and services. Running retail store by receiving inventories and perform inventory management to provide optimal balance for store sales. Foresees sales trends and keep up inventory level. Perform cash management for every day retail store functions. My management supports by great corporations with mature corporate structure. My co-workers are all hard working individual which opportunities of advancement are unlimited. The hardest part of the job will be tough in work life balance. My most enjoyable part of the job is to provide great customer service and my ability to maintain a loyal happy customer based."
bad,Worked there for 12 years as a Service Tech. Bellsouth was an awesome place to work. Now that at&t has taken over the company is going down hill FAST! While the pay and benefits are very good that is about it. Customer service is horrible. In the past few years this Premise Technician title has come and none of the Service Techs that are let go or retire are replaced. I see in the future that they will be replaced by the Premise Technicians who are payed far less and have next to no benefits and think that they one day will have a chance to advance to a Service Tech position which top out at about $30 an hour. Very sad to see what used to be a good company to work for fall so far. Management is driven by a #'s system and not customer service. If you are considering a premise tech job as a foot in the door with room for advancement. FORGET IT!
bad,You go through 4 weeks of classroom training where you HONESTLY do not get the training that you need to perform this job. They throw you on the floor with insufficient training and then scold you when something goes wrong.
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of receiving calls from customers regarding there accounts, selling them new services, trouble shooting problems."
bad,Great teamwork overall. Work to pay ratio has much room for improvement. The hardest part of the job was the physical toll and six day work schedule. Good sense of accomplishment and pride at work.
bad,"I began working here in April , and in the beginning everything was good, and now it seems like its going downfall. I learned to not settle for less , I know what I""m worth. My manager and co-workers are great , however the work environment isn't stable nor is the pay. I enjoyed having night atmosphere , and the hardest part was trying to get people to sign up with Direct Tv."
bad,"Working at AT&T has been a difficult and frustrating experience. The job itself is fine and I can almost say I enjoyed it because I like to help people. However managment is lazy and does NOT understand the job. Dispatchers are not able to go to managers for assistance, we have to go to eachother for help because the managers were NOT trained properly and almost never have any contact with the customers. They micro manage their employees so much to the point where we have to ASK to use the restroom. I am to the point where I would even take a drastic pay cut just to get out of this environment. I'm tired of taking my bad attitude about work, home with me."
bad,My day would consist of answering calls from customers who either wanted new service or had questions on existing service. Learned how to have great sales skills. hardest part of the job was the high pressure of making sales.
bad,A typical work day in Network Operations is sitting on 5-10 conference calls per day dealing with issues and receiving additional items to work on from management. Not a challenging or fulfilling environment to work in if you are young and eager and want to explore other options. Very hard to advance within the company as well.
bad,non stop call taking average from 50 to 60 per day with no break in between until your scheduled breaks and lunch. Attendance above everything! cant be 100th of a second late or you will be placed on a action plan which ultimately ends in termination. Management provides no recognition for all the hard work you do. I enjoy the people I work with and some of the customers are genuinely nice.
bad,On a high volume day you can earn a lot of money making a lot of sales and if it was a low volume day it also gave you to the opportunity to learn more about products and services rendered.
bad,"This is not a good place to work as a technician. The company goes to great lengths to treat its employees poorly enough that they can turn over employees. This keeps costs down as the longer you work there the more you get paid. They are reliable, Your check is never late. You will work more than you want; you will end up hating the company you work for."
bad,"This is a revolving door style company. They are always hiring and always firing. They churn out a new training class every few months, and the vast majority burn out and quit or are fired within a year.Instead of making genuine improvements to their customer service, they keep adding more ""empathy statements"" to their script."
bad,call center with 400 or so employees heloing customers repair and learningn them to surf the internet via phone
bad,"I am not a ""salesperson"" so keep that in consideration when reading this review. The environment at AT&T in their Sales department is very uncomfortable and intense. The expectations are lofty even during a time when their product has become antiquated and unappreciated. This combination creates a high turnover and unpleasant atmosphere on a day to day basis."
bad,"The company is recognized as diverse, top company for diversity by Diversity Inc."
bad,It's close to impossible to make a living with the new commissions scale and the base is similar to what you'd make flipping burgers.
bad,"You'll be paid well, but don't expect to be able to exist outside of work. Company will talk about how much profit they are making over the past year, but instead of hiring more people to assist with the continued growth, they claim they don't have money and just implement mandatory overtime for the foreseeable future"
bad,Managers push so much to do what they want you to do to do the goals but if you're doing excellent work in other areas they don't care. You have to lie to customers to get what they want you to do.
bad,Not much room for advancement if you're a black male in the South Florida market.  They have cliques and if you are not accepted you don't have much chance of being promoted.
bad,"They may be union but there is no job security. You never know when they are going to tell you what they told you to do isn't good enough and write you up. You constantly worry that they will nit pick at something to write you up. They can't make up their minds and everytime you turn around they will tell you ""oh remember what we said yesterday? Well forget that and do this instead."" This company jokes that att stands for at this time but it is 100% accurate. The customers scream at you and the company doesn't care that you are getting abused and tell you to handle it and still try to sell them things and ask them questions about what they do in their life so you can find a product that would work for them."
bad,"You are a cog in the wheel, management will replace you without a second thought.  Make sure you like your potential manager as they will make it a good job or a terrible experience."
bad,"mico managing , high sales quota, work every other Saturday. I'm not sure how the job is now but when I was there it was horrible environment and almost the whole call center was out on benefits"
bad,"I was paid well and Training staff was amazing... (NotDtv training)..."
bad,"AT&T was a good place to work.  The one fault I observed is that they have few women and minorities in upper management.  They expect a great deal of time and effort, but pay well."
bad,"Very pushy sales to an unrealistic point. almost makes people feel as if they have to force or scam the customer just to feel good or to keep their job. Once your in management they own and abuse it, will put all the pressure and stress on you while having you stop what your doing for what they want or need done then blame you for not getting your priorities done, constantly threaten to issue write ups for not hitting sales, upper leadership leaves you high and dry when in need, they aren't realistic on what actually goes on in retail, its very politcal and a lot of under the table retaliation."
bad,"Unlike in the past where your physical location does not matter, nearly all technical jobs are now only in one of seven ""collaboration zones"" around the country.   "
bad,"You have to make this job about you, and not the rules the try to saturate their markets in.  If you focus on making money 24/7 without any drawbacks, it’s perfect."
bad,Toomany managers with differing nd conflicting information and criticism. Too many metrics to meet and implossble goals. Union was not helpful and no one communicating about needs.
bad,Management is pressuring too much on sales rep. They will try helping you to lie so you can close a sale. Too much micro managing.  They treat top salesman and bottom performers the same and sometimes they loom at them as idiot. I work previously in a flag ship store and all the employee quit. They promoted people based in friends even they don't perform well. Its a mess up place.
bad,AT&T could be a really good job if it wasn't for middle and upper management. The job is stressful enough but someone new comes to power every 6 months and decides to change everything which ends up adding more work to the employees and other people being Surplussed aka laid off. Shareholder profits are number one. Employees and customers are at the bottom of the list.
bad,Their main focus is how well you can sell Direct TV. It's an inferior product and they will force you to hit a goal of 3-4 a month. They don't care how many cellular devices you can get out there or how well you understand their technology. That doesn't matter. All that matters is you get Directv into your customers hands. It's why I had to quit.
bad,"I started with DirecTV which i loved. After AT&T bought them out, however, the morale took a serious dip. Raises were halted, stopped hiring, and job security was non existent. Could tell that directv believed ""if you take care of employees, they will take care of the customers"". But AT&T did nothing except cut costs by opening over seas call centers, and used its employees as a human sheild against all the customers upset over missing channels or hiked up prices. AT&T is definitely a company who cares more about their bottom line than they are about customer or employee happiness."
bad,It was a very diverse position so my days passed quickly. There is absolutely no job security here as they now out-source most positions to save money as of 2016.
bad,"Work, life balance is stated to be important but is far from reality. Days off can be taken away with 12 hours notice. and the hours worked are far to much for anyone that wants to maintain a relationship with friends, family or anything of substance."
bad,The CRM software is terrible and takes a great amount of your time when you could otherwise be selling. Inbound escalated calls from existing and new customers often misrouted. Every action you take is analyzed. When you make a sale the stress begins as they will nitpick your call and expect a perfect survey from the customer. These are customers that have been transferred 5-6 times or have been online etc.
bad,at one point this was a good company to work. that time has passed and is never coming back. At&t wants to become a streaming only company eliminating thousand of jobs
bad,I wasn't happy with my time at AT&T.  I felt like the rules changed too frequently.  We were only given limited time to help our customers.  I don't feel like we were given all of the tools to be successful. I worked there for almost 3 years and I was told by members of management on a routine basis that my schedule would be more routine with the more seniority I got.  The last straw for me was when I was scheduled to work 1 pm to 10 pm for an entire month after I had been there for 3 years.  That was not the schedule I had bid on.  No one would help me resolve it even though they had for other people.  I had to resign because I had school aged children.
bad,"The Union sales positions at AT&T are well-compensated and they are very diverse in their hiring practices. However, AT&T has been engaging in a multi-year union busting campaign so I do not predict those jobs will exist for much longer."
bad,"I wished I had never worked there, caused more stress than any other job. Also was promised I could work on accounts in my book of business, yeah , that didn't happen. Employees were nice, management slippery"
bad,"I enjoy meeting new people and being able to share my skills while helping perform a skilled duty. "
bad,"There were nice people working at AT&T, and there were ping pong tables, nice facilities. There was a constant churn in the management that caused a lack of continuity. The IT job that I had was more of a sales job where I was supposed to spend time recruiting customers rather than learning to support the system."
bad,"I worked at AT&T over 35 years. At the beginning, AT&T was like family. Very relaxed and informal. Everyone knew each other. Formal education was nice, but not required as AT&T sent you to schools to learn what you needed to know. After divestiture, AT&T changed drastically. Management became totally engrossed with the bottom line. Employees were no longer people, but numbers on a spreadsheet. Layoffs became, and remain, rampant. Senior leadership often has a poor vision of the wants and needs of the average customer. AT&T is more inclined to tell you what you're going to get as opposed to asking what you want. "
bad,I wasn’t a fan of working there. My supervisor would get mad when I would ask for help and would constantly ignore any request I had. I kept my cool because the job. Is easy but my supervisor made it hard
bad,DIrectv was great until AT&T bought the company. pay cuts followed along with a culture of fear and micro management. We were treated as disposable robots. The benefits were good though.
bad,"The actual job is miserable.  There is constant pressure to meet numbers and the customers can be downright awful.  If you are the type of person that does not like conflict and confrontation, this job is not for you.  I truly hated knowing I had to go back after each shift. "
bad,It was ran poorly. The culture wasn't great at all. I learned different sales techniques. The most enjoyable part of the job was the bonuses and the opportunity to receive a higher commission check.
bad,They will make everything sound so great in your interview but its not anything like they tell you schedule changes all the time you can make very good money and it can be a fun environment and also if anything personal happens you will be wrote up immediately no if and and buts about it.Also AT&T changes thing every other day
bad,"4 days. That’s how many sick days you can have before you’re taking a written warning. IN A YEAR. 6 is a promotion to customer. That includes not only your sick days, your kids sick days, daycare ladies sick days. Their kids sick days."
bad,If you don’t have a family or friends this is a great job for you. You work long hours and can get paid well and the good thing is you are never off to spend the money. Forced OT from management and sometimes working 6 days a week at 12+ hour shifts. Union job so benefits are decent and they protect you from management harassing you. Very cut throat job when it comes to tech to manager relationship. Everybody is always out to get each other. Techs you work with can be great guys. I was lucky to work with 15 guys that I really got along with and keep in contact with to this day. The company will surplus anybody so be carful and do your research. I left because I couldn’t see my wife and kids(most of the time I had to call my kids and tell them goodnight over the phone).
bad,"Love my job and my teammates. Not happy with layoffs hanging over your head ever 4 months.  Now if you are corporate/national you are assigned a collaborations zone which can be 100's of miles from your house.  Yes this is happening to me.  I thought we were a communications company?  Oh well. Non management tech teams are great, at least everyone I have worked with. Not a fan of what upper management is about."
bad,"Management can be a bit difficult and have unrealistic expectations. They also choose when they want to follow company policies and they break it in order to generate ghost sales that will cancel in a matter of days , they will pressure the customer into products that they don't need at the cost of customers experience.BIG warning if you have any medical issues, they don't care if have doctor note that says you had to visit them, unless you are literally dying they do not care. You have to be willing to let go of your social and school life they will work you till you quit, the reason I'm still here it's because of the pay otherwise I would leave."
bad,"However, you will work long hours and be expected to do work beyond what is described. They don't tell you that you have to shake every customers hand and open the door for them. They don't tell you about using 5 key behaviors and having to demo (broken demos) on repeat customers as manager observes the conversation. Management has a gossip culture and promote their favorites regardless of performance."
bad,"I was unfairly fired from this company,which is really sad,because I loved working for them. I missed two days(one during training)and the other because I was sick due to being pregnant with high blood pressure and migraines. I made my hours up for the second time I missed,my points were taken off my attendance. As soon as we switched managers,my points mysteriously appeared back on my attendance. I spoke with my manager at the time about it,he said he would handle it(he did not)They have a union that don't do anything for you. Before I made up my hours I specifically spoke with someone from the union about this matter,because I did not want to be fired,he insisted that if I did not have a lot of absences or being late that he would fight for me. Well that was a lie,the same person that told me that was the same person who said NOTHING when I was being fired,was even asked if he had anything to say and he said NO. After being let go,I applied for unemployment,well of course they have to reach out to the job,well AT&T failed me again because they lied. They told unemployment two DIFFERENT stories,but unemployment was to stupid to see it. So all in all,I was fired from AT&T,evicted from place(that i just moved into)and denied unemployment all due to unfairly being fired and lies from AT&T."
bad,"Many companies grow and become less efficient as they do, but AT&T has made this into an art form.  They keep spending billions to buy other companies and then enforce draconian cost cutting measures on the front line and first through third level management. No server requires this many teams to manage them: an OS team, an application team, a hardware team, a network team, a data center team AND a CABLING team (because gosh forbid anyone other than a specialist run a cable in a data center)."
bad,During my time at DirecTV/AT&T I enjoyed my co-workers and the friendships I made but overall my health suffered while I was employed there which led me to find other employment
bad,Company structure is poor. Constantly had to apologize to customers for bad equipment.  Never knew when the company was going to let us go.  Horrible reward system that got worse as the years went on. Making them more unobtainable.
bad,"Pay and benes are just good enough to keep people hanging around.  Unless you are minority or female, do not expect to advance your career.  Nothing against either group, but HR is just overcompensating for reverse hiring habits of 100+ years.  It is what it is.  Get ANY communication you have with HR in writing."
bad,The job has become a stepping stone due to lack of advancement and don't use employee experience to the best of their ability. Unlikely the job you will retire from and like many jobs in Florida there is a high turnover rate of employees. Many managers lack the experience and knowledge of the job itself.
bad,"The money is phenomenal, but there is no job security and the unionized structure takes a toll on your family. The management differed from store to store so there was no clear direction"
bad,"Although I enjoyed my time with AT&T I was laid off, not because of my work, but because of where I lived. They do have good benefits and working conditions."
bad,"With over 300k employees, working for AT&T is probably closest to working for the government or a large university system.  There are many conflicting processes and procedures, and it is often difficult to get anything done.  Decisions require many layers of approval.  Human resources is done by numbers and financial targets, removing the ""human"" touch from the equation.  Layoffs have happened quarterly for the last few years.  The company is struggling to redefine itself as a media company, but it is hard to turn a giant ship.  Working remotely used to be encouraged, but the tide has turned, and is now discouraged.  Employees are required to be in the office, and those not close to core office locations have been laid off.  Healthcare is not subsidized as much as it should be for such a large company with bulk bargaining power."
bad,This company overall has a terrible culture. A churn and burn mentality. The sad thing is there are a lot of very good people who pass through the halls. The smart ones move on quickly.
bad,"I started with the intent to pursue a career, was advancing quickly within the company then hit a brick wall. ATT is disguised as a great company to work force ultimately you are just a metric for their enterprise. They operate as if you have no life, kids, spouse outside of work, 9+ hour work days, last minute mandatory overtime WEEKLY. They have a “point system” for attendance which is extremely unforgiving, not to mention their pathetic 4 minute grace period. The shifts are terrible, you have to bid for a shift which will last 6 months, allegedly based upon seniority but it isn’t, they don’t even accommodate or try to work with you for your personal needs. Either “accept the shift or you can leave.” The turnover rate is at 75%. Not enough pay for the intense call volume, complex systems you have to work, and the metrics that are unrealistic."
bad,"They paid less than what was promised, a lot of promises were not kept, horrible leadership skills as well as management. However this is just for the mobility side of AT&T"
bad,AT&T makes terrible business decisions and then reduces headcount in the lower levels to make up for its senior executives poor planning. I see no room for career advancement here.
bad,At&t always shifting focus. One week its selling directv one week internet. And if those don't perform they will buy out a competitor. then they will hire competitors employees and phase out its own. No loyalty. Customer service and taking care of current customers is non existent. They only worried about new customers.
bad,"Prepare to be treated like garbage by almost every customer who you interact with. They don't see you as a human being, rather an extension of a giant, greedy company."
bad,do not care about your life outside of AT&T. they don't help much when your on the floor handling calls. the job is not for single parents. the pay is good.
bad,They're a bunch of snakes. They make you force AT&T's services down people's throat. They change people's accounts to make the bill go up every month so that they get paid more.
bad,I worked for this company for 4 years and had 4 different management teams during this time. The last management team targeted me and harassed me and other employees and because I did not just sit back and take it I was fired after giving so much time and energy to this company who had no regard for the hostile work environment we were made to endure under this management. This manager was later fired for stealing company property.
bad,I worked there and loved it unfortunately I was 3rd party so I wasn’t corporate it was sol com Midwest and it was only commission which is okay if the installers would actually show up I had more people cancel and lost a lot of sales that were closed just because of the installers wouldn’t show up to the appointment and then It would effect my pay also take more time out of my day to try and re close a customer just because of other 3rd party companies not doing there job
bad,Great pay. Management did not manage. Work is being outsourced. No job security. All departments are downsizing or being eliminated and the work being sent overseas.
bad,"AT&T U-verse did not pay much, but they expected a lot! They did not care what you had going on in life. You were just another number. I do not recommend working for this company."
bad,"It was a great job when I started, but when AT&T joined with DirectTV it became more about selling, not the customers needs. Agents would lie to customers to up sell them for their quota and then by the time the customer realized the scam, they'd call into the call center and of course the original agent who lied could not be tracked down. Then the customer yells at you because AT&T swindled them."
bad,"Worked extremely hard at trying to get ahead of the layoffs, by taking extra training, volunteering etc.  Then they lay me off, and I have more experience and training than most everyone on the team.  That was because one supervisor out of 15 that I have had over my career didn't like me.  It's amazing how one person can ruin your career.  At&T is always laying off people.  I dreaded it every time and I survived countless numbers of them, but the last one got me.  I only hope that all that extra education and training I did will help me land somewhere."
bad,"Worked average of 10 to 12 hours a day, 6 days a week. No holidays off.  Never able to plan anything because you never know your schedule until the start of the day."
bad,"Daily changing environment becoming more managed by numbers instead of people.  In earlier years the Bell System embraced their employees, developed them and loyalty was a 2 way street."
bad,"Management became very micro-managing, very short staffed and long hours. Was part time and worked 40-50 hours a week. Pay was good though and you get alot of paid time off."
bad,"Super stressful, and no down time. The angry customers should be the worst part of the job, but the managers are worse. There was no work/life balance. For 6 years I worked 6 days a week from open to close, and the expectation is perfection every day all day."
bad,I loved my job and people I worked with but as a company it was stressful because they stress customer service but its really not about the customer its more about the number.
bad,"I learned a lot about the cell phone industry, but further into the job i got the more drama started on the sales floor between the associates. When Management would come in you could tell they would play favorites with people on the floor."
bad,"Lots of nepotism and weak union, no managerial support. Good training but favoritism and hostile work environment. Reporting violations makes the worker the bullied."
bad,"Great for a single person not worried about great work life balance, it is a great stepping stone and even potential if your willing to relocate. The problem is outside of retail there is little room to move in."
bad,"AT&T is a good place to work, you make good money with good benefits. If you are looking for a career, it isn't easy to move throughout the company and there is a lot of micromanagement. Working any of their retail positions leaves very little room for family time, management doesn't have much of a work/life balance. AT&T Reps are union which is a good thing, but also bad because the union doesn't do much for the reps but will tell reps incorrect things to fight management."
bad,AT&T is a company of companies. Your experience will almost exclusively depend on who you end up working for and their relationship with the company. The corporate culture will swing from team to team and from office to office.
bad,They do not care about your safety and not do they care about quality always stressing the employee on daily metrics rather than completing the installs or repairs no set hours to end shift you can end shift late at night depending on when your done that's when you get to go home on approval.
bad,"I did not like the fact that there was a fight for commission and some people would steal each others sales. Hard to play nice at a job like this. Lots of competition, which was ok but if someone makes more money than others, it was not a good day. If you thrive on sales, do it. If not, do not waste your time."
bad,"My job functions have been diverse.  Most recently the job has changed into ""work faster, do more with less support, quantity over quality"".  This work location will be eliminated over time due to downsizing."
bad,"I made good money and it was fine because I was single and had no other obligations. However, the hours are long and hard, the atmosphere is competitive, and management is only concerned about the numbers not the person."
bad,"AT&T used to be a fun, challenging place to work. It got more difficult as the quotas kept being raised, and union grievances became more the norm. Leadership in our office was miserable, and we (the managers in Reynoldsburg, Ohio) were fearful of being put on a performance plan as our teams carried quota."
bad,"I worked at a call center for ATT for 10 years. It was much like working at a high school. It depended on who you had as a manager weather the work environment was enjoyable. When I first started the management team was poised, goal oriented, and fun. Over the years it declined."
bad,working for this company was great. it introduced me to many sales ideas and pitches. I learned a lot and hope they continue to do well on their journey of selling products.
bad,"The company does not care about its employees. You are just a number . First level supervisors are great. The company is not customer oriented, it just cares about your numbers which can be manipulated. The better the numbers are the larger the bonus for management ."
bad,I worked for AT&T for 10 years.  At first it was a great place but as the CEO changed and Direct TV became number one objective. The management style changed from helpful to literally where they would stalk you around the store and listen to every word you say.  It became so bad that it gave me panic and anxiety attacks.  This place broke me.  I do not recommend working for this company.  Your health and work place happiness is not priority. Only thing that matters is Directv.
bad,Very sales driven once it became At&t. Would rather pay to outsource work out of country and have poor quality & constant errors that keep their US based emloyees happy.
bad,These guys pay next to nothing and it takes years to grow salary. Opportunities to advance are few and far between. They do have good training and field support.
bad,Att as a company is a great organization to work for very eye opening. But the workplace caused a stressful environment starting from the area mangers to floor managers.
bad,"I liked working for AT & T, but I left them to go work for a better company that had better opportunities for advancement and better benefits that I did not get."
bad,Company only focused on what is good for company.  They were not interested in my concerns for my future. Growth within the company was almost non-existent
bad,"You will be left wondering if any of the leadership have ever taken an MBA class or read/internalized a management book not recommended/written internally.  Process and controls stifle everything.  140 years of quarterly history with people building process after process onto the process to justify their job during the inevitable slow periods has resulted in a rigid culture that can't get out of it's own way.  Thousand's of employees sitting idle not working on projects because they are on hold or not currently funded...um, we are all getting paid anyway?  Common sense seems to be lacking on basic initiatives.  Many of the areas they trip up from a leadership perspective were concepts that were encountered and solved in the 20's-70's of American Culture.  There is little learning from past mistakes.  Everyone has to justify their position and title with an 'empire' of people.  It doesn't matter if you have work for them to accomplish, you simply need the headcount to hopefully make it through the multiple 'surplus activities' per year (these are the grueling 60 day long firings).  No one gets promoted or advanced as there are 10's of thousands of people just waiting for something to open up."
bad,same answer was just another job. company never tried to make you feel like it would be more. I don't recommend to someone who is looking for a career
bad,"There is plenty of corporate greed. There has been a recent trend of the company finding reasons to get rid of their more expensive, longer tenured full-time employees in favor of replacing them with cheaper part-time employees."
bad,I am not interested in staying any longer. I am not going to say a bunch of bad things about this company to sway someone else's opinion. Everyone has their own experience. It is just time to move on.
bad,They trained us for 5 weeks yet when we got into nesting (on the floor training) a lot of what they trained us on didnt apply to what were doing on the floor. The things that were being taught in the classrooms were either outdated or not how things were done on the floor. Not very good at personally training newer employees when they finally made it to the floor. Often times you feel helpless because the CSL's were overworked so they cant get everybody in a timely manner. Worked with outdated software and tools that AT&T had no plans on updating. Very frustrating job to work.
bad,"Was my first job out of college and not the best fit for me. Very rigid, corporate environment. Wasn't much room for mistakes and strict hours and limited time off."
bad,While the work can be challenging sometime the home or business you go into not only are DIRTY but extremely not safe. Some places they send us not even cops will go! Some day s will be good then the next not so much...
bad,you will not like the management there. they are trained to watch every move you make and every breath you take. although the job itself was rewarding with satisfied customers.
bad,"They try to balance out the negative aspects with a ""fun environment"" but it falls short as it feels forced."
bad,Things are changing and they are letting go of Experienced Talent.  The company is changing from a phone company to an entertainment company. Looking to acquire Time Warner
bad,Ok company to work for.  Mandatory overtime and a very strict policy with regard to scheduling.  Must meet goals and multi-tasking ability.  Attend daily huddles and continuous training.  Learned SAP and acquired call center experience.
bad,The best part of the job was working outdoors and the independence of solo field work. The compensation was also outstanding except the health benefits are constantly renegotiated and have gone downhill. The management however is almost completely intolerable. The first level is generally easy to get along with but past that they are almost inhuman. Seemed like they thrived on making the technicians as miserable as possible. They invest so much in each employee only to  at every turn be trying to drive you to leave or trying to find a reason to fire you. Very stressful and even with the pay Im not sure if i would say it was worth it
bad,"The job has perks to it such as big discounts on your cell phone bill, however upper management plays favorites and you can't always get anything resolved that needs to be"
bad,"I started with high hopes but quickly realized a person with horrible ethics, management skills, and just flat out abusive is lightly reprimanded and nothing to actually fix those issues will take place. "
bad,"So much red tape to get anything done. Slow office culture; for a company that prides itself as a leading technology company, the culture doesn't reflect it at all."
bad,"The company has a drive to automate or make the support role as simple as possible, which i have no problem with. but in this case the almost cult like dedication to following a script leads to hold in the support were the customer does not get the problem fixed. hiring less tech understanding people leads to ineffective trouble shooting. and if you go off script, even if you fix the problem. you will be fired."
bad,"Didn't always have a supervisor when working at one job with AT&T. He was new and out most of time for medical reasons. I was suppose to have on job training. That didn't happen the way suppose to. I was trained by a new technician. .I was put on hold often by phone reps.,and when i did have supervisor would call all time asking why taking so long on job, for things out of your control"
bad,AT&T pays well with good benefits but it is mostly a high stress environment you will work in and you will have to deal with some bad managers who have been with the company for a long time who don't want to retire.
bad,"I was fortune to have an understanding manager, but experienced techs did not feel the need to help newer employees. The training did not prepare a new worker for the job at hand."
bad,"You'd get calls coming to your queue automatically and the 1st 2 to 3 minutes of the call involved account maintenance. There were some times that the call pressed ""0"" to get an agent and they were sent to the work department. The main part of the job was to probe the customer to discover what the issue was and select the closest path within a script that would best suit the customer. "
bad,Local management is very poor and the ability to move up is based on where you are with AT&T. People in small markets have no chance of moving up without relocating.
bad,Pros. Opportunity to work on cutting edge technologies. Support for women in technical leadership roles. Pride in diversity & inclusion with 12 Employee Resource Groups with 40k+ members.
bad,"As time goes on AT&T was too demanding and paying less.  Workforce is in contraction even if workload isn't.  Blah Blah Blah, nothing more to say.  Some good friends I left behind."
bad,I used to really enjoy working for DTV. There were goals to work towards and I was moving quickly up the ladder. All that stopped once the merger with Att went through. I was demoted back to retention after working hard and getting promoted. It has become a go no where job with no room to grow. The pay is decent. I will give them that.
bad,"At AT&T, I worked one and half years in sales.  I learned how competitive and cut throat the field can be! While there I lost my dad which affected my sales quota and was told that I need to get it together quickly or I would loose my job.  At that moment I felt this job  was not for me."
bad,"Tough place of employment, compensation is above average for location. Sales goals are unrealistic and demanding, managers hover over you as if you are incompetent. Meetings are basically bash sessions on how you could have done better"
bad,Pay was good with room to grow. The process in which the company is managed and ran is horrible. Easy to learn and get the hang of. People are more than willing to help you succeed! In certain areas at least.
bad,I worked in the sales department. In my role I had to sale new service. It wasn't the job for me at all. I didn't like being cursed out at 8am every morning.
bad,"El sueldo era basado en comisiones, lo que se conoce o conocen algunos como Cambaceo, a pesar de que era gratuita la Portabilidad, o la Linea nueva a un precio muy accesible no eran muy solicitadas, por lo que el ""sueldo"" no era algo atractivo"
bad,"AT&T is a good place to learn inside and outside sales skills. They provide excellent training and really invest in the development of their people. They even paid for my graduate degree. Unfortunately, there is so much competition among sales people and sales quotas are so rigid that there were many questionable sales strategies encouraged and used. I left the company for several reasons, but a leading cause was that I did not feel that I was able to be ethical and still compete with my colleagues."
bad,They paid well but if you did not hit your numbers in two months you were gone.  Upper management didn't do a lot to help get involved and try to help your team succeed.
bad,"First six months are solid, training very good, when you hit that 6 month mark the honey moon is over, all about the numbers after that, the problem is the infrastructure is butchered up so bad there is no way the company can deliver the speeds promised. Company didn't need to purchase DTV, instead should have invested in rebuilding their network with 100% fiber."
bad,"Culture was ok, job was direct and to the point.had a open door policy management was short tempered at times, I have to remind my self I come to work to do my job, and stay with a positive"
bad,"This is a call center, so you are on the phone long hours with customers. The programs are easy to use if you pay attention to the modules in training, but they are ever changing so you need to read the updates. This isn't a career, just a transitional job"
bad,I worked in collections.  I think this is the most stressful job in the company.  We have to deal with customer yelling and berating you.  You just have to sit there and take it.  A lot of the direct supervisors are great while others are out to make themselves look good.  Having to take as many calls as you can in one day.  I would average 100 calls a day.
bad,Very stressful. Company wanted the highest productivity but lacked all resources. Everything is based on increasing the stock price. There is no consideration to you as an individual or your famiily life.
bad,Very Stressful that is very difficult to advance. AT&T no longer seems to value the knowledge and expertise of their senior employees. It is said they wish for new labor every eight years.
bad,"Management could use some training, most did not know how to do the job, overall a decent company to work for but just like every other place, can definitely use some help when it came to employee treatment from managers"
bad,Many layoffs and outsourcing over the last 10 years. Few Tech jobs remain at AT&T within the area I worked. Many jobs have been outsourced to consulting companies.
bad,"Att Mobility when I started 10 years ago was a great.   company to work for.  It was customer service and taking care of the customers.  But now it has turned into a Sales center first then customer service.  You are on daily and monthly quotas.  If you do not make quotas in sales it starts a discipline process up to termination.  I feel that the customer issues need to come first.  I do not feel that you need to shove products down customers throats if they are not interested in them or can not afford them.  But this is was this facility has turned into.  Does not feel like a comfortable work place any longer.  It is very stressful.  I was originally hired  for customer service then forced into sales.  "
bad,"Simply just a temporary job, wasn't a particularly fun work environment.. Mostly middle aged adults I was the only teen. Hardest part was when customers would try to argue with you if you didn't have all the answers."
bad,"If you work in the ""Sales Department"" it is very stressful. You have quotas you need to meet each week/month. You have to be continuously watch your sales and keep track of them because some of the employees/sales agents will cancel your order (work) and then place a new order so that they will get credit and you don't and therefore you don't make your quota and management doesn't care to hear about it and doesn't do anything to correct that environment."
bad,The compensation structure is constantly changing. They require a ton out of you. You will work a lot of hours and nights and weekends. They are constantly on you to try and sell all sorts of things to customers.
bad,"Value Building"
bad,"To work in this job, you have to be willing to be micromanaged.  Constant pressure to increase productivity.  Need to follow upper management decisions without your own input."
bad,Great place to work if you're dishonest and lacking a moral compass. There is an unlimited amount of commission to be made but you typically have to lie to the clients to make the offer stick.
bad,"Besides being basically your own boss during the day, the company sucks to work for.  Management sucks and is unprofessional, always looking for something to write you up on. Moral is obsolete."
bad,The company doesn't care about it's employees. They are so big that they have no idea what their technicians or their field employees do.  The benefits are good but that is the only thing.
bad,Door to door long hot hrs sometimes no pay their is no benefits to the job pearly commission lots of wear and tear on your car work in all of the weather conditions
bad,"Overall, be ready to not have a work life balance upon working for AT&T. At least in NorCal, no area will work with your schedule which is solely based on seniority. Any vacation you may want will have to be input in the system at least a month and a half before its time, otherwise you'll most likely not have the day(s) off."
bad,It's not a bad job to get some experience in for the Industry. It's difficult to have any life when you are forced to work mid shifts and have no time off on the weekends to do anything with family. You are forced to work hours you don't want due to the Union making everything tenure based and performance has no role in determining your schedule..
bad,"The pay was amazing, however they do not work with you regarding sick days. They do not take sick notes, nor do they do makeup days. People have children, & you never know when you may up & get sick. You can never be prepared for these things."
bad,Its a good paying job but the stress level is to high. Management does not care enough  about there employees. The call center has changed a lot over many years and upper management Ignore has a huge disconnect from the lower employees
bad,"I didn't enjoy my time there.  They pay well but as a sales person your job is always threatened.  I would not recommend going into sales at AT&T, possibly customer service."
bad,It's a good company but the management is horrible they hire people to be managers with no manager skills and most of them don't know how to treat there employees. Att has good benefits but they push you to sell products that contradict another product they are selling.
bad,"AT&T is a strong company in the industry. Do to it being part of the Union there is a series issue with what is best of the employee's. The union leadership makes decisions based on their needs, not of the union members,"
bad,I was employed for 8 months and AT&T's upper management decided to lay off 50% of the sales force. Unfortunately I got affected by it and was out of work.
bad,"This job is very stable. Benefits are great, compensation is good. Leadership is poor, and the culture is toxic. There is no accountability. Activity and politics are more important than results."
bad,I fell ill and shown all proof. But company said that my illness was a preventable illness and would not forgive the time I missed.
bad,"I was promised a lot in my interview that changed as soon as I got out of training. Great company, compensation, discounts, etc but the company does not care for the well being of its employees. They have metrics that are very hard to reach if you follow policy. Not worth the stress."
bad,There is a high turnover rate for these positions due to high expectations on sales. It is doable some months but very difficult other months. It depends on how many wired sales you have to make for the month.
bad,A day of work varied from good to horrible.  Management was only happy if they got a bonus for your work. If not they made working terrible.
bad,"The company only has one good thing going for it the benefits package that's it!"
bad,"Get to a customers house and explain the process"
bad,sales enviroment in a industry that is failing yellow pages print product trying to do business online poor working systems that are out dated and managemnt cutting support
bad,Scheduling is all over the place and is based on tenure/performance but changes weekly based on a computer algorithm. Clopening and sometimes working 9 days straight due to the computer not doing a consistent schedule is common. The pay is decent but the management is sparse and poor. No one ever knows whats going on and polices are constantly changed without notice.
bad,"I like this job because of the very little supervision that I dont have"
bad,You really won't have a life outside of this job. Have to work weekends and the management is not great at all. If you think that you will make it to your kids games or anything like that you wont. as well as random times when your kids get sick or anything your not leaving work to go get them or you getting a write up
bad,"It's an every changing environment where one day you're praised for doing one thing then you being punished for doing the same thing.  Lack of a solid direction and your managers interpretation of where you should be focusing can effect you day to day.  Especially with manager shuffle.  One week you're with one person and you understand their ""rules"" the nest month someone new with a new style."
bad,This is a great company to work for in an entry level position. I made very well here but every time they change the commission the employees make less money. They always say you have potential to make more (and while that's technically true...it never actually happens). The management staff do not care if you have record numbers one day if you don't always have record numbers with every customer...you can be let go.
bad,ATT Digital Life is a nice place to work. Co workers are always upbeat and energetic. Managers are always willing to go above and beyond to help new managers get acclimated to their new role within Digital Life. There is no hard part of the job at Digital Life and there is always room to learn and grow.
bad,Had very little culture and management had a very high turn over rate. Training was very poor due to lack of structure and leadership.
bad,There was not a lot of jobs where I am at so I had to suffer here for 9 years. Finally they shipped our jobs overseas. Managers were good but Job/work life was horrible. Sick kid too often would get you suspended. Advancement only went to suck ups (my numbers were good too).
bad,"The call center was a decent way to make a living but overall it wasn't a satisfying work environment.  I did learn a lot about customer service and how to deal with irate customers.  The hardest part of the job was no matter how good of a job you did or how much knowledge you have acquired one bad customer review could ruin your entire month.  The most enjoyable part would be the benefits package, 401k, pension, and ample vacation time.  But overall there isn't any work/life balance leading to complete dissatisfaction."
bad,people get fired and hired very quickly. very sales orientated. no matter if you go above and beyond or if you laze around all day-nothing gets noticed. hard work does not boost you above the rest
bad,This company took over SNET and gutted the management teams. The culture of the job changed over the years turning a career into a job and the morale suffered.
bad,"A typical work day would consist of greeting customers, executing sales, while proving exceptional customer service.  I have learned amazing communications skills from meeting so many different people from around the world that come into the store for temporary service with the company while they are in town. Management can be awesome depending on the person. Same goes for co-workers. The hardest part of the job is work-life balance.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting some amazing people from around the world and cultures."
bad,"too many policy changes, threw more work on you little by little and under the same rate of pay, really disorganized and unprofessional, the systems would crash and freeze frequently on a daily basis."
bad,"Good company, bad management will lead to a distaste for job. however, can offer a future and the benefits are amazing. It's a fast industry that changes monthly, be ready to learn fast."
bad,Great place to work. Not a lot of job security The place lacks in professionalism and ethics.  Management is very confusing with expectations.
bad,"Great team atmosphere, working in a high traffic store taught me a great deal of working successfully under pressure.  Rotating schedule can be tough."
bad,"Was great working their, great benefits, great pay, job security.... untill AT&T got greedy and closed all their call centers in sacramento and many others in CA...."
bad,AT&T is a company that pays you very well but you will work long hours and no time for anything else in your life. It is a high pressure sales environment with high goals.
bad,"Good work atmosphere, poor communication from upper management and senior leadership."
bad,i was a  self contractor their is money to be made. but if you are not self motivated or have trouble being on time and working in a timely matter without sacrificing work quality. then this may be a job for you.
bad,Good place to work. Good pay and benefits . off on weekends in some cases. Managers need to take better care of employees.
bad,"They encouraged and was many benefits of selling, but at times you can seemed as a number. Not being have to take a non paid time off day if you do not have tine really makes it hard for people who have kids."
bad,A typical day at work was mostly soothing people who were mad because a large percentage of the time the numbers they wanted weren't posted in our directory.  That was very hard to learn how to do.  Every part of that job was a constant learning process.
bad,"There are not that many job opportunities unless you know the right person. They offer equal opportunity but that is a lie. I spent 5 years trying to advance in the company and that was with national recognition, top sales numbers and trying to involve myself in the community. Managers who get promoted are the ones that do not know how to manage. They do not hire within the company which makes it that much harder to get promoted. Micro managing. This company is not great at recognizing hard workers. The environment of the company is not great or fun at all. This place was not worth taking my soul"
bad,"Long hours with an open-ended schedule and being constantly threatened with your job make this position attractive only for certain types."
bad,It was a faced paced environment with no room for mistakes. Pressure was always on by management. Over all its a big name company with a bad work ethic.
bad,"A typical day at work was fast paced"
bad,"I met and helped lots of nice families and enjoyed my colleagues, but upper management was always applying great pressure to get more and better numbers so it wasn't a particularly pleasant experience- Money through a good hourly base and commission was good though!"
bad,"This company has poor management. They allow untrained, vindictive low-level managers to thrive. Very argumentative place. Overall very cold atmosphere. Don't seem to care much about employees"
bad,going to to the point: pay is good for the area. monthly bonus  is decent. management stinks. its hard to get ahead unless u are sucking up to them. they expect to much out you and if you take pto or vacation time they will question you. they want you glued to your chair taking calls if you have to go to the bathroom and youre gone for more than 3 minutes you lectured as to why. co-workers are great. the good thing about this place is the diversity. they do give out prizes like free trips and tvs but its always the same people who win the things. if you are looking to make money and just a paycheck this is the place. if you are looking for something long term not the place. directv has a reputation of firing people that has been with the compny for more than 3 years to fire them for no reason. all in all they do pay well. in the first 2 years i got over a $4 pay increase. do your job and you may be able to keep it. benefits are great
bad,"Recognizable company, great benefits, decent work life balance, but no job fulfillment. Unless you want to be someone's makeshift secretary for the rest of your life. Again, this is just my organization and business segment, so I can only speak on that perspective. Others that work in other departments rave about how good the company is to them"
bad,Its a sales position. If you are exteremly awesome at sales you would totally it. Its retail. If you like retail its a great job. Its a normal job. customer facing.
bad,"You get paid well, but its not always worth the stress. Hitting goals is a challenge ,but the real challenge is how to deal with the unnecessary stress."
bad,i did like working for this company the down fall i had was some of the managers that i worked under miss managed the dept and i was very sorry and upset to see my dept surplus and close up. if the dept did not do so i still would be working there and going 17yrs with the company
bad,"Would rather lay you off  than retrain you. Work schedule always changing and not even released until two weeks in advance, making it hard to schedule appointments and forcing you to take more time off from work than necessary."
bad,"i worked there for a year and 2  months becoming top sales man out of 120 people. i can tell you there train of thought ""last weeks numbers dont matter this weeks numbers do"" i can tell you the program is falling. good luck with hitting the sales goal, when i started the entire floor averaged 115 sales a day. Around the time i left the floor as a group struggled to get 50. and that was six months ago. good luck!!!!"
bad,Great pay but the management was very bad and unorganized. They have great health plans and perks to when you do great work for them.
bad,and not the best call center to be at maybe it has changed over the years training is a joke dont really help when on the the floor first call i took over an hour to get done there goes your handle time.
bad,The general managers are always great to work for but the district managers are never nice.
bad,"No work life balance at all. hours are cray money is good, Management does what it can to help but it that it is not a lot."
bad,"Typical day is very busy, if we have heavy storms we may not get a break in the action for the whole shift due to outages in tv services that have to be documented if a provider is down or corrected if it is our equipment. Co-workers are helpful and easy to work with in general. Since I am management and report to an area manager I don't really interface with my management that often and like most big companies when interfacing with upper management I find they are out of touch with reality. Worst part of the job is that since I am management I have a job to do even if it means 8 or more hours with no time to have a bite to eat."
bad,promotions difficult.great benefits. large company. many different departments. can do better hiring from within then paying more to external employees.
bad,...... no  interested in discussing AT&T.... Pay was great I disliked the job
bad,"I love the work I do for AT&T, but I hate the company. Every aspect of each employee's day is dictated by unrealistic grading methods. Emphasize the word ""dictated"". AT&T gives new meaning to the expression, ""being micromanaged""."
bad,"i like it , was a nice work from home job .    I was IRU care customer service rep . certified csp with 6 months of classes , learned the systems there were pretty easy ipick up fast ."
bad,"Call center work as usual. Union is weak. Don't pay the union dues, its not work it. Policies always changing. Decent pay and benefits."
bad,Friendly competitions helped with a good paycheck but the hours were horrible.
bad,Made outbound calls regarding Medical seminars. Booked Doctors for various events.
bad,"Take calls from customers who had questions about their bills or complaints about pricing of their utility bill.   "
bad,"Timing was not on my side. Just when ATT was able to reconstruct the wiring from outside to inside modem the upload connection became 100%. Then our power company had trouble the next day and reported by leaving a doorknob handle note that electricity would be down for about two hours. I lost my job that day, with the possibility to return 6-months later to reapply."
bad,I'm forever grateful to my co-workers. We are more than willing to share the knowledge that we have. If someone doesn't have the answer we can always find the appropriate measures to handle a situation. I embrace teamwork but yet strong enough to be independent within my work. The hardest part of working for the company is inconsistency within management and rules. I enjoyed making my customers happy. I love to resolve a issue. A typical day of work changes daily due to the need of the customer. No call is the same.
bad,I think it's a great job straight out of high school.  They do not believe in promotions at all.
bad,The course had you in a room with different people who would be within your team.
bad,"At this time I do not have a review of the company. "
bad,"A typical day at work is working on the phones with the customers on billing and questions about there service explaining billing. "
bad,Start the day off with gathering in a circle and discussing yesterday's production and what we can do to make the current day a better day. Always would turn on music to customers liking and help our customers. I learned a lot with dealing with people and services that sometimes didn't work in store or outside the store. Learning how to defuse the situation in store and not let it get to corporate office. Handling the issue myself which worked very well. Management was great at times but still did a lot of micro managing. I found myself to do a lot better without a manager breathing on my neck. Allow me to interact with the customer more. That's why my scores were so high. The hardest part of my job was the place being empty. No customers to talk to. There's no reason to complain about a job if you have one right? The best and most satisfying part was seeing customers come through the door with a smile on their face knowing they were going to get the best customer period. That made my day period.
bad,Must be career oriented with focus on work.  Must work when ill with any ion serious illness
bad,"En mi momento fue difícil ya que éramos 3 técnicos en zona de Junín y nos esforzaban al máximo para la producción de la empresa, un mal funcionamientos del jefe de base hace que los técnicos no se sientan cómodos en su puesto, ya que por medios de intimación y obligaciones a realizar la tarea diaria hacia que nos ocurran accidentes por demasiado cansancio y stress como me paso a mi y a varios de mis compañeros."
bad,"It starts off great but don't be in a struggling market with paranoid managers. I was a top 20% rep but ended up being constantly micro-managed because the team and market was underperforming. When you're low in seniority and your team is performing poorly, your Fridays become 7:30 am to 9 pm days. The customers aren't the problem but managers are. I wouldn't work for them ever again even if they gave me a 30% raise."
bad,This particular department compacted an eight week training into a four week training and covered a lot of material that we wouldn't use much on the call center floor. Very stressful environment
bad,"You have to be signed in on your computer the exact time you suppose to clock in or you will get points that could lead up to your termination. You get 30min lunch and two 15min breaks. I learned that it's not easy trying to sell items to customers when there services are already not working properly and that's the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part is when you resolved the customers issue without trying to get over on them, and the customer is satisfied."
bad,they treat employees like garbage and make you do things that go against your moral fabric
bad,They start by setting your goals and try to be high energy but as they day goes on if someone is not meeting their daily goal they start putting pressure one that person to the point it can be uncomfortable for those around the person.
bad,"Call-center for AT&T (Alorica), over-emplyed, structure of the workplace is very meticulous, culture is negative. Reward culture reinforces ideal worker norms, etc."
bad,"This company is very demanding, don't plan on having any freedom at ALL. You are monitored when you walk in the door to how long you use the bathroom. This job was fun for the first year and half, then it just became not worth the money. This job is good for someone who is greedy for money and does not care about any quality of life."
bad,"Was a great place to work when it was Bellsouth who was into family and would send flowers if there was a death in the immediate family. Bellsouth provided free coffee, tea and hot chocolate for the employees, but then Bellsouth sold us to AT&T. Things have not been the same. Not only did AT&T take away all the perks that we used to get but they also took away all the incentives. Finally, AT&T sold the yellow pages division to Cerberus (YP Holdings LLC). Yp in turn outsourced alll the jobs in our division and we all got laid off."
bad,I'm union worker with a non-union view. I'm being laid off for the 2nd time because of my start date. If it were based on my performance I have been told by several bosses I would be keeping my job. I blame my union and management. The union for protecting the slugs or repeat offenders. And management for looking the other way for years because they didn’t want to rock the boat or do the paperwork. Both sides were just skating by. I saw the hammer coming when SBC bought Ameritech. We deserve it but because of the union. Justice couldn't be handed out fairly. I loved being a lineman and would have done it till I could retire. Now I'm changing careers at 47 to become a computer networker. I went and got my CCNA and I'm working on my Microsoft A+ certification now. It may have been a great company to work once not anymore.
bad,Retail sales on your feet in a retail store selling tv packages for direct tv. team oriented
bad,Typical work day is out installing Uvese service from 8am until jobs are done. I learned how to be a technican something I never done before. The hardest part of the job is hours worked and management.
bad,"A day on this job could be hot or cold for u depending on the season out door sales. What i have learned from this job is u have to be go getter, Management was really not the key here u pretty much had to learn a lot on your own the hardest part about this job is to get people to say yes and signup for your services your are offering but i enjoyed the challenge."
bad,"Enjoyed the Experience, how ever felt my career would benefit more"
bad,"Work mid day, hour lunch, learned how to assist customers with cellphone devices and use different web tools. Management was straightforward, co workers were ok, the hardest part of the job is making a decision to stay or go to school because they did not work around your schedule and was not flexible at all, and I enjoyed learning about cell phones."
bad,"The best thing I got out of my 30 years at AT&T is my extensive training in customer service. I am very lucky that the years that I was there customer service was the main focus, not the bottom line."
bad,ATT is going through a lot of outsourcing and downsizing. Do not let the commericals fool you about a great job. I have been here for a long time and still dodging bullets of being outsourced or let go.
bad,AT&T Was not managed well at all. I don't know if it was the particular store I was working at or if thats how the company actually is. I did not feel like a valued member of the team. I did not feel accepted during my tenure.
bad,Great job but to many chiefs with different ideas about how company should treat there employees with different rule changes every other week
bad,"Daily/Monthly Sales goals to meet/exceed. Hardest part of the job was there was no sick time and being a single mom, that could be challenging. Pay kept decreasing and the quotas kept increasing"
bad,"I love my coworkers. I however did not like the lack of structure. The constant threat of loosing my job if I didn't do demos of Uverse or wired services. A typical day at At&t would be to build repore with our customers, sell cellular devices as well as wired services, deal with customer services isses and upset customers. The hardest part of this job was to achieve the monthly goals that were set forth and the constant stress of the managers reminid us if we don't meet out number we will be fired."
bad,This was my best and my worst place I've ever worked. It's too bad it started out as the best.
bad,"enjoyed working with diverse set of people. Having to make a $10,000 a week sales quota in the middle of a recession was hard. Sometimes it was a not so honest place to work. I did not meet sales quota could not cheat people out of their money."
bad,"Be smart, don't start. The Yellow Pages are over. It's close to impossible to make a reasonable living selling a product that isn't used any more. Businesses don't believe in or want to buy."
bad,"A typical day, log in to the queue take phone calls all day listening to customers complain about the service, call you names, be rude and hateful, and blame you for their phone not working correctly. Random calls being evaluated for certain things that are required to be said on each call. Completing the call in less than 300 seconds, and handling all of the customer complaints up to and including- changing rate plans, changing equipment, making payment arrangements, taking payments, changing features, changing phone numbers, reviewing billing information, explaining the bill, trouble shooting technical issues with the equipment, and helping clients to log on to the website to review the information on the account. There is pressure to complete these actions within 5 minutes, ensuring all activities have been completed correctly. While, management is listening to random calls to be graded for accuracy."
bad,I often worked six days a week and 10-14 hours days. its was a very stressful and cut throat environment.
bad,"A typical day will be getting the store ready for opening, making sure all phone displays are working. Setting up registers and checking morning sales goals. Comparing previous day sales and setting goal to achieve current monthly attainments."
bad,"worked up to 14 hour days 6 days a week for most of my employment, reprimanded often for circumstances that were out of an employees control, management cared nothing about the issues techs faced and provided very little help with problems tech faced in the field due to their lack of knowledge or experience in installing uverse, once i had surgery and could not get back up to speed with installations as quickly as they wanted i was fired for poor efficiency which was for months that i was out due to recovery from surgery"
bad,The job was fun because I got to talk and meet new people. Although the downsides ended up out weighing the good so I had to find a different position.
bad,Job Security is very low. Extremely intense workloads and goals.
bad,It’s ok a lot of pressure from management. Commission is no longer what it use to be. Job is ok for people that don’t have kids it’s better for students.
bad,"Probably the ONLY part of my job I enjoyed was my coworkers and the fact I could sit down for the better part of the day. The pay was good, too. One of the best part time jobs you can get."
bad,Awesome place to work at first. Great pay. Great environment to work until they bought out directv and became money hungry. All they cared about was the money and not the customer
bad,"Massive Layoffs always looming.  No job security.  It doesn't matter how well you do your job, how many awards your win or how much money you save the company.  Employees are not valued AT&T."
bad,Company not interested in anything but cost cutting. Cutting is beginning to affect service for customers. Made a huge mistake in acquiring direct tv.
bad,"They compare you with people who have been there for 15 years, unrealistic targets and they spect you to do overtime because work is most importante than your life or health, you have to learn system from 1980s in technology company that is unacceptable and   if you have kids you have to make arrangement so you can perform mandatory overtime."
bad,"Although At&t looks like a great company to work for on paper, senior management has lost its historical focus on providing quality service for its customers and is now focusing on up-selling and adding on products like phone insurance that is not always the best solution for customers. For example: their partner Asurion used to provide premium customer support for all sorts of technology in the past such as computer issues, now these support calls are handled in-house by At&t staff that have little or no training. In store personnel are expected to be experts in phone technology but surprisingly there no training on ANY of their devices. At&t training is limited to selling. Due to the overwhelming need for customer service due to the sheer mass of their customer base, there are long wait times even for inside sales teams."
bad,"The job is fast-paced call center work. There is no time between interactions. The pay is good and so are the benefits, but call center work is not for everyone."
bad,Relaxed place to work for. Informative. Workplace culture was great. Hardest part of the job was learning all new technical skills. Most enjoyable part was the people I worked with.
bad,Upper management has no clue what is going to happen from week to week.  No oppurtunity to advance my career at AT&T.  Quarterly layoff announcements.
bad,I was commission..enough said. Management sat and listened to your transactions then would point out everything you did wrong after the customer left. It was very discouraging and stressful. You could always do better.
bad,Great place to gain useful work experience! Work environment very entry level but the teams were fun and it was easy to reach goals daily. Definitely would have to be a self-motivated person to work here and make decent money.
bad,"AT&T is a difficult company to work for. They spend so much time laying off people, then concentrating on keeping the employees. Management has completely gutted our teams, that we cannot be fully functional anymore. We lost the experience, the long time friends, the knowledge, the camaraderie. It is a terrible place to be at right now. Unless you are working for the mobile or DirectTV, the rest of AT&T is very toxic."
bad,This job was great in 2014 but now it is hard to make money and management always changes. AT&T dosen't care about there employees just there bottom line.
bad,"good working condition an people, I was able to suggest and implement some new controls."
bad,"Empresa con mucho aprendizaje, una de las mejores para trabajar, buen sueldo. El ambiente es muy tenso por el giro de la empresa y todo el tiempo estas estresado"
bad,"Unless you have been working for the company for five-plus years, you really have no life outside the company. you have to work mandatory overtime shifts, the pay is wonderful but not worth all the stress that comes with it. Management will observer your performance and will evaluate you on minimum expectations. However, if you don't hit one out of the almost 50 expectations you have the chance to be coached that will lead to a write-up. Store wise there is a level of unfair favoritism to the top reps. The union protection isn't really there to help either. The contract for a sales rep isn't the best one for the company. Also if you're thinking about a vacation you have to plan that one month in advance if not you can't get it, and if you have an emergency you have to take a point, you cant take a vacation day. Overall management is always changing their minds on how they want you to perform, products always hold or lose value have to be on your toes the moment you clock in. Management always seems like they are trying to nick pick everything you do even if you get a sale. Sadly you can't trust your managers."
bad,Got the job and watched floods of people leave as they were let go after years of service to the company to be replaced by contractors.direct manager was great
bad,Worked and stuff. Drove a work truck when working to go where I needed to work. Had a manager I worked for. It was a work culture. Sometimes the work was hard. Enjoyed working.
bad,"No advancement for union workers, AT&T focuses entirely too much on salaried positions and scaling the workforce down, which is counter-intuitive after the Time Warner merger and accounting for new wireless tech embraced by the company."
bad,"Too many back to back surplus actions keeps people from ever feeling stable.  The pay is good and benefits, while costing more each year, are still very competitive."
bad,contract worker . I cannot give a honest and truthful opinion of corporate att.  All my work for att was through a contract company.  This would not be correct to assess them as a company
bad,Not a great place to work after AT&T purchased DIRECTV several years ago. Typical day includes taking 40 to 50 calls from upset customers who think they are paying to much and are threatening to change service.  Demand discounts and free equipment.
bad,a very depressing job. pay was excellent but doesnt amount to the stress and headaches. i dont plan on ever going back there. really need to be a nonchalant person for this job
bad,"can make money but very stressful and strict attendance, sick and performance policies that can make job security a considerable worry. Often feel poorly about how customers are treated."
bad,"The company says they work to provide you a safe work environment and that is so not true. You just sign off that you understand that but the managers do exactly what they want. You must be in the ""in crowd"" if you want to succeed or get railroaded in the under current of the shark tank.  They will cut down on positions on a drop of a dime and you will be forced to take another position of possible lesser pay or bye bye you go."
bad,"I was here for 5 years. They implemented a point system for clocking in and out. If you were 5 minutes late to work, you got half a point. If you were 30 minutes late, you got a whole point. You also got a whole point for calling in. So if you were 30 minutes late, you may as well just call in and use a sick day. Our store was right by railroad tracks. Some mornings we would get stuck for 20 minutes waiting on a train to pass by. So we would get attendance points. Since they went union, managers had no say in it and couldn't use their discretion. After 3 whole points, you were on probation for 6 months. If you got another 2 points within that time, you were fired.Union also cut our commission. I knew it was time to leave at that point. Everyone told me that I left at the right time."
bad,"The overall structure of AT&T is similar to government work with very little room for advancement. Even if you decide to move to another position, you have to gain approval from managers that are worried HR will not give them back fill. This makes them reluctant to grant release. The company is constantly striving to transform from telecom to a new age IT goliath like Google. In doing so, they reduce workforce every couple of years by large numbers. Many times the decision on who gets let go is based on company strategy more than an employees performance. Until AT&T stabilizes, it is a game of chance in all areas of the company. Most employees are hanging on as long as they can because of high pay and great benefits, but nearly no one is advancing their career. A 3% raise every year is standard until you hit the top of your position salary range."
bad,Don't get paid as much as you think you would. Commission is only 5% and not enough hours. Manager was pretty cool. I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone unless you go to a busy location.
bad,Job mostly impart installing CATV in peoples homes.  You should have good people skills and be adaptive to working in adverse weather conditions and work environments.
bad,"Lay people off to often, good benefits, good job, good people, gave many chances for working out of town, was very good with training and placing with co workers"
bad,This job was very stressful without adequate compensation for how stressful. They were also not flexible in terms of what can be done if there was an emergency.
bad,"As a Wire Technician the typical day at work is fast-paced and extensive. Labor intensive, technology based, safety oriented, and extensive training. Management for the most part are reasonable, but can easily display unethical and abusive behavior by weaponizing safety policies. Workplace culture is centered around safety to a fault; where good to provide for employees however creates a lot of red tape just to perform the job duties with excessive safety procedure. The daily and weekly schedules are undesirable. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with all the safety, process and procedure the company implements. The most enjoyable parts of the job are salary, benefits, and interactions with customers."
bad,"Very corporate, very slow moving, extremely cheap with employees.  You could spend all day just tracking down who you need to speak with in this behemoth of a company!"
bad,I am a father of 3 and could not stand it that I did not know when I was going to be off from work.  You cant plan for anything and you have to work there for years before you get a weekend off.  I would encourage those with out family to go for it but if you want some hint at stability working for AT&T as a prim tech is not for you.
bad,"When I began- it was Ohio Bell.   That company I loved.  They were like a family, and we all felt close.  We did whatever it took to get the job done.  Then Ameritech, SBC, etc.... "
bad,"working for at&t at an authorized retail location, was stressful at times, specially with upper management/ in store manager pressuring sales. With intent to get paid ,but not looking for what was appropriate to the customers needs. Working their was enjoyable when customers would return due to great customer service.The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to help customers and creating solutions."
bad,"Management could use improvement. Mission is to make every ""employee and customer to feel like family"" . which is not what the company had to offer. Pay out is not much ."
bad,"AT&T pays very well.  During the short time I worked there, I made a very good amount of money.  People that worked there were making tons of money.  However I was miserable there.  It is a harsh place to work at.  I've never seen such extreme micro-management.  The managers talk to you like you're a child and even use vulgar and offensive language towards you.  No professionalism."
bad,"I had 3 managers in 2.5 years and they changed the complete IT infra-structure.  That's way too much change.  "
bad,"Log in on time-keep schedule- receive incoming call, usually back to back, resolve customers issue and try to sell them one of our additional services or products."
bad,"Decent Pay"
bad,"I worked at the company for 7 years and was promoted several times, but the company constantly made employees feel that they could be let go at any moment.  Management was not great."
bad,"I would have enjoyed working for this company a lot more, if the management team that I had wasn’t so demeaning to their employees. In fact I probably would have stayed with the company as long as possible."
bad,"When I first started with Cingular, we were treated as assets. The smallest employees input mattered just as much as the CEO’s. After the AT&T merger the employees were left behind and it became and upper management driven company. I will never regret my time working there, but now it is on to bigger and better things."
bad,"During my time at AT&T I found that while they have intense training, once on the floor, there is very little room for further training and questions."
bad,"Great place to learn about internet installations, Great group of people to work with , everyone supported one another and was real cool working together."
bad,"My manager was the best part of working at AT &T, friendly, understanding, trustworthy, easy to approach and an overall wonderful person.  The hours were 2nd shift which was difficult with a family .  The benefits and pay were not the best. The employees made it a place that you wanted to come to daily."
bad,"Att is an ok company to work for if you have no outside life, family, are in perfect health, and live next door.  The call center I worked for was very inconsistent in hours,  at my start, promises were made of senority  that were quickly broken. If you work an early shift, you have to work saturdays.  No matter if its and avalanche, hurricane, snow storm etc, thats not an excused absence. Nor is traffic court excused or sick days . On top of all of that you are required to the work of 2 representatives (att and dtv) and barley be compensated fully as one.  Working there you realize management is learning/creating procedure as time progresses simultaneously regulating any and everything that can terminate employment"
bad,"At&t can be a great place to work depending upon the location you work at.  It is a physical job, but it's fun work, great co-workers, excellent pay and benefits, but the issue that caused me to leave was with the poor management. Most of the managers I encountered (with the exception of a few) were not trustworthy. They created a cut throat environment that caused a major division between them and the technicians.  Other than the poor management the company is a great company to work for and you will have alot of fun doing the actual job."
bad,"Contract Job,. I don't get enough feedback from ATT on how to improve my performance ,. it is like they have expectations,. if you don't meet them,. you no longer have a job,."
bad,"Good place to start, but a lot of changes occur and poor management. Compensation has been tremendously cut so it is very difficult to make good money. Our goals are too high and management is never happy."
bad,"In both title and job description they don't mention sales until you get your foot in the door, and they describe it as just extra. Then when you're in and half-way trained then thrown out on the call center floor feeling like you have no idea how to do you job, it turns out sales is all that matters."
bad,"AT&T's culture was traditionally based on the good ol' boy network.  You obtained your job, got promoted, and compensated based on connections within the company.  You used to be able to rely on them for job security, but that has changed as a result of a corporate culture shift in the country where all employees are expendable."
bad,"As a Directv technician I worked with the public learned excellent customer support skills, became fluent with satellite system and installation process.  Job required setting up a 28 foot ladder. Moving ladder around house, drilling, wall fishing installing cable outlets."
bad,Was a pretty good place to work. Unfortunately was laid off due to the staffing company they outsourced to hired too many people so myself and about 7 others were let go. Turns out it is not uncommon for this company to have annual layoffs. After talking to others who have worked there longer it is common to get laid off every year or two until you get seniority. Ultimately this was not a good fit for me and I moved on.
bad,"After 15 years your disposable. Instead of transitioning out 40plus year employees to retirement, we surplus the people who who are the future of the company. At least the next 20year workforce."
bad,"It can always be stressful at a Call Center job. But what made this job so stressful was the fact that they moved a lot of the jobs overseas, told the emplyees about it, and then changed all the stats to make it harder to meet metrics. Every month was a tighter metrics to meet. They wanted to have only 400 emplyees at that site, out of 700. Some quit, found jobs, others got fired or forced to quit due to metrics not being met."
bad,"You have to be a robot or have zero conscience to work here. People were great, but the job itself is too demanding for the wage that is given. Very little opportunity for advancement."
bad,For my job as a wire tech there was just no work and family balance. You worked until the work was done and that many times was late and out of your control. We only received one Saturday off a month. I know it was just part of the job and you have to work when other are at home to have their service installed or repaired. It just created a  very tough work  environment and a negative morale within our group.
bad,Great money but no time with your family.  Long hours and forced to work on the weekends. Expectations are high and they give you to much work in a day to make those expectations possible.
bad,"Fair, Enjoyable experience, Slow paced work, good work culture, low salary, lack of motivation, lack of career advancement, unsuitable location, new technology"
bad,Ok not recomend. Pay low.not stablethat's all i got to say about this JOB. Manager  was nice culture was ok values were good. No opputinty to move up.
bad,Highly stressful environment dealing with unhappy customers; inconsistencies in rules and regulations; unfair attendance practices; I most enjoy resolving the issues that the customers have
bad,i learned fast paced multi tasking customers issues to problem solving their mobility problems. when things are good there are no problems but when you have problems its a domino effect
bad,"Not a pleasant place to work, very stressful. I do not recommend anyone to work there. The only good thing about the job are the benefits and discounts provided."
bad,"I started in the DTV call center, and the calls were stressful, the process of getting assistance was stressful, and there wasn't enough training prior to being put on the phone."
bad,"they were always worried about performance reviews. once per day, week, month. Seldom listened to employees on how to make things better for work environment."
bad,"political orientation less skills more loyalty. Difficult for field level and COR, high attrition.  High employee surplus due to managing nut for company transition into entertainment."
bad,"Guaranteed 8 hours a day, but never guaranteed to get out on time. You could be doing training for new services one day and laid off the next. always adding more tasks to our job but never compensating us in pay for doing more work. They pay is pretty good compared to most jobs but I wouldn't say we were paid fairly. This company just let go of 40% of its technicians all while still employing Directv contractors to do the work we were trained to do."
bad,"mentally stressful, had to stay sure of yourself and your knowledge."
bad,"att means at this time and thats truly what it means, fast paced environment with good people but poor management. att is always changning and evolving so be prepared to do so or it might not be the job for you"
bad,Inbound calls concering tenical issues Very good job and has a good culture and a good vibe for the employees that work there.  Management are hardcore
bad,"Retired from AT&T after 37 years. The new AT&T management does not care about employees, just meeting numbers give out every year. Hardest part of job was meeting end user and explaining why it took so long to fix problems in service, because of management idea  of what is needed."
bad,basic job functions was to assist customers with the device and/or features not working properly. the job consist of handling issues that were beyond the scope of level one customer service abilities and requires network engineers to source repair.
bad,"# 1 would be the people I work with. They are dedicated to the success of the company while being relaxed and flexible at the same time. The folks I work with truly listen to my opinion and take it into consideration when making decisions..Where do I start. Pay is a joke. Sales consultants make $9-$10 an hour and the commission structure is laughable. It's DTV or get money taken, nothing else matters. Managers salary pay is awful, I averaged 60 hours a week, because we couldn't keep staff, and my salary was $12 a 40 hour week, so with all my overtime less than minimum wage. And my biggest store bonus was $19. If you are new to sales and need stuff on …"
bad,Very old system with limited room for advancement. Degrees and Certifications will not aid in you obtaining new opportunities within. It is more of a who you know type company where the old employees refuse to make room for the new.
bad,"When AT&T bought DirecTV and the union moved in, Technicians went from piece rate pay to hourly pay.  This resulted in a huge loss of pay and cut the potential for more pay for most techs. The manager was forced to become a figurehead with is hands tied by corporate.  The union bases benefits such as workday schedules and days off on longevity seniority.  Even after working there for 2 years, I was still the newest technician and never got my choice of schedules or days.  It was to be that way forever with no foreseeable relief."
bad,Directv was the best place to work at until AT&T came and ruined it. AT&T only care about their profit. They outsourced all of our jobs and don't train their new employees so customer get inconsistent information making our job harder. There is no culture and it is a negative work environment.
bad,Nonstop inbound calls. Sales quota needs to be met. Handle irate calls and set expectations. Transfer calls to appropriate locations. Explained the bill so that they would be aware of future charges on the account going forward.
bad,"Keep stats high, and you'll have no problems. Pay is commensurate with ability to upsell services, equipment, and additional services such as internet service"
bad,"The atmosphere is nice, I worked with great people but the management could have been a lot better. They would pick and choose who to be strict with and communicated poorly when laying people off"
bad,"AT&T has undergone TOO many changes.  Changes in top leadership, merging with TOO many other company's with different products, and along with those mergers, people lose their jobs in the form of layoffs.  It makes for poor morale and a stressful work environment.  Everyone is on edge and trying to out do the other guy to keep their job.  I am sure there are more changes coming and they will not be for the better."
bad,"AT&T offers great benefits and pay.  However, the morale could use improvement.  Not a very stable situation currently based on the wire line portfolio."
bad,"They allow the ""Real mgmt. "" take buyouts in '96 company hasn't been same since. Mgmt leaves it to the employees to run the office and than accuse employees when  things go wrong."
bad,Extremely structured work environment with extreme micro management consisting of constant charts and excessive daily meetings great bagels and donuts free coffee.
bad,"I got hired initially as an iphone technichal support specialist,  over the course of 2.5 years, it turned into being the ""billing, international, windows technical support, prepaid billing/tech support, iphone tech support, customer care"" department. Theu nust kept adding more work from other departments onto us and then lowering things like our bonuses."
bad,poor management focused on individual agendas - not department strategies. Poor work ethics and attitudes among legacy employees. Difficult to advance without favoritism. Unreasonable project timelines and wasted resources.
bad,"Normally we'd set up outside of a store or swap meet and try to sell to people. The hardest part was probably getting people to give us credit card information and social security numbers. My manager was a really cool guy. The most enjoyable part of the job was probably when you make a sale. the worst part about it was commission only so if you don't sell, you don't get paid."
bad,"Competitive sales opportunity in which your compensation is based on your overall efforts and knowledge of the product at hand. Some days are better than others, but feeling good about your self as well as confident plays a major factor in this process. I did not find this as a deep indenture being a key role to being a career I can hold for the rest of my career."
bad,Love the people I work with. Frustrated by upper management and non-customer friendly policies.  Lack of communication tends to create a lot of frustration for middle managment
bad,"AT&T as any other company is a good company to work for. However, the callcenter that I was recently employed at wasn't too reliable in their last days of being opened. New management ran the center right into the ground."
bad,Directv was a great company to work for. Once At&t took over it was obvious that they have no regard for their employees or our families. The schedule that we are forced to work is absurd.
bad,"I have worked here for 11 yrs. The longer I work here the worse it gets. Stats are created to promote failure. The stats change as soon as u start meeting them. They say we one AT&T however we are one disorganized company. You will do a job that is meant for another dept that gets paid more and will be told just do it because they sign your pay check. When there is snow (even if 10"") you are told use your best judgment however you are given an attendance point if you can't make it to work. Yeah that shows how much they care about you. Policies are created without thought of how this will impact the reps giving the information to the customer. Constantly looking for another job!"
bad,When hired in under Directv was told it went by performance base.  If you work hard and have the good numbers then you could get the good work schedule.  I was in the top 10 of the site from the first month to get the day shift I needed for my family.  When ATT took over I got put on 4 10 hr shifts for Thursday through Sunday for 1:30 pm to midnight.  It would not work with my family needs and they did not care that I was one of the top performers every month.  So I had to leave.  I just spent over $4000 in court fees to get the set schedule to have shared custody with my kids for the schedule that I was on and they did not care.  So I had to leave.
bad,Initial pay is the highest it its category and industry but you pay the price because the expectations are unreal. Management is focused only on numbers and has very little regards to social interaction.
bad,"Very interesting place to work.  If you're looking for an 8 to 5 job and rarely work weekends then this is the place for you.  The people that worked there did only what they had to do.  Nothing more, but often less."
bad,there is so much change happening it is a very stressful environment it was so much fun when I started but all the policies have changed and fun is not part of the job anynmore. get free directv and  discount on att cell phone
bad,"Good place to work, good benefits, flexible hours. The only down side was the rudeness of some of my customers. At times I felt rushed and I wasn't able to do a good job but after a couple of months and some more experience I got the hang of it."
bad,"It provided a good living for my family.   However, changes in leadership has changed the way employees are treated.  They only want to be an entertainment company."
bad,"During my tenure at my AT&T it was a love / hate relationship. I loved working with my co workers and working with customers but, hated management. multiple times I've had people come in and tell that the manager didn't had leadership skills and they could tell. But besides that I loved the customers and my co workers they were mostly kind spirited and I was always so happy, and energetic that even the angriest left happier than they came in."
bad,"Great place to work, great people to work with love the interactions with the customers, I'm just a peoples person great product knowledge really no training learn on the fly.  PAY SUCKS"
bad,"Co-workers are great, but management is always hired based on who became best friends with the upper management. I worked for Verizon for years and regretted leaving a few weeks after getting to ATT."
bad,"If you are willing to work overtime without getting paid overtime then this is the job for you.  They pay is good but you will have allot of unpaid travel time.  You will work 55 to 60 hours a week and only get paid for 45 to 50 of it.  They do provide good training and your own work van.  The health benefits are OK.  You don't know what you are doing until about 6 AM in the morning, all jobs are handed out the day of work so you have no idea where you are going for that day until then.  Very stress filled."
bad,"Okay job if your willing to live in section A. Company was okay but more for a teenager. I didn't work there that long but I wouldn't go back, the training didn't help and the prices after the 2yrs sucked. You was better off staying with your previous job."
bad,Review documents and create work process for crews. Repair maintaine or replace telecom lines. Process work orders communicate with customers and make sales when available.
bad,"job is well paying, but the time you have off you feel totally drained. Work hours are from 8 to whenever the load is cleared. I will say if you are a go getter and want to make as much money as you can. Then AT&T is the job for you."
bad,"was constantly being micro managed.. if you have a target on your back you could be written up on Monday and fired on Friday. "
bad,"Mid shift at a call center, trouble shooting phones up and down the eastern seaboard. Taking bill payments, as well as adding and removing features from multiple accounts per day."
bad,This job had a schedule and hours! The building was in a great location I was in the middle downtown. The commute was good i caught the train to work. But the manager is the worst.
bad,"Usually answered calls for the time I got into the office till I left.  Highly stressful environment.  Worked on multitudes of different technologies....from Cisco, Redback, Ciena and Lucent technologies.  Had work with transport as well, such at T1, T3s and above.  Worked on card replacement and provisioning."
bad,"When I started at AT&T I loved everything about it, My store my co-workers even a few of the stores managers. When management was changed and new management started in the store, I found myself not getting the proper 1 on 1 training from the Management staff. I never had any 1 on 1's with the general store manager. It was kind of like the management staff vs. the sales representatives. I was also let go because I needed to go out for Immediate surgery due to sickness. I am currently working with a Lawyer to pursue legal action against the company and the GM of the Center City store in Phila Pa."
bad,"A typical day was answering customer calls regarding billing, technical issues and sales. I learned that I can expand on my skills. Management for the most part was good. The hardest part of the job was not being able to help the customer until the issue was resolved. The most enjoyable part was learning new information."
bad,Great job with daily challenges. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and the team work to accomplish our objectives. Their was no home life work life balance.
bad,"Terrible management team starting from Store manager all the way to the Director of sales. Wouldn't help anyone unless they liked you and were part of there group. "
bad,"The work life is very stressful. The company has a code of conduct but a lot of fraud and unethical practices surround the company causing lots of stress, whistleblowing and corporate bullying."
bad,Extreme schedule didnt give you time for life and family. One of the pros was reaching goals. This company did give great health care.
bad,"•	Coordination with Offshore and Onsite teams on various Functional and Technical terms"
bad,"You drive your own car, you are not reimbursed for gas, its 100% commission, no sales no money, its door to door. doesn't pay near enough per sale. You have to work outside in the cold going door to door, kind of a joke.The managers are great to learn from and this is a great place to get your sales career started."
bad,"A typical day is staying on the phone calling customers and trying to get them to upgrade either the current phone plan, the phone or some type of accessory for the phone.  The hardest part of the job was the sales and the most enjoyable part was the people I worked with."
bad,Great benefits...limited growth. Great company to relocate with
bad,Spotty leadership with recycled Bell South employees.  Product was poorly developed.
bad,"I worked at At&t for awhile and I enjoyed my coworkers but also the customers even though it was a difficult situation sometimes. However, Not the company.  I started out with a good base salary and as time went on they would decrease it but the key was without you knowing. There were certain quotes you had to make but you didn't always know all of them until you didn't get paid. Also as an employee you mean nothing to them, family problems, medical problems are even a getting in a car wreak was not an excuse. It doesn't matter how long you worked there, all they wanted is all your time by trying to pay you the least. I would never recommend anyone with a family to work there."
bad,"Repetitive, competitive, and degrading..."
bad,training is up to speed and expectations of what you're really dealing with once you're out of training are set. And if you don't meet the monthly requirements you are let go.
bad,"pay below average"
bad,"When I started the company was named Ameritech. It was a great company and a fun, rewarding place to work. Then SBC bought it and changed the name to AT&T and it went downhill fast. It's about nothing but the almighty dollar. People don't matter to them at all."
bad,"come to work ,get on the phones.help customer with in corporate limits (help them only if directed by the computer if not pawn it off on other company) try to sell them another service or $45-55 package to fix a simple issues"
bad,"OK job for the money. Favoritism, Gating (sending calls to one rep and others get nothing), union does nothing or knows nothing."
bad,"The hardest part of the job was walking around best buy and trying to convince people they wanted something they did not come to the store for. You are paid every time you get someone to sign up for direct tv and it has been successfully installed in the customers home A lot of times even if you have convinced some one in the store to put their signature on the papers for direct tv installation and 4 year contract, when direct tv installers arrive at their house they either forgot or simply changed there minds and direct tv says that is allowed. So in those cases you do not get paid. There was also a 350 dollar base pay but sometimes if you had a bad week you could end up owing money.The pay was inconsistent and I could not keep getting payed the amount I was if I wanted to keep up with my bills. I learned way more than I expected to. My co-workers and supervisors were great and I had professionals teach me the basics of convincing and sales. My social skills got better and I became more confident in myself. I learned a whole lot from this job but the pay wasn't consistent and I needed money to pay bills right away."
bad,"Its a great company with excellent benifits, just dosent meet the needs I am looking for, pay has everything to do with it."
bad,The work life balance for this job even as a part time is zero. If you're unfortunate enough to be at a store with no union representative then everything is up to manager disgression. The managers aren't held to the same standards as the reps and are often using favoritism and unreasonable rules. The only good thing about this job is that the pay is hood and with a little bit of effort you might just scrape by.
bad,"I would rather not give too much information about this company. I will explain more in detail when needed."
bad,"This temp position served its purpose "
bad,If you can sit at a desk for 8 hours a day and get yelled at and not care and do minimum work this is the job for you.
bad,Low morale throughout the center. Constant anxiety and fear of job security
bad,It was a great experience for me and showed me how to get out of my shyness. I had to talk in front of people and learn how to speak up. I have improved on that.
bad,Loved working for AT&T as a company. Very competitive and progressive company who pushes you to be the best you can in the field and will work with you to help provide you with any educational materials you may need to be at the top of your game. Authorized retailers on the other hand sometimes fail to keep their promises to provide raises or even pay out commissions.
bad,"its a good company to work for, great benefits and the pay is pretty good. i enjoy creating new relationships with new/different employees at work; everyone is very welcoming and friendly. Management, I did not stay long enough with this company to really judge them, but a lot of employees claims management dont treat them well with respect. Other than that pretty much multitasking consistently everyday at work between multiple systems on two computer screens was the deal. As well at the call center i worked at, i had to meet sales quotas which was difficult because most customers well reject. But what i hate most and the reason i quit was because of customers. A lot of customers are really cocky and they threat us that they'll leave to Verizon or some other phone company, if they don't get what they want, and I can usually handle dealing with various types of customers and their complaints, from previous jobs, but here at AT&T customers are simply just ""rude."" They expect to much and want to be treated to well, and their idiocy just make it more frustrating, I am not trying to be mean but it's true. And being the type of person that I am, I try to be nice/professional on every phone call, sympathizing and apologizing when needed, but if a person is going to continually be rude and have an attitude towards me, I cannot dealt with it, mentally. So if you are the type of person who do not mind being yelled at constantly and can tame yourself from cursing at certain customers, than this might be the job for you."
bad,"A typical day at this job can vary depending upon the status of the area and products that we are currently working. However, traditionally we make cold calls to non-advertisers (new businnes) earlier in the day in attempt to grow our customer base. This includes going through a dedicated list of businesses who do not have advertising with us currently in the area or city that we are working. Also, we prospect on our own by 'bird dogging' for new business in local papers, online news papers or classifieds, etc. A lot of our day though, is dedicated to working accounts for our existing customers. These customers have advertising with us currently and have to be contacted prior to a dedicated cut off date to be able to make any changes, be upsold or cancel their advertising. There is an extreme amount of what I call 'leg work' for many of our processes though. You will spend an immense amount of time filling out forms, getting signatures and waiting for paperwork even for the simplest of procedures. This leaves you with limited amounts of time to actually sell to new customers. This job is extremely deadline oriented and you will be under extreme pressure from your sales manager, his/her manager, and even their manager each and every single day to meet the objective put in front of you."
bad,"Good place to work as far as pay and benefits. Great if you dont have a,family because hours constantly change. Mandatory overtime is something they do love."
bad,A typical day is somewhat stressful.The volume of the calls are catered to most low income people that are not able to afford the bills. So we have to worry about charge backs but still make sells at the same time. My coworkers feel the same way. I have learned about the whole wireless industry as well as wire line products that are offered. The hardest part of this job is being able to advance to other departments within the company. The most enjoyable part of the job is back when we could make money and not having to worry about how we are going to pay our bills.
bad,"The most stressful job I have ever had. The management & my co-workers were great, but corporate AT&T is all about the money, with no regard to the pressure they put on the employees."
bad,"was to get to work wait for a long period of time before knowing where I was going to be working that particular day, since it was my very first job doing sales I learn not to trust any body with my paper work like that I wouldn't be loosing my money or giving my deal away, the management was very poor, maybe i got to see a real manager twice in two years, one of my co-workers was very great the others not to trust them from what I learn."
bad,Very fast pace. in between management. My peers are fun to work with. Hardest part about the position is standing for longs periods.
bad,"Company aspires to be great, however with uneducated managmenet, that does not think strategically the message is lost. If you are in a retail position, depending on what market you are in, your job can be fulfilling. If you are in a small market that is cutoff from the real world, be prepared to have your dreams crushed, feel like you have to ""dumb yourself down"" and have no oppurtinity for growth. The majority of my coworkers are really good people but my management team is inconsistent with their performance. They are not available and do not understand they set the emotional tone of the store and of the sales staff. The are not fully aware of the role they play. I Enjoy working for AT&T, but wish the managment in my area had a true eye for talent."
bad,"Direct TV is a great place to work; however, advancing is very difficult because a lot of the current technician have be with the company for a while and isn't planning on going anywhere."
bad,"Love the customers and learning new products and selling the customers upgrades"
bad,"Terrible work life balance, employers expect you to act unethically. Never appreciative. Schedules are terrible. Money is good and benefits are nice. Would not work for AT&T again."
bad,"This was contracted and i would never want to do this again through them. Unless i worked for the company directly, this is something i wouldnt recommend."
bad,"Do not recommend Prime Communication AT&T. Always low staff, expect you to run a store with 2 people (one is PT). Low pay and not worth it they have bad upper management."
bad,My call center had good management. I more than likely would recommend this employer to others. This job was too far away from where I lived at the time.
bad,"Great company to work for, however the magnitude of potential surpluses   outweighs the good. I was a summit winning manager that they wouldn't allow back because of the major debt/cost reduction."
bad,"customers were great experience was great pay was great"
bad,"AT& T was a wonderful place to work. Some of the incentives aside from a inclusive culture, was great pay and benefits. I admired and learned a lot from senior leadership. Their leadership help to enrich lives and promoted a wonderful culture that celebrated ethics and diversity.Though the hours were long, it was a rewarding career,"
bad,Basically Management treat employees like they are expandable pretty much not family oriented high turn around rate no type of inclusion then up and leave the state.
bad,Yes the pay is great don’t get me wrong but the sales you have to hit is to high! And the managers don’t really help you but drag you down when you don’t make your sales. Also you get 8 points to call out in a year that’s including if your kid is sick or your sick you only get 8 points a year or they fire you. If you don’t make your sales they will find a way to get rid of you. But the half off your phone plan is amazing and the pay is amazing.
bad,Had too many times i would go to supervisors and thy would tell me to follow a broken prosses. I felt like upper management didnt care with what happened with customers. The pay was really well.
bad,Manager had favorites that could do anything they wanted. I took off 5 weeks FMLA family while my mother was in hospice and coworkers were extremely mad because I wasn't at work. Company and union only cared about customer service.
bad,Could find a better place to work. Never had enough equipment to do jobs every day  always working for free because they say job has to go in  we would ask with what
bad,"AT&T is a company in a slow decline with layoffs and call center closings. Many high talent people have left the company.  Jobs have been diverted oversees to country's like the Philippines.  Unfortunately jobs in this industry are much less secure now then in the past.  If you work for AT&T, have a backup plan and be ready to go -- if your let-go."
bad,"Before the AT&T merger, Southwestern Bell was awesome.  Once AT&T took over they tried to undermine the employees. From micromanagement to outright sabotage it was unbearable."
bad,"If you, go to school, have a second job, don’t have reliable transportation, and if you need weekends off for any reason good luck. Have ethics? You more than likely won’t get a commission check or a raise. This job is not for anyone looking for something easy."
bad,"Management is terrible at the Dallas location, the hardest part of the job is having the supplies to do your work properly and dealing with cluttered/dirty homes while your manager breaths down your neck. Pay is good but scheduling is inconsistent (can change to 6 day work week with little to no notice) , sick days are non existent and count as an “occurrence”. No job security"
bad,It was okay i didnt like the way they ran the company and how they treated their customers. Im also a very communicative person and Id rather just talk to people face to face.
bad,NA I have no review the company has drastically changed and no longer cares about their employees. They are greedy and do not provide a work/life balance.
bad,It is was a challenging place to stay honest because they want you to add on things to people's accounts even when they do not want you to. There is a lot of pressure to perform and if you do not then you are basically shunned.
bad,Managers will do illegal activities to either get the job done or get you fired if they done like you personally. My boss unlocked my car door while I was in the customer house and then took pictures of the open door claiming that I left my door unlocked. Ultimately I was fired because of it.
bad,No work life balance at all. Impossible quotas to achieve. Good benefits and discounts. Commission constantly changing to benefit the company. Culture has gone bad in the store I worked at.
bad,No matter how good of job do and how much money you save them they will let you go if you don't live buy one of their collaboration zone. The company does not care about stock holders or company profit or employees performance only where you live.
bad,"There are limited opportunities for career advancement even with advanced degrees. Despite continuous education, you will still remain stuck at level 2."
bad,"No job security,  lay offs every quarter, companies stocks and profits on steady rise.  Why the lay offs if company if having profits?  They want to bring in contractors and get rid of full time employees. No management advancment.  Great benefits.  Great pay.  Would not recommend it to anyone.  Upper management has no clue how to run field services.  First level management when qestioned response is "" it is what it is""  so take it."
bad,Att has terrible upper level management and cooperate greed. Would not recommend as a long term career option. No job security and no internal communications
bad,AT&T is like heaven and h*ll literally. You may meet your sales quotas 50% of the time and when you do the pay is AMAZING. They give you all kind of incentives but when you dont make your sales quotas you will only get paid for what you sell and you are guaranteed to get written up. If you get written up for not making sales quotas you are guaranteed to be fired. The customers are terrible! You get cursed out and get disrespected like 5 times a day and theres nothing you can do about it. That place drove me into depression literally until they fired me. I think I was happier being fired than working there.
bad,At&t by far was the worst job I’ve ever had.  Lasting 11 years was difficult.  The environment was sales based and was unobtainable.  Selling products to a customer that wanted to cancel service makes no sense.  Trying to retain a customer made perfect sense however being a sales driven environment made it extremely stressful
bad,This job was terrible. Sent me into a deep depression. The sales quotas were unrealistic. We were chastised for spending too much time with the clients solving their problems and not selling enough.
bad,"Pay is great. It is a union which I personally think sucks. Also, they dictate your schedule and not flexible to what you are available for. I hated the job, but they are always hiring, so great for an emergency income."
bad,"Enjoy the work the treatment of employees and forced overtime has gone downhill, company appears to be in a total freefall from poor and greedy management."
bad,"Working at AT&T helped to put me through college, which was great.. but that's where my enjoyment ended. The process to get a day off was ridiculous, and there were too few employees to cover the shifts - putting me on weekend and night shift nearly every week."
bad,"I worked in the main building downtown.  The pay was very low and the contract position offered no benefits.  You only got paid when you worked, no health care, no holiday pay, no vacation pay offered for contractors.  The work environment and work space was very nice; new state of the art facility.  I'm sure permanent workers will give a much higher rating, but contract workers wasn't treated well when it came to compensation.  They ended up laying off all the contract workers in my section including myself."
bad,"AT&T pays it's employees well. Although there are no guarantees that you'll be working there for an extended period of time. The company is in a constant state of reorganization, and the guidelines in place for technicians are ratcheted up regularly. Making it harder for techs to achieve their monthly goals. During your term with AT&T remember that the management staff is untrustworthy, and you should always run things by the CWA Union leaders."
bad,"I would not recommend working for AT&T. The management structure is bloated and out-of-touch, and there is a perennial fear of being laid off or outsourced which leads to constant CYA decision making. Once AT&T acquired DIRECTV, the vibrant corporate culture that existed in the latter was wiped out within a year."
bad,I worked for Att for a year after leaving another carrier. The company has a horrible turn over rate for managers and reps people constantly quitting. They try to pay reps minimum wage there is no such thing as a raise. All they care about is TV they could care less about their wireless customers. If your a rep and don't sale at least 2 TV services in a month you will get written up after 2 months and get fired. i will say i worked for a franchise ATT not corporate so that's probably the reason.
bad,"Constant changes, Never enough time for an employee to get use to or comfortable with the work situation.  Soon as they do it changes again.  Past few years and continues today massive layoffs.  There is no job security."
bad,"Most day's you're open to close (10-8) or (11-8), they're slowly improving the commission structure but its still not enough. you cannot make a living working here, especially when there are no customers. The management is great though, they're always willing to help."
bad,"I worked at one of the outsource centers for AT&T. Yes they have a great training program that is easy to manage and learn from. However, as a company that does so much revenue a year they do not have anything in place to make the experience for the customer easier."
bad,"The environment was very hostile at times because management could do a lot of micromanaging. Also, schedules really weren't that flexible if you had kids at school and was a single parent."
bad,company does not  care about the customer all though they say that they do....but they don't. no money for infrastructure on the dsl side...cellular gets the money
bad,"The pay was excellent and the benefits were good. The work environment was stressful and competitive. The hours are long, but also one of the few jobs that allow for a one income family."
bad,"I worked in the AT&T MasterCard and Visa call center as a customer service rep.  The pace was hectic and calls were monitored, both for time on the phone and quality of responses."
bad,"Different leadership styles and inconsistent knowledge between seasoned leadership and newer supervisors lead to stress when switching teams. Integrity is promoted but not practiced. You can possibly be promoted to ""temporary"" leadership position only to return back to ground zero six months later. Low morale amongst co workers is a huge let down to the new hire."
bad,"it seems like there is no way to do all your responsibilitys but it becomes second nature after a few months, the technician has to keep inventory of all equipment on his truck, order new equipment, pre call customers, install the systems, do a follow-up call with customers at one day and one week, educate costumers on how the systems work, follow all OSHA safety guidelines, and most importantly respect the Customer and there home, by just doing what's right..."
bad,"My biggest gripe with ATT is the fundamental  change that the entire Telecommunication industry is going through. The industry is moving away from hardware and moving more towards software engineering. Im not a software person at all. In the past the company has treated to older hardware techs as second rate employees, especially in Illinois."
bad,"We would help people decide what plans they wanted, and also, if people should switch over to AT&T from other service providers. The people I worked with were very friendly and nice."
bad,Numbers driven company. They expect full loyalty and commitment and seem to give nothing in return. Wages and benefits were above average. They lay-off quickly.
bad,"Company only cared about profits.  ATT closed the call center down and outsourced the jobs to other countries to save money, and while doing so they then bought other companies (DirecTV and Time Warner)."
bad,"union agreement makes it difficult to take PTO if needed"
bad,I started out as Bellsouth sales rep. When AT&T took over things changed a lot which is always expected in telecom. The restructuring of upper management was not productive.
bad,Was a great job for me as I was young when I started and wanted to make a career out of it but unfortunately land lines played out and everything is mostly cell phones now so my job played out and was laid off
bad,"If you like working for strict personell t's a great place to work. To strict. They really don't care about your health issues. You literally only have 15 minutes to make the customers happy, fix their issues and sell them something before they start getting on your case. If you don't comply, you start having little meetings and next thing you know, you are let go while you are on vacation."
bad,"I would have stayed with DIRECTV after 8 years had AT&T not bought them and drove them into the ground. I was a hard-working employee who wanted to maintain a lifelong career there until AT&T came along. When AT&T bought it out, it was no longer about a family and growing work environment ; it was about them making money and we were just a number. We went from 1200 employees to less than 400 due to them sending and creating jobs in other countries to save money, forsaking quality."
bad,Would not recommend. Career advancement is near non existent. Constant threats about job security from management. Constant talk of reducing head count. Very hostile place to work.
bad,"I was ""surplussed"" during the held up Time Warner deal... It was the 2nd ""surplus"" within the year.  Lost a few friends in the first one. "
bad,Limited earning potential.  Advancement opportunities only if you want to move to Dallas.  Frequent reorganizations with constantly changing direction and leadership.
bad,je moet er gewoon hard werken voor je poen. en geen onzin
bad,"The lack of a quality store manager ruined my working experience with AT&T. Overall, my coworkers were excellent and it was a very positive company culture within ourselves."
bad,"I became an AT&T employee when BellSouth merged with AT&T. It was really a great place to work for several years. Good base pay, annual bonuses, excellent health benefits. The company was doing well. Particularly in the wireless division. However, as iPhone sales started to decline, AT&T started to venture into the entertainment industry. They bought DirecTV and more recently  TimeWarner. Not the smartest move in an age where ""cord cutting"" is the trend. So after these multi-billion dollar purchases, they began to layoff employees more and more frequently. Most likely to cover the billions of dollars they are now in debt. Since the TimeWarner deal completed earlier this year, my organization has gone through two rounds of layoffs and we were told there will be at least another in early 2019. These are not small layoffs either. This last one was 15% of the workforce. Everyone I talk to in the company is worried about their job now. There is no longer any sense of job security. The economy is growing again. While many companies are hiring, AT&T is cutting its workforce and its stock prices are sinking. If you are looking for a long term job, I advise to look elsewhere."
bad,"I was unfortunately not happy with AT&T. The dysfunction caused by the bureaucracy made it difficult to feel like my work was worthwhile. As a data scientist, it was frustrating that nobody in the chain of command above me was even basically proficient in data science when our job was to provide internal data science solutions. As a result, ""feelings"" and ""trust"" are more important than evidence in many cases, because the decision-makers are unable to assess the evidence."
bad,"Everyday was very different in so many ways, and i enjoyed meeting new people everyday. Being able to put a smile on the customers face was the most enjoyable thing about this job."
bad,"The company closed after 6 years of my employment.  I reached maximum pay rate at 4 years.  The job was wonderful, the management could have used some management training."
bad,I activated phones and answered any general questions customers had. Sold items as add ons. Answered indound calls for 8 hours a day. used E-mail and a two screen computer daily with data entry.
bad,"Very fast pace environment, paid time off, great insurance, and FMLA if needed. If you are great at sales, talking on the phone. Then this is a job for you."
bad,"It's a fine stepping stone position. They have nice workout facilities and good pay. They take their time to train their employees, so that you actually know what you're doing when you start."
bad,I was hired as a contractor as a Technical Account Manager for their largest global customer of over 5 million calls per month which spanned every continent and 11 hotel brands.  I was required to only enter 40 hours of contract work per week despite the fact that it was closer to 12-14 hours a day.  Eventually the situation was resolved via legal counsel.
bad,My job was a union job.  The more you are paid the harder the job is.  Management are blow hards.  Constant mandatory overtime.  10-12 hours a day 6-7 days a week.  It gets really old really fast.  Back to back calls all day.  No time between calls.  People calling are always angry and agressive.  VERY VERY stressful enviroment.  Sales objectives are unreasonable.  People add stuff to accounts without authorization just to win competition.  No bonus pay in sales enviroment.  Just get slight pat on the back.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
bad,Managers that know the work groups function and are able to be personable will help go a long way. Very stressful environment and there was a cutthroat atmosphere before I had to leave.
bad,"Good pay and benefits is all I really I have to say about AT&T. If you can grit out the corporate rat race then this is the place for you. "
bad,At this time I have no comment to make regarding AT&T. Furthermore I think the decision should be voluntary. No-one should be forced into making a comment regarding an employer rather good or bad it should be my choice.
bad,"With any company you have the typical politics. It is no longer what your experience is, it's who you know. You handle customers back to back and often work with people who have zero work ethic so days can drag on. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to nice people. The hardest is dealing with customers who previously talked to customer service over the phone and were promised things that are not possible in stores. AT&T is such a huge company with many different entities that it becomes difficult explaining to the customers."
bad,Too relaxed and there was a lack of job advancement and the pay didn't cover the cost of living while causing benefits to be more expensive. Commission structure always changed too.
bad,"This was a pretty cool place to work while it was open. I didn't work for AT&T Corporate, I worked for an authorized retailer. This gave me fantastic leverage when negotiating my terms of employment and salary, but unfortunately it was an insecure work environment. I started in Boca Raton and the store closed so they moved me to Jacksonville - within 3 months the company went under and my position went with it. Financial concerns were never discussed and I ended up having to default on my lease I signed because the area was so rural there were no other job opportunities!"
bad,worst training ever and then management expects you to know stuff never trained for. Not told of overtime until half hour before overtime starts. Sundays mandatory
bad,"I started out enjoying this job truth be told.  It started with a pretty relaxing classroom setting with lectures and self-teaching computer sessions with little quizs and whatnot.  We lost a couple people during that first three weeks, then moved on to OTJ Training where we used the phones.  Lost more people due to the stress of talking to people and getting yelled at for things we couldn't control, and the fact we had to take to just take it took it's toll on everyone.  I and a couple others advanced to transitional teams where the rest who weren't cut out for this position were weeded out via metrics.  With how little they wanted us on a call, we could barely fix anything and ended up getting yelled at, and we were expected to just take it in silence.  At the end of the day I found out I wasn't cut out for that type of work and quit.  Made it 4 months.  Alternatively, the people I worked with, including management were super nice and understanding, but there were somethings they couldn't help with.  One thing being it's awful attendance policy.  Simply put, if you missed more than 2 and a half days in the first 180 days of training, you're done.  Didn't matter if you were sick, or you wound up in wreck,  NO EXCEPTIONS.  Which is why I rated so low on job security.  "
bad,"Severe disconnect between Technicians and rest of Company. Employees are treated like a statistic and the overall job experience can be dehumanizing. No real advancement opportunities. Pay is severely lacking compared to work scope. The only redeeming qualities are job security, benefits and discounts and meeting new people everyday."
bad,"given many new job roles often, with no raises. Poor management that is uninspiring. Only looking for sales at all costs. Many unhappy co-workers who are always looking for other outside job opportunities"
bad,Es una Empresa en la cual se tiene un buen ambiente laboral
bad,"Working here was ok it wasn't the best job but it wasn't the worst either. I believe for the most part dealing with anger customers was the worst. I mean I understood why they were upset but some customers get really disrespectful with the name calling,"
bad,"AT&T has been a great company to work for the last 10 years with the company provided training, transparency,  promotions, incentives, on the job training, work-life balance, telecommuting, travel and the most enjoyable part of my career with AT&T has been the relationships, friendships I built.  The hardest part of the job would be the constant transformation of integrated upgrades to technical  software which caused many employees to be laid off."
bad,strict 
bad,"Overspends every year for the past ten years, every October they cut contractors because they ran over funding for the year. Poor senior along with poor middle management."
bad,"I was a contractor so I was paid through my agency.  Therefore I can not speak to any of the benefits of AT&T since mine were not through them.  I loved my personal manager, but I got lucky because any other other managers would have been a nightmare for me to work under.  They make promises they don't keep and contractors are treated very differently than actual employees.  Constant layoffs and turnover."
bad,"AT&T was a great place to work until the climate changed to big industry.  Because technology is changing, many jobs over the years have been reduced."
bad,AT&T bought out DirecTV and the merger was filled with confusion from AT&T.  They had their sales people so scripted they couldn't deviate from anything outside of the script from Sales or else they'd lose their commission for the week.
bad,"Got paid ok for what i was required to do. Much less than other previous titles for the same work though. Youre asked to do more and more for the same amount of paid. When i was surplussed, A Premises Technician was basically doing three peoples jobs."
bad,"I didn't enjoy the environment or the company culture, which is what I value in a workplace. Company culture is pretty nonexistent, and it's a super quiet, and boring work environment.I also didn't find the job to be challenging enough for my liking. I was under the impression it would involve a bit more front end developing, which it required absolutely no styling or design, so I wasn't a fan."
bad,"answering customer's calls regarding billing and service issues, also assisting with technical issues. Offering new products and promotions including phone, tv, internet, and cable."
bad,I have reason to believe that after working for major corporation it was a great learning experience. I would strongly recommend anybody who's trying to advance and their professional resume to not shy away from any large companies.
bad,Anyone who is Still a CSR for AT&T or works in the unlocking department. Please get intouch with me on team _ alharbi @ hotmail co uk I have great news and something that may interest you
bad,"I was a sales rep for Direct tv, took inbound calls to promote services. It was a commision based postion, in a fast past competitive enviorment......"
bad,"The work is not very challenging. If you are looking to work on the guts of cutting edge technology, AT&T is not the place for you. You may get to play with cool toys, but it is unlikely that you will develop it. Most work involves integrating systems into a manufacturing environment and defining functional requirements."
bad,"low wages and stressful overtime"
bad,Fun place to work. Also good pay and benefits. Great mangers as well as great company support. The only problem are the layoffs. Other than that a great place.
bad,Salary and benefits are great you can definitely earn some good money here but if you value time with your family than just know what your getting into.
bad,"DIRECTV had a winning formula with a good corporate structure until AT&T bought us and then began making changes. I can only speak for the department I worked in, but because we made a lot of money in advertising AT&T decided that we would be quadrupling our work load within the next year without any new hires. The staff slowly watched as the environment around us became more and more stressful which caused a lot of the ""good"" people to start seeking new employment. The DTV management understood we were pushed to our breaking point but they had to tow the line of AT&T or be fired, there was nothing in-between. I was receiving exceptional performance reviews until AT&T took over, then I suddenly found myself on probation twice in one year. I too decided it was time to move on, so I did. Oh, and DTV gave all their employees free VIP TV service, AT&T only gives you half off anything you purchase at their stores. The difference in a nutshell."
bad,"Typically worked 10-12 hour days. Received very little support from management, the customer metrics assigned were almost impossible to achieve, resulting in weekly sessions with management. Databases were not correct, resulting in lost time on a continuing basis."
bad,"This environment was fast-paced and very different from any job that I've had.  I would recommend this job only for people with a certain disposition as it does involve a lot of customer service, but it was a valuable learning experience."
bad,product just didnt work at the time of employment. didnt have the heart to install something that wasnt working fully into peoples homes. seems to be a great product now.
bad,"Receive incoming calls and collect payments on accounts."
bad,"Pay is not good. Being in the union is a joke. Hated the way that the union worked, screwed up a lot of scheduling. Digital life product is a joke. Would not recommend"
bad,"When you hear ATT, you think of it being a great company. That is true externally to customers and prospective employees. Internally, it is crazy.. the call center facilities are majorly in remote locations in old (maybe asbestos) buildings with a few to none windows. Strict no adherence schedules plus micromanagement.."
bad,"This company...in this part of the United states has an issue.  That issue is diversity, logic, and integrity in Management.  With that said, the job security is always at risk even when you are performing to absolute and beyond satisfaction. "
bad,"Typical work day is logging in and taking collection based calls, or transferring the correct department.  There is no more that I want to add in here right now considering I still work for the company."
bad,Employer disrespectful to its employees. Not a very comforting place to work at. Very time management meaning 1 second late and you are written up. Would not work their again.
bad,"AT&T was constantly threatening to close our office in Birmingham, AL starting immediately after the merger but our productivity and efficiency were too high to justify it. We had new tasks dumped on us constantly, new processes added which slowed the work flow to a crawl, new phone systems which backed our call volumes to hour long hold times (they were kept to under 3 minutes in Bellsouth) and we were getting the feeling that the company was setting us up to fail for the last few years, but we still managed to adapt and thrive. Then they paraded upper management through our building to see what we did and we were suddenly loved and being told how great we were and how they wanted us to be the go-to center until 2027... then a couple of weeks later during the lay off announcements they shut our center down completely and sent us all home without a job on Christmas."
bad,Your are consistently on on the phone assisting customer with there mobile bill and breaking down the bill to them. The calls would have to be transitioned in a sales call and sell U-verse TV and internet.
bad,"Very large corporation focused on the bottom line and not employees. While they state they are a people first company, the actual attitude is company first at what ever the cost."
bad,"Co-workers were great, and the management at my location were amazing, but that wasn't the case everywhere. There is no chance for growth at this job title, and pay does not reflect the work that was required of me. Training provided is not the greatest, feels rushed and as of late the training required is a lot of information. Starting pay is no longer what is used to be, very low for what is demanded of employees. I do not recommend any technician based jobs to anyone, when I started with the company it was a very enjoyable job, but now with the changes of DIrecTV the company is going in a different direction. The stress is put on the field technicians who are on the front lines, and dealing with the customer base on a daily basis in their homes. The job has been complicated much more than it needs to be making the company provided goals almost impossible to reach without breaking some rules."
bad,It was an amazing experience getting to meet new people. Customer Service jobs are really easy. Until you work with RMI Florida because you literally have to walk door to door to sale the product.
bad,I have known many people who loved working here but environment was simply not for me.  Great training program for new employees but pay and benefits left something to be desired.
bad,"Directv went downhill since AT&T bought out Directv. Management is horrible. Great if you're needing something quick, but I would Definitely look elsewhere"
bad,the most enjoyable part of job was assisting customers.  there is unreasonable & unnecessary amount of stress placed on reps daily as far as making stats as opposed to assisting customers properly.  management only cares about their bonuses based on sales & care nothing about you if you arent helping them reach those goals.  they also prefer to get rid of tenured reps & replacing them with lower paid reps or outsourcing.
bad,It allowed me to gain a lot of experience with dealing with angry customers on a day to day basis. And I learned the value of uncovering their wants and needs
bad,"Customer service position plus monthly sales goals.  Selling TV service, internet service, and additional wireless lines of service."
bad,Direct Leadership was great. The job did not have a good work/life balance due to the nature of the duties. The job was a 24/7 because of the nature of the job. I worked as a team with colleagues.
bad,"A lot of unprofessional drama, disruptive and obnoxious people. No one followed any dress code or language restrictions. Literal fights and name calling almost daily. This is not a reflection on AT&T. The company is ACT- Advanced Call Center Technologies."
bad,At AT&T  had to work in any kind of weather. Climbing poles and making sure the customers services was in good working order prior to leaving their homes.
bad,not a fan of working long hours with no minimum breaks. enjoyed talking on the phone helping people with their issues but it can also get overwhelming when the call volume is high.
bad,"Worked as a mid market National account manager, traveled extensively throughout the Carolina's on a weekly basis.  Primary focus on strategic fiber products and mobility products from AT&T"
bad,The expectations and demands leave little to no room for an outside life. There is a constant push to do more work and work is often taken home to balance the expectations of the caseload.
bad,"Very greedy company, with an  inconsiderate attendance policy. The commison payouts change to hurt you. Management pressures RSC to perform unethical sales behaivor towards consumers."
bad,la empresa fue muy buena tuvo un gran ambiente laboral con mis compañeros tuve mucho aprendizaje y un poco de tiempo laboral.
bad,The days were long. The company forgot about providing quality service and instead focused on useless training of the employees to meet some goal of being a new company.
bad,Long and difficult...Sketchy schedules..never knowing when the workday ends. Hard to schedule days off or plan anything.
bad,"Worked with customers on a daily basis, created new account and dealt with old accounts. Always learning new technology."
bad,moving up in the company was not easy and the work was more than what you revived in pay. my time there was alright. moving forward.
bad,"Trying to please management and the customer was a daily chore and really begins to wear a person down. Even if you pleased the customer and resolved their issue, management would still critique your call. 95% of the time, those critiques were because of the huge pressure to sell new services. You resolve their issue but you didn't sell them anything. *tisk tisk* To me, even with the decent hourly wage pay, performance incentives, and great benefits it isn't worth the stress and anxiety involved with pleasing the customer and management."
bad,It's not a bad place to work and it's fairly easy to move up only because they do have a somewhat high turn over rate. They are not always fair with their employees and higher up tend to look down on the lower level employees.
bad,company does not care about employees  and put number ahead of customers. the stress  level was high to meet numbers. customer are easy to deal with. management did not provide support
bad,Not friendly to those trying to balance work and home life. Increasingly harder to make bonuses. A lot of upheaval since take over.
bad,"I thought working for an authorized retailer would be better than working for a corporate location...I was wrong. A typical day was just to help customers with their accounts and make small business calls to drive sales. This location is really slow and not only that the manager at this location does not train well and does illegal things just to make numbers for the month, which I was uncomfortable with. "
bad,I was a technician for the uverse side of things. for a big company they do not treat the technicians very well. How could i work for a company that puts all the fault on me even if it isnt my fault
bad,"This job should be used as a stepping stone only to bigger and better things, the management is dismal and they don't care much about their employees, they will look for any reason to fire you. You have the potential to get bonuses but you have to jump through hoops to get them and not everyone does. In the two years I worked there I only got one bonus. I have had people tell me that I wouldn't make it out on the call floor and that I should just quit, I have had people tell me I wasn't a great agent, and the second time I worked there I was fired for ""Not passing the tests"" even though management told me I did and to come back to work on Monday to take calls. if you're looking for temporary work then this is the place to go, but don't expect it to last long."
bad,the customers were super angry and all responses were with scripts. there was alot of micromanaging.  while I was at 2wire it was a revolving door.
bad,Typical management has zero experience as a Manager of people.  Commission structure can change 3 to 4 times a year therefore it is hard to measure performance
bad,I worked as contractor for AT&T...The group I worked in was a fairly new group. The manager was okay but it was a good group to work in.
bad,They outsource the majority of there positions and organization between outsourced and non outsource employees was less than acceptable.
bad,"I, for the most part, enjoyed my job at AT&T. The building was pretty, and my management fun/nice. It was a very enjoyable waste of time."
bad,AT&T is a difficult company to work for.  You can never do enough to make them happy and the more you do the more they want.  It is not enough to just do a good job.  There is no work/life balance.
bad,"How important to you  is the device you are using now to read this review? Most of us rely on at least one device to connect us to our world, family and economy. My role for the last past two years has been to find solutions on how to bridge the gap of understanding between technology and how we all can use it to make life simple. My job is to find out as much as I can about the consumer, so that I can position a device or service that  helps make life make more sense. I am a Retail Sales Consultant for AT&T and to whom much is given, much is required. "
bad,"Every aspect of this job has a protocol and script. Some parts of that are beneficial, but being in trouble for not using scripts when you fix the issue, and have a great customer experience isnt right."
bad,When i started working at AT&T it was brought to my attention that this job was only going to be customer service but when i got hired it was brought to my attention that it was a call center and sales in which i was not comfortable with and in the beginning i was doing very well but after about a month or so there was a tragic death to our main boss and after his passing the manager(s) who has taken over was not prepared for the outcome and in my opinion was not aware of  there job responsibilities.
bad,Typical day is back to back inbound calls. Most calls are upset customers attempting to fix a problem. As a sales representative you are expected to solve the customers request by asking fact finding questions to enhance their bundle. As the solution provider it is your responsibility to show the benefits of the products you added to their bundle to enhance the customers service. The sales expectations are very high. If exceeding the sale quotas the bonuses are very substantial
bad,This was one of the few places that I felt a little overwhelmed maybe because of the fast-paced environment. One thing I wasn't really fond of was working at the window.
bad,"was ranked top 1% in sales for the company, and couldn't advance in the area because of of the store managers didn't like me. I took my sales skills elsewhere."
bad,"Up sale quality merchandise "
bad,"Commission structures do not benefit employees. Longer hours due to last minute customers and long processes. Even when goals are reached, more is always required."
bad,"Overall not a hard trade to learn at all. If you have the dedication to deal with company's unrealistic tech expectations. Management generally has little to no knowledge of experience of field work of today's advancements. Company adds more responsibility to the technicians than they do the managers. Few and not many you'll find good technicians who take pride and stand by their quality work. You do see often more than enough, poor workmanship and overall the technician just didn't care to provide the service the customer investment. You are in a union and pay dues but, as a bargaining appendix. You don't have as much rights as the core contract, its easier for management to suspend, write you up or/and possibly terminate you employment. "
bad,The attendance policy is really strict and does not even allow excused sick days. Management can also be really horrible and there is nothing you can do about it.
bad,I felt very insecure about job security. The staff was ok and it was a great company but to know that no matter what u can basically be fired on the spot for anything makes me very uneasy
bad,I enjoyed being in a position to provide a one call resolution and help others resolve difficult issues but I was not happy in opportunities for job advancement within the company
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is that we get paid $15 an hour as a college student and being that this position is an internship they work around our school schedules. Management is extremely unorganized and some of them are very disrespectful. Management lacks consistency. A typical day includes logging into the phone and answering calls and working emails to provide troubleshooting and/ or updates for clients. I have learned how to not allow small things to get to me. I have learned to conduct myself in a professional manner even in uncomfortable situations.
bad,"Worked as a customer assistant to assist customers having trouble with their internet. Also tried to sell routers, internet package upgrades, and specialized troubleshooting from a more advanced department. Very stressful job, the company did not have a smooth way of transitioning between departments so customers got frustrated very easily because they kept being transferred and would have to explain their problem to each person only to get transferred again. Training was very extensive and well needed. Strict time frames were expected to troubleshoot internet problems. There were no sick or personal days given in the first 6 months of working there. You got written up for every little thing, even being a minute late, you would be docked ""points"" and you were only allowed a certain amount of points until you were fired. You weren't given enough time ""off the line"" to finish reports to turn into supervisors. Friends were made during training but once training was over, you were all separated and did not get time to talk or get to know your new desk mates because you had to be on a call constantly. You were allowed 2 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch break to talk to co-workers, which consisted of complaining about the job. Very high turnover rate. Got cussed out a lot by customers for the problems that AT&T created as a company."
bad,wake up drive 45 mins get the load go to cx house install there service show how to use go to the next one everyday is luck of the draw anywhere from adding oe box to installing 27 boxes really the job needs 2 tech because they will work you to death
bad,"typical day at work, was really great. i loved the work schedule that we had. My co-workers were all amazing, i loved how we got along. The hardest part of the job was actually trying to get customers to buy the cable service."
bad,Good place to work.  Hardest part is the transport time to and from Davenport. The pay is very good if have no college.  They change constantly so not boring. Really like people that work with and company keeps you informed of changes with weekly meetings. Hardest part is being yelled at by customers or policies that I have no control over changing.
bad,too much micro management. I do better without it. a typical day was 10 hours on the phone helping customers fix problems that arose
bad,"Productive team leader, did a lot of computer work for the company and had good people skills"
bad,Saw lots of jobs phased out with the merger with AT&T and Cingular Wireless. m Atmosphere is stressful as well.
bad,The HR personnel were very rude and didn't care for their employees.  You were just another number to them.
bad,"A great job for anyone starting out, looking for a simple job with a great surrounding. What I learned is skills on the computer with different software and a fast typing speed. Management is there for you, and will help you if you have an irate customer. Co workers are all at a young age and very fun to be around. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with irate customers, most enjoyable would be the environment around for a young employee."
bad,"I worked from 8:00 a.m. through 5:00 p.m. daily. I learned quite a bit from the experience I had working in Internet Services. The job was quite technical for some one coming from the ""Old School"" of cordboards and directory assistance.  My manager worked with me to meet the productivity standards of the company. I felt he did not provide the one on one that I needed. My co-workers were all decades younger than I and grew up in this techno world.  The hardest part of the job was the technical aspects of advanced configuration of the modems. The most enjoyable part of the job was working one on one with the customer. I enjoyed interacting with the customer and received great satisfaction knowing that I was able to help them and make their day a little better."
bad,"I worked here for 3 years and its a great gig but there are a couple ""bad apples"" that have astonishingly made their way into supervisory roles."
bad,Assist customers with billing and new activations or upgrades.
bad,"I enjoyed selling and making a clients life more lucrative, but I should have returned to the film industry long ago."
bad,Was a great company under Bellsouth management. Big call center
bad,"I worked in the mall for at&t. The manager didn't care much about his employees and was more worried about himself than others. . . It was NOT a corporate store, but an authorized retailer. . .So they really didn't have the values that AT&T portrays."
bad,"I have learned a lot from this company. I just wish that work life balance was a bit better. The sales portion of the job is tough, Managers are required to watch next to every interaction and feels as though you are being micro managed. Some stores get lucky and have 1 or 2 managers that trust you to do your job and do it well with out the pressure."
bad,I was happy when Comcast merged with ATT repair. ATT was very disorganized and unwilling to  incorporate new ideas for better productivity.
bad,"Customers were great, pay was good, hours and schedule were horrible including the management staff."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of working here was getting to know my co-workers. Working as a team, also very friendly people."
bad,management misled employees about the amount of calls that come in and about the ability to work with employees during personal issues
bad,Learned alot about wiring and hardware. Very hands on. The Co-workers were easy to get along with.
bad,"Once the 3rd party company finds an effective training technique and process, the trainees and retention rate will increase."
bad,"They really don't care about your well being, just their  numbers. You bid  for your schedule"
bad,"Busy environment, with great co-workers. The hardest part of the job was trying to maintain the quota."
bad,"Un día tipo en el trabajo era entrar a las 9:00 AM, firmar la planilla de asistencia, y luego salir a vender, podríamos llegar ir a los pueblos cercanos de Río Cuarto, o quedarnos aquí mismo. Los días que nos quedábamos en Río Cuarto debíamos volver a la oficina a las 16:30PM presentar las ventas de las mañana y salir nuevamente a vender; los días que viajábamos volvíamos directamente a las 20:00PM. En cuanto mis colegas fueron una gran enseñanza para a mi, me llevaba muy bien con ellos, fueron parte de mi aprendizaje, y aprendí a tratar con las personas, técnicas de ventas, saber manejarme con un grupo de trabajo e individual. La parte difícil del trabajo fue lidiar con las mentirasde  los gerentes, prometían cosas como por ejemplo las comisiones y no eran cumplidas. y la parte que mas me gusto fue encontrarme con un grupo hermoso y cálido que fueron mis compañeros de ventas."
bad,"Typical day at work included greeting customers, informing of what would be attempted to restore their service, then actually working along the route of cables to isolate & repair service. Always learning something new EVERY day ! Management was THE ONLY displeasure of the job when at&t acquired company, with SWBT / SBC, practically everything went like a charm. Co- workers were THE BEST EVER ! Hardest part of the job was the politics of the job, aka "" The Paperwork "", with at&t ! The MOST enjoyable part of the job was the reaction of the customers, especially the Senior Citizens, when their service was restored, they were the ones THAT REALLY NEEDED THEIR TELEPHONE SERVICE, basically to keep in touch with their family AND their emergency needs and it really brought them ( and us ) to tears, on most occasions !!"
bad,Sales and customer service. Overworked and under paid. Nananananananana
bad,company hires and tells people they will do customer service work and they end up having to sell
bad,The good boy system.  Just hope you will get a manager that will actually help you and not work against you. Even the union.
bad,Benefits are good.  You can move up if you have the necessary experience and educational background.
bad,"this was a horrible place to work, it was long hours in the elements without breaks, no days off, and horrible management"
bad,"I didn't like working there because I feel the expectations were too high. You had to finnish a customer service call in 5 min and then up sale phone services, direct TV, DSL, and cell phones. At times it was very hard with AT&T being around for so long a lot of the customers were older and didn't want the things that we were selling. You would add services to previous accounts and they would call back the next day to cancel. So it was very hard to keep a sale unless they were new customers or transferring service. My manager was not a good leader. He did not have patience and even screamed in my face one day. Very uncomfortable. So I ended up leaving the job."
bad,Not a good company to work for. They don't care about work life family balance.
bad,"I worked at Empereon Marketing for a few months. They are a 3rd party call center for Directv. Please note that the details in this review do NOT reflect DTV but on Empereon Marketing. "
bad,Typical day at Att was very stressful an constant calls back to back
bad,working in a call center ebvironment can become mundane day to day important to find ways to make it fun
bad,"long hours little management support over worked staff, great dedicated field staff"
bad,"long hours, hard work great coworkers"
bad,Great pay and m-f hours but terrible management and micromanagement. High turn over due to stress from unattainable sales quotas.
bad,"When the market was not so saturated and competition was very healthy, you worked harder to sign those contracts. A good test of endurance and strength for those who could survive working 12 hour days."
bad,This was a very stressful environment to work in. The pay was great but sometimes it not always about how much money you make.
bad,"This Job will drain the life out of you. It will pay the bills but the price of the monetary compensation is very high. I worked there for seven years and finally had to say to myself, enough is enough, my peace of mind and health are much more important than anything this job has to offer."
bad,Constantly learning about new products and services. Frequents feed back from management.
bad,"I did not like working for this company, as it was solely commission based."
bad,"The jobs changed every few years, from lease equipment to calling card accounts, to collections of calling card account and finally to residential long distance billing."
bad,Turnover rate was too high to fully rate the accuracy and satisfaction of employment. 
bad,"This was working for a branch of AT&T developing, training, and implementing a new product.  The work was fun, challenging, and creative.  I was a contract employee."
bad,work concession stand
bad,Typical day you would dry dial for an hour and sit there flirting with the girl next to you. The mangers would start posting peoples sales numbers on the board. So after a couple of hours screwing off you would stop dry dialling and make real calls and get your quota for the day. I learned that Telemarketing was not my calling.
bad,i liked working for this company and would have remained there if it wasnt for my needs for maternity rest while employeed
bad,"Typical day would be attend kickoff meeting, setting up QA environment, set up data and planned for release mapping of"
bad,the job ended but the job was inside sales and part time. This was a outbound call center me didn't take very many inbound calls at all.
bad,"Company had a very supportive staff, management wasn't great"
bad,Tuve mucha responsabilidad pero me gustaba lo que hacia contaba con excelente grupo. Pero en fin no estaba comforme no respetaron el salario que me habian prometido en un principio.
bad,Taught me how to think quick on my feet and gave me confidence to interact with potential buyers for the product I was selling. Co-workers made it easy for me to learn and have all the tools needed to be a productive employee.
bad,"typical day at the job for AT&T you go in and log into systems and read emails with in the first five minutes and than start taking calls, They want the calls only to last 5 mins or less and to solve issues. if customer has more than 2 issues and is business needing to transfer to other dept to handle, if iru needing to handle call yourself. Most of the time customer's are rude for being on the phone for so long before rep answers, not reps fault having calls back to back."
bad,"AT&T Click to Chat, was a customer service place where I worked for a few months that taught me alot. Even though the pay was descent, the people who worked there were somewhat unprofessional, and made work stressful sometimes."
bad,this company has no morals scruples or integrity i would not work there again
bad,I went through the training of the position. After the training I did not take the job because of it being comission only. My hours also did not fit with my schedule.
bad,"The second you walk in, it's very loud and it's hard to even hear your own voice. The combination of everyone talking plus the loud music that plays the same hip-hop songs over and over again makes it very difficult to focus. They try to make things fun, but it ends up turning very stressful. You're constantly being yelled at for things out of your own control. The rules for sales are never clear; they tell you to do one thing, then turn around and tell you to do something else. A lot of people just do their own thing, even if it's not the right thing to do, as long as they don't get caught."
bad,"To many tight goals& don't get recognized for the good, jus get scolded for the bad."
bad,"Had a sales and service manager that whenever he reviewed calls, he would always look for a way to give a bad score and whenever he would listen to a live call he would talk over the customer and tell you what to say. The other managers I had while working there were great, but he was worst. I would not recommend working for them until he is gone which would be never as he has been there for at least 10 years. Also area managers were always pressuring managers to get rid of agents."
bad,"Not a good place to work. They give a base pay but fail to mention its a drawback. When you work a bad week which everyone has here and then, the next time you get a good check, dont expect to see it. They take every penny back."
bad,"My job consisted of telephone technical support and resolving all issues associated with troubleshooting networks, equipment and switches. Also trained in billing and Customer Retention. Handled about 60-100 calls within a 10-hour shift. I learned a great deal about how to interact with people. Management was less than I expected in the way of team support. Enjoyed working with others. Hardest part of the job was being expected to sell products that the cutomer either did not want, or could not afford. I truly enjoyed assisting my customers in finding solutions that fit thier needs. Most of my customers were very pleased with my performance, and I believe I contributed to the overall Customer Satisfaction with the company."
bad,This was not the best work environment. Some of the management team abused their authority and made it impossible for employees to further their career with the company.
bad,Gave upward coaching to new employees on sales and computer programs.
bad,"You were recognized for how long you were on the phone as opposed to the sales you brought in. Morale was bad, and turn over high."
bad,"Going to customers homes and installing their prerequested services, from IPTV to high speed internet. I learned alot while with the company. Every day was different depending the amount of jobs in our load of work(jobs to complete that day). We never knew when the day would be over. You couldn't set up any plans after work due to never knowing when you would be off. We never got off before 5:00pm and I worked some nights till 11:00pm, from 7:30am too. You are required to reach a specific number everyday. This ""number"" value is based on a combination of number of jobs completed, time it took to complete, how long in between jobs, number of repeat visits a week, and several other things. If you can not keep up to their numbers you are considered not doing your job, reguardless of what may have interferred with you on a day. Things like waiting on repair techs, ect are counted against the tech even if we have no control of the situation. We as techs had to deal with customers whom were promised things over the phone by people who haven't seen the actual amount of work to do, and customers got upset with us because AT&T said that would be no problem. The manager was constantly trying to find something to put against me due to the fact he didn't like me. He would come to my job site everyday, when he went to other techs maybe once every other week. I found the work schedule and the managers attitude towards me horrible. They treat you only as a number, I was running well over my required number to be considered a good tech. They do not care about any personal problems you may be"
bad,I worked at the call center when it was Cingular Wireless. I logged in on my phone and began to take in calls on a various reasons. I adjusted bills and gave technical advice. I worked at my own cubical and had my own space. I worked around some great co workers who helped when I didn't know an answer to a question. I was trained for a month by a very smart trainer who did his job very well. The place was very big and bright. The hardest part about this job was to try and calm someone who was upset over the phone. Also you were not supposed to spend too much time on one call so it was sometimes hard to help them like I wanted because of that restriction.
bad,stressful some days and enjoyable other days. while answering mutil line phone you learned more about your customers and what they expect from the company although frustrating and demanding at times it could be rewarding just to hear a thank you.
bad,"AT&T is a very demanding employer. It is a stressful job as well as environment. The managers try to keep things upbeat and fun for the most part, but there are major goals which need to be met by the manager and representatives so it can get pretty tense at times. The pay for the job is not very good nor are the health benefits."
bad,"I always wanted to work for the ""PHONE COMPANY"" as a child and it was fun for the first few years but then it became really morally and ethically disturbing."
bad,This company was a nice place to work at. I am a heard working and I am a nice person to work with.
bad,At&t let a lot of us down when they surplussed us; those who could not relocate. I was laid off twice and did not have a since of stability or room for advancement in the company. People were and are still on edge because every quarter they fear a lay off. The pay was excellent but you were stressed OUT!
bad,Good place to work with good benefits.  Good advancement opportunity. Ok work life balance. Always given the tools you need to do your job. Micro Managed.
bad,"They are Laying off Americans and shipping jobs overseas."
bad,"I was a loyal and good employee. I worked tech support for iphone and android phones. I had good surveys, and didn't cause any problems when at work. "
bad,"I always loved working for Directv. They had great benefits, 401k match up to 4%, great training, excellent rewards program. We prided ourselves in great customer service and loved helping people out. But once At&t took over everything changed, they were more focused on pushing phones and equipment on people who didn't want it, the metrics we had to keep up with was about 10 different things. People were laid off and job security was very low."
bad,"The company provides little to no support to individuals in this role but if you thoroughly enjoy cold calling, door knocking, and having no leads or direction to reach an unreasonable quota then this would be perfect for you. You end up performing the roles of multiple internal positions outside of sales due to the lack of direction and support."
bad,"The benefits are amazing, but it's become a terrible place to work.  They've stretched themselves thin financially with all of the buyouts and mergers and now there is way more stress caused by management pushing everyone to be robotic and cover a ridiculous checklist of things with every customer regardless of why the even came in.  If you don't basically harass every customer you get disciplined."
bad,"Es buena empresa, solo que personas como los jefes de arriba, si no te llevas bien con ellos, no tienes crecimiento, vaya debes ser lambiscon para poder subir o bien para que no te corran por el más mínimo detalle."
bad,"I can honestly say when I applied here I was very excited for the job, it started great a lot of training (6 weeks) but a lot of information can be very overwhelming, but not impossible. After that, you then have 2 weeks of supervised floor training on the phones, and then nothing, and yes I really mean nothing. At this point, you start working an independent schedule (different from the rest of your team more than likely) so you will be there for the most part by yourself with no managers or leads for assistance."
bad,"AT&T Promises great salary at the expense of your fun. Great pay, but it is very difficult and taxing on the employees. It is a great job for someone who loves the thrill of getting a sale, but can be depressing for someone who enjoys helping people."
bad,"Horrible company to work for. Mandatory overtime, have to bid on shifts and days off, threats of layoffs every year. Being denied PTO constantly. Asking permission of using your own paid days off and being denied. Lack of training, toxic work environment, mean management. Inconsistent work processes, horrible documentation and communication of new customers accounts and processes.The only positive is the pay and benefits. Other than that, I would suggest looking to work for somewhere else other than AT&T."
bad,"I am great at customer service, but the metrics relied heavily on sales.  As if sales were the only thing that mattered as opposed to resolving customer concerns and keeping them as customers."
bad,"there is much turnover in this industry which causes for employees to pick up extra hours with no work around. Management is great though, and you have to have tough skin to be able to deal with the customer base."
bad,"depends on site assignment"
bad,"excellent manager, the workers also the company is the mistake they put pressure on you to fulfill your goals you do it. then they  dont  want to pay, there was always a mistake with the commission and the overtime, they want us to talk lies to be able to sell that is not customer service"
bad,AT&T is can be an okay company to work for. I would say its downfall would be the cutbacks and constant equipment shortages. Great guys and some good mangers.
bad,"Hit the floor running. Pull reports, do emails, mail, birthday balloons, work on what ever project for that day. Inventory for the store, phones etc. "
bad,Job duties changes quarterly.  Compensation for the duties and skills of a premises technician is low.  Management different depending on area of work.
bad,not a job for the faint of the faint of heart. life work balance is talked about but not supported. company is lost in their lack of direction and having to double back yearly.
bad,Att was a great employment lot of opportunities for managerial positions . Pay was good. Hours were 40 a week off days were consistently Monday and Tuesday which had its ups and down
bad,I love my job but a surplus of employees every year is not a comfortable situation.  Wage group 1 employees!  Plenty of work has to be completed and the best group to do the work is being surplussed.
bad,"AT&T at one time was a coveted company to work for.  Major changes over the years (divestiture), buyouts and layoffs due to the acquisition by SBC, have made working for this company feel like you're in a boat that's constantly rocking."
bad,"The location I worked at was previously owned by DirecTV so they did have thing like ping pong tables, an onsite gym, free parking, and free coffee but AT&T wanted to remove some of these thing because they did not want to pay for it. "
bad,"Management was poor, paid was good and benefits too. This job have really bad schedules since is only base in seniority and no performance. I love AT&T how a company."
bad,n/a....no interest in commenting..to each his own...work at your own risk..very hard to be promoted.  The employee you work with make working for the company worth the frustration worth while
bad,very busy day high expectations on a not realistic goals. Hardest part of the job is sales to angry customers and the approach to sales is changed every few weeks must be very flexible
bad,Stressful place to be. It is all about hitting your mark and if you don't its review after review. A lot of the goals that you are required to manage are not in your control.
bad,"Go to work handle sales, retention and account management.  The job is easy just looking for a change, colleagues are the most enjoyable and is a very diverse culture.  It is a constant changing environment so we are constantly learning new technologies and new software changes."
bad,"The pace is fast and ever-changing day to day you are to be on your toes.  The technology and the breadth of the industry is large and fascinating.  I was able to see many changes in technology over a short period of time.   The management is basically driven by numbers and constant corporate changes.  The company has diminished in size and is expected to become smaller in the coming years due to consolidation of departments, techniques and centers to create a leaner company, this causes the employees to be  in high competition with each other and even managers seeking to shift around from different departments to flow along with the company's vision.  The hardest part are the last minute chamges and many changes in practices but it takes getting used to and finding your niche.   The company as a whole was avant-garde,  experimental, radical, or unorthodox and ahead in technology and that is what kept it fresh and interesting or frustrating and hectic."
bad,The call center was eventually closed due to lack of unity or teamwork. There was a lot of room for improvement on part of upper management.
bad,"There were 2 of us, without warning, let go during training. No for warning, nothing. I was ranking within the top 3 for sales. Also, they state all through training that you really have to try to get fired there. So NOT true!"
bad,"Highly stressful work environment, always threatened to be fired, not enough workers for work so besides the 2 to 1 day(s) off from work you have no free time whatsoever. If you like having no free time/life and being constantly told you're not doing good enough it is a perfect place to work."
bad,no room for advancement been at the company more than 8 years pay has not increased attempted to apply to management position in the call center nearly impossible
bad,"work hrs based on seniority, new hires get worst shifts consecutively while tenured agents get cushy 8-5 everyday. Schedules are bid on, also based on seniority. Pay is skewed, everyone does the same job, yet the pay is $10, up to 15 for others. Alot of favoritism, with managers hiring their kids and starting them with max pay....even with no experience. Upsell required, even though it was not mentioned in job interview or job ad. Job was very stressful, do not recommend."
bad,"Assisting customers with their account by handling questions, complaints and billing inquires, taking payment for invoices, fixing equipment, activate new or used devices"
bad,The overall job was very demanding in terms of selling but was very low in pay. You hardly never seen your hard work in the sales you made. The management seem to not care about employees as long as numbers were met.
bad,"Great pay "
bad,"As a manager of 7 sales consultants my job consisted of motivating and inspiring the team to produce the sales goal while maintaining a high level of customer experience. We worked together as a family and were consistently ranked amongst the highest in the district regarding sales and service."
bad,"A typical day for me includes providing exceptional customer service, maintaining a high willingness to recommend  the services. I've learnt how to continuously empathize and encourage customers also how to use the needs and wants and make a relevant offer of one of our specific products,the goal ultimately is to maintain service above and beyond average. Co-workers are continuously focused on resolving every customers issue while maintaining a genuine attitude and owning every issue and keeping up the brand of the company. The hardest part I would say is making sure every customers issue is resolved EVERYTIME and being able to know that the customer is not satisfied before getting off the phone that is where above and beyond services comes in. The most enjoyable part is being able to please the customers at the end of every call,resolve the issues and maintain the great name of the company."
bad,"as a Retail sales consultant At&t offers good money and great benefits. You count your money, open or  close your store, make your sales, and constantly have to be up to date with the latest promos and phones. Managers are okay depending on your location and as for other Retail sales consultants they are usually easy people to work with. When it comes to Area managers and higher up mangers they put a lot of pressure on store managers and retail sales consultants. It seems as if whatever you do it is never enough unless you're perfect in every sales category which is a lot of categories. You always hear about someone either being written up or being close to getting a write up. You can get written up for anything in example if you don't greet a customer with your name. The shifts are usually long especially during holidays. Your not allowed vacations during November to December. If you can handle constant daily pressure then at&t may work out for you."
bad,AT&T was a good company to work for however the Senior leadership did care for the people
bad,"- Procutive and fun workplace"
bad,This job was very micro managed. I did enjoy troubleshooting computers. It was an awesome place for growth
bad,Answering incoming calls there was skill training at least twice or more a month managers were available on occasions and co-workers were outstanding everyone would help each other with standard and tech questionshardest task finding managers to assit with un-satified customers assisting customers with their bills and network issues   
bad,Money is great but you have to lose an arm and leg a and other body parts to work
bad,The hardest part of my job was making sales to customers who where upset about billing issues. Management was okay. I loved that we had perks on specific days if we meet our sales objective. As a hold at&t is a good company to work for. Job security is not granted.
bad,"This company I work at is based on union. The schedules you get is based on Seniority. If you don't get the shift you want, tough luck. Good company. But if you can tolerate customer and company nonsense that they abuse you terribly for no reason at all, and if you care about the difficult obstacles to get high numbers and metrics to get free money, then this job is for you. Pay is great too with awesome benefits. Work place leaders needs work"
bad,"Theu value sales above anything else, they dont care how happy the customer is they just want you to push tv and internet sales even though the call center is a billing center"
bad,"The pay is great once you've been there for 4 years. The benefits are great too. You get over 3 weeks of vacation after your first year and 4 weeks after 5 years. There is a culture of ""sipping the koolaid"". The company makes awfule business decisions that result in the employee having to sell nonsense. If there was not a union, every corporate employee would have been fired by now. Culture of deceit and telling half truths to get the sale. Would only recommend if you need money and want good benefits. The sales position itself is a headache."
bad,"Full paid training at the CFL was great. Learned some cool things and all the instructors are awesome."
bad,Overall experience was good. Management was questionable sometimes but as long as you do the work in a timely manner then everything is good. I was there 20 years with no problems then I go through some depression and make a mistake off duty. Sought out counseling and still got fired.  How's that for loyalty and job security?
bad,"I worked for AT&T for 7 years. I loved it. I went from Retail Sales Consultant and moved to Sales Support Representative. After a few years, I was laid off. I accumulated a lot of vacation over the years. As in the day in the life as a SSR, it was very difficult to manage tasks because you were doing multiple jobs in one. Luckily I had great management on my side, I was able to go to school and work. Overall, AT&T is a great company if you are out of the retail sector. I found it hard to promote and networking is your best bet into landing a higher paying job. I had a lot of experience and wanted to promote, but AT&T got rid of my position."
bad,"the entire process is extremely loose with a lot of gray area, in my opinion. However, the job pays well, I suppose, so that's why I'm here. I wish there was more clarification on parts of the operations as I often find myself having a lot of questions. A lot of the job seems somewhat unofficial. When I ask questions the answer seems to push itself in a different direction."
bad,"I worked for Asurion - who was contracted by DIRECTV. I only worked for AT&T for a short time, during the initial merger. Not many things changed from the beginning of the transition to the time I had to accept another job offer due to the dissolving of the work at home department DIRECTV had successfully established. I don't have many quality details about working for AT&T because they didn't provide me the opportunity, instead they made huge job cuts to existing. positions on all levels after buying DIRECTV."
bad,"At AT&T you are required to pitch everything that is available to the customer. In training you are taught to identify the customer's needs and to offer what they need. However, on the floor it wasn't like that at all. You are expected to offer everything to everyone, not customizing it to fit the customer at all."
bad,"Promised compensation changed and less than agreed."
bad,"When I applied I was promised that the company would work with my school schedule in order to allow me to finish- boy was I lied to. Granted, the company does provide you tuition reimbursement but then turn around and have you pay it back when you can't attend the classes they paid for  because they change your schedule mid semester. I will always appreciate the opportunity and the people that I met while working there- but I really do feel that the company should spend more time catering to the needs of its employees and keep their promises."
bad,"Att used to be great culturally, but once they became this juggernaut acquiring everything from Directv to time warner, the pay got less but the demand became overwhelming. I left when they were still fighting the CWA union almost a year after our contracts expired. They didnt want to pay us but somehow able to may taylor swift , marky mark and the funky bunch for endorsements. Anyway. RUN."
bad,"I receive anywhere from 25-120 calls a day collecting monies from Business customers. The workplace culture is cut-throat with no compassion for their employees. It is all about the numbers. They pay well and provide good benefits. However, the stress level and treatment is not good.  I have learned so many valuable things from AT&T.  Their training they provide is good. I learned customer service skills, problem-solving, and too much to name. One of  hardest part of my job was keeping my integrity and honesty in handling my job. Another thing is providing good customer service over the years. It became more of a numbers game than customer service."
bad,"I initially was hired by DTV and the ATT bought them, they began laying off employees almost immediately and shipping call center  jobs over sea's.  Prior to the ""merger"" I would have recommended that center to everyone."
bad,"I learned customer service skills.  How to resolve customer complaints without the help of management.  "
bad,"Yo ingrese a trabajar en el 2008  como ejecutiva de Atención a Clientes con la empresa  Nextel,  posteriormente ascendí a  Supervisora de Atención a Clientes   y  1 año mas tarde  Ascendí "
bad,"a very demanding and stressful job with a lot of physical activities, managers are on a lot of pressure as well, bell south was more people oriented. customer services is the worst. customer calls to get a land line and they ended up getting voip, and internet. i however,enjoy being independent, and felt satisfaction helping out customers, even though my metrics weren't as high"
bad,Better company before at&t bought the baby bells but benefits still pretty good. Union takes good care of you even if you do not want to be in the union.
bad,lacks growth and recognition to its talented hard workers. Could use more transparency with in transactions as well as towards career expectations and growth process. great place to start a career must have someone with your good interest above to succeed.
bad,"DO not like the union environment the makes for a very stressful work place, this also allows people to do less and expect more. Not a fan, but then its not for everyone"
bad,I was excited that i got the job and i ended up liking the job as well as the shift i was on. It was the distance and being to far away from home was to far.
bad,Working in long distance repair involved handling customer calls globally.  It was continuous inbound and outbound testing calls.  I learned about the many methods of repair through the local access carriers.  My manager was good to work with and was an excellent instructor.  I enjoyed talking with customers from all over the world. Sometimes it would take more time for the local telephone company could fix a problem and the customer might become anxious.
bad,"Meet in the office, learn new product knowledge, talk about week goals, then go into teams. After teams we go interact with people."
bad,Compensation/Benefits are fantastic . Company has great products and starting a great new future. Learned a lot and can't take that away great education . As for the way company is run. No Comment.
bad,Decent place to work. Bosses are a little unrealistic in what they demand as far as the balance of quality vs the amount of time given to complete each job.
bad,"AT&T is a good company with great benefits, however the management there is poor. Alot of harassment and racism is the reason I'm looking for another job, although i love my job its not a good working environment to be in. Its sad when you report these things happening to you its a slow process due to the managers, area managers, and director work together and cover up alot of things that shouldn't be covered such as harassment and racism."
bad,I'm currently going through an issue with my compensation besides that At&t is a wonderful place to work. You have to sale two cell phone a month to get your payout at the end of the month I sold 2 but my comp plan is not showing on the reference
bad,"A typical day at work was in a face pace environment.  When I worked for AT&T, they were diversified and work oriented.  Today, I feel that so many are not being hired for their experience but its who you know"
bad,The best part of working at AT&T was working with lots of different people and a wide array of customers. I also enjoyed working on my own.
bad,"Very rewarding. I learned so much from this company.  I enjoyed speaking with the clients over the phone and filling orders for telephone service.  My co workers and I enjoyed working and sometimes going out after work.  The hardest part sometimes would be to make sure that the circuits and trunks orders were designed correctly on the orders.  The most enjoyable was to go to work each day and knowing that I was going to try to fulfill the needs of each client. I also enjoyed knowing that when I decided to apply for another position, I could apply for the job without any repercussions for management."
bad,was not what I thought it was. Organization was not the best at my location and it took time to be transferred to a location near your home.
bad,"I enjoyed this job because I had the opportunity to assist customers with their phone service,  Many of my customers were elderly and the services provide were vital to them.  I really tried very hard to provide the best customer service possible.  I received great reviews from  the customers.  The hardest part of my job was when another rep made mistakes on a customers account.  The managers pushed sales so hard that it hurt the  customer.  This opened the door of reps to dishonor the company by placing customers in accounts that they didn't need,  Sorry to say I lost my job for correcting a elderly ladies account and refunding her money, Her service was never installed and she paid her account for three months.  A manager decided that the company lost revenue because I refunded her money,  The Dept of Labor decided in my favor.  I am not discouraged.  I did what was right for the customer.  I pride myself on my professionalism and compassion."
bad,"Most of the time was spent finding problems in wiring."
bad,"Great pay, great staff, but meeting the sales quota was really difficult."
bad,"Incentive plan is awesome you can get to six figures just by sitting at your target. The job is a hunter role ,cold calling is the key to succes for thid position."
bad,AT&T doesn't take care of the employees in terms of retirement.  They offshore people jobs especially when you close to the 20 years of service and they still terminate you.  The morale at AT&T is horrible.
bad,Sales goals and objectives can change in the middle of the month with no prior warning. This makes it hard to meet your numbers and maximaze your bonus. Management is lacking
bad,The monthly compensation for sales has decreased over the 5 years I’ve been in the retail environment while the workload has increased. Paid time off is nice once you’ve been with the company as long as I have. But they work on a points system for sick time.
bad,The work environment bat AT&T is somewhat stressful and very competitive. Managers push all reps to drive sales and never take no for an answer. Reps are ranked each month based on their performance and receive regular coaching discussions to inform them of their performance behaviors.
bad,Company had a lot  of micro-management. They have an excellent idea but unfortunately the company undergoes lots of changes in short periods of time. We were actually bought out twice in my almost 3yr experience. There training programs for success are great though no matter what company you work for.
bad,"Almost all technician positions are terms (Temporary) with hardly any chance of becoming permanent. Jobs within the company are based on seniority. You can't get seniority because contracts are for 3 years. They are still in the process of doing mass layoffs. Used to be a good company when it was Pac Bell but now they have another vision. The union won't help either. I can't get a response from them so I don't know why I am paying. "
bad,"DIRECTV was one of the best environments I had ever worked in.  It was not easy, but was completely focused on performance, breaking barriers and pushing the envelope.  AT&T completely changed it all (as witnessed by the huge losses in customers after the acquistion).  AT&T is about politics, non-delivery and figuring out how to do the least amount of work you can on a daily basis."
bad,"I learned that you have to do more for yourself as far as advancement.  It has a lot to do with who you know versus what you know.  The company has a good reputation, however, maybe because it's a large company, it appears to be difficult to advance in the company."
bad,"Not a terrible place to work for, just wasn't a fit for me. Managers were very good. Always wanted peoplele to hurry yet reviews never came through as promised. Hated protection plan sales, and useless for most people. Products were very good and always trying to make them better."
bad,"It can be a little stressful, but the people there are really friendly and helpful to make the day go by faster. The hardest day is dealing with the sales agent, for example once the application has been expired or completed, the sales agent doesn't see on their end. So, we would have to figure out how to help them to see it on their end."
bad,ATT likes to play with the metrics which in turn plays with my money. I don't like it when I never know what too expect or I can't fid a person to explain something
bad,Cold calling every day. I learned a lot about selling into state local and gov and the politics and protocol. My manager was great and very helpful. We worked remote so no real culture. The calling and amount you had to do was exhausting most days. Payday was always a great day but awards for achievement has always been significant for me.
bad,"This job is not for everyone, it is a very fast paced environment with many responsibilities, multitasking is a must and ability to maintain a consistent performance level daily.  A typical day involves resolving a customer issue while attempting to grow business by incorporating sales into the call.  Learned how to rephrase certain things to maintain a positive ""spin"" on a given situation.  Management and coworkers are very supportive.  The hardest part of the job is to have to sit and constantly be yelled at by customers while being also having sell them something.  Best part of the job is working with the technology and learning new things."
bad,"Hard working environment, can get crazy, we def deserve more for the hard work we provide. Benefits however are awesome."
bad,"inbound calls, taken care of each call to the end with customer sanitation, resolve disputes, interacting with other department to handle customer request..  keeping up with dally reports of the team goals.weekly meeting on results of the team and organization. listening is the key to a satisfied  customer, love customer service taking care of customer needs.  ."
bad,"This was a good company to work for but nothing long term. "
bad,I learned many ways to communicate effectively. The management does change quite often so you're constantly having to adjust.
bad,"A typical day at  work consist of  heavy call volume , and  dealing with technicians and customer ,  automated phone system, and heavy computer use . Extensive training in customer service, and  relations. Very informative supervisors and management team , easy to communicate with. The most enjoyable part of the job were the employees I worked with on a daily basis"
bad,A typical work day at AT&T was awesome. I learned alot on how a customer interaction was very important on all the calls. Managment was very unfair some of the managers were not fair about the part to where the reps weren't as important as they were which i thought was very important in all work places. Hardest part of the job was just to maintain the same numbers every month. AT&T does make it very hard for you to recieve bonuses every month. The most enjoyable part of the job was to come to work everyday and make the customers satisfied my resolving their concerns on the first contact.
bad,"This job is truly a hit or miss.  You can't seem to get into a solid working pace that allows you to work freely or find a nice groove."
bad,I felt that the higher ups were greedy whereas the worker bees were unappreciated.  Never given consideration for family life.  Because you didn't have any outside of AT&T.
bad,Working for AT&T is Challenging everyday but not worth to stay because of pay more work loads but no changes on pay rate numbers is the main factor not considering dive time
bad,"To start with, the most amazing part of this company is it does not let you feel like you are a employee. It feels like a family. Work is good and great seniors to guide. You feel you are in safe hands."
bad,"AT&T would be a great place to work if you weren't just a ""number"" on paper. They will beg you to work for them and tell you all of the opportunities there are and then let you go 2 years later for no reason other than, you are low in seniority, and we no longer need you"
bad,Manager wasn't open to feedback. The environment was too stressful one mistake and your gone.  Manager was not prepared for a new employee. There are some friendly and helpful managers there.
bad,"Working as a sales associate was fun, and I made a lot of money, the company itself is GREAT!!!! My problem were my co-workers, if you dont ""fit in"" with everybody then that's when you will have major problems. I was in a very abusive relationship at home, so I really concentrated on my work, to get the job done to the very best of my ability and go home. Next thing I knew my co-workers were walking by my desk constantly repeating my text meesages and emails from my ""personal"" cellphone..... for what??? (Privacy of invasion ) When I went to my supervisor about it, his reply was, ""maybe someone is trying to find out something about me"". WOW really???? What a big mess."
bad,"Very high call volume ,helping customers with devices,understanding bills,explaining how to work devices ."
bad,"Corporate america at its finest. Worked like slaves, and assumed you live for nothing but the company. The pays great but doesnt fix being miserable day in and day out."
bad,"En general las presentaciones y el salario de la empresa es muy buena. Es una empresa que se esta expandiendo en Mexico, Europa y hasta en Asia aparte de EUA y Canada por supuesto. Estoy en el dept. de Loyalty o Retención como se conoce en otros lugares u empresas. La verdad la metrica de VOC y AHT que se manejan se me hacen contraproductivas porque costantemente hay problemas de sistema. Aparte la metrica de VOC se me hace injusta en ciertos casos porque la metrica se supone que mide tu nivel de gentileza o profesionalismo al manejar la llamada es un chiste porqué hay veces donde el cliente no paga y quiere que le des credito en su cuenta que no esta justificado o piden promociones inexistentes injustificadas o simplemente piden credito de 50 dolares e.j. si no tuvieron servicio por 3 dias injustificadamente porque simplemente los servicios no cuestan tanto y al darte una evaluación te califican mal no es justo. Simplemente una empresa con tanta credibilidad pierde empleados por tener metricas injustas y metodos de operación poniendo en duda su credibilidad como empresa. He visto a gente llegar y irse por el simple hecho que la forma de administrar la empresa deja que desear y no lo dijo por el pago ni los bonos ni los sorteos de premios que se hacen simplemente la administración debe cambiar se queremos ser exitosos aquí en México."
bad,"§Designed floor plan to maximize merchandising strategies by organizing displays and by"
bad,"More training  and working systems, This has been a great job one of the best I have had and my managers are the absolute best and very helpful. I would work for this company again when the time is right for me."
bad,"Great company but did not like pushing employees to buy,  I enjoyed helping them.  Management could listen on your calls at anytime which sometimes scary when you forget sales offers"
bad,"A typical work day for me involved opening and closing the store, setting up the devices, and going over sales presentations with potential clients. Handling all cash and credit transactions, closing out the business day, sending emails about sales and current promotions."
bad,When I was employed as a sales agent it was my duty to transition existing AT&T customers off their old network and update them to the new network. My job as an administrator was to do the daily sales report and input them to be sent to corporate. I had to email and call other applicants. I was also responsible for booking people for training and making sure that they had the proper paper work filed out. I had to do background checks as well.
bad,"enjoyed working and learning on all my jobs. I have a wonderful job experiences, met a lot of good people who are still life long friends. management was acceptable . took the good with the bad"
bad,"A typical day is walking door to door through out our market group and knocking and talking through out my day.  I have learned that people don't always like unexpected company. "
bad,I stayed busy all day long with clerical duties everyday and got along with all my coworkers
good,There’s a lot of discrimination and despaired treatment in the office. A very toxic environment and unfortunate because there are some good people who deserve the best!
good,"I didn't like that job at all, you would be working morning to night almost everyday going door to door, not even knowing if you're going to get sales or not."
good,"You will work whether your there or not. You will haft to answer email,phone calls, text messages no matter where you are. The industry for a manager is very much like this."
good,"I was told several times that quarterly layoffs are just the way off life at the company. Despite the pay and benefits I don't want to have to work everyday worrying whether or not I will have a job tomorrow. That's a really great way to slow down productivity. The most enjoyable part of the job, and the reason why it was hard to let go, would be the people. I worked with a group of diverse and unified people that treated one another like family."
good,"A simple call center environment. Taking calls, making payment arrangements. managing stats.Troubleshooting technical issues. If one keeps a positive attitude, and can adapt easily to change, the job will prove to be less stressful."
good,"Answering inbound calls from customers who need to troubleshoot a device. Some calls required sales, bill payments, address and phone number change. Plan changes for example minutes and data. "
good,"Safety and rescue for bp gas plants all around the country."
good,"they weren't very good in training their employees, didn't provide you with the necessary information to give the customers.."
good,"high escalated calls, no help from managers, poor training,  promise of  pay raise but never comes through. you have tool available to teach your self"
good,The best part of this job was seeing new and different places everyday. Management was so-so. Pay decreased while I was employed which prompted me to look for other employment
good,This job has a lot of non experienced workers whose work ethics are at bare minimum which causes conflict in the workspace. What I suggest is group workshops amongst staff for providing better work performance
good,a lot of changes caused for a lot of turnover when I was there.  Management changes were very quick so adjusting to new management styles every six months was tough
good,"Working at this place, will occupy your time. Very fast pace. Good Place to work. Great over time. You will learn a lot of things that will help you in your IT career. Great team of people to work with."
good,Management stole sales . Not a job particularly for a person wanting to spend time with your children after getting off of work. Management was pretty low .
good,Current culture is driven from the top tiers. The technology changes so quickly that the running rules are often changed before the previous shooting solution reaches implementation level. They have focused on abandoning the copper business while personnel are still in place trying to do their jobs without support or direction. The workforce is totally demoralized. Between facing customers they are unable to correct their issues to waiting for layoff announcements many employees are concerned if they will make retirement eligibility.
good,"My overall experience was ok , it could have been better if management was all on one accord, and actually cared about employees. Other than that I enjoyed all the new customers I sent home happy and my team at the northlake location."
good,"AT&T expects the highest level of customer service for their clients, but gives their representative very narrow boundaries to work with to retain business and build customer value and loyalty. Their required metrics for each representative are the highest I have seen from any call center and I frequently wondered how any of the reps can meet the call volume, first call resolution, and maximum call time asked of them. I found this position to be very stressful and not worth the limited compensation package offered to telephone representatives. The coverage provided seems comprehensive at first glance, but is cost prohibitive."
good,This place was a joke. Working over 40 hrs a week and only making minumim wage. Cut my pay and our comp plans. Managment was terrible. We were required to go to meetings 2 hours away once a month and never got paid.
good,"competitive company culture"
good,"I was the top sales person in my store and in the top 15% in the company my entire time there. Yet the management still wanted to know why I didn't offer every piece of equipment under the sun. I even offered to work open to close Mon- Sat just so I could enjoy my one day off and that wasn't good enough. The final straw was when I had a vacation planned, paid for and approved and they took it back due to ""needs of the business""."
good,"make sure you are in the right department for advancement. "
good,I actually loved this job. It paid well. It was challenging and you felt important. Granted you won't have a social life but the pay reflected that. The training was extensive and made you confident. The only thing that made me have to quit was the warehouse. You would have to be at the warehouse at 6am and get all the parts you would be using that week. Most of the time they had the equipment but when they didn't you are screwed. When you get issued a workorder it would tell you what you needed for the job and 40% of the time it was wrong and after driving 45min - 2 hours to the job you would have to drive back and get the contract gear. Wouldn't be an issue but you got paid by the job not by the hour.
good,"i found them not really concerned with "
good,They talk to you any kind of way. They don't really care about you as an individual. They make you stay on the phoes with them all day and you cant get a sale
good,Wake up early out all day no breaks constantly working will have a burnout. I learned somethings on customer service. My Co-workers were constantly fighting.
good,"Besides the fact that you're literally repeating the same exact call flow every time you pick up your phone, the place is a disaster. The working environment was the worst i have ever experienced. The only thing I learned from this job is to keep my standards HIGH and not to settle for anything. Working for this company was an absolute nightmare. My pay was never the same amount although i worked the exact same hours every week. The bonus programs were only suited for the floor supervisors who did absolutely nothing but make my job more difficult. The majority of employees were x-cons which wouldn't have been a problem if they had left their criminal activities outside of the workplace and performed in a professional manner while clocked in. This includes my immediate supervisors. The hardest part of working for this company was the lack of professionalism, the inaccuracy of the payroll, the out right lies about bonuses, and of course dealing with the employees who didn't approach their job with any level of professionalism at all."
good,This job I made calls out to customer all day making them interested in getting at&t uverse cable service.
good,"Aprendí a utilizar la palabra como medio de comunicación."
good,i worked anywhere from 100 to 120 hours a week with little time off and pretty much all of that was used sleeping. Never had time off for holidays left alone family time. Pay was not worth the hours or stress
good,-Handle incoming calls form AT&T customers
good,Responsibilities:
good,AT&T call center is more for a younger person starting out in clerical / customer service work.
good,Att was a pretty good company to work for besides the managers that always micro manage you and never gave you advancement when you were doing a good job.
good,"Ambiente de trabajo muy estresante, los jefes carecen de habilidades de liderazgo."
good,"My manager was not very nice. My experience wasn't very good, but the customers were a lot of fun. And the product basically sold itself. I enjoyed being able to speak to the crowd."
good,There were many friendly employees at this location who cared about the job and that the job was completed correctly. On the job training was up to speed.
good,"Unable to continue to work for this company due to ageism.  Had prior experience there, and times have dramatically changed.  Young managers have no idea of how to work with people of different age groups.  If new managers were in place to support and assist representatives, the turnaround factor would be very low.  Before I left there they had new training classes every three months."
good,Working for them in the call center wasn’t bad. But at the same time the contract wasn’t stable and I didn’t have a job after the first year of being there. They pulled there contract and put everyone out of work
good,Working for AT&T started off great with pay but after a few years of constant commission changes and a revolving door with managers and poor managers forced my decision to leave the company after almost 10 years.
good,"Depending on who you are assigned to determines your breaks as well as  where you are placed.  Therefore, if your supervisor doesn't know you or like you, you will probably not like the position."
good,"The managers were obviously purposely stressed and pushed that stress on workers.  The work itself was challenging and fulfilling, but management expected much too much in terms of productivity.  I'm certain AT&T made enough money to hire more technicians and reduce the stress, but they chose not to do so.  I would have stayed if the work was 45 hours or less and the pay the same, with lower expectations, and I think customers would also have been happier with less hurried technicians."
good,Not what it used to be. company bundles every job under a few titles as they can to avoid advancement. Co workers and management are great. The problem is cooperate where people that just get out of college make the calls that never have stepped foot in the other end of the guidelines
good,"After working in the field for several years, I realized that the company was reducing technical field workers due to advancements in technology, fiber i.e. The number of more senior field technicians far outweighed the available management openings."
good,"Too much micromanagement  bottom line driven not employee driven , highly political .Benefits are good , chances of promotion are not . The team that I work with is awesome ."
good,"work in all elements. lots of hrs to be worked. learn how to work under lots of stress. become a troubleshooting wizard. meets lots of people,some good some bad"
good,"AT&T is a joke. I came there with high hopes just hoping maybe it would be different than other call center jobs, well they lied about everything. I go there with a smile through just to get through my day."
good,"I think working at At&t was full of great experience, but needless to say that their commitment to delivering the best customer service possible was their main motto, sometimes this was at the expense of its employees. We didn’t work by hour so at times we stayed behind for 1 or 2 hours and those were never compensated or even recognized."
good,Upper management failures have caused massive layoffs while those at the top reap the rewards of short term savings at the detriment of workers and customers.  AT&T saw massive gains in new tax savings and made promises it failed to keep.  Failure to keep those promises has impacted workers across the country as well as rising prices for consumers.
good,"Because of the numerous system problems, strict rules, time constraints, long hours, faint union comrades, never too hot or too cold to work according to mgmt, and the lack of compassion from management, AT&T is easily one of the worst companies to work for as a Wiring Technician."
good,Not treated appropriately with the responsibility and customer contact . No loyalty to their employees that go above and beyond. No work and home balance list my job to a injury in the job after hours and hours of time put into company I was released and left with nothing . The union did not help me in any way my workman’s comp was reduced I lost a car and my health insurance was also canceled by the company not fair or right to treat a dedicated employee this way after a on the job injury
good,"I was sexually attacked at the work place. I filled a police report. Management did not do anything to the person who attacked me, just the opposite, I was told I would be in trouble for insabodination if I talked to anyone concerning the attack. I quit my job, two years before my twenty years. I felt management did not take the attack seriously. It scared me to come to work and face the person who attacked me."
good,"Contracted through Working Solutions specifically to raise their ""Willingness to Recommend"" metrics, I was treated like I was incapable of progressing through the program, even though I was meeting and sometimes exceeding their metrics. Disorganized leader and very cliquish in their approach to growing employees through their organization."
good,"We would start the day with some fun sales exercises. then we would split into teams and head out to different areas of milwaukee and the surrounding areas. Our job was to go door to door asking people if they had AT&T, and if they didn't, try to sell them on purchasing the latest in U-Verse home phone and internet packages. Our day would start at 8 A.M. and would not end until almost 7 or 8 P.M. 6 days a week. It was a very demanding job where you were on your feet 90% of the time. I learned how to be quick with information and that i wasn't suited for sales. I didn't like misleading people to make a commision. The best part of the job was every Tuesday we would go out for dinner as a team and celebrate a week well done."
good,"Poor management, unrealistic metric structure. Company has an out dated and ridiculous safety policy. No accountability on part of the managers. No room for advancement, at least with the DirecTV side of the company"
good,It's a great job if all you care to do is work and make money and not have a personal life outside of work. poor management and little no no paid time off.
good,"poor management "
good,"Used to be a great company to work for, now it's just a mess. Management playing favorites/clicky, no kind of compliment of good work, always ""opportunities to grow"". You don't make your numbers and you're being a decent human being on the phone? Oh no buddy, too human, you're fired."
good,do not work here if you value anytime with family not a healthy environment stress level too high by management who only cared about their numbers etc
good,This job like any other payed the bills. Management was all over the place and very unorganized. The position required a lot more than what was told and we were under payed.
good,No work life balance and compensation is terrible. management does not care about or fight for employees. they clock you out for lunches even when you have not taken a lunch
good,"Working for AT&T is extremely frustrating.  The expectation for your sales goals are constantly ballooned to the point that achieving them is near impossible.  The tolerance for low sales is extreme and turnover is extremely high. The hardest part is the constantly changing commission structure, which is the majority of your take home.  One month the requirement pays a healthy amount, the next month, that requirement is removed and shifted to another area that is much harder to achieve."
good,"Each year the company is in constant turmoil, from furloughs to layoffs. That combined with the below average compensation makes this a touch place to work."
good,VXI Global is just okay if you do not want a career. Its a good place for a house wife. Training took 6 weeks. When you got on the floor its all different
good,"Worked as a technician for three years. Perks were full benefits, employee discounts,  good pay, and little supervision. Cons were the constant changes in management. Often we're pressured to overlook the quality of work over quantity."
good,"Once you completed training & were out in the field with a partner, that's when it went down hill.  We were taught the newest ways to do things & in the field the were doing whatever they wanted with no follow up."
good,"Door to door sales man for marketing company"
good,AT&T was once a company that was promising. There was always an option for growth. That option doesn't exist anymore. This is a place now where you simply come to work and you are required to meet a metric that is sometimes out of reach. The atmosphere is negative and there is no career growth anymore. This is a temporary stopping place in one's life. This is not a place where you can have a successful career anymore.
good,Need better people as sales manager. At&t have to hire people according to there performance and not because they were in line. Friendship and business can't mix in the stores.
good,"Working for att has been a very tiring and cumbersome experience, while the money may be good for housing just barely above the poverty level, the social life with friends and family is non-existant."
good,Would have loved a better work environment! They need better pay scales and commissions. Also better management would have been a plus! It was not a good environment for a female
good,Too much stress  working in At&t call centers. They keep raising sales goals while cutting our commissions.  Management turns their   head to people not handling accounts properly if the reps are getting sales.
good,Looking for something more like a 9 to 5 position/telecommuting. I have been able to increase my knowledge with AT&T for the last 8 in a half years i have been with the company
good,"I never knew I could hate working somewhere so much. There was a very unsupportive atmosphere and the turn over was in the high end of 70%. There was very little encouragement and practically no advancement opportunities. I was there for a year before I found a tree job and that was extremely rare to the point where they had to reset all of my systems and access tied to my id which never happenes so it took them almost a month to figure it out and get everything updated. So I was basically made into a personal assistant for every manager there since I couldn't access my systems. I could t get out of there fast enough!"
good,"No regard for their employees.  Like to file false reports against employees and claim they informed employees without informing them to use as justification for termination.  This was prior to them unionizing, and was terminated within 3 days of unionization so they would not compensate me, or several others with the bonus as part of the deal."
good,"The company only cares about themselves. You do a good job and no one tells you, Learned a lot working with different systems and people."
good,At one point I loved my job and I thought it was secured. I was there for over nine years and one day I was told that my job was about to come to an end.
good,poor management. Does not consider opinions of workers.It's there way or no way. Very high turnover rate. But hey this company is here to stay and only getting better. Poor work life balance.
good,"Goals for 2020 are to reduce headcount by 100,000.  The older workers are being retained as they will likely retire in the next few years."
good,At Convergys a day at work was like a day at a daycare. The management there has their favorites. I just really never have seen a company so unorganized I work For AT&T thru Convergys..
good,"El sueldo esta muy bajo , la administracion mala y tuve problemas con mis pagos"
good,"Good place to work definitely not the best, poor management and weak commission compensation plan. Given the fact that consultants are supposed to stand throughout the day on the sales floor, there should be a better hourly rate starting off with the company not just $9.50 an hour."
good,"there is no flexibility, the hours are inconsistent as well as the commission plans. The health benefits are good as well as the tuition reimbursement although its hard to go to school with an inconsistent schedule."
good,"I hold the team up."
good,"Pay is decent, benefits are great, call center environment is comparable to one if the worst nightmares you will ever experience. "
good,"my job can be very stressful at times i try my best to get my work done in a efficient time frame and help the customer's restore their phones,internet, etc...  The hardest part about my job is reaching a technician hold times can be long at times"
good,a typical day at revana / directv call center was always fast paced. the work environment was mentally draining and the lack of support from management was a key factor to my leaving the company. the agents that take the calls are enjoyable but the job itself I do not recommend.
good,"my first sales job , very enlightening "
good,working for u-verse call center in san Antonio TX was very frustrating I feel. the work wasn't hard and the people that work along side me were great . its just that it felt like our job was hard because the team of people that came before us weren't doing there job correctly. therefore it made us do duties that were not necessarily ours.
good,The best part of this job is the pay. The worst part of working for this company is job security and no room for advancement.
good,"This is a great job for a short term investment. If you are going to school it is Perfect!. you get paid a lot and you will be better off than most part time position."
good,"customer services, sales, billing, tech support, warranty"
good,"1. Hours are non-standard hours for most positions, 90+ hours per week are not uncommon for some positions."
good,"It paid the bills, bonuses got smaller and nobody knows anything about the paid time off there. As I was signing my exit review when I resigned, the HR admitted that she has no idea how it works and that she kept getting denied PTO.  How unorganized does a company have to be to not even understand how PAID TIME OFF WORKS?!"
good,I personally worked for red Skye Wireless lets start with commissions isn't that great and you better be on your toes they will fire you for the littlest mistake even if its your first other then that great pay do miss working there but only because I was making good money without the commission
good,"AT&T is a really good company to work for. The opportunities are almost endless, just not in Louisiana."
good,Management is hard Management is hard and no work life balance
good,"Report to work 6am, learned to install and troubleshoot satellite system. Management focused on senior employees first. Hardest part of job was not being able to get supervisory help or advice on issues other employees couldn't help with."
good,I enjoyed the call center/customer service environment. I enjoy fixing people's problems. The medical benefits that I had were amazing. One drawback was the constant change of managers that I had throughout the years. There was a lot of turnover. 
good,"I helped At&t business cell customers and telecommunications  managers with their accounts and devices. I liked helping people resolve their issue,   which could be anything from tech support to billing."
good,"I did not work here for very long, but it is a typical call center environment."
good,"Horrible management, money driven company, no mercy for employees, high management turnover. Have rules and guidelines in place to show concern for employees but constantly ask employees to break the rules to satisfy the customer or to get the job done."
good,"The pay was good. The Vision benefit were great. The health insurance was terrible. The job was fun when it was Bellsouth but AT&T took over, it just became tedious and redundant work. It got to be boring and they kept raising expectations without properly compensating. I enjoyed my time there, I did learn a lot, but there was no room for advancement (not really, anyway, considering our contract). All in all - it's a good place to be until you can find something better."
good,Would not go back there. They do not care what is goin on with a person you are just another body to fill a slot
good,its not a geat place to work at. the managment is horrible and the goals are to high
good,At AT&T there is no work life balance. They do not tend to promote within no matter how hard of a worker you are. They do not value their employees. Compensation is horrible.
good,This job to me sucked. It was not well managed. The made promises that tehy could not keep.
good,Take inbound calls from people who are having issues with there phone or with there bill or would like to pay there bill. My boss was never ready or available for questions so I had to go to my area manager a lot. This job was bot very hard just a little stressful. Best part of the job was the meditation rooms and the casual days.
good,Great company benefits but not much room for advancement and can remain stuck in a beginners position for long periods of time. Great compensation if you work efficiently towards your goals but unrealistic targets can be extremely frustrating.
good,Care more for the customers and not about the sales. Some of the managers care more about sales than their employees. Work life balance could be better.
good,"Como técnico de servicio, tienes que hacer de todo menos dar servicio, los inventarios cíclicos semanales son pesados, además no sólo es un inventario son dos, el de equipos y el de accesorios, no te puedes ir, ni descansar si el inventario no cuadra, te dejan solo y a tu suerte haciendolo a esto sumarle que si de la administración pasada falto algo te lo cobran aunque no tengas nada que ver o seas nuevo, todo eso sin dejar de atender a los vendedores que te piden equipos y accesorios para los clientes, recibes mercancías y ""controlas"" todo lo que entra y sale, no hay espacio para comer y muchas veces ni tiempo, comes parado muchas veces, no hay espacio ni ventilación, estas enclaustrado.. El título del empleo debería ser almacenista y ayudante general.. El sueldo es de 6400 lo cual es muy bajo..."
good,Great company work great people great just need better management and  better commission everything  is good hours is great for young great experience.
good,"I worked at AT&T for 8 years.   My reason for leaving is because when they bought Directv upper management would coach you into selling services in an unethical manner, when it came time to be investigated upper management would not have your back and admit to that’s how the sales team is coach and people would end up getting fired"
good,"micro management is the name of the game, cannot make any judgement calls without them jumping all over you, 54 hours a week required to complete a shift"
good,"Management took all the credit for my work and earned her a promotion for work knowledge she did not possess. They worked me up to 6 days a week (with OT Pay) but didn't give me a choice. I was under contract and at the end date, was just released with no follow up employment options."
good,This was not a direct AT&T role. I worked at Sutherland which was a client of AT&T. It was a call center environment which was challenging and rewarding.
good,"Promotions based on favoritism over performance and knowledge. No work life balance, no religious accommodations. Pay is terrible for the work you do. If you are not in their sales department, you don't make commission. For example I work retention and often have to sell new services or phones but receive no commission. Stores are constantly"
good,"Love working on game days, long days, like management, need better organization and call people with reasonable time to work.They don't have enough people to run the place sometimes."
good,"High sale goals, multiple things you had to sale. Always a threading to fire you if you didn’t meet the goals. Huge over turn on management and staff."
good,AT&T does not put its employees first. Job is not secured. You wont be able to have a personal life outside of work. If you dont have the proper tools or equipment to do the job the manager will leave it up to you to get the job done. They wont help you or get you what you need.
good,Very hard company to work for now and also very frustrating if you are type 1 diabetic. They either think they know about the disease or they know someone that is diabetic and think they know how they control it.
good,The management at this job could use so much improvement. Imagine coming to work without being acknowledged by your boss until the day is over or he needs you to do something. The lack of communication in this work space is unbelievable for a job that is supposed to be focused on teamwork. I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone. The business days are faster at the beginning of the month than any other time in the month. The sales quota we have to meet becomes hard to achieve when there are 5 people on the floor on a weekend and we only get a few sales.If you do not meet the quota you will not get any commission. The most enjoyable part about the job is working with some of my coworkers we have created a system within ourselves to make sure we meet weekly goals even when someone is not  there.
good,"This is legacy company, good to work but over the years Management is outsourcing all jobs. So no job security and career growth. "
good,"No room for growth within the company. Poor management team. The company offered no real bonuses. Turnover rate High. Employees working in the call center over 15 years still stuck doing the same thing making barely enough to get by, and working multiple jobs to feed their families"
good,nothing to say.  no life to be had  if you work for  them. if you are young and have no family then this is the place for you. but if you want to have a loife then stay away. nor room for advancement at all!!!!!!!!!!
good,"Management  claims they are looking out for you and your team but really only looking out for themselves. Also tries to find ways of shorting your work time on a job when a job really takes longer due to problems in wiring and signal flow. Hardest part of the job is being in all weather conditions, up and down ladders many times a day, dealing with management calling when you have already let them  know the job requires more time, and have to work long hours some days that extended into 12+ hours. Best part of the job was the travel, to be away from your area and see new places, but if you get even one write up, kiss it good bye for 6 month."
good,"Pretty standard retail mobile sales position. Decent benefits, opportunity for advancement due to constant changes in company structure. Disagreements between company and union often end up being worked out to the disadvantage of the employee."
good,"When I started with AT&T the job was exciting, and I felt like I was actually making an impact, and that I had opportunity for growth. After 3-4 years, and extremely poor management decisions, and poorly conducted business practices, the job has become more of a chore than something that I can take pride in and look forward to going to every day. I enjoy what the job actually entails, I just can't get behind some of the company's decisions anymore."
good,Management is constantly changing. Many managers want you to be aggressive and don’t take no for an answer. There are a lot of backhanded things done behind the scene to get the sale. If you have any type of integrity this job is not for you. They love snakes in this company
good,"Typical work day consist of talking on the phone. On a busy day, the phone will ring nonstop. There are two 15 minute breaks with an hour lunch. The culture of the workplace is not the best. Some of the managers will assist you with hard issues and some of them will not.The hardest part about the job is not having a lot of authority to fully assist customers. The most enjoyable part of the job are the benefits."
good,The company has has 3 reorgs this year (2019) and several members of the team I was on were let go with no notice.  The project just kept the less paid/inexperienced workers.
good,"I am going to be honest, its a great place to get your foot in the door into the Telecom Industry. If you are not upper management the benefits are pretty bad. One of the largest Telecom providers in the U.S and they stripped the benefits of being a part of the team. No real stock options, you get to pool your money with other co-workers and the 401k is pretty bland. When I first started you had way more control on where the money for your 401k was being invested in. Instead its been done away with. "
good,I left Att as a wire technician because I could see the lay offs coming I would not take a job at att as any type of wireline tech right now. The company is an entertainment company now not a communications company .
good,"A lot of pressure at work. Difficult to balance work and life. AT&T is always trying to cut costs so job security is out the window. However, benefits and pay are good."
good,"Everyday is very repetitive."
good,"No matter how hard you work and how much you bend over backwards cor them, they will not help you.  Can't even get a day off unless there is s death.  They offer PTO but with rules making it impossible like at all time 3 employees must be working and you cant have anyone cover you if they will go above 40hrs. And many locations only have 3 people scheduled on shift making sick days and any form of PTO nearly impossible and any tardiness or lack of sales becsuse your location is slow or hours are during slow time will be used against you as well as sales made by not installed due to trees of the installer (only way to keep your job is by selling Directv)"
good,"CWA has become a tool for executive management. "
good,"Bad upper Management, which creates hostile work environment among store employees. Commission percentages constantly change. Incentives for high sales are quickly changed or removed."
good,The company i worked for was a authorized retailer and the management was horrible pay was when they felt like paying u and they expected u to work like a animal
good,"The hours worked were probably 70 per week with manadatiry overtime."
good,"No chance to move up, the management team is always trying to find a way to fire you at anytime. You have yo go to work everyday wondering if you still have a job."
good,"There are some really great people there. But somehow, amidst all the talent in the company, underqualified and poor leaders get promoted, while hard working and talented leaders remain underpaid and stagnant in their career growth. The company has lost its moral compass, having senior leadership push unethical practices for short term results. The entire level 2 leadership team and many of their direct supervisors are engaged in highly unethical behavior, and eventually the company will have to address it, or lose customers. The two cannot coexist. The HR nightmare that is the sales team overshadow any discount or benefit that the company may offer. Avoid the entire retail channel and you may be ok."
good,"While working at AT&T, the majority of people were decent people and the job tended not to follow you when you went home. There seem to be few advancement opportunities and the ones available seem like too much stress for the compensation."
good,"No es una empresa que se preocupe por su personal , no respeta horarios , no pagan horas extras , te hacen ser como vendedor un aval de los clientes y tu sueldo nunca es seguro"
good,"Management is under immense pressure to exceed goals and this is passed down to the underlings. A typical day involves a meeting about performance with at least 3 different managers at different inconsistent, inconvenient times. These meetings are unavoidable even for those exceeding their metrics."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working from home. The hardest part was part about the job is getting in contact when someone when you need help.
good,The Job of wire tech is very stressful..... however the management and culture simply make a terrible place to work. This however is a recent change in the last 3 years
good,"Have to be willing to go under houses and in attic spaces. Long days and late nights. You meet a lot of people and learn more in the field, than you do in training. A lot of micro management"
good,"I worked for AT&T for 4 months doing door to door sales, during that time I worked horrible hours which made me have no home life or free time. The pay was horrible since it was fully commission based. Your manager decides everything about your job including hours worked, commissions received, areas you have and if you are able to start interveiwing which is how you get promoted. So if your manager doesn't like you then you get bad areas where people can't pass credit or arn't available for most services so you don't get paid at all and occasionally the manager will change the hours when you go into work that day so if you have anything planned for after work you have to cancel. They sometimes have mandatory night events for after work where you have to socialize with people from work so the job is everything to you so you won't quit because the job is all around horrible."
good,Job duties felt intrusive because i was interrupting peoples schedules at home. Trained to be pushy to gain entrance into prospective customers homes. I felt like i was preying on lower SES individuals.
good,exciting to work with different people with different and different energy. the different calls make you want to order things while looking  up info for them
good,Over the 9 years I worked with AT&T I developed a disability in my lower back as I worked in a call center environment. I have several bulging discs and a degenerating disc causing severe pain in my lower back after I sit for more than 5-10 minutes. The condition will require surgery and is a direct result from the job conditions and my disability was declined. I was not cleared to return to work from my doctor and I was fired. My benefits were backdated 4 months prior to my last day of employment and I was billed for the expenses the disability case required to continue my case.
good,"The position was fast paced based on a quota."
good,"All of At&t is not operated poorly. The sales department, is not organized its stressful, not accommodating Poorly ran, inconsistent and overall not a good work environment to b e in."
good,"Peers are great and smart, hard working. Management is unorganized and not in sync.Many processes are removed before a replacement can be brought online. This causes a lot of additional manual work."
good,spirit of family and fun in the work place but lack of benefits and of advancement. salary is not enough for the job description the hardest part of the job is you have to deal with Irate and lots of complaint customer but as a customer service rep. you need to meet the customers needs and satisfaction.
good,At&t no longer cares about its employees. They are renaming  the job titles to offer lower pay. Everyone is no stressed and about 90% of the employees are seeing a psychiatrist.
good,"I worked for a TPR AT&T , so I didn't get to experience the corporate rules and regulations. the TPR company was not in order, we were under paid , took money away from our commission, worked over 50+ hours every week. never received overtime because they said it was a ""salary"" but if we missed a day we would get deducted"
good,I liked doing my work but the various back handed things the upper management in HR are doing is insulting. Like job title changes to employment status changes without any prior notification or exact cause.
good,No consistency. Management is hardly available. Advancement is selective.  The pay is mediocre. The training is definitely not the best. The supervisors are sometimes very slack.
good,"the job itself of answering calls and doing technical support isn't terrible. It's how backwards the management is. They'll hire you saying one thing then do the complete opposite once out on the floor. They also care too much about stats, which, in turn effects how agents do on the phones poorly."
good,I liked working there but they felt there wasn't enough mail traffic so they transferred me to Bausch & Lomb to check the copiers there that's why I'm there now.
good,very fast paced call center with back to back customer calls and complaints. The most enjoyable part about working with AT&T was the coworkers I made many friends I still have today.
good,"huge load of work pressure in compare to salary, the rate is too low, and huge scope of work. Job training is not quality and sufficient to prepare a rep to start serving the customer."
good,Days are long and stressful. Upper management does not value front line employees. Managers often bad talk their employees to each other and create a hostile work environment.
good,"Lack of training, help desk was not my choice, I enjoy installing hardware, pulling cable, setting up equipment. It was a temporary"
good,This job isn't made for you to succeed. When you make your numbers consistently you may get investigated for cheating & when you don't make your numbers you'll get written up. But this also depends where you work & what kind of leadership you're under.
good,can't even begin to describe the things i had to deal with to get my money from Spring Mobile.  If an employee has to travel 3 hours total to work every day you need to pay them travel pay.
good,"Working in an extremely numbers driven field. You may be working offline, but you are expected with little to no training to master your field and exceed expectations always. Rules are constantly changing and you have to master Excel without the full compensation. Pay is fair if you live in a two-income family, otherwise you will barely be able to make rent and buy food. Excellent, stable work, but very stressful and challenging."
good,i did not enjoy working for AT&T. they did not focus on their employees as people but rather numbers. Worked very long hours with little pay and benefits
good,"Needs some improvement for the call center workers, that's it I have worked here for 4yrs and I must say management is not all that but what company is prefect?!"
good,Cellular One & Cingular Wireless both were a top notch places to work before they became AT&T Mobility. Like all big corporations jobs do not last long.
good,True definition of impersonal corporate employer.  Hires without qualifying and mismanages current employees.  No work/life balance.  Hours are long and expected.
good,The sales quotas are crazy and the commission keeps getting cut.  Sell more and more and get little to nothing in return.  The staffing keeps getting cut and there is no end in site.  Managers are like stalkers and are always in your interaction with the customers.
good,"Most stressful four and a half years of my life, management is a complete failure. if you have a family that you like to spend time with this is not the job for you. The hours are long, they force 6 day work weeks, most times working 10+ hr shifts"
good,Dont care to waste my time giving a review.  Pay was good to start off with but as the company started buying more than they could sustain they started modifying the pay scale and employees suffer from the upper management.
good,We had deadlines for printer dates. We also had different shifts for our sales force. Worked different states. Always met printer dates. Got the job done.
good,"Scheduling is computer generated & selected based on seniority."
good,originally with DIRECTV then when ATT took over the culture changed. the innovation was replaced with gross financial oversight stifling creatively and the desire to be part of something big or at least meaningful.
good,every day is extremely stressful i changed department several time and they allow there customers to abuse their reps. I felt like i was just a number and exposable
good,Love at&t. got laid off & wasn't able to go bk when positions were available. that was very disturbing to me. had 2 interviews 1 was off the record with manager I heard & the other a recruiter came into management office.
good,"They tell you they will work around your schedule and give you plenty of time off to be with your family. As soon as you are hired, they will send you anywhere they want and not care one bit if you are out for 16-17 hours per day."
good,"During my time with AT&T, I saw a transformation from a company that really rewarded its employees to a company that just squeezed every penny they could out of its employees. "
good,Great customer service reps and the customer's were also great. The company is based on numbers and productivity rather than self respect and accuracy. The company wants to train all employees to be in-human and product pushers more than a real person with emotions and feelings.
good,Responsible for new logo equipment sales.  Also did 2 years telemarketing over the phone.  Went through 4 weeks intense sales training.
good,The company encourages competition between co-workers. This doesn't always end well. The commission scale is constantly changing and you pay will change when this happens. This makes for inconsistent paychecks. That is not good. Management has no understanding of our job because none of them have ever done our job.
good,"Usually a fast paced environment with an emphasis on serving the customer's individual needs. I learned a lot about people with hearing and/or speech loss. Best part was helping those individuals,"
good,"-launch new product line U-Verse in the residential markets of Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit"
good,"Typical day a bunch of calls to take up most of the day, which gives little time to focus on your basis of the job."
good,Overall it is like any call center however they engage in wildly inconsistent business practices with their customers and enployees. This results in an environment that does jot engender trust or respect in any capacity.
good,"I worked in the customer retention department, which was a very stressful department due to angry customers, the job would have been easier if the management team was part of the day to day interactions with the customers. "
good,"Lots of hours and lots of work to be done, it is only for the driven and detail oriented. You have to work hard to earn decent income."
good,the management stinks they only worry about numbers not you. the way you get paid is lousy compared to the amount of work and time put in to do a job.co workers and nice customers make you want to stay with the job.
good,"Inbound call center, retention call center, learn how to manage a irate customer. "
good,"Provided with proper training for wire technician"
good,Remote Offices are managed very differently from Main HQ and corporate offices. WBS erodes the further away from corporate one is. Communication and work life balance are poor and divisions are siloed.
good,"This is a customer service job however not for everyone. The job is consist of hard sales. No is never the answer, and I can't isn't either. They insist you sale products to customers that are calling in about their bills however if they want to lower their bill they won't buy more. The employees was cool. The management has very bad communication skills. They act concerned about their employees, but they only are worried about sales and who is the top sales person. They did give bonuses and incentives for things that was sold to encourage employees. Typical inbound call center for customer service issues, Billing, questions on services, and quotes about Direct Tv."
good,"It's a highly professional environment."
good,"I get to work at 8 am and work till well after dark, I don't see my wife or kids at all due to working too much, and am so stressed out over performance metrics."
good,Not really many chances for advancement. Very low pay. Many improvements needed at that time.
good,"I truly did not enjoy the time I was there. The job experience was something I wish not to experience again. The management team truly only thought about the compensation, and not the overall of the employee."
good,If you don't put money in the managers pocket you will get the short end of the stick. Manager rule your world and will make your life very differential
good,"It is a sales environment and everything that entails. Some people thrive and they get taken care of. Others just work hard and go home unhappy. I loved who I worked with, made some lasting friendships. I enjoyed learning about the mobility industry. Being a union was tough and unproductive at times but had great benefits!"
good,"Basically the same thing everyday, I took a 9 week training that was not that helpful. Management is poor, I never knew who my manager was. Co-workers some are helpful. The hardest part of the job was being assured that someone would be there to help and answer questions and no one was ever really there, what I most enjoyed was the competition for sales"
good,"Times have changed over the past 22 years."
good,"Not a great job, not an awesome job. If you like mediocre tips, this is the job for you."
good,i will not disclose the worklife at this company because io have more negative than positive to say about the company and I'd rather not bash them 
good,"Job okay, chances for advancement typical of telecommunication company."
good,just not the type of comaly that i would have a bright future with management was pretty much children.
good,Great job if you're single. Having a home life and a job like this expect to have little to no family time.
good,"i did not work here very long very stress full enviroment, however amasing pay rate"
good,"I received inbound calls from a mass mailer sent by suncom wireless for free cell phones my job was to have customer agree to a two year agreement in return for a free phone, on average I would closed 60% of the customers I spoke with"
good,All you do is answer phones after 9 weeks of pointless training
good,"long hours on a salary 10-12 aday 6 days a week for only 600 aweek, and every 6 months 80% of employees were let go and replaced"
good,"This was a great experience and helped me with my skills working with the public and working Table Games. The management was tight and secure, but helpful."
good,"A typical work day includes sales and customer service, but 95% is sales."
good,"the financial benefits were great, having less egotistical leadership would've been better"
good,"Stressful work enviorment, the company wants to move to texas, no unions and cheaper realestate"
good,"Difficult environment for a sales representative. Compensation was cut in half due to the ""recession"", yet goals were increased."
good,"Overall it is a pretty descent company to work for, it can be very challenging mentally, and some times physically depending on your job. Management are more concern about metrics than the actual employee experience. Advancement is based on sonority and work/life balance is horrible. However I have learned to be more responsible for myself and my actions dealing in customer service. You definitely will work mandatory overtime and holidays, the pay is reasonable."
good,Customer service is sometimes overlooked by the number driven culture   Not family friendly work hours in retail positions   Great for single people or college student  versatile work locations
good,Personally I don’t want or feel a need to get into details but honestly if you want to succeed in this company major in something that they need because of you have a degree in something else and you’re a front line employee you’ll have to be the best at what you do naturally because they will not give those who slack the proper training needed to actually succeed in a sales/customer service environment.
good,"I enjoyed working AT&T at first, however, over time the number of hours and days worked to keep me from enjoying time with my family. As a manager, you were required to work 7-days a week and be on call 24 -7. Although the company stressed safety and work-life balance after working with them for 6 months I realized they did not care about you or their technicians."
good,No work life balance. Layoffs every quarter. Live like you are poor because you never know when you will be in the bread line. No job security at all. Cut throat. Trust no one.
good,"I worked at AT&T for 1 year and 4 months. They provide great benefits and pay, however you may enter into a state of depression. It is a good thing AT&T gives an allocation for therapy sessions, because you will need them. I can't speak for the company as a whole, just on my personal experience. There were multiple times during my employment where I witnessed coworkers lying to customers in order to close the sale and hit their goals. There is a 14 day return/cancellation policy so by the time those customers realized they were lied to, it was too late for them to do anything about it. I pointed this out to management on multiple occasions, where I was brushed off and told that if I was ""good enough at my job"" I would know how to turn the issues into sales, even if the customer already had all of our services. They coach you on how to flip sales in order to bypass the system. There were also multiple occasions where install technicians talked customers out of a product after I sold it, because they were just too lazy to install it. "
good,"Work is too much for the pay. Tools are not competitive for 3 LOBS it always lags, or freezes and incentives are not that enticing either. A lot of customers complain about the offers and the services."
good,At&t is a shell of a company that it use to be. The metrics they hold sales consultant changes month to month and now want you to screw customers on monthly price or get out
good,"*No employee support more concern for “ bottom line”"
good,"I had an absolutely terrible experience working for AT&T as an authorized Dealer, management was horrible, and customers are extremely rude! Constantly getting threatened with termination if you didn't get a sale from a cold call that week  from a store in a country town with very little businesses."
good,"Call center work is not for everyone.  If you have thin skin, easily offended, fall to your emotions if verbally abused, yelled at, or generally berated for any reason, you should stay away.  You are not a person to the customer on the other end of the phone.  ""You"" are the company, and they will take out their frustrations at whatever reason they're calling customer care out on you.  Some people who stick it out there (who aren't mentally able to differentiate what the customer is saying about you is actually them talking about AT&T) would go home defeated, and depressed, stories of people sitting in their cars 15 minutes before work crying because they had to go in there are also common."
good,"the work life is thrilling, you meet new people, you make tons of money, you learn more skills than you walked in with. the cons are you don't see your family, you loose friendships, you don't always make the same commission a month. don't take the job if you cannot handle the long days and missing out on family or friends. this is a career not a job to walk into and take lightly. you will be held accountable and they do let you go for petty things. you will be expected to sell and pitch all products to every single person you speak too regardless if they want them or not or if they qualify credit wise or not. very cut throat environment but you have drive and like this you can do it."
good,"Extremely poor management. Does not correct time and never work weekend. Chyna Prude does not no what she is doing, The biggest mistake Vincent District manager made. Shame on yall!"
good,"I enjoyed the teamwork with my peer group, management under impressed. Management consistently showed lack of support and offered no real solutions to address issues."
good,Horrible management and customer service centers are worthless. No one cares about helping or getting anything fixed. Lots of pressure to meet goals that sometimes cant be met.
good,"Lower pay than T-Mobile or Microsoft. Disorganized program with too much management and yet not enough. Very nice management. I managed an advertising API that was key to attracting app developers, and yet it was a terrible choice (made before I got there) and I spent most of my time either researching issues or trying to get another solution, but cost was the only factor used in consideration of product selection."
good,"Overall, not a bad company to work for. Benefits are great except for time off. Advancement is solely based on networking. Payment structure changes often to keep reps from making too much money."
good,"Some days would be laid back and some would be super busy. Make sure that on thosr slow days have a business that always needs new stuff. A lot of stores have issues, just stay away from the drama. Do what your manager asks and just speak professional."
good,10 hours a day 7 days a week.  Only 2 days a month off.  It was hot and tedious. Burned out quickly. I would avoid if you have a family that you want to see.
good,"There was blatant corruption, cheating, and coordination in these efforts. Otherwise, the competition was fierce, and if you did the work, you got paid well. This place is not for the faint of heart. It takes guts, thick skin, strategy, and defense to get ahead here."
good,never knew when you could go home. horrible management. long hours and NO help from union. DO NOT work for them. It is all a lie. they will work you into the ground. the infrastructure for AT&T is too old and they WILL NOT fix it
good,Company does a great job at preparing for the large picture. Lost in the big picture is the little man trying to get from A to B. Leadership is being led by those who do not know how to lead.
good,At&t used to be a great place to work but now it hard to deal with all the small things. They keep adding atuff for us to do byut never add anything yo benefit us.
good,AT&T is a very corporate and beaureatic organization and I found it created a culture of mediocrity. I found managers tended to micromanage and indulged in drama often.
good,"A great company to work for if you want forced overtime. The pay is great for a call center job. Benefits are great, but unfortunately it is very difficult to get time off if you need to go to a dr."
good,"No job security two / three times of lay offs per a year, Benefits are not good, especially the health insurance for families are very expensive, management is not proactive and effective,"
good,"Management was routinely verbally abusive and difficult to work with. I mostly kept my head down and did my job, working my best to ensure customers were happy."
good,"Good salary but poor work environment.  Shifting priorities and ruthless surplus practices when someone is near retirement.  They promote internally to be the fast pace environment of a google or apple but they have little interest in letting collaboration groups work out complex problems but would rather pay consultants to figure out direction and design.     Great job security for those in Dallas, Atlanta, and Redmond."
good,"I love my job I really do,management not so much. They care about nothing but stock holders. We work long hours which is fine with me because the pay is good but I doubt At&t will allow me to stay around until retirement. They only want to cut costs anyway they can."
good,"Good pay, bad management.  They told you to do something without proper training and then criticized you when you got it done.  HR would not fire techs that needed to be let go.  To worried about lawsuits..."
good,this company does not have any health benefit at all. we have to come out of pocket to pay for our sick time off. we do not get a lot inventory to provide to customer needs.
good,"There is little to no opportunity for promotions and career development. Compensation is not competitive. There is little to no communication between departments and management rarely gives direction clearly and concisely. Although, AT&T has good benefits and PTO."
good,My job was going different areas of Miami FL to get new customer and and old customer back with sales I had take the bus . It was ok because I was able to make new people and make friends the bad was only c commissions pay and you had a sale the call center would take the sale for they're self and if you didn't sell you would not get paid for the day. I was not have a sale take from me.
good,AT&T is amazing at first. The pay is good and the benefits are amazing. The management is lacking. It’s a sales job with all the typical downfalls of a sales job.
good,has ruined the company they just bought out. monopoly that is pushing out their employees.  Benefits are about the same as they were before but now our life-work balance is horrible.
good,Not in to reviews   not into reviews   not into reviews   location is  great ..    People are great met some good people  there .  Had a great time  with the  people
good,"Once I start my shift, I am reviewing my projects that need to be completed. I am also checking on new projects that have come in and evaluating them."
good,"Working for ATT was an adventure everyday.  You'll never know what's the company next step.  We always here about layoffs every quarter."
good,At&t is a good place to work at if you do not mind not having a set sch. Depending Where you work in the state business varies between slow and busy. The job was like school you have to learn about every new product that came in.
good,"Some days at work are very hard and stressful. The hardest part of the job is not having a steady upper level to assist you when needed. There is a lot of stress between most working for ATT. I enjoy the work, but if you are not treated with respect then its not a happy place to work for. One should be able to enjoy their job and be able to think positive and want to come to work."
good,I was one of the top sellers in my center and a rival team's sales coach got a promotion now the whole first two years I was there she never liked me but could not do anything to me because I was never on her team. she got a promotion and my direct supervisor quit immediately. after she became manager she did everything in her power to get rid of me.
good,"not much room to advance, if you get hurt you are done, helps to be related to management. Pay is good when they allow overtime, the Union is a mess,  job security depends on what role you have, benefits used to be great now very expensive. overall it was just ok."
good,"Empresa que no respeta a sus trabajadores y cruza límites poco profesionales, poco confiable."
good,"Good discounts and benefits.Pay is not bad, but there is always room for improvement. Very hard to get out of the technician role. Very hard to move up in the company unless you know someone."
good,"Poor management and poor job work/life balance. You get your schedule based on seniority, thus it changes every month. They force you to work overtime. Sales quotas are unattainable for the most part."
good,"When it went from Cingular to AT&T things went down hill. Very political, they own your life, to make advancement, you need to have the right connections. Many good employees surplussed, (bought out). It is not what it used to be."
good,the work that you do is not reconized..if you did not hang out with certain people you only got moved from store to store to hire another family member in the store for the position you were applying for
good,AT&T has very good benefits but the pay for non commission roles are very low. Advancement is best determined by who you know as opposed to what you know or how well you perform.
good,Was a very stressful job dealing with upset customers for 8 to 12 hours a day. Management was all was pushing for shorter time on phones instead of allowing us to complete all requests
good,Union environment with obtainable sales goals. Full time position with good benefits although there isn’t much opportunity for career advancement but you do get a raise every 6 months and every February
good,"ATT was a great place to work, except there was very little job security.  You always knew that layoffs would happen and that they effected even the best workers."
good,"As a technician, you never know what you're going to get day-to-day. Just when you think you're almost done for the day, two more jobs will be put on you!"
good,This job has very strict attendance policy & metrics including sales. You never know what you’re hours are going to be due to shift bids every six months & no raises only from the CWA Union.
good,Not a very good experience I had to resign because they wanted me to choose att over my wife who was in a accident and need to be taken to the hospital att needs to take a long look at there policies and make some improvement they also changes work hours too frequently and they give you mandatory overtime without consulting you on what days could work for you not caring if you have to pick up kids and then they give you write ups if you can't make it even though you were not given the option to see if you are available
good,I worked there for a year and a half and killed myself for them. Never shown any appreciation and stepped on like a door mat. Only positive was pay. It's a good start but not a career
good,You cannot go use the bathroom and management is terrible. Pay is just okay but with what you have to put up with it is not near enough. Its all about stats no matter the situation.
good,AT&T was once a great place to work for. However in the last 5 or so years there were more and more lay off rounds going on. Have talked to many people and all most agree that AT&T is not a place that you can retire from anymore. No one feels safe or secure.
good,"I enjoyed my time with AT&T, and was sad to move on. My team worked well together.  I strived to achieve sales quotas, as well as tracked all sales made by my team to figure and pay commission. I tracked all products and maintained inventory."
good,"Management, Long work hours, and cutthroat mentality make it stressful. Work life balance is horrible. Its very very very difficult to maintain a personal life."
good,"My interview wasn't with AT&T directly. I was working for a company that worked for AT&T. They hired sales associates to go door to door, selling their services. The job description for this position leaned toward a receptionist type of job. It wasn't until after the interview that I realized it was a sales position I was just hired into. I only lasted 2 weeks at the job due to only being paid if I made a sale (rarely the case because I was learning job duties and sales tricks every morning and had a few hours to go into the field). I was also required to use my own vehicle without compensation for the amount of time and the amount of gas I was using each day. I spent a total of 10 per day, only being paid $70 for the entire 2 weeks I was an employee there. I was very disappointed in how much I was compensated for the amount of work I did each day."
good,"9 hour days with 1 hour lunch.  micromanaged,  15 minutes twice a day for breaks but 30 seconds late, gets ""mentioned""    "
good,Very productive and I leaned a lot of different skill sets to help generate revenue. The culture was diverse. There was no hard part of the job when I was employed there.
good,started off great but when u get to the top pay they try to to anything to get you out the door. they work you into the ground before i left we had mandotary 6day 10hr work shift. i had 6 different managers in 1 year.
good,I cannot accurately describe the work environment with AT&T. I worked on a project that was contracted out. I believe ATT is more than likely a great place to work.
good,"Stress,an ironic lack of communication. Poor Work/life balance. Payment is extremely good at entry level. All employees under tremendous pressure to meet sales goals; service suffers as a result of this pressure."
good,"excellent company, outsourced front-line..... corporate is where you want to be unfortunately, very difficult to get there. management is not always promoted inhouse, but company is a great place to spend 8-10 hours of your day."
good,"Unfortunately, AT&T has outsourced a great deal of their internal IT organization.  I, being one of them.  "
good,"Great pay and benefits. however, your expected to do so much within a short amount of time. Upper management are results driven and often times forget that they are managing humans, not results. This company is always changing and is becoming an entertainment company aka less employees needed."
good,"The company is becoming a comcast, and focusing on home services. I did not feel confortable doing something asked when it came to pitching Direct TV."
good,"A typical day at work involves meetings, updating projects and providing status reports.  I have learned it is best to create relationships with staff and always be supportive with a good attitude."
good,"would never work here as a contractor again.  "
good,While the position was customer service...i would be reprimanded weekly for not pushing out products. They are more focused on sales than actually making customers happy.
good,"I worked through a contractor (Sutherland Global Services), it was a good start in the telecommunications industry, but left much to be desired. The higher level leadership was not interested in providing employees with a good work space. Lack of chairs, and facilities in disrepair is very disheartening."
good,I would never work for AT&T again they care more about their products than employees regardless of your tenure. And reporting issues to HR was a waste of time In our market.
good,In retail it’s hard to advance unless your getting over 150 monthly and it’s also very cut throat with the constant selling mentality. It’s like they want you to sell visual products to blind people.
good,"You clock in and immediately start helping customers. Managers are there to guide you if you have questions. Theres seems to be a new ""push"" every few months"
good,Tough place to work and trying to advance is almost impossible. You got to know someone to get considered for advancement. Not much job security with all the cut backs due to high dollar mergers
good,Management is difficult and not truthful.  Poor management support.  Definitely no job security or employee appreciation.  I enjoyed working with customers in helping to resolve their issues.
good,Me gustaría que se pudiera dar mejores oportunidades a corto plazo un ascenso o tal vez un bono serían una buena opción.
good,"not very desirable , high turn around "
good,Great compensation.   Used to be a great place to work 5-10 years ago.   Now everything is about doing more with less.  Outsource every job possible and lay off anyone making a decent salary.  There is no job security with AT&T anymore.
good,"AT&T was revered as skilled labor with competent, caring employees.  These employees have been, and will continue to be replaced with less skilled, incompetent, uncaring employees who work for 1/2 of the previous generation's wage.  Management seems to be part time, only concerned about what their boss wants, instead of customer's or employee's needs.  No one cares about the big picture or common goals.  AT&T has become the modern cable company with like minded employees."
good,"Although AT&T is a large company, with the changes in leadership, it became completely ""business"" oriented.  My mistake was to become boxed in a position that was eventually a surplus to the company but the atmosphere in the company was not flexible to allowances of moving to new jobs or responsibilities. I now know that work, for me, has to contain new challenges as well as bringing some fun.  Everyday should be greeted with an eagerness to get started.  I rarely enjoyed my career in the past 6 years so I will be careful in finding the right elements within my 2nd career."
good,"The focus at AT&T wasn't on the customer, it was on adding things on their account and getting them to spend more money by upgrading their services. It didn't matter how well you treated the customer if you didn't add something onto the account."
good,It will consume your life. they ask for more and more. they dissect everything you do and how you do it. it is a constant battle from union to management. I was a leading sales representative and was still pulled into an office just so it looked like everyone was being talked to. commissions changes every time a new product is out and it always involved doing more and getting paid less.
good,"Only work here if you have to, otherwise find something else to do with your time. It is very stressful and the management is poor which reflects poorly on the environment. The employees are also very pessimistic making an even negative situation worse."
good,IF you go to work for at&t you know what you're getting into. They're the largest telecom company in the world. They're a giant Utility company. You should expect to work a lot. There is no Work/Life balance. You work.
good,"Energetic and team playing is a big part. However, the department where I was in (service), was always the red headed step child of the company. Performance was never praised. Only employees praised were sales since they brought in revenue. Service employees were never recognized."
good,"No guarantee that you will get the shift you bid on.  It's an abusive culture because of the customers who call in.  You have to take it if you are cursed at or screamed at and you have to resolve complex problems in as short amount of time as possible or you can receive corrective action. They do offer a lot of training on new equipment and hold internal ""contests"" which tend to make for more pressure in your job."
good,A typical work day would start at 8:00 a.m. and there was definite end time for any workday. Management was so hit and miss on too many different issues we had a techs. The other techs I worked with were very easy to work with out in the field. But when it came to management it confused us all. The hardest thing about the workplace was getting a straight answer on anything. One of the few things I did like was I didn't have a boss over my shoulder micromanaging me. I didn't have to drive my own personal car to and from work. Having a family in this work environment was very hard.
good,It was great working there until it wasn't. The company laid a lot of people off due to cut backs. The work environment was calm and quite with a lot of friendly people.
good,No Full time position available on contract work.After 3years you have to sit out at least 6 months before returning to AT&T. T.hey need to change the workplace culture at AT&T
good,The management were constantly changing direction.  They had no idea how to achieve any goals.  I think their goals kept changing from day to day.  Not great thinkers.  Those who climbed were the ones that kept their heads the furthest in the sand.  They are lucky they had a product that people needed rather than wanted.
good,If AT&T cared as much about its employees as it does its shareholders this company would be amazing to work for. It is a cut throat environment with lack of job security.
good,"AT&T is huge company but all staffs are just working as pony."
good,"For the amount of work that there is, you would think major lay-offs would not be the talk every quarter. Metrics constantly changes hard to keep up with the standards and monthly goals."
good,"This company isnt family friendly or a fun place to work. I didnt enjoy how AT&T used people from other areas within the company to choose management, who didnt have experience in the field."
good,There are a lot of flaws within the wifi service branch of AT&T. These flaws outshine the pro's most of the time. This job is stressful at times but can also be fun.
good,WORK WORK WORK thats all you have to look forward too. If you have a family or life outside of work this is not the job for you or if you take pride in your work dont work here they want mules.
good,They pay decent have decent health care and benefits however it can be a stressful job. they lack empathy with where you live and if hired can assign you 30+ miles away from home. Management is constantly trying to get numbers which means forcing you to work harder than realistic expectation. The company wants super techs who do everything from start to finish when other positions are paid twice the amount for the same work. Union is horrible and lack bargaining skills and are unable to decipher the contract verbiage that they agreed too. work conditions range from awesome to extremely hostile in seconds. management monitor every move one makes from driving to things performed on work devices.  If suspended they will come down with the book and expect the union to fix after. Management say they care about the customer till it doesn't benefit them and have done actions to show quiet the opposite.
good,Management especially in the training organization lack transparency.  The training division have begun surplus of long time employees in favor of newer less experienced trainers.
good,"Long hours, no support, lost company"
good,they require alot and they work at home position required a lot of you time. and getting in touch with someone that can help you is impossible. and if your a contractor there is nothing to protect u from network drops
good,"My manager was amazing.  However, the company culture at AT&T stinks.  They don't treat employees well at all.  In fact, I wouldn't have stayed in that job at all if it wasn't for my manager (an exception to the rule).  Also, AT&T doesn't have much opportunity for career development in Software Engineering."
good,it was ok. they wouldnt really work with me on my schudle. i had to miss alot of things with my son because of the hours they had me working. but other then that it was ok. i quit because we moved to texas.
good,"At&t is a good company, it does create a culture of stress and resentment. The code of Business Conduct, is there to protect the company not the employees. Overall it was not a bad place to work."
good,"Retail Sales Representative/Business Representative"
good,"helping the internet chase its tail, clicks, bits, lies, scams, hidden subtext, greed, boredom, quantum spacklegrackle, help em out, useful tools, wangery, screaming, spurious knowledge, laundry, broad horizons, adz, psypying, sync, swm, nicotine sheen, copper, underground, spam, house, biz, mail, friendly folks, flat screen down the pants, fiber diet, stress, confusion, aerial, stratosphere, thoughts, grind, time out of line, confines, switch, bait, minds, equilibrium, skills, change, bots, jah help bless us, big G, behave urselfie, wandering, hoods, trucks, memories"
good,"up at six at office by seven, training sales reps till 9. Knock door to door till 12.  Conduct office responsibilities, return to knocking doors by4 to 8.  Enter sales for day to about 10. go home eat than repeat..."
good,Long hours and very hard to advance. AT&T is slowly changing the scope of work for Wire Techs to include service techs scope of work and not increasing pay scale to match.
good,Processes and management always changing so you have to get use to being able to adapt to changes. Job can be stressful at times but for the most part you know what to expect day in and day out.....................................................
good,"I worked for At&t for 16 years. The job itself is great but they say you have career advancement and that is not the case. I have seen managers personally pick people who are their drinking buddies or family members for advancement instead of the most qualified person. When it is brought to the company's attention they harass the employee until they terminate him or her. Most people that are passed for opportunities have more education than their bosses. I don't like throwing races out there because I believe some people misuse the word. In this case, it must be used because not many African Americans are being promoted in this company!"
good,Micromanagement was the rule. Typical call center bs but it was union. Employee discounts were nice. They do not pay competitively compared to other companies doing the same thing
good,"You will enjoy working for this company as long as your sales and operations are in order, this would be the case for any sales position. The focus areas do change from day to day and week to week and you do have a lot of conference calls (wish they would remove most calls, most are very repetitive). The workalike balance is good only if your store is doing good."
good,"I started as a rep and it was fantastic.  We had a great group, it felt like family.   As new and constantly changing management entered, everyone had their own direction they wanted to push numbers, causing constant confusion, too much juggling and pushing of products and services on customers.  Upper management doesn't have a clue, and they chase whatever ball is being thrown.  It gets really stressful, you feel under appreciated, and even when you have a great sales day, you are asked why you didn't do more.  It's defeating, soul-stealing, and leads to plenty of unethical practices.  The company puts out trainings so they are doing their 'do-diligence' but they want numbers and don't care how you get them.  Customers beware - and new employees beware.  My pay started out about $10000 higher.   They expect much more, stop letting you tier on meeting and exceeding quotas, and always expect more results and pay you less."
good,No room to grow in a smaller town even with a call center. Nothing ever sticks things get started and dont like it cause hey it isnt going to last long. Most management DONT know much about the actual job function they are managing.
good,"intersting meeting new people and going into there homes, drive to locations all over and install whatever the customer has orderd within a timely and respectful manner, help the customer understand all functions of the dvr or what they orderd"
good,"Learning the newest technologies available to different vertical industries was really exciting. Another enjoyable part of the job, by far,  were the clients/customers. Collaborating with clients in developing solutions and services that  streamlined their business and enabled them to operate more efficiently was great.   Technology is ever changing so learning is on going and it is a stimulating, exciting environment in that respect."
good,"The work hours are flexible nut depends on your seniority in the garage and groups of crews.  I learned to safely work in all kinds of environments, outdoors,indoors confined spaces and  in all types of weather conditions.  I quickly learned how to read and interpret test readings and wiring standards.  I learned how to make cat 5 cables, block 66 and coax terminations. Installed internet and phone demarcations. The workplace culture was not what i expected from a big company. it was more focused on time not customers.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with management that didn't really consider all the obstacles and safety issues techs face daily. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing a happy customer after installing their internet and tv services."
good,This could be a really great company. There are lot of improvements that came be made to policies and the treatment and culture in side of the stores.
good,I enjoyed working at ATT and received great benefits. The hardest part of the job was working in Houston Heat during the summer. I learned a new trade.
good,"The job is no longer people oriented. It is going to a mobility job and people are just numbers. Even with extensive experience, my positon was eliminated because I did not have people reporting to me. Eliminating positions will be an ongoing issue at ATT."
good,I worked at four stores and the atmosphere was different in each one. Some of the stores were more laid back. It was a fun job that required doing a wide variety of duties.
good,Extremely high call volume with erratic unachievable goal setting.  High bonus structure large at risk dollars multiple levels of evaluation.  little advancement opportunities.
good,everyday its something new to add to your work and management always will find always to write you up. everything is always uncoordinated and no one knows whats going on
good,"It was awful. No work-family balance. Stressful. Unobtainable sales goals. It was a horrible place to work but the pay made the majority of us stay. If you value your health, do not work here!"
good,"Start your day with a group meeting, then get your stock only if your where off the day before. You pull your first job and give the customer a call while putting address in the GPS. You go to that job which is either going to be a install or repair. There is a lot of physical work involved and working in all environments as well as weather."
good,"This new generation of consumers don’t rely on traditional methods of viewing content (cable dish). Millennials want to be as “unplugged as possible. Using streaming services that more suit their needs. However AT&T has done a poor job of meeting this demand. AT&T feels like pushing their old content agenda on Millennials and they are not having any of it. "
good,"Mal manejo de personal por parte de los líderes "
good,"it wasn't too great, I didn't like it but you may. long hours. usually worked 12-15 hours a day 6 days a week. if you like that kind of overtime, go ahead and apply."
good,I first started working for this place when it was ATT wireless and it was the most amazing company to work for. Your felt like u were appreciated and wanted. Once Cingular took over you were cattle and almost all the people that had been there forever was fired and the few of us that was still there were reminded we coould be replaced. NEVER work fr ATT HORRIBLE company unless u like to be cattle
good,"I was training to be a project manager when someone retired, and AT&T shuffled me into his position.  The job duties were Change Request (CR) management, which I grew to dislike.  "
good,I was tech support in the dsl department. Dealt with the most hateful customers ever. Upper management constantly told us were not important and that they had a line of people waiting to take our jobs.. The pay topped out at $14 an hour
good,"AT&T used to be the gold standard. I used to come to work and love my job. After 3 years the decline is overwhelming. Technicians are leaving the company left and right. A 4 billion dollar quarterly earning company is disgracing its technicians and applying so much pressure to them and union that it has made it unpleasant to work for anymore. AT&T keeps adding more and more job duties to technicians but are fighting to remove more and more employees from the work force. The CEO and board of directors in my opinion are out of touch and are running their company into the ground. Sooner or later, it will catch up to them, I hope."
good,"get in trouble for not hitting quota even though it is not realistic, I was number 5 in my region recognized by the higher ups, and my district manager still was always on top of me micromanaging me and would not allow me to grow as a sales person."
good,"a typical day included call taking, requiring sales quotas be met, adherence metrics be met, provide customer service, times customer interactions...."
good,Complete as many jobs as you possibly can on a mandatory minimum 9 hour work day (10 hours if you count the mandatory 1 hour lunch).  Until you have some seniority expect to operate worn out machinery that spends a fair amount of time being repaired.  There is a lot of heavy manual labor.  You do get to be out doors.
good,Like all companies the potential is there. You just need to be with the right managers to move where you want to be.  The possibility of that is very rare since there is the mentality of them vs us on the front lines.
good,"This place was very hard to keep your cool only because management wasn't good so it was very stressful and overall a not so fun place to work, because of it was the reason I left."
good,"Lots of mandatory overtime. A lot of paid training, that I am grateful for.  Highly demanding.  A lot of responsibility for minimal pay and minimal respect.  There is a union (CWA) but in a Right To Work state they dont have much pull.  I haven't met a manager that is good at managing there crew, but There manager love them."
good,"I am currently an employee of ATT. I am a prem tech, I gave it 3 years but it's time to move on. There is no advancement with this job. I suggest that you don't apply to Att. They are crooks"
good,Unfortunately AT&T no longer sees the value in promoting from within.  They have highly qualified people but won't pay them what they are worth.  They would rather pay someone from the outside more money instead of keeping the people who have grown with them.
good,"The people that you work with at att are amazing, the pay is decent, but that is where the good ends. Management and upper level look at you as a second rate citizen, they make sure that you know that they are better than you and make you feel like anything you accomplish is because they allow it to happen."
good,If you have done door to door sales previously then you would do great in the Home Solutions Door to Door team. If not it can be very difficult to adjust to that kind of position.
good,Good to learn for freshers it is a very good company to learn more like tool room production design also learning of 2d drawings and converting in to 3D models
good,"Good pay, Good Benefits, I enjoy helping people on a daily basis and making people happy when they come in and leave my location. However the never ending flavor changing directorate of the company that trickles down to its lower tiered employees usually results in unattainable goals and endless coaching sessions. AT&T would be a sensational company to work for once it figures out its place in the world of telecommunications and entertainment."
good,don't listen to any input for there employee. not a family type places. no job security. too many what if. my co worker are good to work with. hard part would be the working outside.
good,good company to work for just wish they paid more hourly other then that no complaints just wish they didn't have so many classess
good,"AT&T is a great company, but the call center is standard call center always busy, stuff rolls down hill to reps are always in the hot seat for the flavor of the day. No consistency between teams/managers and the same old office politics and good ol boys clubs"
good,"This a good company to work for if you are in the right department. If not, it can be a very stressful place to work. The department that I was in was an outside job. The condition were poor."
good,My job was great. My hours were horrible. I was never allowed an opportunity for any advancement while being employed with them. My co-workers were great. Many of the managers were horrible. They knew nothing about the job nor did they try to learn about it. My job wasn't hard at all and the money I earned was great! I actually enjoyed my job to the fullest until it was taken away and moved to another state.
good,A typical work day is long and stressful due to being constantly observed and have to met goals. I've learned alot about technology but also about life and the work place. Store manager is create district management and up are unethical beings. They are very unprofessional and lack empathy. co workers are fun and friendly for the most part but are sheep like and go along with harsh treatment and unethical behavior from management.
good,"The work is good, easy and abundant, the managers and team in the Azusa office are horrible! If you love working and not seeing your family on weekends or holidays this job is for you! We worked Thanksgiving and Christmas day with not even a thank you. No holiday parties or celebrations. Very number oriented mentality, very military style management. I need money but not this bad!!!!!"
good,"AT&T is a good company to work for. At the retail level, as long as  you like customer service and commission sales, it is a great work environment. My area is not like the rest of the company."
good,Most days are full of bs from management but the pay is always really good if you can get a full week in. Its mostly a job where you crawl through muck and dirt it is advised that you get overalls to protect your work uniform otherwise management will be upset with you for having dirty clothes because it is not a professional look.
good,"If you are looking to grow and advance with a company this is not the one. If you are looking to take a job and remain in the same position for the duration of your career then this place would probably suffice, only if you have decent support from leadership. Best advice would be to utilize the company resources to get an education and then go out and find a better job opportunity."
good,"Company is terrible. They need to get their feet under them. So much potential, but stop bleeding your managers and employees dry. Compensate employees for the work you demand; minimum wage and awful salary doesn't cut it. Go to corporate; don't waste your time/life here."
good,"Empresa que no fomentaba el compañerismo, habia mucho racismo en los mismos latinos y aun mas entre los americanos. "
good,This company will work you to the bones and spit you out when they are done with you.  High turnover rate. Market manager micah along with mr stokes are all about the profit and quality of life isnt a concern
good,"Expect long hours, working weekends, and holidays, hopefully you can get a manager that is not a puppet or robot or that micromanages you by following your every move on camera as if they major in store security.... Moving up in the company is non existent unless you can relocate, even then you have to make sure you have made the right connections, its all political here, they make some managers stay managers for years before promotion, I've seen other managers not even be working for a year and get promoted, it is all based on favoritism trust me. Your manager can make or break you. The company overall is on top of technology, they are very innovative and they mean well, but the frontline employees face customer abuse daily, and upper management Directors of Sales specifically have no idea what is going on with customers in stores. Every now and then you will have a good area retail store manager, the one I had was a @#$!!&$!"
good,"Management was not aware many times of the internal workings of their own organization. I was fortunate to work for some managers who respected the effort you expended and allowed you to learn new technologies on the job,"
good,"As a first time customer service position this is a good start.  This was the first time I was ever exposed to a call center environment and I do not regret the experience but do not want to be exposed to this again."
good,"AT&T is only number driven, the culture of the work place is about what you can sell, I have been in sales for over 20 years and I will not compromise myself to sell a customer something they don't need or want. They don't care about customer service."
good,"AT&T was a great place to work for. It is a great place to work, and provide support. The work is very demanding, and a great place to work for because the individual learns a lot."
good,Wasn't exactly what I expected when I signed up. The training could have been a little better before they sent us out into the field. Management was all about numbers...not the employees.
good,at&t was a okay company to work for until uverse came into the picture.  They set goals way to high and a few people made goal but cheated at it and the other people was fired after 3 months
good,"Fun job, meet different people."
good,"Wanna go back to high school?? If so this is definitely the job for you . where sleeping with supervisors gets you ahead, bullying is allowed, and the restrooms smell like a barn."
good,Management is unorganized.  The moral and atmosphere is very low.  Working at AT&T you will be micro managed on a daily.  The sales goals are made for you to not succeed at times when AT&T is low on income.
good,must generate new lines of service to existing customers or find new customers all together in order to get credit for a sale. upgrades no longer count as a measured sale unit.
good,"Fast paced with great commission potential.  However, the schedule is seniority based and provides no flexibility. The managers micromanage."
good,"AT&T is part of my past.Working there led to the financing to launch my own business.I am thankful for my Telecommunications background,however it isn't part of my future plans."
good,the management made this job difficult i was let go for doing my job and after i had to go to court because they tried to deny my unemployment.  i found out i was actually wrongfully terminated
good,Worked with many great people and was able to build relationships.  Compensation was alright.  Management at the store level was good but at corporate level was cut throat and soap-opera like.
good,"great pay, great insurance, bad management"
good,"Relay Department for AT&T"
good,working for direct tv  allowed me to learn the meaning of the word no. it also allowed me to step outside of my comfort zone.
good,"Simply go every day to the customers homes and connect DirecTV services at their homes, or go to those homes whom already have DirecTV to upgrade their receivers or fix their problem."
good,"A typical you come in and get on the phone and take calls, most calls are from people who do not know how to use their phones, you do calls that have actual network issues but their not that common, most calls are easy other calls you have to think outside the box and that's where the fun is. When you have to think outside the box with the customer you start hold actual conversations and not just scripted talks. but you get to feel their frustration and you know that they're grateful that you're going outside the box, even if at first you don't fix the issue they're still grateful that you tried you're best. The biggest issue is communication with management, most of the managers are power hungry, there are some very good managers that will work with their team and do everything they can, but the new managers are power hungry and upper management does not seem to care. If management would fix themselves, and if pay would increase this would be a good job."
good,"Poor and/or indecisive decision making and planning at the higher levels makes for a streesful and unstable working environment.  Initiatives and processes are rolled out only to be replaced or amended by a contradicting policy.  "
good,Its not a bad company if you dont have a degree you still get good pay and awesome benefits. however they have no understanding that there is a life outside work and things happen.
good,I worked as contractor for AT&T Mobility. I worked with techs who were turning up new circuits at cell sites that were all over the USA.  I used a PC to log in to the Cisco routers at the cell sites.  The circuits were crossconnected remotely in the DACS's and mobility switches.  I worked in the PCO in Middletown with a knowledgeable group of employees who helped me learn.  I enjoyed working on the  phone with people from all over the country.
good,"AT&T Partner Exchange:"
good,"Very demanding long days with no job security. Have to get up everyday at 5:00 am to see if and where you will be working. I learned they would never appreciate hard work or quality of work. they only cared about customers signing a two year contract."
good,"The job pays ""livable"" wages but they make new recruits go an entire year before any benefits and becoming ill in that year gets a person fired. More of a ""frat"" group than anything else as the labor union meddles and imposes themselves onto new employees whether they are interested or not. Not easy to just ""do ones job"" without constant ""poorly executed"" social engineering from labor unions. Management separates themselves from employees letting unions run crews mostly."
good,"To accept this position was career suicide. It was too far of a drive, dayin and day out, an hour and thirty minute drive on the toll (I-294 to I-290 to I-90) is not a good way to spend your day for that compensation."
good,"The position required a person to be an absolute self-starter with the ability to manage oneself, including great time management skills, the ability to multitask and manage projects electronically via spreadsheets and tools specific to the AT&T environment. Because the management team was inundated with management duties of their own this was a requirement but not an attribute all team members possessed. The hardest part of the job was having to carry team members who didn't know their job duties and were either not capable or didn't want to carry their own weight. The most enjoyable part of the job was there were also many great and capable people as well."
good,Looking to leave bc the culture is very militant. 100% of your day is micro managed bc they believe this is the best way to ensure efficiency.
good,fun company but management could have been better. More training could have helped and management could have been more helpful
good,I didn't enjoy the fact that there was no room for advancement or raises. I really did like that job though. I was hired under contract with the temp service and my time had expired.
good,"Loved AT&T and Statefarm incoming call center."
good,"This job was accepted when times were hard and was temporary. Pay was low, benefits were acceptable call centers are very political."
good,I dreaded to come to work everyday cause it was 12 hour over night shift.
good,"Assisted customer's and employee's with account maintenance and some network issues.  It taught me about the evolving technology in telecommunications.  The toughest part of the job is just dealing with constant change.  I'm an outgoing individual with a big personality, so I enjoyed talking with all kinds of people."
good,"AT&T just don't care and it shows in not only how they treat their employees, but how they treat their customers. They lie to them and install services knowing it won't work properly and then try to make you pay for them, etc. They put their agents on long holds while waiting for TLQ, and if you are a temporary employee there I really feel sorry for you."
good,The hardest thing about the job will be the managers dealing with individuals who over throw their boundaries and power as a manager.
good,"Telemarketing and sales. Learned to work with people and customer service skills. Management was lacking, but co-workers were fun to work with. I liked working with people and the learning sales."
good,Office location was 2 hours from home. They route you up to 4 hours from your house no mater the time. Was never home with family always on the road. Made it hard for a family Life
good,"its a great place to work for some people. this is not a place to work if you prioritize family or school. it is really tough to get a decent education when you work 5 out of 7 days a 12-9 schedule, school work will suffer. you don't get to see much of your family and if you have children, its definitely not the job for you."
good,"typical day at work, they over worked me, 6 days a week, an it had no benefits because it was a contractor for at&t"
good,"Reputable company with great benefits, mediocre pay, lack of advancement and/or job security. Hired on as contract and if permanent positions are available one can apply but no position is guaranteed. High turn over rate, management can be biased in call center environment."
good,"The best part of the job was the pay. The worst part of the job was the change of managers, supervisors and schedules every 3 months."
good,"bad work environment. Pushy, demanding, not truthful. The co workers are great, but the management was not helpful, or supportive."
good,"I truly had a great time working there I knew what was expected out of myself and my team."
good,Often business is too slow at my store's location to make the sales that the company needs to have to meet the goals that the company has set in place.
good,Not a good working environment.  Not good mentorship.  Left due to illness.
good,"Worked on RF plant on daily basis. Learned how to work with RF systems and cable and telephone systems. Management followed guidelines that were sent, but never personal. Hardest part of job was trying to meet required numbers that company set. The most enjoyable part of job was fxing customers issues with their service"
good,"The best part is working with my employees and the customers, The upper management has no respect for their employees or work/life balance."
good,"Where should i start...If you like working tons of hours, this job is for YOU. Management is not very good(the one i had)..I heard some garage managers are cool."
good,Very numbers driven attitude toward technicians and has turned into discipline factory.
good,I worked for AT&T for a little over a year which I enjoyed the work very much. My immediate manager was great but my area manager was a joke. I
good,My focus is customer service and money managment.  I also ensure that all of my coworkers as well as managment are audit ready at all times.  Everyday at AT&T is a enjoyable day some days can be more challenging than other days.
good,"I got to meet racists. Unbelievable numbers to meet, all for the stock holder. When fed up and tried to transfer. No you do not meet the numbers. It got old always looking over your shoulder. Thank you Lord for allowing me to retire and not go postal. The needs of the business was a phrase used by the Bell Blue Bloods. To say the company doesn't have heart, while it DON'T."
good,"Co workers are great to work with but a lot of the management does not have the experience on the job. They have never taken a call or have any experience in dsl.  They have ridiculous metrics that change constantly and  that way its a very unstable job. People get fired/hired constantly because company does not know how to keep employees and  does not care at all for it employees. You get  2 breaks and a lunch. They have a  pretty nice break room. But besides that going to the restroom is impossible because they micromanage your adherence to the schedule .So forget about being sick. You have 3 to 6 seconds between calls and now they push you to do sales after troubleshooting  as part of the metrics to meet with no commission.  Simply no commission ! either you do it or you won't have a job. People are great to get along with they share your feelings but are highly stressed because its hard to meet metrics.  You have metrics for how long you are on a call, adherence to schedule,  customer calling in 3 days, customers calling in 30 days, truck dispatch, sales and customer reviews and surveys. Plus you have to follow a call flow and tools. And script verbatum . ( yes they do listen to your calls). And the constant stress that every month your schedule changes. I was getting home close to 1 am. !"
good,"I have worked here for almost one year, there are lots of opportunities to advance but it is hard to actually procure another position with this company."
good,This was a third party company that outsourced for AT & T and other companies.
good,"This company isn't very efficient.  There's a lot of hard, but unnecessary work being done at AT&T.  I worked extremely hard for what was essentially busy work.  "
good,The culture with the area I worked with was rigid and I did not fit in well. If you like a more structured environment this is the place for you
good,"It is a benefit to work for a company that is the best in it's industry with a strong brand. Unfortunately with the substantial growth and competition, the cutbacks to company provided training & the very values that built this company no longer make it the Consumer's choice."
good,been there for a few years but the management is not that great
good,You make what you put in in terms of work/production. Management needs more training. Long days and long distance driving.
good,It was a good company until Uverse was entered into the customer care aspect of the job. Then it became all about pushing a product on the CELLPHONE customer calling about their bill or for technical support. The value of the customers issues seem to disappear by the day. They stand over your shoulder and tell you what to say.
good,"In extreme economic times, I am grateful to have an income. However, cuts on 'non essential items' such as water, paper, pens, coffee, has reduced my moral that such a large company recognizes me only as a number and not a person. After 8 years, I have one of the worst shifts and don't get home until midnight."
good,I loved the job and the interaction with the customers.But the rate of speed that att requires there installation and especially repairs to be done are not acceptable. You can not give nearly enough time to your customer to make sure there service through att is a great one.
good,"Not much room for advancement unless you're in the ""Circle"", However, you have to know how to work the system."
good,"At this job, I was manager of a store to sell DirecTV for DirecTV to customers at Best Buy or Sam's. The issue I had is not with DirecTV but with the company that I was hired by to represent DirecTV. we got one day off a week and the other 6 days were 12 hour days once travel time is included. Not only was I away from my family for 72 hours, but the money they were paying did not even match the hours worked for us (my family) to do anything productive (like save to move, purchase a car, etc...)"
good,Connect and route telephone cables through manholes and on poles per engineers blueprint.
good,quotas are too high and out of reach to achieve.
good,"A typical day at work was like being in grade school.Management had their favorites,the co workers gossiped about everyone,but yet they were friendly directly. The hardest part of the job was overcoming objection.The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to customers from all over the world."
good,Great company to work but no advance or growth for their employees.
good,"You are never bored always something new is coming out. You have to learn new devices and plans in order to teach customers how to operate the new devices and explain the changes to their plans. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customer go through their monthly bill to make changes that would benefit them. For example, adding company discounts, removing features that are not being used and adding features that would be benift the customer."
good,A typical day at work is customer service and tech support. When calls come I assist the customer with issues involving their mobile devices.
good,Fast paced
good,This company is not very family oriented..Once I started a family I realized this company was not for me anymore.
good,A typical day would begin with sales meeting; then prospecting for new business and appointments from 9am to 10:30.
good,"stressful, poor management.but good learning experience."
good,"As long as there are jobs to go to, then everything works out. They are too crucial, when it comes to time frames. You only allotted a certain amount of time to either fix and repair a job, or doing installs. Some jobs are easily accessed where others are longer and tougher. There has been times when they ask for volunteers to go home, or not come into work, because there aren't enough jobs. Their policy is if you don't work you don't get paid. There is no absolute that you will get 40 hrs/week. Did you know you have to predict when you plan on getting sick and get it pre-approved before hand. That's right even if you are sick and you didn't put the time in for it and it was approved you are out of policy. That goes with everything you do there at AT&T. This is just a few of the issues with this company. Did you know if you are driving a company vehicle and if you have it parked or your driving and if you get struck by another vehicle it will always be your fault whether or not it is your fault."
good,This is not your once Ma Bell reliable Pacific Bell. I believe the customer service reflects the company culture. Many great employees are out numbered by people who should not be in charge. There needs to be a lot of house cleaning to make this company respectable.
good,looking forward to a new challenge and looking forward to working with a new wonderful team
good,During busy times of the year we were not allowed to leave our desk unless it was to take a restroom break. They would even bring in food and serve you at your desk while you stayed on the phones to continue taking calls. Work/life balance was completely unheard of with DELL.
good,"sales, great co-workers, very rewarding working with awesome people everyday"
good,Overall pay was what kept me with the company. I enjoyed my co-workers but environment was too stressful.
good,This job was a temporary job. I had to go the extra mile and had no problem with it.
good,"This is not a customer service position, The job is a high pressure sales environment with daily sales goals. The company will focus more on Uverse tv sales that customer service and overal happiness of customer"
good,"very bad job security.  you can be surplused at anytime, no matter your position or work ethics.  can be moved to any team at anytime without even appling."
good,Honestly it was the worst job I ever had barley new if I was gonna get by people only worked there to look nice and where a suit it was a pyramid scheme for sure
good,An Ok place to work. been her for 17 years. wish there was more room for growth. Management is not all together. I wish they were on one accord. Work culture could be a lot better as well.
good,Store manager is so obsessed with numbers that she skirts around policy and makes up rules and procedures that are contrary to corporate policy. Coercion and fear are the only talents held in high value by upper management and executive leaders. In order to succeed sales associates must lie and cheat to hit goals and disregard what is best for the customer. Say whatever it takes to make a sale. If you have moral fiber and value your own dignity this is not for you.
good,"Decent working environment, contract ended with no notice or explanation. Not sure how to feel about the company as a whole. People working there were decent - ignorant to my faith which was hard to handle but overall a normal American business."
good,"A typical day at AT&T consists of your morning meeting to discuss previous days numbers and efficiency, loading your truck with supplies and looking over the current assigned job for the morning. "
good,"Decent pay for students or those who have multiple financial resources, but very disorganized and management, not on the same page as consultants. It also appears to be very hard for someone to move up in the company."
good,At&t is constantly laying off employees and outsourcing positions overseas. This culture of doing business is leaving a negative impact on employee moral.
good,"The job is doable not enjoyable, not somewhere I wake up happy to go to. This was not always the case, inspiration and motivation was easier to come by whe first starting"
good,"Cuando entres negocia bien tu salario, será el mismo todo el tiempo y si subes de puesto será el mismo salario. Todo te cobran, hasta la fiesta de fin de año la pagas tú. Te venden celulares y vasos"
good,Great company!  Just cant plan on retiring from there.  They have to many expenses once your salary is at a certain amount I feel they are out to get you!
good,"On a typical day at work for ATT, i would say that it's action filled from the beginning of my shift to the end. Calls are back to back so there is  definitely job security."
good,"The  custom communication / AT&T is a good place to work while you are trying to figure out what it is that you want to do with life. If interested in sales then, i definitely suggest to look into that field for career golals."
good,Telecommuting is the best thing. Uncertainty isn't when it comes to having a job and supporting your family isnt. But that wan happen with any company.
good,Contract salary was great  but the culture allowed inexperienced people to become managers without proper credentials. It was extremely stressful  working there.  The life of a contractor is like being subhuman.  You truly have no rights that they are bound to respect.
good,"When I was hired- the job was great, you worked, you met and exceeded your number and you made money. It was an enjoyable job- you knew what you had to do to succeed. THEN, new management was put into place, they had no clue what was going on in the channel - let alone the market. The demands became outrageous, the customers were not take care of- everyone passed the blame. Folks where hired who were friends of friends and everything went downhill. The culture was changing- and then people were stressed about losing their job. Cuts were made across the board- people were being surplussed - even if you were at the top of your game- and preformed- you could be fired. Every quarter they were laying off people.If you were being surplussed- you had 90 days to find a job within the company- BUT- there was a hiring freeze going on. And only certain folks were receiving jobs. Openings in departments were kept quiet- so friends of friends got hired...  The new initiative was to hire Veterans, and I believe that was a great idea. Unfortunately, many people were fired in order to do that. I hate to bash the company that I truly believed in. "
good,"I previously worked for DirecTV before it merged into AT&T  I do not have the new experience but i do have all customer service experience. I was responsible for accepting payment via debit and credit card, also updated customers about u coming bills and payment plan DirecTV had to offer."
good,Se informa de una manera errónea con información falsa con respecto al salario  a percibir; existe mucha falta de comunicación entre RH y operación
good,"Work consisted of the manager and I working from open to close 7 days a week for the first 4 months. I had a severe accident outside of work and was hospitalized in the icu for 28 days, due to severe burns on my face and hands. I called in daily to let my supervisor know how things were going, after the 7th day, he told me it wasn't necessary for me to continue calling daily, and that once per week would be perfectly fine. After the second week, he stopped returning my calls and by the third week, the hospitals billing department showed up in my room to inform me, that my insurance through the company was no longer valid. This is how I found out I was terminated, while lying in a hospital bed, with 3rd degree burns covering 80% of my face arms and hands. Thank You AT&T."
good,"The first year was great, the last 2 years was horrible, managers threaten your job security constantly,  managers fight against you. The union is great at times, Good luck!"
good,The best thing about working at AT&T is having benefits on your start date. They take very good care of their employees as far as benefits they give. The workplace is a gossipy clique culture. If one person doesn't like you your name is mud throughout the building. Managers disclosed my age to other employees
good,managers are very rude. a lot of times they belittle lower ranking employees. it was a very bad experience for me and I do not recommend this job to anyone.
good,"Retention means every single call will be from an upset/disgruntled customer. They will want to cancel all of their services and you will have to try and convince them not to, while also trying to convince them to purchase more products from the company. This is not our average call center job. If you can't communicate at an exceptional level, ask questions and pretend on every call that you love this company and it has the absolute best products anywhere, you will struggle. If you believe you have fantastic communication skills, have no problem learning about intimate details of stranger's lives and using that information to make sales, then you will do very well."
good,Good place to work I enjoyed helping customers. The company tries to rob you from your commission. Commission plan changed every other month. Manager not very understanding she is very boss and doesn’t care
good,ATT stands for “At This Time” Mandatory OT is a must and schedules changes are very common. Pay Is Great But you soon feel as if the constant pay raises and pay increase is to retain employees. You Will Have To be Self Sufficient and make sure your managers still remember any request or help you may have asked for.
good,Everything this company does is a knee jerk reaction. Upper management is only interested in their own well being. They claim to be interested in employee welfare but this is not the fact. Most of management training is on how to document employee behavior so they can be fired.
good,"Good people to work with, but has been plagued by multiple layoffs per year, without a reduction in the volume of work. Constant budget cutting mid-project, and a short attention span for priorities. Network quality is not the priority ever since the TW acquisition, and it's showing."
good,"Working as a Technician for At&t from 2013 to 2017 was not a good atmosphere.  From the Directv mergers to the massive layoffs the company handled everything with a “It is what it is” attitude.  Never stopping to value its employees and/or show appreciation for work that me and my fellow employees strives to do on a daily basis.  Pay became less competitive, conttacts became less appealing, they work became hardened and the company was only focused on the numbers."
good,"good place to work however treated like a number and laid off after giving them 20 years of my life. No thought as to how it would affect someone, just a number in the big corporation"
good,I worked at AT&T for 18 and 1/2 years and then was laid off.  I had planned on retiring from there.One year I received the highest honor an employee can receive on their review.  I don't know why I was let go.
good,I have no sense of accomplishment even though my crew meets deadlines on a daily basis. Upper management makes all the decisions but I am the one doing the work and they have no idea how to do my job!
good,first 6 years we were forced 10 hour days 6 days a week had to burn time just to have 2 days off together now constant threats of layoffs makes for a stressful environment
good,The company is in the midst of a transition from a telecom behemoth to an integrated communications and media company.  It's an exciting opportunity for the company but very challenging for employees in the traditional part of the business.  The future has great potential.
good,Management is old and outdated. Nepotism and favoritism run rampant. Progressions are few and far between. Low stress but nothing really to strive for.
good,"Hard to stay positive when a company lets good people go simply because they are not in a ""HUB"" city. The last 10 years have been so stressful.  You didn't know from one month to the next if you would have a job.  Everyone is running scared.  Upper management wants you to get ready for 20/20 and then they work you 18 hours a day and berate you for not keeping up with all the extra work from all he people they have laid off.  It's kind of a sad company now."
good,When At&T bought out Direct Tv more work was placed on the Premise Tech. Without a pay increase. A little one week of training was all that was given for new and unfamiliar tech. Managers only care about their numbers for their bonus. Employees who don't make their numbers are in danger of losing their job -hence the stress.
good,"Stressful environment due to extreme Attendance Rules. I did learn all aspects of FMLA, disability, Workers Comp and ADA, in addition to the company attendance rules."
good,"In the beginning att was great, but as you progress in the company it becomes harder to move up. You may have all the experience, been with the company for over 5 years and they will still not look into. your application. It. became. restless. trying to move up. There are too many surpluses as if they do not know where they are losing money or where they want to put a support team."
good,"Competitive place to work, but a relatively fun environment.  Company was very overbearing, due to the employees being union.  I was going to school at the time and there was no leeway with my schedule."
good,Stressful environment. Micromanagement is so bad that you couldn't even make your own choices as a tech on how to fix a issue. Whole company is ran off of numbers to impress stock holders. No time with your family.
good,I worked for AT&T for 12 years.  Over the last 3 years the company culture has changed to a negative reinforcement management style. It became an environment that was not motivating and created animosity and many people leaving the company.
good,"Good benefits and salary but no room for advancement "
good,"Something out of blue would sprung on you . There are more managers than actual  workers . It is very hard to find information relevant for your work . People are more likely to hide informations and present very complex and over the top view of rather simple projects . Because of AT&T direction , people are always scared of loosing jobs and very skepticle of each others."
good,"El salario es superior a cualquier otra empresa, pero el ambiente laboral es horrible. Los jefes son tus dueños. Daño psicológico y moving de parte de ellos."
good,AT&T Leadership is only concerned about the budget. The current leadership is driving employee back into 10 hubs but we are a telecommunications company where working from anywhere should be possible.
good,No work life balance. Typical day is non stop threats of loosing your job. Only reason we stick around is because of the pay. The benefits are great thats all
good,"The company once took pride in providing an outstanding customer experience, now they are only concerned about making people think they care. They stopped caring about employee's as well. Executives will lie to your face and tell you you are valued and at the end of the day they throw people away when they decide they need to save money."
good,"Outside sales 100% commission is no joke, however, it taught me more about sales as well as time management than any job I ever had. Unfortunately, this was also the lowest paying job I ever had."
good,Management didn’t always make the best decisions. There was too much of a focus on FTEs even though they were mostly ineffective in delivering goals or initiatives.
good,"Not impressed at all with the job or any type of career there,its a numbers game. They set high sales quotas and no one can reach them. Dont waste your time here!"
good,"The experience that I had with AT&T as an employee was a bit of a learning curve they showed many signs of, I can say neglect, and showing how thier system should be ran As a whole company where The management so the lack of interest in the ones that were struggling and more interested in the ones that were understanding it a little faster than others. Gladly that I learned so quickly I was one of the ones they show More interest and to move forward in their company which made me have the decision of leaving for better opportunities for growth and financial stability."
good,"Almost 15 years in, it started off great but changes to management at many levels have created an environment of unethical practices to achieve unrealistic expectations and if you are someone that wont do the unethical things you are viewed as a lazy employee because you aren’t “achieving” the unrealistic expectations."
good,"Las vendedora que tiene más tiempo se aprovecha de los nuevos, no cumple con las actividades de atención al cliente, malas caras si no es para venta."
good,Management does not give 3 sh*** about you. You are promised a promotion 4 times but never received it. You only get promoted if you kiss a*** but that’s not how I work. Working almost every Sunday is a buzz killer and has me really burned out. Money and Benefits are good though.
good,"AT&T was a good job, but not a great career choice. Pay is low compared to peers and management is archaic with their Top down management approach. The have plans to lay off 2/3 of their workforce by 2020 and at this point there isn't much growth for an employee within the company unless you're willing to relocate."
good,"It's always a challenge, responsibilities and environment change very often.  It's required to complete training for your role.  Threat of layoffs keeps you on the edge all the time."
good,"The management style was poor, with aggressive and sometimes unreasonable goals. Working schedule was not reliable and difficult to mesh in with my child's schooling/daycare/babysitting requirements."
good,"I enjoyed my time here until my campaign was over. I had the option to be apart of the upcoming champagne, however it was not advancement. I would have had to take a pay cut."
good,"AT&T is driven by numbers not always quality. AT&T micromanages its employees to a fault. You are never good enough.Though, you can be good at your job, you never feel safe. Management is always monitoring you and adding extra tasks with out increasing the time allowed for the job. It's very good at learning about fiber-optics installation and all work related to telecommunications."
good,AT&T is no where close to the company it was when I started.  Their strategy is unclear and as a result the market has punished them for it.  As a result of the debt they have taken on Surplus (layoff) is the driving force these days.
good,"While working at AT&T is quite an experience and you get to work with a great amount of great customers, the company has become greedy and really micromanage their employees too much. Some leadership is very unethical in sales practices and force their employees to go along with this behavior. A typical day at work is clocking in, being expected to know your quota for sales, going to the sales floor and wait on customers. You must be knowledgable about the products/services for customers. Management/leadership expects workers to really perform like robots and not have an actual real conversation with a customer. Leadership is very poor and never really want to develop anyone unless you are ""chosen"". You must follow a list of things to do with the customer as well as demonstrating products. If you do not follow instructions, leadership can fail you on observations, which can lead to discipline/termination. The workplace culture is different in each location. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new customers and helping them with their problems. Many of the employees were fun to work with, but there is a HEAVY amount of stress daily with every employee. I would not recommend this as a place to work unless you are willing to be unethical and reach for numerous amounts of sales to meet your quota in the wrong way and pressure customers to buy things they don't necessarily need. The pay is great, but it's not worth it."
good,When i was there it was all about sales and they paid well when you hit your goals. New owners fro the Philippines came and basically ruined it. The managers only look out for themselves not the sales force.
good,"The working environment was difficult to work for.  A lot of the experiences were negative.  I believe that the management misinterpreted how the employees were to be treated in the call center.  I worked my position very well, however, the management style was very limiting.  Breaks were treated as if we really were not allowed to leave the floor.  Stressful for many that I watched working everyday."
good,"doesn't matter how well you are doing next week better be better, saved 60% of customers wanting to leave.. better be 80 percent next week. the people were nice, it had on in house gym. decent bonuses, free directv"
good,"Great discounts on services Tenured reps are usually rude because theyre tired of being burned by AT&T If you have a personal life, say goodbye to it."
good,I have not worked at AT&T for years but at the time it was all about numbers and not the customers or employees. Life/work balance was nearly nonexistent and many of the management team were not experienced and the ones who were knowledgeable and good at what they did were let go due to frivolous complaints from my peers.
good,"It was great to work remote for ATT while it lasted until 12,000 of us were notified of a layoff through a website.  Our jobs were outsourced and then they offered to hire us back as contractors at 1/3 of the pay with no benefits."
good,Good Overall but cut throat when it comes to getting sick and being penalized for it. I would recommend working for them but benefits take 6months to take effect and FMLA doesn’t benefit you if you haven’t been there over a year. So Its at your risk and it’s union based so if you aren’t part of the union and pay your dues it works against you. Overall a good company but just any other company many ways to get rid of you and demean your confidence and value!
good,"If you can find better, I would recommend that. There’s a big turn over rate. It’s also extremely hard working here when you have a family. The schedule changes all the time and they could careless if it effects your home life or family."
good,"Very rigid corporate structure. Call center jobs have an incredibly high turn over. You will be told it’s a customer service position, only to find out in training it’s a service and sales position."
good,High management turnover rate and stressful corporate feel. Very poor communication between areas of the company. Benefits dwindling vs competition. Only reason most are staying is for the pay rate.
good,If you don’t mind setting aside your integrity to get sales this is the place for you. The sales tactics are not very ethical. Otherwise it would be great.
good,"This place was too stressful, especially when they were talking about shutting down the center, made you want to jump ship because of the pressure. They did eventually shut it down, and it was sad because they could have treated their people so much better while they were there."
good,My personal time there is colored by the lack of true management style or help from said manager who took all good things as his due and the bad was someone one other than his fault and be blamed for the infrastructure of being bad.
good,"	Work with federal staff to identify, prioritize, and resource new development and maintenance projects and oversee the complete rural development and Software Development Life Cycle and project management activities."
good,You only suppose to work 8hrs shifts and they will surprise you with mandatory over time within 30mins of your shift ending. The pay isn't good for all the work you do.
good,Work methodologies has switched to an agile development environment. Lots of gaps while the company figures out how to adjust while the work culture is moving forward towards the future.
good,I was a Uverse Prem Tech. The hours are long. What you learn in training doesn't help you at all in the field. Better if you have cabling or networking experience. You have to know your craft to do this job well.
good,"The trials and tribulations associated with a contract role at AT&T were worth the hassle because contractors worked from home and seldom travelled to an office location.  It helped ease the work/life balance issues with working so much."
good,"The role I was in was extremely stressful due to extremely poor and biased management.  while the company is good overall, my particular situation was unbearable."
good,"I work for the DirecTv side of AT&T. Training is paid and very in depth. Typical day of work involves a lot of ladder work, working in attics and crawl spaces. Management doesn't seem to care what happens anymore."
good,"Typical day, morning meeting get out of garage before 9am. Use of ipad to push button random jobs for install or repair of services.  Your performance is measured by number of installs and any issues if any after install.  Managers leave at 5pm home, leaving one evening manager on call.  sometimes no updates on jobs left or when going home.  Make it to work garage at 11pm, have to run report and clean truck.  Get home at midnight & have to be back at 8am even weekends & holidays."
good,"This is a company that is constantly changing, for good and bad reasons. You are disciplined when someone does not buy anything because for some reason it’s your fault that they didn’t want it and you are treated as if you are a robot. At first, working for this company was fun and exciting, but towards the constant changes that were made for the soul purpose of money and trying to get customers to buy products that do not even benefit or sastify them, this company has become rutheless and unpleasant to work for. If you enjoy constant stress and discipline from your management, then this is the place for you."
good,not as good as it used to be . A lot has changed and so has the pay scale. Very shady place to work. I do not recommend working there to anyone at all .
good,AT&T has some good points in being employed the benefits are amazing but the hours and family life changes constantly. While working there I had four different managers and worked on 7 different shifts.
good,my experience there would not matter for it was a TPR store so they didn't follow a lot of At&T rules or stretcher and the pay and work rules were horrbile.
good,"If you're looking for a job and you don't mind working late hours, then this is the job for you. This job will keep feeding you more work until you are on the brink of quiting."
good,"typical corporate, always changing requirements and customers unrealistic expectations make for a hectic work day .virtually no chance to move up in my division"
good,"Honestly, I have no overall review for AT&T. They had there moments when the company overall were up and up at the beginning a few years ago. Which, at that time they  had a very upward advancement opportunities and overall good culture. However, once surplus took place with the merger things rapidly changed and not for the overall good."
good,"This company is like being in a cult. You must bleed blue, which I did and enjoyed for many years. Then there was a merger and 80% of our department surplussed. The company had no ones interest but their own in mind when making this decision. They did not take into consideration the years of your life dedicated to them or your performance. I was always won top rewards, always a top performer, highly respected in the industry and AT&T decided to choose the incoming people from the merger instead of the dedicated employees they already had."
good,"You will need to be patient, and understand the meaning of political correctness. What I learned is how to understand and execute time management skills more efficiently. Management communication needed to improve, somewhat of a blame game mentality.  Workplace culture is very diversified, unfortunately a bit depressive.  Treating adults like millennials.  The experience I received from the multiple positions, some life long friends I made, and seeing the process of big data."
good,"Great place for single millenniums that are not aware of the importance of life. There are many individuals in high positions that will feed you false hope on having a promising career with a company that DOES not value their employees or their customers. They are all about how much you can sell and they don't care who its being sold to.,"
good,It was a decent place to work. the sales goals became a little overbearing once digital life was released and when we acquired DirecTv. Customer Service went out the window and all that mattered were sales.
good,"management doesnt care about you           "
good,Company is focused on numbers from area manager down to the tech. If you want a life outside of work do not apply to ATT. Hands down one of the worse jobs I have every had!
good,"AT&T, if it weren't for management, would've been a great place to work. You meet new people from various backgrounds, and 50% of work involves travel within the city. However, management makes it very stressful throughout the day. They set forth goals that are very difficult, if not impossible to achieve. The culture is very disciplinary based. You could find yourself written up or suspended for even the smallest infractions. The pay is decent, however there are many days where overtime is forced, which will take time away from family. It's a very ""us vs them"" relationship between employees and management. And good luck trying to continue education as an employee. They say they support it, however no one is allowed to clock out until all the work for the day has been completed, which means attending classes will prove difficult. I would only recommend this working environment if you're single, with no familial obligations, and even then, just barely."
good,Very stressful with management being intimiding.  Feel could have been a better work enviroment.  Was there for several years and chose to leave based upon the treatment of the employees.
good,"I took this position thinking it was customer service, turns out its sales. Management has selling goals. No matter what a customer calls in about you are expected to make a sale of an AT&T product."
good,Love working there management was lacking they do not work with you on your schedule very inconsistent but the pay was good benefits were awesome.              I would go back
good,lets see the job was like high school all over again. all tho nobody in my high school did coke in the restroom on brakes and called in every other day because of a hangover or worse. i left that place as soon as i could.
good,"Great workplace where most everyone is friendly except for a few managers who are just bullies. The work isnt difficult, but the micro managing over the 4 years I worked there only got worse and worse. Pretty much to the point where it was difficult to do an easy job because of all the extra bs they expected us to do without any extra compensation."
good,"The company invests a lot of money into call centers making them look nice but put them in a financial bind forcing downsizing later down the line.  The amount of call the center has to take becomes and issue because AT&T does not tell them when the calls are coming throughout the day or days of the week.  This forces scheduling to become a problem.  The centers hire based on projected money they are going to make.  When they find out the scheduling to reach call waves and random times becomes almost impossible, they are forces to downsize.  This ends up in hundreds of people losing their jobs."
good,"The greatest thing about AT&T are the people you work with on a daily basis. The work is extremely challenging. This is a corporation in transition. They are trying to compete in a rapidly changing world but trying to accomplish that on the cheap. There is too much outsourcing to firms with substandard workers who have little or no accountability for work product. "
good,Company I dedicated 10 years of my life to. Very stressful and always on your feet. Constant changes and horrible scedual unless your in sales and have been with the company forever.
good,"Poor management / very stressful working environment caused by Manager."
good,"Management does not support growth.  Senior level employees and management are more worried about keeping their job  and bonuses. Many walk around with compromised ethics, and those that aren't will be ostracized.  Talent Development Program  only works for the business sector where they promote advancement."
good,The hours were awful and the management team was too busy infighting and bullying there reps to care about the store productivity. The rep team was amazing but management needs a overhaul before the company becomes a better place to work.
good,"Currently ATT is going through round and round of reorganization, job surplusses and jobs being moved across the country.  People are being shuffled from leader to leader in the span of months.  The culture has changed significantly with the purchase of Direct TV"
good,Company had great potential as a long term career. The direct management offered no real support and ultimately I had started there right before the economic crash and they laid off nearly the entire office.
good,"Very cut throat, fast paste, leave you behind if you under-perform. Push sales more than customer service. With the right leader job can be very fun!!"
good,Diversity and inclusion is not prevalent.  No advancement unless you know someone or you are related to someone of importance.  Doesn't value their employees.
good,"place was amazing to work at. the atmosphere was great when certain people did not work that day. some of upper management had some attitude issues. if they didnt like you for whatever reason from then on out you could do nothing right, you had a target on your back. very political with some management staff,"
good,"You either are completely for everything the company stands for or may god help your soul."
good,It was fine for seasonal work. I didn't need it for more then a few months to make a little extra money for the holidays and that's what I did. Worked out good but I would not have stayed full time.
good,I was paid $9/hour plus commission.  The main issue is that if you sell a customer something and then they change the package in the next 3 months you lose your commission for the sale.  For instance I spent about an hour selling a customer 2 sell phones with an internet and texting package.  I suggested a package that included unlimited texting but the customer declined.  The next day the customer was at a mall kiosk and they ended up changing him to unlimited texting and then sent him back to me to explain his phone in more detail.  So basically even thou I spent all of the time helping this customer I received no commission as once the mall person changed the plan they took the commission.
good,Upper management is very pushy and if you do not perform you will be cut.  Commission structure is fair however the hourly pay can be quite low.  I would recommend for someone with sales experience who likes a fast paced enviroment
good,ATT was a great place for Innovation however employees suffered from low morale.  This was due to the constant threats of loss of employment and very high demands to deliver quality on short-term.
good,Mass layoffs in california do not suggest applying for a position here. Pay is good but once again they dont want anyone working in california. Union backed employees most time
good,AT&T is not the corporation that rewards the value of hard work and decisions aren't based on performance and metric based. AT&T is a good place for benefits and discounts.
good,"It used to be a great place ro work.  In recent years the corporate greed hand has pushed down so hard. Demanding more with so much less.  One day the ceo tells us how the xompany could not exisist without the employees. Then a week later starts a lay off. "
good,"A lot of down time inbetween jobs, high turnover in management, have to get maintaince on vehicle on your day off, only get one day a week off, meeting once a week even if it is your day off"
good,"very unstable, too many layoffs.  the employees are good and very hard workers.  But they are cutting people left and right and there is zero job security."
good,"Customers come to you with problems and there's almost no shoulder to lean on. You're given a list of numbers to call incase you run into any issue. On many occasions I'd had department I called hang up on me. They offer timed support so if they believe your outcome has been achieved they are required to hang up, even though you work for their company too."
good,"Job can be really hard sometimes, If you happen to be in a group with a cool manager than this job is not to bad. If your manager just thinking about his number than this job is really hard"
good,"The pay was pretty decent. The management could care less about you though. Everything was always about the customer, even if they were wrong. Non optional overtime was required a lot of the time. You get at least one weekend off a month thanks to the union. It is an outdoor job so you can't really complain about the weather, but sometimes you have to draw the line when it comes to certain animals like snakes and massive wasp nests where all your cans of wasp spray will not kill them all."
good,a typical day starts at the garage with a small briefing and review of the previous day results. then techs are off to their jobs. usually the fun part is on the job.
good,"Pay and benefits are good, but you will sacrifice quality of home for staying competitive or simply to keep your job.  If you are good at playing politics, this is the place for you."
good,They made us train our replacements here at home and they sent our managers over to the Philippines to train them. Absolutely no respect for our american jobs.
good,"Management in my office was absolutely horrible"
good,"If you enjoy having 3 companies make,change, and contradict each others policy it is a great place to work. The company is focusing on tv but not doing anything to make regular tv a viable option."
good,"not for me, not  bad place just not great having to sell items to ppl who dont need em...did like meeting various ppl from different backgrounds "
good,"Great job for someone who is working while in college, not a real career field. All commissioned sales, most associates are in their early twenties just trying to make ends meet. Base pay was minimum wage plus commissions, not a reliable income for most adults. Retail hours, 9AM-9PM, depending on location could be longer especially around the holidays."
good,"Although working for AT&T has its perks, the environment is horrible. Management is so focused on their bonuses that they micro manage you to the bone. Even though I enjoy helping people out, working for the company makes me a bitter person, just by the way they manage. And corporate is set on expanding, that they don't see that the company is not competitive anymore."
good,I would give at&t a 3 star in total because they wont do really good customer service. And the environment  is not really friendly. I would never like to work for at&t ever again.
good,"My overall experience with Coworx was great... The staff was friendly and helpful. I could always count on the staff for support. The best part of the job was the interaction with the sales prospects because I had a chance to connect with people from all over the lower 48 states pretty much and talk entertainment. The people they contracted for was a company named STI/. STI on the other hand were tough to work with because you couldn't plan on anything really regarding the compensation. When I initially started they didnt own the work, they bought the ATT contract and essentially took my bonus that averaged 600 to 850 a month to ZERO for 2 months straight and did this without notice."
good,"management was fair"
good,"AT&T is a unique workplace as the only unionized telecom in the US. The union covers hourly/occupational employees and is the reason for the excellent pay and benefits. Once, or if, you make it to management the benefits are still okay and the pay is good with annual bonuses for most management roles. There's two different company cultures, the one for management, and the one for hourly employees.  The company culture is one of diversity and inclusion, however if you're in an hourly position you'll experience a different culture where productivity is king and only those capable of being top sellers will advance. Hourly employees are encouraged to be sharks, and scamming/creatively wording sales to customers is frowned upon but expected in order to make sales. First line managers are either the worst people who gave up their personal morals for the commission,  or excellent coaches with a great understanding of advancing your career. Unfortunately there's more of the former than latter. I would only recommend working here if you are interested in a career sales job. Management positions are sales driven but less involved in the sales process than first or second line managers. It was once a tall hierarchy with easy career moves but has become more flat and more competitive to advance."
good,"They tell you it was customer service but it was sales and the quotas were nearly impossible to meet. The people there were nice, but any good manager that came through realized what was going on and left."
good,"AT&T Phone Center's mission was to sell home and office products; therefore the work performed was customer services, increase sales, less returns and more profit.  Work is measured with how much one sells per day, per week and per month.  It was cut throat and one had to learned about the product.  Very little product training.   The plus, customer service and satisfaction were achieved during my years with AT&T."
good,I was laid off because there were others that had more senority than me took my position. The union does absolutely nothing for you and you pay union dues.
good,"Overall AT&T has a lot of great benefits and career options for you to pursue, or at least they initially did when I joined with the company. Over recent acquisitions and transitions made recently within the company, it is becoming more and more difficult to find career paths outside of your first or second step up from a Sales Consultant. Management is poorly represented, and at times they aren't qualified to effectively lead their staff and it leads to failure. There isnt a lot of inspection or development of our leadership talent, which leads to a lot of consistent problems when it comes to growth and opportunity. "
good,Focus is entertainment. Phones sell themselves. Management changes average every 8 months. Great Company but no sick time in NY. Should definitely pay atlas 20 hourly.
good,"Manger was not very nice, some discriminating.  others try to use thier power to have you work more.  The best part of the job was I learned new code, and I aso learned how to deal in an environment that is not a team oriented"
good,"lots of satellite installation, no work in the rain, lots of ladder climbing, some rude customers. Hardest part is bad customers. You have your own van after training. Too much of a workload sometimes."
good,The retail store workers that are on the floor are the most unappreciated part of the company. The pay is minuscule for the amount of work we do. The CEO and other executives reap the rewards while the RSCs suffer balancing their work and life to make a living. We are at risk of experiencing more pay cuts while the company refuses to come to an agreement with the union that will benefit the RSC.
good,AT&T created a workplace culture where very few people actually cared about their work.  They didn't take pride in anything the tech did because if a technician took the time required to complete the job the proper way they would be punished.  But also if you were caught doing the job improperly in order to meet expectations you would also get in trouble.
good,"After 9 years of working for AT&T and going through their management development program, I haven't been able to break into management yet. The environment is definitely who you know not how hard you work. The benefits are great (401K, Pension, above average hourly pay, vacation weeks) but that's due to it being a Union environment."
good,Typical day managers are constantly pushing sales over customer service. If sales goals are not met there is a constant reminder that your job is no secure. I learned to adapt to a fast pace and constant changing environment. The culture is very cut-throat if you are not a seller. The hardest part of the job was trying to stay optimistic with the constant reminder that you could lose your job at anytime. I enjoyed the skills that i learned and the people I met.
good,"Reps work 8 hours a day and help with customer service and sales. The hours and wages are great. They provide 401k, medical, dental, vision, and paid incentives. Its a very stressful job sie to high sales goals. This is a union based job that is currently working without a contract. Most reps make 11 to 18 an hour. You get 50 percent off cellular and dtv for 10 a month."
good,"this is a very cool job but if management would care more about helping employees excel it would be my dream job,not only do they be-little you when you do something wrong but they dont even help or coach you on your mistakes or being a better salesman."
good,"Co-workers and team mangers are awesome for the most part. Upper management is a joke at best. Recruiters will lie thru their teeth to get you to apply. Training is comical.policy changes daily to suit the upper mgmt. Bonuses change all the time and requirements to get said bonuses change as well. Company is noe outsourcing to other countries and by the time the customer gets to you they are so angry they don't want your help they just want to speak with supervisor which is usually to busy to take the call. Support structure is nonexistent as it ""costs to much"" to provide. Be prepared for co stand head aches if you work here."
good,"I loved this job and was good at it, but the systems never worked properly which cost both the company and the sales staff money. I was top sales rep."
good,Was a much better company to work for when it was Southwestern Bell. Southwestern Bell cared for it's employees and the people that worked for them and their families.
good,I really do not remember too much about employment here seeing as I have not worked here in at least 7 years. I wish that I could be more help. And to add this was only a summer job when I was in college.
good,"Network Operations Field in AT&T is not a welcoming place for women trying to have a career in technologies. there are no advancement opportunities neither an exit strategy to other fields within at&t, the definition of a dead end. A good job for retiring on if there is no interest on getting ahead."
good,"I liked the many different people from around the world you would get to chat with . I enjoyed fixing accounts and building customer report. "
good,Working for Car-tel Communications isn't a bad idea. if you work hard you have an opportunity to make a lot of money. Overall not a bad place to work if you don't mind constant deductions for not selling Direct TV or hitting monthly and or quarterly goals.
good,"Pays great, good benefits, targets were raised 45% in a month, always felt as if you were going to get suspended, fired, or laid off very low job security."
good,"Pays well but u will give up everything else. Micro-managed to pieces. Too large of a gap between the have and the have nots. The less work you do, the more you get paid"
good,Will never do call center work again because of this job. The pay was decent but the job was way too demanding. These types of companies could use someone with an I/O psychology degree on site.
good,"groundhogs day.. "
good,"Unless you have a degree this place will rob you blind, make sure to get in a union. The benefits are very good. The provide plenty of work. They have weird restrictions, like no wearing shorts even if it's over 90 degrees outside."
good,"Watched a great place to work as DireTV go into the dumps when ATT took over the place."
good,"The turnover rate is extremely high, people are constantly getting fired and hired. Management is not very good, but you may happen to find a manager that actually cares, which is very rare."
good,"One major cool point is that their benefits is the bomb. They also pay very well. I didn't think that they were for the employees. It was more for the customer, not the employees that handling the call with the customer."
good,"I think you can be productive but with some kind a of way u don't get paid for the thing you do, The hardest part of the job is long hours the most enjoying part of the job is being able to train people when need be."
good,This is slow company with a lot of politics behind the scene. However it's very convenient to work. I liked working here but I'd rather work in a more friendly environment.
good,"8-to whenever is the time schedule. Rotating schedule as well. Great pay, benefits, and the discounts are great. Clickish/selective about who stays and who goes. Experienced discrimination on the job with some of the employees. The potential to grow within the company comes with politics and favors, not hard work and dedication."
good,management are a bunch of young people who all fight and sleep with eachother. advancement is based on favoritism. change is constant. job security is never guaranteed.
good,Culture has completely changed from a local global telecommunication company to a content hungry company who value shareholders over employee loyalty.
good,"Tied to a phone, always felt attached to a leash. New hires get the worst shifts, mandatory over time. The company is always trying to get out from under higher payroll by finding reasons to let go of associates with seniority in order to replace with new hires who are paid less."
good,Better management to busy and crowded not enough help when needed more training needed before they get on the floor and need to be more  professional in work area
good,"Buena empresa, con muchos beneficios para empleados pero muchas carga de trabajo y pocos beneficios para personal subcontratado."
good,It was ok the only downfall is your by yourself in the warehouse. It gets boring real fast and sometimes the person from the earlier shifts messes up the work and leaves you with a crazy day.
good,"Union reps and managers defined workplace activity.  Sold cell phone, non-cell phone, internet, and television to people who called in asking for help with information or billing."
good,"This is a company where you can truly earn your own place by constantly trying to beat your best in metrics obtainment.  Commission is decent, but used to be better than currently.  Work life balance is the tough part.  Great for single individual, but once there are other priorities in your life this job does not make it easy to accommodate those priorities.  You will be coached with official documented conversations daily, and you will be micromanaged.  Go into this job expecting this."
good,This job will demand most of your time.  If this is a job that someone accepts then they need to be prepared to spend more time at work than they do with their family.
good,Although you get to work around lots of technology - get great benefits. the retail environment is on shaky ground.  There have been massive layoffs and more expected to come.  I would not recommend retail to anyone - the hours are rough and do not provide a great work life balance as well as the extreme sales pressure added to you
good,I was always complemented on my job performance but I was simply surplused from my position due to job cutbacks and union seniority.  when I tried to transfer back in later years the rules were changed and I was left selling cell phones.
good,Company has no loyalty to it's employees - will always watch their bottom dollar and when they are done toss you out like bad trash; management is decent and cares for the most part
good,Nothing really to brag about when working in the business portion of att. Not really any open oppritunities to grow unless you are involved in the consumer world of att.
good,"I worked in a support center for AT&T and they did absolutely everything in their power to keep their employees feeling like a number. There was never a discussion about what job advancement might mean with the company, regardless of the length of time you were employed there and often the scheduling was so strict that coworkers were fired after being even one minute late from a break."
good,"Muchos cambios recién el cual ha afectado el esquema de comisiones, inestabilidad laboral,beneficios no en todas la áreas"
good,"I worked for a company that was contracted with AT&T and several other companies to provide technical support and customer service."
good,I thank god for the 18 years I was with At&t but they do not care about their emloyees...Terrible place to work...There is no job security but the benefits are great
good,"You will spend more time at work than what you will at home. Your coworkers become your family and if you treat them right, they have your back. "
good,"Overall work environment is extremely micro managed. Chances of moving up in the company is based on personal relationships, not performance. Not recommended."
good,"While I thoroughly enjoyed the amount of money I could make as a leveraged sales rep for AT&T's Retention Department, I could not stick it out due to the horrible management, the big brother-like operations, the constant worry about the center closing, lack of job security, and arduous process of covering absences for illness. While the pay is great, they are paying you not only to work, but for you to be their slave. Don't expect to have any kind of personal life and don't expect them to protect you if you fall ill or develop a disability--- you're only worth something to AT&T in a chair, taking calls, otherwise you are worthless and expendable."
good,Poor training / leadership lots of people who did little . It was who you knew not what you knew. You could try and try and not get ahead if you were not in the cool club. Management did and said things they should not and only offered me a promotion if I promised not to take FMLA after birth of my son.
good,"I loved working at AT&T when I first started. I feel like the company is great but the management is not so much. Its about who you know, its not about what you have to offer when it comes to promotion. Employees who work hard doesn't really get recognition but those who are close with ASM, RSM, and higher up management tend to get promoted without working hard at all."
good,AT&T is a great company to work when I first started 10 years ago.  AT&T could careless about its employees now.  The union is a joke. They have gone back to  a point system for attendance.  If yiu are sick you get a point.  You now only have 4 points for a whole year.  Once you get 4 points you go on a written. It makes it hard to take care of your children who get sick.
good,"in the event you run into a wire technician position for ATT-Directv make sure you make it as a stepping stone towards another job, or enjoy the single life, there is very little advancement opportunities you literally have to wait for a manager to die, get fired or decided he had enough from the company to move out, the hours are long and unappreciated, the compensation is relatively good, family time is not something they care about."
good,"As long as your hitting your numbers your pay is pretty good. If for some reason you don't, its unnecessary stress from yourself because that's HUGE part of the check. Also stress for your manger because your money is their money too. and that is all they care about. Training to get in is about 3 months. But instead of seeing how much the training can improve ones skill, they will fire you, and they don't care. Management was so conceited it made it hard to work. Also, this is not a job with flexibility at all.standard 9-6 or 10-7 and they need you everyday"
good,"not a hard job yet a challenging one"
good,"When the big company got taken over by the bigger company, the entire culture changed.  Recognition became a thing of the past (they even fired the people who oversaw it), our staffing was reduced by nearly half, and the majority of our perks disappeared one-by-one.  In addition, all of our company benefits changed, for the worse.  Insurance premiums nearly doubled, the company sponsored HSA went away, and everyone had to scramble for info that had been previously presented to us clearly and concisely without having to ask for it."
good,"Att was a great experience lots of trainng to become an excellent csr "
good,Good pay kicks in once you go management. Sales consultants pay continues to be cut as more and more is asked for less pay. Benefits are weak and upper leadership has hidden agendas to remove seasoned employees to replace with lesser paid new hires.
good,NO work life balance. The company has a really difficult point system. You never get weekends off. The amount of work you have to do for the amount of money you make is not worth it
good,Start the day at 8 am arriving at first customers house and working the day until all work orders are completed.  Often times working a lot of overtime and having mandatory 6 days of work.  Hard work with ok pay for the amount of time you put in.  Have to be able to crawl into small places and work off ladders.
good,Unfortunately the company cared more about the bottom line than investing in the employees for a better customer experience. There was no empowerment to be creative to build a fun successful work place.
good,"Answer phones, assists issues accordingly, screen information, direct calls. Schedule repairs, installs, configurations, and troubleshooting software.Process transactions and payments in an efficient manner and multitask while interacting with several programs to assist customers. Maintain work area in terms of cleanliness and hygiene."
good,This was a marketing job. There were no benefits and it was 100% commission. This job was not what I expected or was looking for.
good,"Lets say a customer has issues with a service or device or unhappy about their bill,i try to resolve the issue to the best of my ability and see if there are any products that they may need to offer them. My managers ask why that customer didn't add any new services and threatens to write me up if i don't get sales. My coworkers help the days in high spirits. The most enjoyable part of my day is clocking out."
good,ATT keeps everyone in a contracting loophole with no opportunity for direct hire or advancement.  The management are only promoted due to tenure and the structure is full automation of every service.
good,"The management team is clueless to how to lead a team. Management does not understand how to motivate the staff to be successful.  Management is focused on the sales numbers instead of developing the sales team to be placed in leadership positions.  Management is taught to coach out instead of coaching up and if they are not writing people up, they get writing up.  Sorry, but it is true for the Hampton Roads area."
good,Management lacked communication skills which causes some issues when it came to procedures. Besides that the staff there were extremely helpful and mindful to everyone working there.
good,"Company has changed over the years, no longer focused on conducive environment to cause employees to thrive & want to do their best. Just a means to an end."
good,The culture promotes excellence in job functions but I worked 7 days a week for two years.  They do not want permanent employees just contractors for specific projects.
good,Good ole boy mentality that doesn't allow employees to advance. Some people get disciplined and others don't I was lucky enough to be in with the cool crowd even though I didn't feel good about it. I don't recommend for anyone with family values.
good,"When you are a new employee you are considered to be bottom of the totem pole and usually will work 11-8:30 everyday leaving no time for family. This job would be good for someone who has no life, no family, and no friends."
good,"Addressing customers technical concerns with the ability and authority to provide necessary credit(s) to prevent detraction. "
good,"Great experience but not an ideal job for someone like me. The pay was not that great, but manageable. I am working for a dealer that is not consistent or organized. Things were chaotic."
good,"I enjoy working at AT&T, although I wish the environment was more stable.  Also, in terms of compensation coming in as a contract employee is more beneficial."
good,"Same thing i said about it before.  They pay decent for a call center, but then again, I dont know how much people start off with.  Dont expect to move up here, very little job opportunities."
good,Working for AT&T was a fast & easy learning job. Once through the doors I experienced the real deal. The upper management did not take the under position employee serious. Upper management was often jumping to conclusions without any proper guidelines or procedures before warnings/part ways with an employee. It is an easy learning job and you can progress within the company if doing what you are suppose to be doing.
good,Management is constantly changing and only the favorites get promoted or are able to transfer. Long hours and no home life.
good,hard work dig thru others peoples stuff to hang or display in store. you have part time hours min wage lots of on your feet work never know what is going to come in clean or very dirty so beware anything can be seen.
good,At&t Uverse call center is a good place to work if you need fast money.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that you get to pick overtime if you want.
good,"Between the management and the responsibilities of the job, the work you do for the pay you get is not worth committing to a career here. With the acquisition of Direct TV, Prem Techs now have to do everything that a DTV tech would do on top of their normal jobs (in other words double the workload) for the exact same pay. Management does not care about it and the union does nothing about grievances."
good,"Policies and procedures are constantly changing, expectations shift depending on the manager you have and the manager your manager reports to. Meeting the requirements you are given is never good enough to avoid constant criticism. Work is high stress, fast paced. Most customers are upset and will not be satisfied regardless of anything you can do."
good,since the merge with at&t and Directv the company is not the same environment it became hostile and the stress became to much. Prior to the merge it was a dream to work for such a company.
good,I have been with the company for 2.5 years and there has been no shift bids in over  a year.  I was terminated while on disability.
good,"estoy en un modulo en soriana cadereyta,entro a las 11 am y salgo a las 8 pm."
good,"Management at ATT is deplorable.  Those in management do not care about work life balance even though they preach it.  THey are only worried about what their bosses think..  The ""stuff"" truly does role down hill."
good,Good place to work when young and still motivated by money. High attrition due to work hours and personal/work life balance.  Opportunity for growth is limited.
good,I found this job a good place to learn how to make important foods and gain skills on how to prep them and learn how to multitask and run a slicing machine
good,AT@T was a good place to get familiar with the business side of the telecom world and find out what is customer satisfaction rate and what can be done to improve customer service.
good,My overall feel of the company is it is very set in its ways. Older employees don't really embrace younger peers joining the company as much as they should. A position can be very stable but moving up to a superior role is difficult even if you're a top performer.
good,worked in the lab and on sales floor.  Underpaid for what you actually do in the lab when you consider how much product you produce in the amount of time you produce it.  Sales commission per transaction is kind of a joke when you take into consideration how much the customer is spending on one or two pairs of glasses and lenses.
good,The average person lasted about 70 days. Out of the 30 people in my class 2 were left after a year. This may have changed in the years since I was there but we were considered contractors not AT&T employees. We didn't get their pay or benefits and were made to feel like we were expendable. The best part was being able to pick up all the over time you wanted. The worst part was not knowing anyone because everyone around me was always new.
good,This company has gone through many changes and does to always have the employee in mind when changing. be prepare for constant direction change.
good,Managers are not considerate that you have a life outside of work that you much balance and they have a terrible habit of not communicating
good,"inventory your truck. call first appointment."
good,"It's an okay place to work. Casual dress, learning on the job is constant but easy. A lot of approachable people as far as help and overall friendliness. The benefits are average, the pay is below the mark, the attendance policy is nothing short of strict. Tries to promote fun work environment, but actions via certain management officials contradict that mantra. Advancement from within is a popularity contest and even with that, still an uphill battle."
good,It was a work from home environment. Learned how to assist customers who called in with a problem with their account. There was no one directly over us. Worked from home so didn't really have any co workers. The hardest part of the job was the constant new things they wanted you to learn on a weekly basis and the amount of information they wanted us to know in such a short period of time. Best part of the job was being able to work from home and set your own schedule.
good,"Contract Employee. Paid 25% of industry wide, skill set, Wages Level. Project shut down regardless of merits of the project. Simply cut to meet Cost Cutting numbers"
good,"Several leaders in senior positions need a face-lift!  Leadership drives culture in all organizations.  Turnover is high in several sites and retention is low when the culture is poor.  Nepotism is rampant with managers/leads dating CSRs. Several leaders are unethical inside and outside of the workplace. This creates a culture that many employees do not want to be a part of and become very unmotivated to come to work. "
good,"I do like the job I do daily as I am a people person and enjoy helping"
good,For the U verse operations aspect this organization is worse then when I was in the army. I am treated with little or no respect by my manager and coworkers I have just started working with out of training here in Austin. Quite disappointing since I was really excited about this position.
good,"Every day, you fear you may be fired the next. The pay and health benefits are amazing, but barely make up for the fact that you constantly under a large amount of stress. Negative reinforcement is all too common. I did learn a lot about proper customer service and how to sell a wide range of products."
good,Directv was a great paying job with great benefits but when it came to personal life and having illness they cared more about having people in the chair then they did about the person and what was going on. even with doctors notes saying that they where to not be at work directv would not allow it unless you had the pto to cover it or medical accommodation from another party which you where not allowed to have tell you have been their a year.
good,"Schedule and time off, was based on seniority. Upgrading customers mobile plans. Adding extra features to an existing mobile plan. Helping the customer understand their mobile bill. Helpful co-workers, but management was barely around. The most enjoyable part of the job, was receiving your  commission check."
good,It did not provide the upward mobility I had hoped for.  There were alot of lateral moves without an increase in pay.  Very frustrating.
good,"Sales position at AT&T is the epitome of a dog eat dog world. The schedule is rough if you do not have seniority and the quotas are pretty difficult as well. If you have a back bone, no children/minimal social life, the ability to handle lots of stress & difficult management, and previous sales experience then this job's for you."
good,"Started from home and punched in on handheld computer,put my self on site,ETC,activate service,make changes to work order,close work orders and communicate with dispatch and supervisor at days end and punch out on handheld.The job was always making changes and had to be willing to accept change.Alot of my co-workers were inexperienced and not willing to take advise.I did enjoy the freedom and trust they had in me to go and do my job with the least of supervision........."
good,"Make sure we were ""online"" at exactly the time we were to log in for the day, unable to bring up all the screens/programs we needed to efficiently help the customer as the company didn't want us to do that before our scheduled time."
good,Just like any other call center on a timely matter or getting on the phones meeting multiple criteria high stress with sales and requirements to meet the job
good,"the job was very routine.  I was in collections, some of managers were great and some weren't. Most of my co-workers were there just to get a check. The hardest part of my job was have people take crazy to me about a cell phone. The day i was let go was my most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"•	Support of Vallent Prospect report generation software and applications for UNIX system base.   "
good,"Too many changes for no reason.  Unstable Management and practices."
good,Directv is a fine job if you don't mind sitting on the phone for hours at a time.
good,"I typically would arrive at work by 7:30am, and leave by 5:30pm.  The work environment was bad, with no coffee to be had anywhere.  I had a decent boss, however, she would never consider me for my true job, which was project management.  I was hired to be a project / program manager, but got pigeon-holed into a dead-end, worthless job with no possibility of advancement."
good,The company was more focused on making sales than on resolving customer concerns. They also have a extremely strict policy for QA where one mistake during a call will cost you your job.
good,A typical day at work is feeling like your coming in going back to grammar school and listen to the teacher for 30 mins to an hour in the morning which cuts away from working time. The skills learned to do the job are what I greatly appreciate. Co-workers were pretty helpful but some were setting bad examples. The hardest part of the job was the hours worked which was eventually not a problem anymore. The most enjoyable part was the amount of money that could be made.
good,"Management lacks leadership skills and the ability to train their employees and new changes with the company.  The pay and benefits are great, but the stress level is through the roof when you constantly have managers over your shoulder.  They also hold no value to an employee's tenure with the company and will terminate employment at the first sign of poor stats OR incorrect tool usage even if your have met them constantly for months.  They will offer no guidance to instruct you on the correct methods."
good,"Great company to work for as far as hourly and compensation as well. But after all, sales is what drives the company overall, so if you're not selling enough they will be on you every single time with every single customer. After so many years with the company I am fed up and tired of insisting people to buy things that I think they need and not what they really need. "
good,"I've gained a lot of information, some outdated and will never be used anywhere. Some has been useful and can carry over to other jobs that could lead to some level of success. "
good,"calls are typical customers calling in complaining about the system not working"
good,Work in a multi departmental office resolving customer concerns.
good,This was a temporally promotions job. I only work when the supervisor called me that a spot was open. But the pay was really good.
good,After a year of improving myself for the company and looking to move up. I left after no longer being able to support myself or my loved ones on the paycheck. $400 to $600 every two weeks for 80+ hours a week. My attempts to move up were ignored and had to resign.
good,"Managers do not have any idea what they are doing, The call center I worked at does not care about its employees and their life's. The pay for reps could be so much better, the benefits are great, but you have to deal with more that just good benefits. Because its a call center the turn over rate is really high. The company wants you to do so much on just one call its hard to keep track of what to do on each call. The managers do not want to take escalated calls they will find ways to get out of them. just more negativity in that call center there then I would like to be around."
good,Will fire you for anything!!!! the sales rep are all fake and management is horrible........ watch out!!!
good,"As a whole I'm sure AT&T is a great company to work for. But if you end up working for the U-Verse side of AT&T good luck and more power to you. Working in Atlanta they said you would only work 8-10 hr. days. I worked 12 plus daily, barely got to see my family. Management was terrible, you get stuck on the job and need help, only thing they will say to you is ""well figure it out"". Co-workers were great because they understood what I was going through. Hardest part is when you can't figure out why your not getting a signal inside the house after replacing the homerun line several times and crawling around a 12-16in high crawl space. Only thing that was enjoyable was lunch break."
good,"I worked as a contractor in a new department, there were a lot of promises made to fellow employees that were not followed through on by the company, there were also managers who were not quite qualified to be in their positions, did not know how to do the work but, were given the position just because they are friends with higher managers. The work environment was, however, very relaxed for the most part.  The teams on our floor loved to throw parties and events for any occasion."
good,"Great learning experience, poor management. Worked 6 days a week, Wed off. Co-workers were great! Hardest part of the job was the preasure of sales. The most enjoyable was working with the public."
good,"This job had very good pay and benefits, but this job treated you like a robot and not an individual. this job made you talk like they wanted you to talk. I feelt like I could not be me."
good,This company stresses starting at the absolute bottom and moving up tier by tier after long periods of employment at each tier.  The balance between work and personal life is also not important to management.
good,The technicality of the job consists of troubleshooting Internet service issues for subscribers of DSL High Speed Internet. The company provides adequate training to learn the tools and software needed to perform the job well.
good,This use to be a great company to work for before changes started to take place. Compensation plans have been lowered and there is too much micromanagement. It seems as though AT&T continues to search for ways to make their employees unhappy.
good,"The most I received from working with this company was the day to day challenge it presented, such as consistent increase in product knowlege, expectations in performance, being very flexible with time and open to change. The downside to working for the company was their lack of communication and clarity of job duties causing it to be completely unorganized and hard to maintain a consistent and successful job performance.My overall enjoyable part of the job was the challenge, perfecting responses and other ways to connect and build with customers. I love learning knew things to help promote me to a higher level than where I was before. Exceeding expectations."
good,"Is a company with good training progra, but supervisor's need to be more friendly oriented with technicians."
good,"My day at AT&T would involve resolving customer issues, informing and educating the customer. Telling them of AT&T products and future events. My coworkers varied in my year of employment I had 6 different coworkers in a 3 person store. The most rewarding part of my job was hitting my goals and getting a bonus."
good,"The company is great. Its AT&T, so they will be around forever. The issue is the constant every day fear of losing your job. There are many goals and metrics to meet,each of which can hurt the other. The morale in the building is shot. Everyone and i mean EVERYONE is afraid to lose their job and waiting on the day it will happen. You are treated as another number. You are expendable and replaceable. The union follows the steps required as a union, but dont really care if you get help or not. I filed a grievance to get my job back and their response was ""well we can try but they usually say no so its up to you"". Very encouraging... as i feared, I lost my job after devoting 6 years of my life to them. A house, 2 cars and a nice independent life later, they took it all away. Find me under the freeway, my new home!"
good,I worked at AT&T for over a year. They were really shady in that when I first interviewed with them they never said that we were required to sell anything. ans then when we got on the floor after training it was a different story. the Sales and Customer Service needs to be separte not combined!
good,"As a premises technician, you learn a lot about wiring, networking, and customer service. No two days are the same and each job comes with its own challenges."
good,"I loved that we had so many devices to learn from and I witnessed the speed of technology evolving.  I love helping customers, they are the main reason I went to work everyday.  I loved being able to help a customer with any problems they had.  Unfortunately, I did not like the store environment.  The first location I worked at was wonderful.  The team was very welcoming. I was transferred to another location which was totally opposite.  Everyone was very cold and unfriendly  No customer service at all.  I expected more from the company.  The benefits were too expensive.  Not what I expected from AT&T."
good,"Monitor my team of 18 CSR's on quality, call control, sales and product knowledge. Also take escalated calls from irrate or upset clients. Analyze daily,weekly and monthly statistics to identify trends. Provide coaching and development to my team and CSR's daily. Administer action plans and solutions to my outliers who are not meeting or exceeding goals. ect...."
good,The office was very relaxing. i have gained lot of experiences. work well with my peers.
good,"great job for those who like to work alone, I personally did not like working in harsh weather conditions."
good,a decent company for hardworkers the mgt makes job more difficult then it has to be .
good,"I have worked for AT&T for 5 years and ive seen it gone for absoloutley amazing to one of the worst places to work-  They expect too much! They add on new goals every month, change the commission structure every year and some how are able to pay you less and less while expecting more and more-  They do not care about their employees-- my boss told me I wasnt allowed to have a work life balance working in this retail enviornment!! Most enjoyable part is working with technology but when the stress gets to you...and it will get to you, you will be looking for other avenues quickly."
good,this job is stressful. the only good thing is the pay and the benefits.
good,"it was fun place to work. There was no home-work balance. You worked 10-12 hours a day and expected to go to ""team nights"" instead of spending time with your family. It is a single persons company to work for"
good,"Un dia tipico en el trabajo: nos reunimos en la cochera, y viajamos a la zona! nos reunimos al mediodia para almorzar, charlamos un rato de lo q se hizo, y durante el horario de descanzo llamamos clientes y buscamos zonas donde puede llegar a venderse en buena cantidad... No teniamos horario de vuelta porq no nos importaba la hora siempre y cuando sea por alguna entrevista con clientes... Muy buen grupo de compañeros, me gusta porq tienen ganas de trabajar... La administracion de la empresa esta muy desorganizada, lo q genera problemas a la hora de organizar viaticos, viajes, puesta a punto de los vehiculos, y lo peor al la hora de cargar las ventas (lo cual genera mucha disconformidad en los clientes, por demoras). Aprendi muchisimo a valorar la palabra del cliente, lo cual me sirve a mi para poder ver de q forma lo puedo convencer para q compre el producto, y en el caso de tener varios, geerarle la confianza de q le voy a vender algo q lo deje muy conforme y no algo q me conviene a mi!!!"
good,"Its three star company "
good,Handle heavy call volume following company guidelines. Pay is competitive and benefits are good but work enviroment is stressful. Co-workers are great!
good,"Its not a job for everybody, you have to be cut from a special cloth to hang in at this company. Its great for some, but not a universal fit for everyone by no means. The coworkers were great and a lively bunch, the management needed managers, the most enjoyable part of the job was getting the weekends off to decompress."
good,Hired on good independent with boss that dont pay on time bad.
good,"    a typical day at work: Log in and be ready to take calls as they came. Inform potential client about DirecTV product. "
good,"their hours where not steady, they called at an hour to tell you to go to work and if you where not there when they needed it was an issue even if they call you at 12am to be at work at 2am, u need to be there no matter, and they never gave you 8 hours between shifts, they were rude and required you pay for stuff that they wont pay you back for but it was required by them not for the job just something they changed."
good,Constant change for changes sake.  Constant turn over in management so we were always reinventing the wheel.  There was not much consideration for your personal life.
good,"Busy throughout the whole shift. Fun, able to meet new people. Able to learn something new every day."
good,"the money and benefits were great but management was terrible, communication was terrible"
good,"diretv is a good company to work for if you don't have a family. start the morning by checking your route then you go out and complete the jobs you were given, the down side for this is the management makes false promises. "
good,It was a nice place to work but the hours were very demanding and there was no stability in the job.
good,"Not fun, stressfull, all about productivity and numbers."
good,"I loved working at AT&T for the first 5 years, and then with all of the mergers and managment changes everything was focused on numbers and not people."
good,"AT&T repair center offers the same challenges the average call center offers; long periods sitting at one station, working with irate customers, changing work shifts and constant emphasis on number crunching and call quality, often at the expense of really servicing the customer."
good,"siempre es bueno aprender.estar en contacto con la gente.lo más dificil fue llegar a algún tipo de estabilidad económica porque no tenía sueldo,todo era comisión."
good,The pay is great but they are not good to their call center employees.
good,Great opportunity to learn more about the telecommunication industry and many different functions involved.
good,"I worked at ATT for quite some time. The people are a bunch of back-biting, clique-oriented, miserable wretches because that's what management wants. There is no incentive to work hard and do your best, just stay with the herd. Managers are typically people who decided they didn't want to do the work, so they sucked up to their boss to get into management, which in turn leads to more bad management since nobody knows how to handle people. The biggest problem with ATT is integrity - there is none."
good,"Management is the jobs we were replacing, so management didnt really want us replacing their friends at a lower pay for the same jobs"
good,"Plagued with nepotism, if not liked by management one can be targeted and work life made very stressful. Therefore,having earned a higher level degree, is a wash. There are many qualified Afro- American's with tenure to fill leadership roles who are overlooked, for example manager position filled by an intern right out of college with no prior experience. I retired early, conditions for me had become very uncomfortable. I loved working for the company but for me continuing to work in a hostile environment was unwarranted demeaning to my character and professionalism. With higher educational degrees and strong management expertise it was difficult to continue to witness unfair labor practices, after nine years. Job was challenging, worked well with co-workers and enjoyed working for the customers. The most difficult part of the job was getting adequate training and fair job advancement opportunities."
good,It is a very stressful and there is too much change. Every three months you change managers and seating. There is no consistancy with the job.
good,i dont really like this job i know more the leads and Management!!!
good,I work at AT&T part time right now but dont plan on staying for a career. It is a great company but it doesnt challenge me.
good,Too much work for the money
good,"en desarrolo del puesto asignado, aprendeindo el sistema de venta, y la concrecion de la venta."
good,It would be a great company if they really cared. I learned a lot about phones and other devices. I helped customers with their billing issues and I treated them as if they were my family. The hardest part of the job is the management because they are all friends and there is no room for advancement unless you know someone. I love my customers.
good,"DirecTV provides excelent training for thier staff, however thier focus is not on the employee it is on driving up customer monthly bills and hooking customers into long term commitments all the while raising thier monthly bills sometimes without fair notice not a good look for a company the whole thing feels shady."
good,"This company going thru its various changes since 1998 has endured the test of time being well established. When I started, when I transfered, and when it ended could be a tale of three cities. Once a company where when you came to service the customer all was great, to if you dont sell 100% of the time all of the time then what you have worked to build can come tumbling down. I enjoyed my experience, but I wouldn't want to work in certain departments within this company again."
good,"At&t has the worst way of coaching employees. They have a system that tracks everyone's sales. No matter how well you do for each month the bottom 10% is getting written up. In my year of experience with this new method at&t have made i have realized that it tends to create a lot of back stabbing for sales. Now its selling to benefit a ranking, instead of selling whats best for the customer. The reason I do stay is because of pay which is becoming less and less year after year."
good,• Open the shop for business and facilitate tech routes for the day.
good,"Pay was wonderful but management made life miserable!! As always in a call center, customers were a handful but the employees there are great and very helpful."
good,AT&T is a great company to work for. A typical day was working as a project manager on the migratation all of their current storage infrastructure to a new NetApp Storage infrastructure and mentoring new hires. As well as documenting new processes as the project I was working was losing a great deal of resources and following change management procedures. I learned a great deal with my time with AT&T from their processes and daily redundancy in certain areas that could be eliminated to provide more productive time for the tasks at hand. The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility to work from home some days during the week. They hardest part of the job was the very long demanding weekend work after working a full 40+ hour week.
good,"I worked for a vendor of AT&T. The AT&T portion was great the vendor was the issue. New company still working out policies and such. Pay is fine however no paid time off, point system however no excused sick time so you will occur points with or without a doctors slip. Im not sure how well that will work over time with human as employees and expensive medical insurance."
good,A typical day at work was ALWAYS stressful. The managers had no problem informing employe's that they would not be employed long. They raise goal every month and if you do not meet goal you would be at risk of being fired. If you did not sale certain products then you would not get bonus no matter if you made goal or not. The hardest part of the job was not being able to spend time with my son because there was mandatory overtime at least 5 days out of the week.
good,"I was actually one of the very first technicians that started with the AT&T Uverse service. In my opinion they rolled out this produst to fast. The training was not very good, the trainers did not know very much about the service either. This made it difficult but not imposible to be sent out into the field with very little knowledge. It did make me a very good technician by teaching myself and learning from other technicians."
good,I did enjoy most of my co-workers and managers but felt a lack of communication for top management. Their philosophy was for you to ask questions to disseminate program updates and information; they would not provide proactive top down notifications. They did not encourage out-of- the box thinking or initiatives. If it wasn't part of the process you were heavily chastised for doing it.
good,I work with amazing group of account managers and I have loyal wonderful customers.
good,They have no flexibility in working with someones schedule and outside demands.
good,"I noticed my first day that every tech in my garage out of 3 crews were basically worried about or excepting the fact that sooner or later they would be fired. The demand they put on the techs is stressful. Long, long, long days, being forced in or your day off or even out of town for weeks at a time, and entirely too much micro-management make work feel like much more than a job. Compensation is good, however, likely not worth it. Good luck to those that try."
good,"During my time with AT&T, I did enjoy my job. This company has good intentions but zero follow through at Area management level (ARSM) & above. I found the directors within the market I worked-some of the worst. Other markets had engaged & genuine directors of sales.This company starts training & coaching at the bottom of the food chain and does a solid ""stop"" at director of sales level & above, instead of introducing new techniques & information @ both high & low positions & meeting in the middle."
good,"management style is negative management, where your faults and failings are what is brought forth in an attempt to improve work levels rather than positive management where the good aspects and good reports are over looked"
good,very dynamic environment and lots to learn and grow. learning cutting edging tech processes and systems along with working with pople of varied culture and ethnic backgrounds is always exciting
good,"When I first started over 20 years ago, it was an excellent company to work for. Over the course of the years, the environment has changed and it is a less desirable company to consider for employment."
good,"AT&T should value the employees who go above and beyond. The corporate culture is one that does not value any tenured employees, especially those who have helped them exceed mandated government regulations."
good,I had to do door to door sales and walk many streets just to get a customer and half the time they werent able to get service. I only had s notebook and a pencil to write down orders.
good,"I started out LOVING my job at AT&T, but quickly found that the environment was toxic. Management had clear favorites and worked actively to terminate employees they didn’t personally like."
good,There is a lot on confusion with management.  There is no cohesive unity in the management and a lot of chiefs and not enough Indians. Just wish there where more reliable leaders and not everyone having there own vendettas.
good,"I generally enjoyed myself due to the fact I didnt get much assistance. It feels like youre running your own company. I enjoyed the many customers I encountered in my 7 years. If you are not a people person and cannot process technology alone, this job isnt for you. You will have an opportunity to make plenty of money with the OT. I felt like Tom Hanks looking for Wilson in Cast Away because of no support."
good,"Tuve la oportunidad de conocer 2 AT&T, como capacitador fue estupenda, nos vendían y vendíamos espejos de una gran cultura organizacional, enfocada al personal, en donde funcionaba las líneas de denuncia y el crecimiento era exponencial."
good,"Not enough growth / care taken. "
good,"The best part about working for AT&T is there are multiple opportunities to work in any area you desire. Collaboration is great along with the benefits. The people that work in the trenches within the organization are also great."
good,"The fact that you really don’t have anyone over you because you’re out in the field by yourself is good, but that about it. You’re a door to door salesman that has to lie your way into people homes. You show up to the techs appointments that are there to install cable or internet. You pretend to be some kind of manager to get into the door, then have to try to sell them phones. AT&T service usually isn’t better or cheaper but you show them a price that appears to be. Then they get a bill that’s way higher and now you have a angry customer that feels lied to. You call customer service and spend hours on the phone trying to correct it. They never do. On top of all of that, you get charged back for up to 6 months! Job isn’t great or worth it"
good,"If all you care about is making money, AT&T is for you. The pay is absolutely top scale and the benefits are not bad even though they have been cut in recent years. With overtime- often mandatory- you will make well into 6 figures a year. But you will go home stressed out, angry and probably become an alcoholic if you work there too long.  Very stupid management too."
good,"Depending on which organization you belong to or work in, it can be a satisfying place to work at and develop your career.  In a company of this size, it is all about who you know and how well you network since there's a good chance you'll need advocates to get to where you want."
good,"Ryder Logistics is the company I actually work for.  "
good,"Very good jobs at AT&T.   Lots of Area Manager And PM Jobs.  Too many employees never receive a promotion or maybe just one in 20 years.    Unless you have a friend above you to carry you along, don’t expect a promotion any time soon   Lots of layoffs and re-organizations"
good,"The company is too big.  The executives are so far disconnected from reality that it is frustrating and difficult to communicate with them.  They continually talk about how well they are doing to organizations that aren't well off.  They do not know how to connect to the 'little people'"
good,Todo excelente hasta que paso una semana sin tener las herramientas necesarias para laborar
good,"Unfortunately, how much you enjoy this place completely depends upon how management functions. An inexperienced stressed manager equals stressed employees. But a management that is seasoned will make you feel pressure, but give you the tools to accomplish your task. Learned a lot from working here. The money was good, but unfortunately the big ticket item (Directv) is a dying medium. And they push this to be sold like crazy. I loved my coworkers and head manager though but the stress to sell something thats going obsolete made me change directions. Good job for people just starting out."
good,The place is ran by mangers who forced to micro-mange by there managers to reach our sales goals. So the pressure is sometimes unbearable. We get talked to after every single customer we help about why we didnt sell them directv or why they didnt add a new line or why they didnt want insurance. The reception in our area is terrible we are forced to the lie to the customer and try to be like there is nothing wrong with the reception. When there really is.
good,I wouldn't sat say its the best experience. They set a monthly quota and expect you to hit it without doing pushy things it felt wrong people just went in there to fix their phone ended up leaving with tablets home services tv accessories upgraded phone I felt like I worked at a car dealership.
good,"Empresa con buenas ideas, prestaciones y objetivos.sin embargo el 80% de los jefes que tiene la empresa no conocen la complejidad de la operación así como las necesidades de la empresa para que el personal se desarrolle, es una empresa en la que si demuestras que algun superior esta haciendo algo mal te dan de baja con pretextos y causas no comprobables."
good,It is a competitive type of job. You need to push products out and assure you to give everyone what they would like. For example if they buy a phone you should ask if they would like a case.
good,"The company pays a pretty decent wage for the most part, and offers pretty good benefits and retirement options for a huge corporation. The issue is that the company sees you as a number and one that cost the company not betters it. You can not order essential parts to preform your job and changes are usually made in a way that increases the overhead of the company as opposed to a benefit to customers and workers alike, and these changes are based off people who have never been in this position or haven't been in the position for many years. The company also reserve the right to force techs to work a six day work week for months at a time but only notify them on Wednesday for the next week, so technicians have to cancel plans or seeing their family because they can not move or schedule time off in short notice."
good,"The employees was greet but we had low morale and poor management."
good,"ATT pays for clothes, boots, tools, and provides vehicle with gas.  Pay is decent with overtime.  Benefits are good. No opportunities for growth. Union job"
good,"I was able to provide for my family, but it was extremely hard to get positions close to where I live... Almost felt, like the company was trying to make it hard for that to happen..."
good,Los turnos son demasiado extensos y cuando estan en temporada alta no respetan horarios de almuerzo o break
good,"I not going to express any negative job experience on this platform. AT&T afforded my the opportunity to work with the company and I'm appreciative. "
good,"Very stressful, schedules inflexible, call volume constant. I would have preferred to work in retail versus the call center but never given an opportunity. 7 years total, still couldn't get schedule preferences."
good,They hiring right now but they might lay you off in a year. It was long hours you had to be at the shop by 7am to get equipment like 2 times a week. It was stressful cause stuff keep changing
good,"When I first started working here the commissions were great, the atmosphere was great. The company used to hold rally's to shop how they appreciate everyone, buy slowly that changed and it was all about getting to the goal. If you didn't reach that goal this month you were written up on some type of discipline. I moved around to a few different departments and the culture had changed everywhere. people were always stressed out about losing their jobs at the same time every year. Every year they always made cuts and it wants always based on performance. I know first had because a coworker lost his job and he was leading the whole team year to date. I was in 2nd place at the time and we both thought we were safe."
good,They set goals and change them highly during launches and holidays to reduce bonus payout. Poor communication. Lack of culture. Makes you work extended hours during holidays ie 50-70 hrs and 6 days per wk. If you don’t sell Directv they reduce pay 50 percent. Force you to focus on things that don’t pay you out. Clocks you out even if you don’t take a break.
good,"Att is constantly looking for ways to terminate top performers or long time employees to get the payroll budget down. They do pay well however the amount of hours you have to put it to hit monthly goals and quotas really cuts in to work life balance."
good,Dont do it dont do it dont do it dont do it you will regret it dont do it. Att only cares about themselves they dont care about their employees. Att is selfish and greedy
good,"Company started surplusing employees back in January but the workload of installation and repairs has increased since then. The work became stressful as they had to start enforcing 6 days on / 1 day off. Being I had a family, this did not align with my interest and eventually moved on to a better job with the same pay. Great benefits and 401K plan. Job security at the moment seems bad since they could surplus more employees. Time will tell."
good,They just dont care about you or the customer. They will have no issue laying you off due to their bad business decisions. Upper management just wants their bonus.
good,"The Commission structure is not designed for you to get paid, The goals are unrealistically high. ATT does not care about its Employees. I worked there for 7 years worst job I ever had. Horrible management drove me into quitting."
good,"Worked for the company for a year and a half, within that time, I've had 5 different retail store managers(RSM). Very hawkish because of the pressure from upper management which created a borderline toxic work environment."
good,I made the most of my time with the company to excel as far as I could.  Travel was constant with use of a company vehicle that was poorly maintained by the company.
good,"If you are looking for a job at&t is not for you.  Managers are back stabbers and only care about themselves.  They preach will versus skill and if you have a skill gap they will no do anything about it and make you learn yourself.  But if you learn incorrectly they will fire you.  You have to sell cell phone service to people that have directv and all they care abOut are numbers and don’t care if you have a family or not.  Do NOT work for AT&T in northern Virginia.  Find a better job, the benefits are not worth it.  These sellers and manager have no integrity and allow fraud to happen to the company."
good,"AT&T as a company is awesome but the management sucks. There’s a union but they don’t help, especially since they’re friends with management. The pay is decent and they offer overtime often so it’s not hard to make a decent living. They offered little to no advancement opportunities."
good,This job is great if you have no family and wanna make some quick money keep in mind your social life will severely suffer since the upper management (the ones who run the market) have no respect for your time off. Plus keep in mind if you dont use PTO time they dont pay you out on it over all a terrible job if you value family or pto
good,"Las políticas y filosofía propias de AT&T provenientes de Estados Unidos son grandiosas, sin embargo, las personas que ""dirigen""  en México a nivel dirección y gerencial en su mayoría son gente que era de Nextel, personal carente de profesionalismo, ideas creativas y raciocinio. Cuándo quieren despedirte ""buscan"" lo que sea y te fincan responsabilidades de las que no tienes responsabilidad y te indemnizan con un menor monto. Para ahorrar, dicen los de RH."
good,"Commission rate was cut the day I got out of new hire training. Reps were making half the commission checks they were making for the same amount of work. Stores close at 8pm, but most nights there were four to six customers still in the store in queue. You don't get off when your shift ends, at times you're off two or even four hours after your scheduled shift. In Indiana, reps are unionized while the management is not, making for super low trust between reps and managers. Leadership was weak and relied on power tools of threats and paltry rewards to motivate team members. We were often urged to push products that weren't a good fit for our customers to meet store goals set by computer algorithms. Almost impossible to get time off, shifts are awarded per longevity with the company. All in all, I didn't get paid enough to warrant long hours, no time off, and toxic culture."
good,"You will work alone in the field with your iPad and iPhone, "
good,"Company always has huge layoffs so job security isn’t secure."
good,"Work is always the focus for the company. Employees don't have time to pursue further education. Work in inclement weather, regardless of the severity, w/o hardard pay."
good,Leadership adopts new ideas and methodologies only as a public relations strategy. When it comes to implementation there is no follow through or focus on quality. Leadership does not understand the day to day reality nor does it truly believe in what they set forth as goals.
good,Managers make you feel like trash if you don't hit your weekly goals. They don't know how to motivate unless it's threats with write ups. They're inconsistent and for the most part super lazy. AT&T really needs to learn how to pick better managers.
good,"At onetime, it was a great company to work for. People were excited to go to work. Now it is a culture of bad moral in which the desire to work there has greatly lessened. Upper management no longer caresabout work, home life balance."
good,"Advancement is either going to happen for you or it isn’t. If you’re lucky enough to be your managers buddy and work in an area with an area manager who won’t block promotions - you’ll get promoted within a year. Problem is... it’s 100% political. You’ll know after 4-5 months if you’re going somewhere. Suck up to your management, exceed your sales goals (150% overall attainment) and look around to see how many in your area get promoted. Don’t be late or miss time because the majority of people get fired for “points”. Utilize your u ions and good luck. You could make good money there at one point. That seems to fluctuate depending on the goal structures."
good,"The position is presented as a customer service position but make no mistake, this is a sales job first, second, third and in a distant fourth is customer service."
good,"Absolutely loved what I did. But did not have a balanced life. Nights and weekends for over 6 yrs"
good,It is an okay place. It is highly demanding of your time as you are required to work over time when needed.  It is good pay and benefits. I would recommend if you have no problem working 60+ hours.
good,You could learn alot about electronics working there but it depends on the location you work at as far as bonuses and money is concerned. I wouldn't personally work there again.
good,"At&t is a good company to work for if you are someone who is okay working retail hours. That means closing at 9pm and not leaving until 10-1030 the latest. You have to be willing to work every weekend and everything is seniority base.  They do pay well hourly and with the perk of making another 3-600 on commission (before tax) if your okay with the hours and working weekends you will succeed with att. Also, if your going to school I recommend part time because they work with your school hours. Full-time it’s harder for them to work with your schedule so you will run into trouble. I don’t recommend this job if you have a family because work life balance will not exist with this company. Even if you work part-time they will not work with your schedule to fit your family life style. Management can try to help you but then co workers love to call union and HR and will hate on your situation, leaving management not able to help you anymore because of the word “favoritism” even when that’s not the case. This is all advice and I just want to be clear about things that I always seen ran issue with some people when they got hired. Hope this helps."
good,AT&T pay their employees very well but do have a lot of layoffs. Layoffs been happening more this year 2019 than the years I been here. Management is poor. Level 1 managers get told by level 2 manager they are not writing enough people up so they purposely create problems at techs’ job to have some to document. Very stressful environment. Manager tells techs to have their ducks in a row due to they may or may not lay-off more techs. This job really discourages a lot of us to even do the work just to come to work the next day without a job.  My advice to anyone applying for Wire tech or installation tech position DONT NOT WORK FOR THIS COMPANY. They do not care about employees. First day their you will hear about how you could get laid off in a week or so. This is not a company you can retire from because they will not let you.
good,This was a very good 'filer' job. Since this company was a 3rd party contracted out and i did not get the chance to work Directly from ATT i feel as though i cannot provide appropriate feedback.
good,"Back to Back calls"
good,"The job is ok, they make it into something that it really isn't.  Their is no chance of advancement. You are actually installing things that will one day make a tech obsolete.  The Union life is horrible, no seniority no life outside of work what so ever.  Other issue is you are in the same union voting group as call centers so as  field tech you have no say at all.  Your voice is outnumbered by people inside screwing up orders."
good,Aprendí a trabajar con pocas herramientas por falta de capacitación y a trabajar bajo presión.
good,"If your not making your numbers. Your job is on the line"
good,"If you wanted to keep your job you had to adhere to unrealistic expectations.  You couldn't be just decent.  You were expected to be phenomenal from day one after training.  One bad month could put you on the path to being dismissed even if after that month you were excellent.  I really loved this job, they simply did not love me back."
good,Aprendi muchas cosas siendo de origen nextel creo que deberian recuperar esos valores de empresa y desechar los que tomaron de iusa
good,Negative culture. Everyone is worried about being laid off. Good albeit expensive benefits that cost $800/month. Leadership team has no idea what their managers do.
good,The best part of the job that I liked the most in the area that was part of my job. Was merchandising the store every 2 weeks. Means new product would be coming out along with new phones.
good,"I liked my job, very challenging. Pay could have been better. Started with AT&T, sold to Cingular. Back to AT&T so very inconsistent with benefits. Vacation, PTO etc."
good,"Great compensation and benefits, High pressure grind on the sales,"
good,"Corporate life stereo typical environment!  It’s all about the numbers and your just a number to management.  Your evaluations are not based on typical job performance, but the numbers represented in your area by your technicians."
good,I absolutely loved my coworkers. They were the best thing about AT&T. I loved my manager as a person but she wasn’t the best manager. She would ask our input on how to best help us succeed and then proceeded to do the exact opposite. There was blatant favoritism and it discouraged the other team members. And the goals and expectations placed on us were severely disproportionate to our location.
good,"Environment was high volume fast paced phone sales."
good,good place for low entry level sales.  Had a good experience working there. The only downside is the compensation plan they had. They constantly keep on changing it
good,AT&T used to be a great place to work. It is TOP heavy and much of your day is reporting to different managers the same information. I attempted and been successful to reduce the meeting and get more done while finding ways to communicate to upper and lateral management. The people are great to work with. The hardest part is the SLA levels for some work is too long and impact the ability to move more agile mode to complete projects ahead of schedule. Escalate has been more the BAU than the exception. My communication skills with cross-functional managers has held me to achieve my results on time.
good,My day consist of meetings and appointments and prospecting for new customers.  I am tasked with growing new business so I am out in the field in front of customers trying to sign new logos.
good,I loved my job managing at the call center here in Missoula. The only issues arose in the last 6 months when my a peer took credit for the work I did and I was removed from the project by my supervisor based on incorrect information given to them.
good,"Management was very unprofessional. AT&T spent all this money to train us and then as soon as you graduate, it seems all they do is try to find ways to fire you."
good,"It is said that if the Post office is working, then we are working. However there have been many days that the Post office has closed shop due to weather but we are still out working. Safety is preached but this is absolutely a results driven position. My main issue with the company is the ever changing job description. They will add job scope every 6 to 12 months, but there is never a reduction. 8 1/2 years for me and my responsibilities are too broad to list them all. Another problem that i have is more a concern. 2 years ago, they had a surplus (fancy word for layoff) and we lost some good technicians. It was done by seniority (as are many things like schedule choice or vacation poling) which some believe is fair and others believe it should be numbers driven. Our union fought to bring these guys back and get rid of contractors instead and after a small fight, they did bring back the guys that were laid off and indeed got rid of some contractors. That was a victory for us, but they just let go of 6 managers just this month and now our crew sizes will be too high. This scares me as well as the rumored layoffs on social media (the history of these rumors coming true is very high)."
good,"Upper management constantly threatened to fire good employees. They coached by fear. The work life balance was also terrible, worked every weekend and got out very late some nights."
good,"When I first hired on at AT&T it was a great company to work for.  Excellent medical benefits, great work environment, flexible work schedule, yearly bonuses."
good,place changes a lot and you need to embrace it or be eaten alive. Upper Management loses touch with actual front line sellers a lot.  Company has got to be so big it doesn't have the personal touch anymore.
good,"It's been more than six years since i worked for at&t. I can't remember much. However, back then at&t had a great commission program. I made really good money there just working park time"
good,"Entry level positions are well payed, but dead-end. The company hires people who are competent, but does not trust anyone to make good decisions and puts in place processes that everyone must follow despite logical solutions that may apply to specific circumstances."
good,"Co-workers and job are great. Politics between management and union is very stressful. I loved my job but the politics wear you down after awhile, even if you are not a member of the union."
good,The name gives a false sense of security and they treat you like cattle.  AT&T like to work you and string you along with hopes that you will make advancements. At&t is not accomadating as a technician I had to drive 50 miles to a garage when there was a garage 5 mins from my house.
good,If you are willing to work on your own and very long hours with little to no support the work is there.  You will learn skills in the training but mostly from experienced employees that have been on the job for years.   The hardest part of the job is little to no support from the management regarding help with problems on jobs or equipment.  Not having the right tools and equipment shortages.  The pay is the most enjoyable part of the job.   It pays well for the work preformed
good,No longer customer focused. No longer values employees. Only care about numbers. Managers are always stressed and they take it out on workers. The only thing that matters are numbers.
good,"Has game table, not much growth. Not very happy with the learning."
good,"Customer appreciation was extremely high before DTV sold out. "
good,"I would avoid AT&T, if at all possible, at this point. They are removing all telecommuting workers and workers outside of the 'hub' areas. I loved working for AT&T for 15 years, but it's over now."
good,AT&T was great when I first started back in 2013. Since then a lot has changed (as do with large businesses) the moral went downhill and so did the pay. It seems as though there was more work for less money.
good,"I am being forced to share feedback about AT&T."
good,No hope of becoming permanent as a term employee the transfer system is a joke management is no help at all. Its all seniority based and surplus employees have first dibs on the rare opportunities that come available.
good,"I will keep it simple. Management needs social training skills in order to be much better leaders. Management for Wire Techs is horrible in context. As for pay and other incentives for being an employee of AT&T, this is what is best. I would not recommend this job to the strong willed person. You will find yourself battling management and you will be targeted. Fair warning"
good,call center setting. great way to save money when they offer overtime. assigned to a team/manager have to sale U-Verse products. outbound call center so customers get annoyed with AT&T calling to upgrade services.
good,"My Manager had a HS education and only got the job because of his father.  These types of managers are still there and will only leave due to attrition, they retire in their 70s.  Find out how long your managment has been in place before you take the position."
good,Not a lot of pay. Could have done much better. Great on policies and processes. Stable positions offered within the company.Not a lot of room for growth at that time.
good,People yell at you all day over the phone and there is little to no advancement. Prepare yourself mentally each day as it will take all your patience not to go ham.
good,"unless seeking opportunity to work in retail forever, or facing risk of being victim to the never ceasing wave of surpluses of management would not recommend as a long term career move. otherwise decent schedule and mostly laid back sales position. management is key."
good,The company I worked for has been sold off and is no longer there (AT&T Wireless Jungle). But it was a decent stepping stone. Since it was an uthorized dealer the benefits were not close to a corporate AT&T
good,"es muy buen ambiente de trabajo dependiendo de la tienda que tengas no todas las tiendas son buenas , se aprende el convivió con tus compañeros , la empresa siempre tiene un problema con el cambio de puesto ya que si no eres amigo del jefe no puedes cambiar"
good,"I put a lot of efforts in performing various roles in AT&T; the hard work , intelligence and skills don't get recognized properly. very political place."
good,"good job to get you though school but not to really make a career. worked for them for 10 years and its was an ok experience. "
good,"regular day by day performance. when ask never received feed back "
good,Pay is great but the company needs to work on culture and cultivating talent. No focus on work/life balance or even just providing a positive working atmosphere.
good,You are just a number with AT&T and completely disposable. Management is a joke and the metrics system is horrible and inconsistent way to judge your employees.
good,I enjoyed the interactions with the customers I worked with as well as bringing them quality services. I enjoyed the ability to work on my own without excessive oversight. The work life balance was also another thing that I was not a fan of. The company was not open to people who had families and issues that come with family.
good,I was hired as a Sales Support Representative but the company got rid of my position so I was force into the sales roll or had to look for another job. The pay and benefits are really good but besides that the atmosphere is horrible.
good,Organizations vary in how they approach work and people.  Some support and promote others provide difficult working conditions.  Spent 21 years and predominantly 2 organizations.  The Marketing Org was a place that worked with people to find things they enjoyed and opportunities for advancement.  Finance organization offered neither.
good,"Due to the large workforce, you were only given a small portion of a project. I never felt challenged. Managers lacked training and promoted their friends and family, A typical day at work consisted of very basic analysis, generating data, and leading discussions, The most enjoyable part of the job were the discounts."
good,"Typical day of phone calls from customers unhappy about their bill.  My job was to explain the bill and sell them phones, services or tv/broadband.  A typical day my phone calls are recorded and i spend half an hour listening to them in the manager's office with the manager trying to improve my salesmanship behaviors.  Bonuses on commission.  "
good,This is the first job I had that required me to have my Bachelor's Degree. The training was very professional and not rushed like most companies. I had no prior knowledge before training and ended my career with ATT as a nesting coach.
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo, sueldo bajo, prestaciones de ley"
good,"Falta de oportunidades de crecimiento, ya que la gerencia no ayuda a definir tu carrera"
good,"AT&T was a GREAT company.  They call themselves AT&T but in fact its SBC (southern Bell Company) which is Texas based."
good,AT&T needs to improve on handling customer service complaints and develop a better call center structure. Customers should not have to be transferred to many different departments to resolve an issue.
good,"Lots of hours you have to put in to make a living. Enjoyed working with customers and handling their issues. The opportunity to advance to a higher position is a little slow, but hard work gets you there"
good,You do not get promotions based on skill. It is all who you know. They do not care about family and home life. They do have excellent training to make sure you have everything needed to hit the floor.  The hardest thing about job being single mother is that you gets points when you have to leave early. I had an abscess and it bust in my mouth at work. Had to go to ER and was penalized because of that.
good,"management is not and does not promote teamwork, or a fair work environment."
good,"Sales pressure is at a all time high, there isn't a time where a manager isn't breathing down your neck making do things that don't abide by their policy ""sales with integrity"". Compensation is increasingly diminished, hourly pay is decent."
good,"Se trabaja en buenas condiciones a excepcion cuando no se poseen los equipos necesarios, el pago quiza no sea el mejor"
good,"However, small towns they offer little help to sales and expect unrealistic goals. They are also very robotic in their customer service attempts.  Management are on more conference calls than managing employees."
good,"My job is very fun and busy at all times."
good,I en joyed talking with the many customers and being abdle to help them with their bills athe hardest part of the job was keeeping calm whren a customer would cuss you out
good,Management not great. The pay was really good if you didnt mind working 10-12 hour days. Not to mention flux in your weekly schedule. Great for young person looking for work.
good,"When I first started, it was the greatest place to work. Change is not bad, but upper management needs to buy in first. At the end of my time there it was horrible."
good,I would not recommend working for this company. The company does not offer a work/life balance for its employees. Working on days off/time off and during vacation time is normal here.
good,"Pretty good job, learned a lot about installation and serve repair of satellite tv and technology.... They provide you w the training, equipment & tools needed to perform the job duties. Will also allow you to go out of town to work and earn a perdeam but you also get to enjoy the travels and sigjts..."
good,"Pay is not bad, benefits are really good. Huge culture change at the company through the years. This used to be one of the best companies to work for. That is no longer the case.. Toxic work environment with no work/life balance and advancement is based on politics not based on your performance,"
good,Retail sales consultants are given ambitious targets and generous compensation upon attainment of said targets. Management is promised opportunity for advancement but if too much time is spent in a single position expect to be overlooked for promotion or even unofficially blocked from advancement. Non-unionized employees can be moved without the employees consent over 50 miles from their originating location with no compensation for extra travel.
good,un lugar donde puedes aprender muchas cosas lo malo es que no tienes muy buenas prestaciones y el ambiente de trabajo es de hipocresía. pero si puedes aprender cosas nuevas en el area de servicio y reparación.
good,To much uncertainty with all the network changes.  Time/Warner deal keep everyone on edge. Automation and outsourcing were a big problem at ATT. No job security to speak of in the last few years.
good,"The energy within the organization is non-exsistent. Countless team members are just counting the days until retirement. "
good,"customers called in to get help with their cell phone, The managers were never on the floor most of the time they were in meetings, the hardest part of the job was people cussing you out because their phone bill was wrong"
good,"the work was dangerous, and you were not compensated enough for what you needed to do. Also, the unionized environment was not conducive to having any sense of job security."
good,Being in a managerial role for 10+ years I have experienced many ups and downs with this company. The way the company now treats its employees is a real shame. I regretfully have to say that I would not recommend employment with this company to anyone.
good,Company compensates handsomely but forgets about the human side of it's employees. At&t focuses on micromanaging and putting fear in it's employees about being moved out of business.
good,I feel like i have to ability to have a life working here i am here all day long and i feel like i should be getting paid more for a job like this. My experience working here is that there is to much turnover and people come and go to much. You are constantly having issues with new people coming and not knowing what they are doing.
good,"AT&T is known Globally by the famous AT&T globe.  The more ATT grows and acquires, the more prices go up and layoffs and commissions go down.  I want to grow with the company and not get thrown underneath the bus.  Watch out for new services that are going to take Big Corps out of business slowly and painfully.  I am a level 3 Director with a company that is growing and its all for the Consumers and Sellers!  Check it out"
good,Meeting quota. Manager couldnt deal with complicated customers. Had to push more accessories or more services on clients. sometimes coworkers would steal sales.
good,Boring.  Disorganized warehouse database.  New product offerings were created and sold long before any thought was given to designing proper database storage.
good,"Working for AT&T in the 90's to early 2000's was delightful. Going to work every day was fun. When Cingular (SW Bell) bought the business, and then when AT&T LD bought Cingular, it was a slow decline in just about every aspect of the daily work life. Layoffs and scores of re-org's (honestly lost count after 6-7 re-orgs) made the work life balance unbearable after being with the company first indirectly then directly for two decades. When it came time for another re-org in 2012, I was given a choice to stay with the company or go. I chose to take the severance and start my own construction."
good,"okay, place to work if you like working in a big company.  too many layers, no growth opportunities.  Too political.  stable company with stable job security if you are too ambitious"
good,Alright company to work for very stressful for technicians. Average compensation for this type of work compared to other companies. Amount of work expected should have high pay
good,"The company acquires several companies big and small per year, so with that progression, the numbers game gets bigger and trickles down to customer service. You are sought to meet demanding goals. The benefits are great; however, you will work hard for them."
good,If you aren’t used to the dog eat dog world of corporate don’t work here. Many of the people I worked with told me the same thing. If you perform your best they overwork you and if you barely perform they lay you off.  They advised to just do enough to graze the middle.
good,worked with att for almost 2 years.  learned how to advance my knowledge on everyday technology we all use. Great interaction with most people in santa Monica City
good,"The work is very labor intensive and the metrics are extremely difficult to achieve. It takes a strong person with very thick skin to do this job. There is a union at AT&T and they do well to stand with workers rights. The pay is ok, but could be much better in regards to the level of training and safety required to do the work. There's no time clock you punch, and you never know what time you get off work. Any absences or tardies will put you on a path to termination."
good,This job environment has most likely changed dramatically since I've left.  This was before I got my education in network security.  AT&T still offers U-Verse.
good,"High stress to meet goals"
good,hard to get any help from management. shifts are based on seniority. over all stressful.like the people i work with. the hardest part of the job is telling people no on the phone.
good,AT & T does not reward top performers and nepotism is rife within the organization. Poor performers are often given plum assignments or cushy jobs because of their minority status .
good,"Too clicky for me.  If you knew a guy and he knew you, you had a spot.  Not what you know but who.  Project Lightspeed personell took all the promotions.  I actually worked for a manager promoted in over me who knew absolutely nothing about what we did in Wireless.  What a mess."
good,Wanted to get hired by these folks and liked the team I was on but managers made poor financial decisions and budget cuts meant contractors first to go.  Never felt secure in job here even though was promised i would be converted to full time permanent.  Was correct since i was laid off before this happened.
good,"Miserable.  Stayed for the vacation days offered,  that You can never take.  Very virtual.   Never met my supervisor in 10 years!!!   Compensation was minimal.   Tons of pto days,  but never allowed to use then. Hated every minute of it"
good,"AT&T is a typical sales job. There are several different quotas to hit that often change in weight, value, or rules. This can make hitting targets difficult. I appreciated the time spent training me, but overall it is easy to be lost in the shuffle at this organization."
good,"I worked for a third party for AT&T, not the actual AT&T company. I was hired as a call center agent but first day on the floor I was promoted to a floor support supervisor. I was told I'd receive pay increase and never did so I moved on to new employment elsewhere."
good,Great job if you have no family life. Also very stressful. I enjoyed the people I worked with. But being a single parent of a special needs child. I had no help and I couldn't work the required nigh shift hours.
good,"Excellent opportunity to learn new technologies. As a contractor, I was paid somewhat well but no permanent role available. Suggest company try to avoid keeping contractors forever."
good,I first worked for AT&T and it was a great place to work.  Plenty of advancement opportunities.  Converygs took over and it became a outsource center that had tremendous turnover.  Would not recommend
good,I feel that there are too many lay offs here other than that it is an ok place to work. The pay is good and the benefits are good. When there are lay offs they do try to find you another job and if they can't they will give you a severance pay.
good,"AT&T is a solid company that does not take value in its employees.  They are a cut throat company that does not care about the overall leadership but the bottom line, i would not recommend this company as it drives its employees into the ground with the amount of hours they have to work."
good,job has changed drastically in the last two years.  No amount of pay is worth the continued frustration of training yet another manager.  Promote people that actually know the job and good people will stay.
good,Their policy's were there to protect the consumer but not the employees no supervisors around when you need help and if there was an issue at home it counted against you as far as their attendance policy goes
good,I learned a lot through the company and I am grateful for the experience that I received. This was not the job for me even tho I feel like I put in enormous effort to grow the business.
good,"Politics drive career advancement, not skillset, aptitude, or demonstrated results.  Positive performance reviews result in very little benefit.  The better you perform, the more is expected of you, but recognition, pay, and career advancement don't result."
good,Overall it was an ok place to work. Too much pressure to make sales. After the baby I wanted a more part time position so that I could spend time with my children.
good,"High pressure on sales targets.........., quotas a moving target............ Some management caring.........., not sure of company direction.........."
good,"no job security, pay for managers is good, good benefit plans, union employees are not well respected or cared for as a whole.  Understanding and compassionate managers are few and far between"
good,"As a union company AT&T's management failed to reprimand those long term workers who would choose to sleep for 2-3 hours of the day, forcing the rest of us to do much more work."
good,"team huddle for daily goals , challenge limits , mangers come and go , hardest part about the job is trying to get to ur goals at the end of the month, so better stay on top."
good,Slow and too many levels of bureaucracy to get anything done at a technical level. Inadequate access to systems responsible for on a daily basis. Inadequate training or learning time.
good,At AT&T a typical work day is a very intense but engaging coding hours to fulfill business requirements. Management and company culture dont sync well with the development practices with the development team. As they follow water fall model.
good,The job that I had as a Network Manager was a wonderful position to develop technicians. However the culture of the work environment needs to be changed and higher management was not willing to do that.
good,"As with any typical Fortune 500 company, you can expect average pay and good benefits.  With such a large company, don't expect to make a difference without taking large risks."
good,"I was never allowed to use my skills that helped me to be successful with previous companies, I didn't receive positive encouragement from management and the employees gossip level and spreading rumors was out of control."
good,"It's a comission based sales job. Nothing wrong with that except you are put in neighborhoods that don't want DirecTv and you hear ""No"" a lot. Hard to make money that way. Manager is fine, people were fine, but it is not a career move."
good,"You have to work every single weekend. They have a point system, you get up to eight points before you loose your job.  Once you occur a point you have to wait an entire year to get the point taken off.  The atmosphere was very good until there was a change in management.  Interacting with the customers was a very good part of the job."
good,Hours were long during the day and there weren't any benefits to working long hours due to cuts in commission rates. The work put in didn't seem to benefit the employees.
good,Poor management and long hours. You deal with customers that have been waiting on service sometimes up to 13 days and are already angry because the company won’t hire help to cover large areas.
good,"- Cut Throat"
good,"After a 10 plus year career with the company, the leadership showed how much they valued loyalty and dedication, by advising that I would not be offered any options to rectify my under the industry average, salary. The leadership team was advised that the role was creating a financial burden on my household, as a result of childcare cost, which was needed for me to  travel internationally for the company, 2 weeks at a time; their response was that nothing could be done about my pay and that if I could not travel, my position would be backfilled. Unfortunately, there was a process available to address my salary, but my leadership chose to not utilize it. After a 90 day standoff, I was seperated; 30 days later,  all of my peers at the same level were surplused."
good,Hard to get the job done with so much paper work and restrictions. Every project is cut short do to funding or time constraints.  Never able to do the job correct the first time.
good,"Insurance is too expensive through my job, is a very stressful job,a lot of work and pay is low.Also some managers can be really rude.In my personal experience I can basically said that the amount of money you make vs paycheck was never equal."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, falta de interés por parte de los jefes en cuanto a necesidades e inquietudes de los empleados en cuanto al apoyo y pago de comisiones."
good,The job get really boring after a while. There is no chance of real advancement and it can be a waste if you don't find what to do next . It is all about sales and nothing to help customers.
good,"AT&T was a great place to work if you have no children, no school, and no personal life. They are more focused on having you there and working then about your family or personal life. No job security. AT&T is focusing on sending jobs overseas then keeping jobs in USA. The hours were consistently changing and no weekends off."
good,"after being with the company between times of a pay scale change, i got paid less for jobs and seen no benefits, no insurance, and no reimbursements we were promised. So basically we're getting paid like we're on W2 but we're still 1099."
good,"The pay is competitive, but this is offset but lifetime middle managers that are disengaged, or are simply too focus on keeping themselves in their role to help others or do their job correctly. The companies new focus on downsizing nationally means constant cuts at random even from high performing units."
good,"stressful and no choice of what hours you work.  No work / life balance.  work weekends and all times of day so cannot plan any real social events far in advance.  Only know your schedule 3 weeks in advance ."
good,No chance for advancement unless you kiss butt! Micromanage everything we do! They show favoritism towards the people that kiss butt! Always wanting to work people to death.
good,mgr suck they are just look for and at what you did wrong. wants you to do 12 of work in 8. send you for training and then not have you d the work for 6 months. then wonder why it took you a long time.
good,"No flexibility. No job security. After many years there, let go without a second thought.  I worked there 20+ years but AT&T  did not believe in sick time. You could take sick days but they counted against you."
good,"not a long term job, not much chance for advancement.  Positive and working outside and little management involvement at times, however at times management involvement can be overwhelming"
good,Part of a team of engineers that supported 3G/4G enode b integration services for the carrier markets and I enjoyed working with the team members and the support they gave to me as a team member.
good,The first month after i started with att they started doing lay offs throughout the entire country for field sales.  They did not effictivley manage their people
good,"This company has union techs. The company can force you to work no matter what your plans are for your days off. If your children get sick the company will not give you time off to take them to the doctors. You have to take them to an all hours clinic, take vacation, or have someone else take them. If you transfer to another state and try to go back to the original state, the union contract makes it almost impossible."
good,Depending on what classes I would be teaching.  The company is now focused more on how much money they can save versus the value of preparing retail employees to do the job the right way.
good,"Training is done 1st shift."
good,"great company to work for if you are looking for something stable but not too challenge, not the best payment but a lot of benefits."
good,"I have been working for the company for about 10 years, The employers got treated unfairly with their salary because it was a long term temp. job so nobody was hired on to the their company. After 10 years I moved further away from the job forcing myself to find another  job. I'm currently at Printegra, Ive been working there for a few months while trying to find another job, Its a Temp job and i'm looking for a job that hires directly on with great benefits."
good,Great place to work if you are ok with a tough sales environment with constantly changing pay structure.  Management is very one dimensional focusing only on numbers versus growth.
good,"Too stressful! Too Competitive! Unrealistic quotas! Work place Drama! And just no work life balance at all! "
good,Es una empresa totalmente innovadora por el giro de la misma y trae metodologías de trabajo diferentes a las de Mexico.
good,Things were constantly changing and the company wanted over 120 hours of training to be completed each year from about March of each year until October.  Working over 60 hours per week became very common.
good,"A typical day included requesting to change dnis's because of lack of sales from the calls and not getting it changed, I did learn many things though so I am very grateful for that. Increasing my typing and multi tasking skills as I was required to assist customers input data and trouble shoot if necessary at the same time(along with many other things). The management was relatable but non-motivational and sometimes not helpful, the culture was diverse so great but reminded me of high school, the hardest part of the job was staying out of a non complacent place since there was multiple discouraging things about the business, the most enjoyable part was conquering the metric goals along with my own."
good,"Wire Technician position pays well. If you have no problems with long work days, this is the job for you. Employees receives 50% discount on all services."
good,"pay sucks lots or work and no pay, you get lucky if your job is still there after jan 2018 don't bother go somewhere else...if pay was good I would stay"
good,"This was a very stressful sales environment for most, but for me it was very natural and easy. I learn and pick up quick, especially with sales. Once you get it, you got it!"
good,Nothing more to add. Anyone interested in working for AT&T should explore it as an option and form their own opinion of the culture / work environment.
good,"AT&T has numerous ares to move, however the management culture changes from place to place and you need to be lucky not to fall under management that views you as number only."
good,This is not the worst job I have ever had but it was very stressful and the management was not the best. Ive had over five managers in the last year i have worked.
good,"Woke up at 7am because you had to be at the first house by 8 and there is no set time you get home i always got home around 9 to 10 pm all the time, and would repeat 5-6 days a week. They say they will have you working close to home but i would work 50+ miles aways from home no matter how many time i requested to be relocated near my home area. After 90 days your pay will drop exponentially."
good,This was a very competitive and fast paced environment.  The good thing about that is that you work hard and play hard.  The technology was also lacking.  I expected more from a company like this.
good,"It’s a good job to gain work experience but don’t make a career out of it. They play favorites and managers are never looking out for your best interests, only their own."
good,"The People I worked with in this Company were exceptionally friendly and nice. "
good,"pay is decent, work/life balance is promised but never given, promises of development, promises made but never come thru, lots of hype, just to be pumped up and be let down."
good,"I have been with AT&T for 7 years now 2 offices, and I really enjoy working for the company itself. However, with any large company's come politics and when your center is the target of those politics, you want to vote all management off the island. My job is mentally/thought provoking challenging which I love! AT&T as a whole is a really awesome company to work for, nonetheless, each individual office is different and you learn to adapt to those differences. Would I change anything, yes I would have started working here sooner and I would definitely move around in the company as I have started to take advantage of as a  person that can accept change."
good,1099 contracting is not for everybody. I have met people who has done it for years and people who quit on first day. I liked contracting because in the field of wok I'm in i want to make as much money as I can for doing the same work i would get less than half to do for a company. Even paying for my own tools. To be a contractor for Directv you must be very independent being you cant just call a supervisor or ask another contractor to come help you complete what seem impossible jobs or big jobs.
good,"Days at AT&T were quite long and hourly rates for contractors were lower than most.  Work from home flexibility was not available to all workers, making for overnight calls in the office."
good,"always in training and learning new ways of growing the business. I worked in National Retail and Local dealers for 19 years. work life balance was a big challenge over the years , but it was just how the company ran the business."
good,"With all due respect I do have to say I work for a third party vendor for at&t, but I have had poor experiences, as well as the supervisors for the company. We question whether we'll be working there the next day with Florida as a right to work state, and we have had to try to pack a company that is supposed to get off the ground in 6 months into one month. Their best sales coach told people in training they need to produce or to just quit and leave. On top of this over 60 percent of the company has already left within 2 weeks supervisors included, and the rest are all talking about finding new jobs. Even for the original At&t company itself the system is not great, and there are so many different tabs. I do not recommend working here. The commission rates were made to look spectacular as well, but they paled in comparison."
good,"Knowing someone in the company is key to getting hired and knowing someone in upper management will get you promoted."
good,"Culture within AT&T is siloed to your org. Moving within AT&T is possible if you are listed as ""Hi-Po"" or in LDP. Otherwise, like what you get hired to do because you'll probably be doing for a long time."
good,"Even if you like people"
good,no work and personal life balance.    Didn't have good experience with work environment and management. Totally no for the opportunity. only good part is supportive collegue
good,"The AT&T I worked for before it became the giant conglomeration that it is now (AT&T, Cricket, DTV, Time Warner, etc.) was a great place to work.  Now it is very political, stressful and cut-throat.  It all about who you know not what you know and who you are ""buddies"" with.  If you don't play their ""games"" then they will ""surplus"" you which seems to happen about every 6 months the entire staff gets put on ""notice of surplus"" which creates way too much stress.  Then they want you to think of more creative and innovative ways to make things more automated just so they can ""surplus"" even more employees.  Not a good place to be other than the benefits.  The pay is not equivalent to the amount of work and stress they put you through."
good,I still have them for internet. But one thing I can say is that the uverse technicians are micro managed which really has proved ineffective and inefficient.
good,"A great place to work at with a lot of opportunity for learning focusing on planning, executing and troubleshooting telecomm technologies .  The management and coworkers are very helpful."
good,Typical day at work consist of up-selling customers and offering new products to customers. Trouble shooting devices and applying trainings to real life situations. Hardest part of the job is meeting goals and the most enjoyable part is turning an upset customer into a happy one.
good,Starting pay and discounts are wonderful. Job work/ life balance terrible. Advancement difficult. Management experience greatly depends on what manager you have. (mine is great)
good,AT&T makes 100 billion dollars per year in revenue.  That's more than most companies see EVER.  As a result they tend to gobble up smaller companies and treat them like the write offs they are.  This is neither right or wrong.  It's business.  If you don't have thick skin and realize what it is you'll be miserable.  If you want to play the game knowing the mentality you'll be very happy here.
good,Ratings are honest and the same as I have submitted in internal surveys when asked. It is not a good place to work as an hourly employee if you have a family.
good,at&t is one of the greediest companies i have worked for.  they make 100 million dollars in profit a business week and will not compensate their employees for their hard work.  At&t outsources good american jobs and pay whatever jobs are here minimum wage.  pathetic at&t.  they gave mark wahlburg a 1 million dollar contact for some commercials but won't approve a 4 dollar raise for employees. SHAME! SHAME! SHAME!
good,Not a good place to work if you have a personal life because they demand pretty much all of your time. The benefits are great and the pay could be better because of how physically demanding the job is.
good,"It was a good with great people, awesome benefits, energy, and perks then it went downhill. When I separated from the company it was way beyond time for us to part ways, the culture of the company changed drastically. Customer service is about servicing the customer with the greatest tool a company has its employees; a company does that by providing effective, productive, long-term resources, environment, culture, and management to its employees."
good,AT&T certainly has its perks and benefits but unfortunately the way the company is now structured the availability of advancement or non-parallel transfer is basically nonexistent. Work/Life balance can also be a major issue at times. Not a bad job if your looking for the decent pay for a while but I cant picture staying there for an entire career.
good,Worst job I ever had. Will never work for another call center ever again. Employees are not valued or respected. Turn over rate is very high. My training class of 28 new hires were all gone from the company within 3 years of our start date. They put out a new group of new hires every 4 - 6 weeks. Half are usually gone within the first 6 months. Definitely not a company you can plan to hang your hat and retire from in 20 or 30 years.
good,There was job security until ATT bought DTV. Now layoffs are the culture and everyone is always on edge and afraid of losing their jobs. They don't hide the fact that it's all about share holders profit marines and the employees don't come first.
good,Customer focused.  Learned about cellular phones and cable/tv/internet/home phone technology.  Lots of training in the beginning.  Not so much afterwards.  Just hands on experience.
good,"Not much to say, constant changes with the company (Sutherland) Low page. But overall not a bad place. A great way to start in a call center to gain some experience."
good,"Work for a world class company in a challenging, rewarding role where I can utilize my advanced analytical skills along with my wealth of knowledge in Workforce Analytics and Business Intelligence.  This position will offer the opportunity to use other key strengths, such as my project planning, organizing and implementation of best-in-class business strategies. "
good,This was not the greatest job the co workers were great but as for the management and the way they treated their employees was not the best. I understand that jobs are not always the happiest of places but you should be able to wake up and not feel like going to work is the worst part of your day.
good,"good and bad team leaders and supervisors, clean break room , dirty workstations, very crowded, high call volumes, not enough floor support, long story short make this your last result"
good,"They are basically looking to fire you. They create standards that are impossible to live by. They keep changing the standard. I worked there over 2yrs and the person that had the next closest seniority was 5yrs. They go through people like crazy !! Culture, environment and etc is horrible. Benefits, pay and etc are great."
good,"While ATT has some of the best benefits for their services, they miss work life balance.  50-60 hr work weeks and the pay doesn't keep up with those hours even though they receive record profits quarter after quarter."
good,"I started out in non-management, held several positions at AT&T, and was promoted to management.  I have worked as an Exec Asst to Vice President which I enjoyed that field very much, promoted to Human Resource specialist this was my favorite job.  I really liked helping people.  Finding the info they needed, explaining the rules and showing them where to go for help.  The hardest part of this job was having to lay people off, or having EEO issues.  "
good,The company was fun to work at and provided an environment to grow and learn.  The best part of the job were the people.  I made life long friendships and work relationships.
good,"A typical day would consist of high inbound calls you have to talk and type at the same time I think the job was daunting, and demeaning, I enjoyed my managers but the company works individuals to hard"
good,Very stressful work environment. Have to be on the phones constantly with heck to pay if you are not. They also awarded individuals who were extremely dishonest.
good,"Stressful, the biggest focus in management positions with this company is all driven by numbers.  Though this is a customer, and people type environment att hardly considers their own people"
good,"answered calls from irate customers"
good,a typical day is sitting at a desk taking phone calls for 8 hours and being told what to say and when to say it via computer. I have learned after 4 years it was not the place for someone who has a family. Management is always looking over your shoulder. the hardest part is trying to meet all the goals they ask of you.. the most enjoyable part of the job is going home at the end of your shift.
good,"I had the flexibility I needed and wanted during my time here.  It was at a price, job stability, compensation, etc.  I gained lifelong friends from this job and learned a lot while I was there."
good,Good benefits and strong lineup of products.  Company continues to grow and become a leader in entertainment.  Management is top notch and provide strong leadership.
good,"Management was not very helpful. Office environment was poor. Customer base was not very helpful. If I ever had an issue that needed dealing with, my direct managers were not willing to help."
good,"Great to build experience and skills right after college however it was very cut throat- especially since the Advertising Solutions brand was decreasing. "
good,I am filling up the space because I cannot continue without filling up this big blank box and I wish it would let me skip this entire section. Thank you
good,"AT&T authorized retailer can be a great opportunity if places in the correct position. I was placed in a store that forced me to work 6 days a week from the day I got hired. 9 months in I became very tired. In my time with the company I saw 4 sales rep quit which left me in a store alone with a manager that didn't care about my time, future, development, and pockets. While other employees thrived district placed me in a store with extremely low volume. No marketing strategy and no opportunity to move forward. Over all a bad experience to what could be a great experience with the company"
good,Way too much pressure on leadership with NO assistance from above.  Most ARSMs and above have no idea what it's like to actually run a box top to bottom. Unreal expectations
good,"Generally and overall good company, the smaller employees in the big picture don't get treated like a part of the team. Poor structure and lack of rigorous activity and stimulation."
good,"Working with my customers is the best! It makes my day when I can resolve an issue for others, making their day better. It's awesome to take puzzle pieces and put them together to complete the picture. I love the people I work with and the customers I work for. "
good,"I enjoy the people I work with, due to the similarity in likes and dislikes with the job. They can be pretty flexible with schedules, however attendance is a BIG thing. They expect a lot from their employees, and unfortunately don't spare enough time to actually train."
good,"Its good company  works with US customer for AT&T us Telecom, provides services to customer on I-phone security and sales."
good,it was a clean are on the building. They have a good sized patio to be able to enjoy the weather. as well as a shop inside to be able to purchase some snacks and food.
good,"The start of job was great. Great money and benefits. Lots over overtime. Co*workers were amazing. But after year. They changed commission. It lowered most salaries 40,000. It was shock to bills and commitments we had made to others. It was said, you can go or stay."
good,"Working for AT&T I thought was a career job, I was mistaken. If you like to be micro-managed this is the company for you. After 13 years I had enough. The company kept coming up with procedures that hindered production and just kept adding to the list and expected you to get done even sooner. Management did not listen to employees or value their input. I did make a good wage that I worked my tail off for. This job was a physically and mentally demanding position. The technicians could not know on a daily basis when their shift would end. 9-5 schedule  would usually be 9-8 respectfully.I enjoyed what I did and fixing problems, but meeting new people was the best."
good,"Amazing vision coupled with uncanny ability to engineer complicated unfriendly experiences gives me pause. Employees are ""lifers"" and avoid progress at all costs. Bloated organizations make it impossible to thrive."
good,"This company Sutherland Global, third party provider, does not have direction and changes its goals weekly."
good,"Although pay was good but learning wise it is mundane. "
good,"I sold these awesome products through Alorica, a call center here in Texas.  I really enjoyed the work. I got to speak with hundreds of people across the country and provide them with excellent service all while setting them up with great internet, tv, and phone. However, Alorica's policies are really not set up for our success. I watched many talented sales employees come and quickly go during the time I was there due to the lack of good management."
good,company was great before all of the mergers now it is so big you are just a number. In order to move up and possibly stay with the company you need to mobile
good,"Long hours, demanding work, low pay. However I worked back in 2008-2009, it's probably better now. Their training is comprehensive, they focus on safety. Loved their training facility in Dallas. Lots of hands on training in the field."
good,AT&T is a good career but doesn't support a worklife balance. They also give you your schedule for a month in advance so you have to plan your life around that.
good,"This company needs a tighter interview and hiring process."
good,"They fired me over an issue that never occured. Instead, they believed two persons who were being fired over the actual manager about what actually happened. They fired me, then fired the other two employees within a week. I actually won my unemployment case due to the fact that I was fired for no wrongdoing when it was investigated"
good,"This is a good company to work for, I put in long work days with many meetings daily. It was hard to run your team when you are in meetings all day and every day. I enjoyed the team and people I worked with daily."
good,"if you have  vacation tie and hours available you can leave work early same day or day or next day with pay, and  it  does not affect  you."
good,Management constantly changing which groups you'll support with little to no advance notice.  Absolutely no room to advance unless you are willing to take a cut in pay.
good,"Management is hard on employees, but most want to see them succeed, some just want you to put your life on hold, just to fill their pockets... At the right location, AT&T could be an awesome place to work."
good,"Coordinate between multiple departments including sales and service. Provide best in class customer service via inbound calls. Partner with management, IT Staff, and executives to provide documentation and client deliverable quotes."
good,"Profit driven at the expense of the worker. This place was not, and is not, worth working for in its present configuration. With an unprofessional management team concerned with rate of return and numbers, than quality service."
good,I promoted from a technician position to management. I enjoy working with my technicians to promote their individual knowledge and business success!
good,"Been working for ATT 10+ years. It's good and overall, but they sometimes suspend you for no reason. The benefits are alright. I am not sure if it's more of a long term job for people who can't handle the pressure and demands."
good,"I have worked in a couple of AT&T Centers and they are all the same, too much drama, no growth opportunity, most of the management team are not professional when it comes to work. The pay is fair, but there's a lot that could be better in this type of business."
good,Over the years I had the privilege to get to know and work with some wonderful people.  I also had the opportunity to learn and become a certified Six Sigma Green belt.
good,On your feet all day which makes brain and body tired at the end of the day. Happ when you make quota because it means you keep your job
good,Not loyal to employees at all. Very corporate and you are just number to them. Huge company who only cares about the bottom line
good,"The pay was fine and it certainly lined up with the work that was required. However there was a huge culture of ""catch not coach"". Every conversation even in passing ended with yet another reminder of termination. Always felt like I was staring down the barrel of a gun."
good,"Learned a lot about the wireless industry"
good,"AT&T has offered me many opportunities for advancement, personal growth, and advancement.  However, the culture has changed and I am currently looking for a better fit."
good,I worked for a subcontractor called MASTEC. You need your own tools and you get paid by pice work. There is always obstacles that are preventing you from getting to the next site.
good,"Management is aweful, pay is lovely, dont expect to keep friends or get any sleep. no one cares if you live or die on the job here. (adding extra because i have to)"
good,"I am not directly employed for ATT although i would love to be its the place that has the Att account thats the problem. Very unprofessional and just a hard time enjoying coming to a place and enjoying the business and providing all that is needed for Att customers to enjoy their service and their info Poor training and the place is not clean and there are rats, bats and spiders i was bit by a spider there due to teir negeligence and was out of work for a year horrible but Att is worth working for just dont go for a third party company"
good,"with all the new changes it is very hard to find where you fit in with this company, poor management, poor team leads, little help given as well as little training."
good,Att claims that they are all about emplyees and family but that is a bunch of bull.  Att does not care about anything but its bottom line.
good,Great place to work from a benefits perspective. pay could be more competitive but overall not bad. work life balance was good depending on the position you worked in. i enjoyed the flexibility of the schedule
good,"a typical day at work consists of building a habit to check your current percentage of rev."
good,Most enjoyable part is working with the people in my department. llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll.
good,A typical day at work is do what your told no matter how ridiculous the request or be punished. Management doesn't care about your well being just numbers you chalk down on the board
good,"Trabajo dinamico, "
good,"In 1989, AT&T was a good entry level employer who educated their employees.  They had good methods and procedures.  The provided their employees with the tools to get the job completed."
good,learning new things every day and sometimes not enough hours in the day to train or complete training. products always changing and company shifts focus too much throughout the year and lowering commission payouts.
good,"The culture, the compensation, and the leadership team used to be outstanding.  I really enjoyed working at AT&T for 8 years in various departments."
good,"I learned quite a bit in a short period of time, mostly on my own. I was told many things that were not true from supervisors. Leadership is only interested on your stats so they can try and hit their bonuses. No praise from supervisors, only interested in volume of work you do. It is a customer service job, focus should be on the customer, not the sup's bonus."
good,"I'm sure the culture has changed since my time there."
good,"Over the past 9 years what I have learned is that the responsibilities keep growing with no compensation gain. The benefits are getting to be less and less over the years. The union is weak and is working with the company. The ""core"" technicians make 100k a year no problem, prem techs make 55k with same responsibilities and working conditions. No availability to move up, this company is still on the good ole boy network. I have achieved more education than my entire first level management team and have no available positions to apply for. Due to merger acquisition the company is more focused on getting rid of duplicate titles and downsizing. The best part of the job is the freedom of not having someone breathing down your neck all day. The worst part is the way you get treated by the company and management team."
good,Mobility sales and service is a stable job because at&t is a very large company and cell phone services are one of their main segments.  There are plenty of jobs in this side of their business but it is just not a very inspiring position and commissions are always dwindling.
good,this was a great company to wok for /telecommute was not to fun I like to work around people. I enjoyed helping customers with issues and concern. I started as a customer service rep ad then was promoted to a Top performer (lead Customer Service Representative
good,It would have been a better workplace if the managers would manage more. It didn't feel as if they truly valued each employee or cared about the betterment of them.
good,Lack of compensation and work life balance makes it tough to defend the work in which AT&T will ask for. There is little to no training on every aspect and the requirements to do more than your title demands is very high.
good,"most enjoyable part of the job i would say is when we do actually get paid our commission, management is challenging. typical day would be coming to working putting on your headset and dealing with much of the same problem continuously with customers"
good,"Great benefits, not a lot of time for anything else but hitting your numbers.Some really great people work here, and the compensation can be great, however they are constantly decreasing commission."
good,"Other than the pay, there's not much about the job that I actually like.  The company pushes the concept of ""safety"" and attempts to give the impression that the employee is their number one concern, but anyone with an ounce of common sense can see right past their phoniness.  They're not concerned about the safety of the employees, they're concerned about the money they'd have to pay out if an employee happens to suffer an on-the-job injury, which is why if an employee is injured on the job due to circumstances completely and legitimately out of his/her control, that employee will still more than likely be suspended.  Their number one, and only concern is efficiency.  This job is especially burdensome to those who have any kind of a life outside of work.  Scheduling is not at all flexible.  The overall relationship between the employees and management sucks.  I regret quitting my previous job to accept this one."
good,A typical day at AT&T was all about the sales! Monthly goals were set and expected to be met. Working here taught me that a smile and a little southern charm can get you further than you'd think. The thing I enjoyed most about this work experience was being able to train on and see new devices before the typical consumer was allowed to view them.
good,was a good place to work and grow workdays are long and structured. Numbers driven not much else is looked at.Not a good work life balance always on call.
good,"Too many contractors, and the culture is affected by it and everyone knows that it is apparent. Just procured Directv, and I am a Directv legacy employee."
good,"There is an opening and a closing shift. There are demo devices that you set up in the morning and take down at night along with an inventory count and a cash count; also, you clean the booth by dusting, sweeping, and taking the trash out. After that you warmly greet customers and take care of their need while educate them on different ways they can maximize their service."
good,"I would get my dispatch orders and go, I worked alone so that was good. the hardest thing to deal with at AT&T is the management. I did love the work though and the money was great."
good,"Typical days were non-stop full of conference calls, anywhere from a minimum of 2 to 5 lasting anywhere from 45-90 min. Very challenging to accomplish amount of assigned work when required company courses must be completed, mandatory conference calls for projects, daily team calls, etc would often interfere with daily work, but overtime was not granted even when requested, but overtime was not allowed if not granted either. "
good,Not ideal if you like your weekends free. Positive training environment. Very safe place to work. Must love dealing with VERY DIFFICULT people.
good,The culture has changed drastically over the last couple of years and there is much unnecessary pressure to perform. I would not recommend it at a good place to work any longer
good,"Difficult to advance with unrealistic sales goals. Their management style is lacking in enthusiasm and motivation, most managers would rather shout orders from the rear rather than lead from the front."
good,"SBC had great benefits, but there was price to be paid for those benefits. You would have to write on a computer screen when you went to the restroom and if you were gone longer than that thought you should be, they would come after you. Your family suffered as well, because, very seldom where you given time off for family events that were held on the weekdays between 8-5, examples: kids school play, or their graduation from 6th or 9th grade, and funerals. "
good,"Go from house to house (business to business) setting up Internet and phone service."
good,AT & T is just big player in the market due to its telecom market but not a good employer in giving benefits or treating employees.
good,fast paced work environment with great opportunity for money just not a secure job and changes are made every second of the day. management not very supportive and checks are always short
good,The hours are very long and it is not great for a family life. The salary is decent but cuts are made year after year with the commission package.
good,Att is very difficult company to work for if you cannot change like the weather.  The pay is good but with the stress of the job this is why the pay is good.  Lately ATT has been reducing their pay and making targets harder to hit so the pay decreases with each target you fail to hit. ATT is not for everyone and if you fail to meet 100% of the sales objective 3 months within a 12 month period then you will not have a job much longer at ATT.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people that you work with.  You have to have some kind of fun while at work and you will make friendships that will last a lifetime.
good,AT&T is a great company with excellent products & services. The work culture is terrible offering no job security. The company continues to reduce headcount and but the workload only increases. Most people are exhausted and looking outside the company for better positions & a better work environment.
good,"Great I have been working with AT&T for over seven years, AT&T is not very family oriented, after seven years with the company due to my role with AT&T people who have been with AT&T have a better work schedule because they are in sales as I am not."
good,"High pressure to ""make the numbers"" with little recognition for success."
good,"A few things I learned at my job with BellSouth is the wire color code, types of wire and wiring procedures. I learned to listen to the customer carefully and communicate the best way to render service. I would say I work well with others and assisted co-workers on numerous installs. The most challenging was the physical aspect of the job; climbing, crawling, moving, etc. I really enjoyed doing a great job and the appreciation I received from the customer."
good,Not really loyal to those who have given them a lot of years to them.. disappointing. spoke with commercial customer's wanting to leave directv or with escalated concerns. Saved the company hundreds of thousands of dollars by retaining customers..
good,"Working at AT&T required taking incoming calls 100% of the day.  During my 23 years of working for AT&T, I have acquired strong customer service skills and always handle customers efficiently and rapidly resolving any conflicts.  Management was very unprofessional in the last few years that I was with the company.  The co-workers were very helpful throughout the office.  The hardest part of the customer service job at AT&T was the sales quotes required."
good,"Money is great but thats about it, don't expect your day off to actually be a day off. it never happens. no time for family, The expectations they give are constantly changing from hour to hour and management isn't held accountable for anything they say or do."
good,"Operations Management needs a complete overall.  Employee turn around rate was through the roof. All this department cares about is sales, sales, sales regardless if it impacts the employees personal home life, mental well being and the like.  Ma Bell is no longer present. It's sad. really it is..."
good,"Typical day starts out by getting your route and making your pre-arrival calls.  Then you want to make sure that you have all of the equipment and small parts needed for all of your upgrades and new installs for the day.   "
good,"Days are filled with multi tasking and micromanagement.  Most employees are told"" if you don't like it here, McDonald''s is hiring""."
good,"your direct manager has complete control on whether you will enjoy your job or not."
good,"Very fast paced, call center environment and heavy sales floor type of atmosphere. Typical day consists of heavy call volume from customers regarding billing, new service, change of service.  Heavy bill and account analysis."
good,"Ensuring that team on the job site were in position to conduct the project presented; while trenching, avoiding to hit any water pipes, gas lines, or power lines that would lead to injury. Team and I needed to be aware and prepared of any kind of forecast."
good,"It's a very slow paced environment, well at the Schertz location is. A typical day at work is very enjoyable. All the employees are easy and fun to work with. It can get stressful at times. Meeting number deadlines and what not. Overall AT&T is a good company to work for."
good,I was a fun opportunity but I had a bad experience with management because I was doing sales. Management was very sly with explaining the installations so I moved on with my career.
good,"Take calls from customers, help manage customers accounts and services."
good,I've worked in several call centers definitely not my favorite but I suppose it could have been worse. Nice perk of free tv though.
good,It was a pretty good job assisting customers with issues on devices but it then became more stressful due to staffing and working conditions.  Not allowed to leave our desk for a drink of water and vending machines being removed from the building.  Faucets didn't work and couldn't use the restroom without getting in trouble.  It became a sweatshop.
good,"1: educate and helped fix  tec issues with a different education levels of customers "
good,"Lots of changes in job responsibilities and procedures based on frequent changes in upper management.  Lots of talk of work/life balance and using earned vacation time, but really doesn't pan out if you want to stay employed."
good,"Drove personal vehicle 30 miles to office to pick up COV. Did routine work such as repair/installs."
good,"Based of commision and sales"
good,"For new employees the turnover rate at at&t is ridiculous. Out of all the twenty-something people I first trained with I was the only one remaining. The job pays extremely well but the management are absolutely terrible. The company does not hold them accountable for any of their behaviors but rest assured that if you so much as breathe wrong they will be up yours so fast your head will spin. If you can handle very high sales targets, managers breathing down your neck every single day, an awful work life balance and favoritism and biased working conditions in order to make more than the average person with no degree then this is the place for you. If not, I suggest you save yourself the stress."
good,"Directv was an amazing place to work when I began over 10 years ago. As the compensation increased the customer focus decreased. Once upon a time, we were actually allowed to focus on the customer with passion, and take the time to ensure that we were taking care of the customer and providing outstanding customer service. After 10 years, the culture became, ask about the issues and bonus' was dependant of whether you were able to sell the customer something. Transitioning to a sales environment cause the customer service to go out the window, and caused everyone to focus on money."
good,"I'm sure that AT&T across the nation has great locations to work at. The company as a whole is a great to work for. The one I work at however, is ran in a untrained, inexperienced and completely unprofessional manner. The HR for this center is a joke. I do not know how this Fortune 500 company let's one of it's call centers to be ran in this fashion."
good,"Lack of strong management team."
good,nuff said  good job if you are a single person and want a great paycheck and benefits and don't take the ridiculous metrics system serious.
good,"Cable splicing was amazing with AT&T, set hours that were perfect. When they moved me to Premise Technician it was the worst day of my life. Took a huge pay cut ($9.00/hr.) and was required to work extremely bad hours without double time when overtime was met."
good,"The office was located in San Francisco. Each manager was assigned approximately 10 to 15 cases per day.  Each manager was required to handle each case from beginning to end, which involved several departments and technicians. The most difficult part of the job was not being able to close the cases within an 8 hour shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was after all the hard work being able to change the customer's feelings towards the corporation."
good,"I did an excellent job during a very stressful campaign and was tossed out like garbage the day the negotiations ended."
good,"Typical day, you help customers with purchasing a phone, try to cross sell home solutions, Strategic, Accessories products such as: Digital life, Home phones, DirecTV, tablets. ect."
good,"In a typical day at work you are criticized repeatedly no matter how hard you apply yourself or how great your scores.  You are forced to use a number of obsolete and antiquated computer programs and told to try and provide the customer with an efficient level of service. Managers are lazy and they are not held accountable.  My direct supervisor sits at his station and plays candy crush on his phone all day, and gets angry when you ask him for help.  It's ridiculously frustrating."
good,I worked for directv for 2 years and the job became to stressful working full-time hours there and being a full-time student. The metrics were annoying because every week directv is changing something up and reducing the pay on the incentives but I believe its due to the recent merger with AT&T. The benefits and the reasonable pay for a college student is all I miss about the place.
good,Competitive salary and benefits. Great company with many attendance options and vacation time. Service provider and company products also a plus!
good,working for this company is something that can't be done over a long period of time. its hard to advance within the company or maintain a life outside of work. the employee tends to last only 1 year.
good,standing on your feet every day asking customers to get direct tv could be a awesome company but management sucks I really believe this manger wont be there long due to the scheme
good,"High pressure to perform"
good,"In an AT&T's call center culture one must forage through multiple tasking in databases, oral communication and product knowledge. This constant changing, diverse field of telecommunications brings an extreme competitive culture that challenges even the brightest and adept individual.  Attention to schedule, time on calls and sales is the most challenging balance.  The hardest part is applying sales and customer satisfaction goals in unrealistic allotted time frame.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the team environment, learning new systems, and cutting edge products while receiving quality compensation and benefits."
good,"Anwsered calls for customers deciding to deactivate their premiums,Learned alot about television."
good,"I woke up each day and checked my route by logging on to a technician site then checked what each job was getting and checked my truck to make sure i had all of the equipment i needed for the day. If i didn't have the equipment for the day then i would leave about an hour early to stop by the warehouse to load my truck with the items i would need for the day then i was off to work. every job was different, every location, person, etc... was different and very exciting because of meeting all the new people and seeing all of the different locations around your local area."
good,"Lets get this straight, its a retail sales job.  What more is there to say? The compensation is great but when you get down to it that's the only thing that worth it in this job.  You can advance very fast but when your constantly sacrificing all of your morels to get ahead its not worth it to me.  Work life balance is non existent unless you know the right palms to grease and forget about getting off on time because 100% of the time you have to stay late.  Your not able to plan anything in advance because most of management is unwilling to let you do anything to get extra time off.  When you sign up with this company you automatically give it everything you got and then after a while they just take and take and take.  Customers hold all the cards in this industry and no matter how hard you try to help you are fighting a losing battle between them and the management.  I have worked with a lot of great people over the past 5 years but they have all been burned out by upper management.  I personally care about the customer from start to finish and only want the best interactions everyday."
good,"I learned a lot working here.  It was my first job out of college.  It was great, but stressful.  I think all call centers could be a little stressful.  Overall, I am thankful for my first real job and life experience."
good,"A typical day at work for me is first arriving on time at 5:00 Monday through Friday. I make sure that everything I need is set up before I start taking phone calls to give the customer the best possible experience. I learned how to sale under pressure. Not knowing if you're job is secure or not makes you try harder. That type of pressure led me to being the number 1 sales agent on the floor. It's a lot of pressure and can be stressful, but I'll still flourish. The management makes sure that you come to work everyday on time and makes sure that company procedures are followed. They're not as professional as they should be dealing with their employees, but I guess the work environment is so competitive, it;s stressful to them as well. My co-workers are very good at their jobs. Even though we're  in competition we always help each other. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who just refuse to accept the information you're giving them. No matter how informative and courteous you may be. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing I did my best and I made someone happy with my services."
good,Very big Company depending on the culture you could become just a number.  An not considered to be valuable even when you are exceeding sales goals.  Company is loosing touch with the customer and sometimes not building value and appreciated the customer for helping them grow to be so successful.
good,"Great company, however the commission structure continues to change and good employees are continually asked to do more while being paid less."
good,"There is almost little to no upward movement within the organization."
good,"Overall, the Huntsville site is ok. There are not a lot of opportunities for growth unless you are willing to move to another DIRECTV O&O site.The pay is fairly competitive and it environment overall is very relaxed."
good,"This hotel is in a very small town in KY, people here are not used to diversity in any way."
good,This job does not have a lot of opportunity to make a lot of commission.
good,"I used to get paid a lot better at a different wireless carrier, I dont mind the pressure and goals, this is retail but pay me decent, you ask me to sell a bunch of products and at the end of the month I bring 1,200 dollars commission check, not enough to pay for all the bills.  Good benefits like any big company, some managers blow, some are cool."
good,"I enjoyed the setting however, there was no promotions to look forward to."
good,With being noe of the 1st installer's when Uverse rolled out. We made good money- has time goes on your jsut a Number to ATT and not a human. Robots should apply here. Mangament is terrible.
good,"As long as you are not in the DMG group in NYC  you stand a decent chance, otherwise the culture and treatment from senior staff is very poor."
good,As a premise technician it is almost impossible to get another job within the company. Terrible management.
good,"Job not very secure for premises in most area. Management isnt very supportive, union isnt very strong in certain areas."
good,I would like to stay however there is no future for advancement after 7 years.
good,"Worked in a high call environment taking incoming calls so lots of phone work so communication was ideal. Data entry, computer and technical support skills also required."
good,There are a lot of clicks there. The pay is great but personally not enough training provided to new hires.
good,"Lots of late hours if people come in at the last minute. Pay is good if you are willing to do the job that is required. Too many people aiming for the same position, advancing is not too easy. Management and culture of the store I was in definitely had room for improvement."
good,"Although the pay is good, this is a horrible play to work for. They rule by fear and do not see their employers as people"
good,Continual change in performance metrics creates confusion in expectations.
good,A typical day of work consisted of welcoming potential candidates and proctoring a pre-hire assessment.
good,"Much pressure in all of IT to do more with less.  Although they did give ample hints for months before-hand about trimming the staff (by 1500 in all).  However, work-life is good in some IT dept's."
good,Responsibilities:  Meeting and exceeding sales quotas.  Inventory.  Cash Control.  Staff supervision.  Customer Service.  Customer account maintenance.  Training and motivation of associates. I received several sales and service awards during my employment with this company.
good,"one of my least favorite jobs"
good,"A typical day was very busy."
good,Great company with excellent benefits however the work life balance is horrible.
good,"A typical day would consist of answering calls from AT&T customers around the US. I learned that you have to genuinely like talking all day to be comfortable in this job. Management was not up to par. I rarely received assistance from floor supervisors when needed. Co-workers were very loud and filled with drama. Callers could hear other workers chattering in background. Hardest part of the job would be trying to find the correct matrix to use to resolve customer concerns. If the correct matrix was not used, you failed your call. Even if you resolved the problem. The most enjoyable part would be that you get unlimited overtime. Make sure you say every word in the Matrix use lose points off calling score."
good,Typical day at work is busy with no time to think of anything else. Talking is the hardest part of the job.
good,"Beyond good pay and benefits, I cannot recommend working at DIRECTV."
good,"This job entails answering calls from customers who are angry about their ridiculous TV bill.  Spending hour after hour getting yelled at over the phone is bad enough.  But we were promised free service after 30 days which was not offered to us for and extra 10.  The installer made such a horrifying mess with wires and drilled holes that our management forced him to remove it all within 20 minutes of completion. "
good,"Excellent co-workers and team commitment. Never a boring day, always something new to learn. Amazing continuous learning and opportunities to learn new technologies and technology resources."
good,Call Center work...if you must work at a call center getting yelled at by customers all day it might as well be At&t they pay well thanks to the Union
good,A typical day at work consist of processing orders and interacting with external and internal customers.  Management is reluntant to training.  The hardest part of the job is to maintain order quantity/quality quota while attending meetings daily.
good,Install satelite cable on homes and business.  the hardesr part of the job is fixing a job that was done incorrect.
good,Answering calls from inter company departments to resolve issues to complete work orders in a timely manner.
good,I am working on a Data Analytics project and it is affording me the opportunity to broaden my skill set.  Not a bad place to work.
good,ok place to work. Lots of driving and late nights. Comp pay that doesn't make for a good place if you have a big family
good,"good pay , fast paced, very little work/life balance, this particular location Portage Mi has an absolutely terrible manager, be prepared to have very little flexibility. The manager Terry Thompson over steps his boundaries and favors particular associates, he may make inappropriate comments to make you feel terribly uncomfortable then act oblivious if you bring it up. He is lazy and if he doesn't do his job somehow it will become your fault. I worked there for 5 years prior to his arrival once Terry came he made my life along with my co workers lives miserable he talks about you behind your back and your ""confidential"" information will not remain confidential (personal issues, health issues, home issues) so if you want to work for this company DONT work at this location the Kalamazoo location is excellent if you like to stay busy and can sacrifice personal time, it's easier if you don't have any children."
good,"It's a good job just very strict, the training is a long process that doesn't really help during the actual working process. It's a union job so you start off at the bottom and stay your way up which means a 2nd/ late shift and weekends for a long time."
good,"very high tech and high pressure"
good,"Contracting is tough there are charge backs and you are on your own to acquire business."
good,"Management was strict, but necessary skills were learned at the position in regards to communications and sales experience."
good,"Manager in this organization do not often respect individual differences. There need for Management to take training courses in how to work well with others is GREATLY in need. Diversity for AT&T is something just for the pictures not for the work environment. "
good,Pay was good job sucked. Definitely need an improvement on management and the process of advancement.
good,"Never bored, learned a great deal, up to date technology, great team work, good people."
good,"Intense finance and excel work. Managed PRT tracker, collaborated with Finance Directors."
good,The retail environment was always changing. Customers often were irate.
good,Work hard for a small paycheck. I wish there more opportunities to advance without moving cities
good,"management was terrible, you would get written up for any reason, pay was good, hours you got alot but never knew what time you would get off, coworkers were great , customers were godd for the most part."
good,Enjoyed moving from place to place it was a great experience in which I learned a lot of great things and meeting different types of people
good,"A typical day at work includes handling various customers concerns or inquiries ranging from billing questions,general questions about products and services to equipment troubleshooting. I learned a   lot from AT&T for example how to adapt to change at a moments notice, putting  customer first besides any distraction that may occur, how to truly be your best self, and finally how to push yourself beyond what you think is your best. If i could improve anything about the company i would improve the company on their consistency with customers and their relationships with employee, the fact that you change managers every three months is also a disadvantage as well. The hardest [art of the job is the companys' inconsistency and the most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers."
good,"-Great job to work for, nice bonus for exceeding you target"
good,"Through training it seemed like a great job, then when we got out everything was different. I was told that if i didn't make my numbers within 90 days I would be let go. Other than the pressure and micro managing it was a great job. You are on your own most the time and you learn a lot of skill not only with the technology, also with thinking on your feet when you need to most."
good,None.  It's better to say nothing than something not very nice.
good,Meet sales quotas in a very fast pace sales environment. Present a high level of customer service. Tech support for all mobile devices. Being able to multitask in a fast pace environment. Poor management and company doesn't care about employees.
good,"A typical day a work would be taking inbound calls from customers regarding their bill or services they have with directv all day. The beginning of the day would start off with a team huddle where everyone would discuss the calls from the previous day or week. For example what calls that may have been difficult and how we got through them. We would periodically get phone statistics throughout the day showing our average handle time, how long we've taken in between calls and how many calls we have taken thus far. Once a week we met with our supervisor to discuss goals from the previous week and if we have accomplished them. We would set new goals and what steps we would take to achieve those. The most enjoyable part of the job was being with my teammates and learning from them. I love learning new things so when there is a new task or development it would excite me."
good,"to far of a drive and  had to use own truck. had to hope for enough jobs , and always short on equipment ,but  they had  great benefits and  great people,  hardest part of the job was to make the next appoint on time.  best part of the job was meeting new and sometimes exciting people most enjoyable part was working on your own."
good,"This was a Human resource/ Admin position"
good,"One of the best parts of my job was being able to speak to my customers everyday.  I truely enjoyed helping them understand their bills.  A typical day would be for me to go over the customers bill and explain to them what was wrong with their bill and then after I handle the initial request, I move into sales and find out what products the customer has in their home."
good,management made the job bad but actual job was good. job security was always on the line because of strict requirements the hardest part of the job was dealing with management and job is always busy
good,"Solve billing issues, remotely repair HSI and Telephony services, great co-workers."
good,call center tech rep for at&t when it was a cable company was not that great. they didnt treat there employees very fairly and supervisers where not very helpful at all. I continued to work there until I could find another job I missed two days due to a car accident and due to me missing two days from a car accident even with a note from a dr they laid me off. this to was unfair and did not show very good management. they have since relocated and are now under new management comcast.
good,"The company itself requires too much out of an employee. At my specific center, we had mandatory overtime, often not told to us until the night before, as well as a ridiculous attendance policy. Many employees came in to work very sick because the company didn't have sick days for us to take. The pay was decent, but it's not worth the stress and lack of flexibility AT&T has."
good,multi tasking was a large part of the job. There was a lot of required overtime.
good,The vendors that AT&T hire does not provide what is needed for productive technicians.
good,"un dia tipico en el trabajo era salir con mis compañeros a buscar nuevos clientes, donde se aprende la solidaridad y el comprimiso con uno mismo y con los demas."
good,"Install IPTV/VoIP systems.  Rearrange Inside house/business wiring, network interface devices, install or repair customers equipment, verify network services are operational;  educate customers on features and functionality of services."
good,There is always high pressure to perform and meet sales quotas and great people to work with. The managent above the store manager level is less than desirable and always changing which is the hardest part of the job. The compensation and benefits are competative.
good,"It was my experience during a short contracted tenure with DirecTV that many of the challenges of employee morale were due to management's inability to manage beyond the things that were directly in front of them;  i.e. workers, including me, were told it was a family friendly environment but it was the furthest from it.  80 - 100 weeks were the norm.  It became clear to me quickly that management refused to take a longer-term view, meaning when models or processes were improved and efficiencies were available for them, they got spooked many times, and resorted back to processes that were error-filled, redundant, and frankly, not valuable for anyone.  I'm convinced that if much of the low-hanging fruit, meaning improvements available to them right now, were allowed to take hold, those 80 - 100 hour weeks would be cut in half..not even including the more robust improvements that were obviously needing made.  The workers are not happy in the least, they are undervalued from an appreciation standpoint, and there is a layer of ""management"" in the middle (I use that term in quotes because frankly, many of them I suspect are hold-overs from previous acquisitions and are not qualified to be considered management.) that is spooked and paranoid enough about their own existence that they stick to antiquated and dangerously error-prone and inefficient ways of work--only problem is that the analysts and lower-level managers are the ones to pay the price via investment-bankeresque hours for work that really should be basic operations and finance."
good,"Gets the bills paid. Wants employees to sell too much. •a typical day at work"
good,"you could work 9-14 hours a day, learn to deal with people, had travel 100+ miles a day talking to some of the people."
good,"Working heree has been and experience "
good,Ok place to work the only way to move up is to be buddy buddy with someone...not based on ability
good,Ok company but virtually no job stability and too many employees
good,Senior Mgnt is disconnected from day-to-day operations.  Middle managers are left to do all the work.
good,"Same as before"
good,"Stressful environment at a fast pace. "
good,"If you really don't care about the quality of your work and can also tollerate a seemingly endless level of oversight and review, then working at AT&T Learning Services may be a great place to work. "
good,"A typical day at work begins with addressing all the customer's technological needs pertaining to their telecommunications services with AT&T. I learned how to perform a variety of tasks including but not limited to, exchanging SIM Cards, selling all AT&T products in order to meet district quotas."
good,"great compnay ..... great great great great , hard work pay is great"
good,"Had to on time one minute late was wrote up, no matter the circumtances. I learned to be a team leader. Some good some bad. All where very supportive, great people to work with. There really wasn't one. The most enjoyable time was inacting with co-workers, and helping others."
good,This was a some call center and it was really based on sales and commission. The managment was a mess never got the big bouns check every month cause the managment never turn in the correct paper work.
good,"Things can get a bit hectic at work. It is a call center and my current role is production floor assistant. This specific role has taught me how to manage staffing as well as reporting. I also communicate quite often with management, coworkers and AT&T Clients to ensure we are meeting the required metrics and are as productive as possible as a vendor site. The most challenging part of this position is adjusting to the different personalities that I encounter on a daily basis as it is also the most enjoyable aspect of the job."
good,"Lack of a concrete schedule makes a life outside of work very difficult. Push goals always force you to work over 50 hours a week. compensation is more than adequate, which allowed me to save up enough to go to school and live while I took a leave."
good,When it comes to money its definitely worth it but it takes up too much of your life and doesn't offer a lot in return.
good,Management is not clear when hiring as to exactly what the job will be like. Very stressful environment.
good,AT&T isn't a great place to work anymore. For management employees the health insurance and benefits have been changed to a high deductible plan. If you use monthly maintenance medications or have an unexpected surgery or long term treatment be prepared to pay ALOT of money upfront to cover your deductible before the company insurance kicks in payment. I do mean ALOT of cash upfront.
good,"The manament was not the best for a big company like theirs.A typical workday would be mandatory 12hours a day.The hardest part of the job was sitting down for five to six striaght hours at a time.The co-worker are great, and very helpful.the most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers."
good,Overall my experience with the company was a rocky one. It became hard to agree with the direction the company was going in. The job function was not hard and most of the time enjoyable. The unfair demand on us as specialist took away from the customer experience.
good,"• Received customer calls in ref to billing issues, answer billing questions."
good,"In the last 5 years the stress level has risen greatly, the pressure put on employees to achieve ratings is the primary goal. Upper management wants to apply a cookie-cutter effect to every individual customer report, and hold the tech to a standard created by accountants and office suits who have no concept of the real world."
good,"Working as a telephone operator was a very high pressure job due to having to be courteous, accurate, and efficient on each call. Daily average work times needed to balance for an acceptable monthly average work time per call. So, when I encountered longer-than-average time callers due to their physical limitations, their need to get a pencil to write information down, etc. each work day, the internal stress level inside me increased. However, I was apparently able to handle this as I worked with ""Pacific Telephone"", then its new name ""Pacific Bell"", then its new name ""SBC"", then its current name ""AT&T"" for a combined total of 34 1/2 years."
good,"I retired after 24 years, made alot of money while I worked there and when I left."
good,repaired cell phones
good,"work minimum of 80 hrs a week, usually at&t employees would get double time pay after 60 hours, but they made a separate contract for us so it remained at time and a half. job not too bad if the hours were more reasonable"
good,Start between 6-630
good,"A typical day working for Direct T.V., was great at first. I could work any hours that I wanted to. The down fall to the job was there was not an hourly pay if you didn't make any sales you didn't make a paycheck. I have kids so, I had to have a regular paycheck."
good,Not a family friendly company.Poor management.this company sets goals that are unatainable unless u cheat or you abuse customers by hanging up on them after they have waited for 20mins to talk to a rep.You can always transfer out and lie and tell the cust hes in the wrong office.Or you can just say nothing when the phone rings and then the customer thinks they have lost connection with u.Couldnt treat people this way anymore...After 15yrs This company isnt what it was when I began in 1996.I have to sleep at night.Do they.
good,"As the title said, don't plan on making it a career. Great place to put a few years in and gain some really valuable work experience/ skill sets."
good,"When I began with AT&T, I believed I had found the company I would work for forever. Being 20 years old, a college student, and still living at home, it was a blessing to find such a solid job. A month in another state for training while everything was paid for was awesome, as well as the total earnings during my first year with the company. However, that's where the dream ended. Within the two years I had worked for AT&T, I had two different general managers, three different district managers, and two regional managers. Complications arose when the sales strategy, goals, and pay structure would change each time this occurred. Changes in commission plan resulted in a $12,000 pay cut from year one to year two. Also, the company became entirely focused on ""scripting"" each retail store, taking away any creativity or individuality and favoring a more streamlined experience for customers to ""enjoy."" This resulted in making my customers extremely uncomfortable in the store, as I was being forced to offer products to a person who simply did not need them. Beyond that, district management went to the point of even informing to pretend some products ""didn't exist,"" instead to emphasize the ones AT&T felt were most important, even if another product was available in the store which was more suited for the customer. You'll quickly form a bond with your coworkers, as you'll see them more than your own family. Also, as the newest employee, anticipate having the worst schedule (ie. closing every night, working every weekend) as the schedule builds based on seniority."
good,"If you work hard & self prospect weel you can make decent money, but if you do really well they will force you out after a few years."
good,"A work day was very productive, taking incoming calls from customer who had problems with cell phone data plans and also wireless computer cards. Management was not too strict and they were rarely seen on the floor. The co workers were very friendly and the overall atmosphere was tolerable. The hardest part of the job wast trying to convey to the customers the steps to getting their services back working. Sometimes they would not know how to reset their systems and this could produce a 2 hour call. I enjoyed the people I came into contact with and some of the customers. the only problem I had and the reason for my resignation was there was no advancement within the company. people had been there 5 and 10 years still in the same positions. There were no new management opportunities and no room for growth."
good,"The company itself forgets that the workers have families and cultures outside of the job. They want you to drive in the ice for work. They forget that Christmas is national holiday and people would like to be home Christmas eve with their children. They also don't provide coffee in the breakrooms, or forks or spoons, salt pepper, or anything useful."
good,"The pay gave a high school graduate like me the chance to purchase a home, raise a daughter as a single Mom, and save some money for retirement. I learned to Multi task and work non-stop while trying to meet objectives. I enjoyed my co-workers and we are like a family against the company. Wasn't always like that, just in the past 5-10 years, company has steered away from Customer Service, and only caring about meeting quotas that were not realistic"
good,You make great money however it comes at the expense of your family
good,"A typical day at AT&T's call center is fun. You answer customer service questions and help them with their accounts then you get to try and sell them TV, Internet or Land line phone service. Not very many are sucessful, its a little harder than I thought. I learned that you can take a customer's unpleasant experience, fix it and then if you become their trusted advisor you can sell them any AT&T product. My co-workers, although there are so many seem friendly and like to have a good time at work. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that I have helped someone."
good,"I worked in a business office/call center environment receiving calls from customers and from employees such intra-company departments and service technicians. Our office handled all calls for AT&T Payphone Services for 13 states. We handled repair, installations, billing and collections. Every aspect of the Payphone business went through our office."
good,Uncover new opportunities for the company. Increase revenue for the company day by day and exhbit un parallaed customer service with every opportunity.
good,"AT&T seemed like a great company at first. Their products are pretty good, and it wasn't difficult to sell iPhones or any other smartphone of course if the consumer wanted one. It was getting people to purchase a smartphone who didn't want them was the challenging part. I had 3 different managers in 9 months that I was employed there, and all 3 had different managing styles. One of the 3 managers helped me tremendously and taught me everything about selling. The hardest part of this job was actually getting people to purchase things they did not need, or weren't going to use."
good,very stressfull work environment. either your good or your gone. terrible hr guidelines. hr isnt fair to contracted employees when it is clearly companys fault. rather fire higher paid employees and replace with lower paid. puts former employees on no rehire list forever.
good,The pay was very good however we had too work very long hours and the management staff was awful.
good,typical day- handle on average 60-70 calls a day
good,No 9-5
good,"Good company, great compensation and benefits. Customer focused and family oriented."
good,"i really enjony working there the people i meet was cool,and the shift i loved"
good,"AT&T customer care there was always goals we were striving for and discussing ways to put the customer first which was exciting. Every day you manage customer accounts, complaints and you make business decisions frequently throughout the day on how to best handle the account leaving the customer happy and upholding the standards of the company."
good, Handled incoming and outbound phone calls
good,Trabalho envolvendo multi tarefas durante todo o tempo.
good,"It was my first customer service job, great experience but you do not get to choose your work schedule or days off. Management stayed on top of you which is good. Hardest part of the job was telling people you did not have a phone number to the place they were looking up even though you know it exists. The best part of the job was the training."
good,Forced into hours that were not agreed on at the start of the job.
good,A typical day at work would be filled from start to finish with customers who were being challenged by company systems. I learned a great deal about the company and technology. Management here are rigidly devoted to policies. My co-workers were great folks who were highly trained. The hardest part of the job was coping with the customers who were irate. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing you were always going to work a set of hours from start to finish.
good,A typical day at work is very busy. The job is very demanding and requires very good time management. The co workers are trying to maintain what the company is asking while trying to have a family life afterwards. The hardest part of the job is trying to manage your time and complete various task due at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job is the compensation.
good,Union employees have the benefit of job security and making use of the employee services.
good,"A typical day of work in an ATT call center is to be treated like a child. The management expects you to clock in at a specific time, take breaks at specific times, eat lunch at specific times, and clock out at specific times. If you break any of these ""rules"" then you will be out of compliance, which will result in verbal warnings, then written warnings; and finally termination. The average annual turnover rate for an ATT call center is about 70% to 80% percent. I worked there for a year and a half, and I saw countless employees quit or get fired every few months. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the constant flow of calls without a pause. Most days I would be taking phone calls back to back from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM; this would amount to about 50 to 60 calls a day. The only way I stayed sane was by making a few friends on the job."
good,"management states to employees ""when you mess with my money, you mess with me""...pertaining to individuals whom do not hit their daily numbers for performance."
good,"A typical day of work at Directv starts by showing up at work and logging in to your computer work station. Early morning calls are usually customers who have had service interrupted and either have to pay their full balance due to get it turned back on or request your supervisor to tell them the same thing. Typically when a supervisor is requested you have to find one that is available, which can often take up to 15 minutes. Waiting often further upsets the customer, who can rate their phone call. Not only does the customer do this, but the company does as well by monitoring random calls, timing calls, recording transfers (when a customer needs a different department). Advancement depends largely on statistics the computer records that you have no control over for the most part."
good,"Great Benefits but horrible hours! i learned the best ways to troubleshoot any technical problem! Management is ok, not the best but they are average. Co- workers are all awesome, like a family. Hardest part of the job is entering into a persons home without knowing the danger they could bring! The most enjoyable part is working alone!"
good,"Was a great place to work for the first 10 or so years. It has now become a corporation that has no interest in the employees. Hey folks, its only TV not life and death!"
good,While there there are many good things about the company I do not believe I was afforded an opportunity to encounter them.
good,Learned a lot about how to use computerized equipment to troubleshoot.
good,I would of stayed here if they wouldn't of closed the door to the public
good,Company is ok I really liked the benefits. The training part could have done a better job of show and providing information to the employees.
good,Good company to work with. More working hours and not that very good infrastucture facilities.
good,"This job to me was a money maker, if you are motivated and willing to work. That is where the good attributes ends. As an employee I was given little care or consideration from my upper management. They acted as though they only wanted to cover their own butts and make themselves look good. If that meant getting you in trouble or holding you accountable for things you didn't do, then they will go there."
good,"This employer is constantly laying off workers and moving jobs out of Connecticut to Texas and India where the pay is much less. AT&T does not care about its workers, only the bottom line. The pay and benefits are decent, so if you don't care about job security or being treated like a number, then this is the employer for you."
good,"Compensation and benefits is good compare to most jobs, training is excellent to get accustom to your duties."
good,Great place to work for sales and learning about technology.
good,"Its all about the location of the store and the previews store owner. All sales have a reputation, if your store is in the bottom it will always stay there."
good,"Recently, there has been too many changes too fast to maintain the respect for the leadership or the sense of any security. Telecom giant company blocking the telecommute culture was interesting one..."
good,Like most major corporations AT&T has forgotten who built their brand. The employee is looked upon as a necessary evil. The culture has become toxic. The only reason to be here is the pay. We are losing customers by the thousands and the upper management doesn't seem to care anymore. It has become a race to the bottom hoping to be able to retire with our promised compensations. FYI new hires are payed half ofcwhat senior techs make and no more pensiobs.
good,It was commission and sometimes  you would have a sale but the customer credit wasnt in the 700 so you didnt get paid  for working  days and nights basically for free I remember getting chased by dogs trying to sale cable and a guy not wanting to let us out his house
good,"Nepotism is very real, since is not illegal is commonplace.  You will be paid decent for work if you can get hired, but unless you 'you know someone who knows someone' advancement is difficult and layoffs/reorgs show up often."
good,"Like most large companies, employees are laid off often.  I expected to retire with AT&T like my predecessors.  The employees that they look for are IT or project management types or replacing full-time employees with contractors. If you are hired with this company do not expect to retire with them.  No telling where they will be when you are ready for your exit."
good,Good pay great job but now is a 3 month job every 3 months is a guess if you have a job or not constant pressure for numbers so they can fire more people good pay but hard on the mind.
good,I liked it at first but eventually I didn't like pushing sales on customers who could barely afford their own phone bill. With every call it was mandatory to offer them a tv and internet package.
good,"I looked forward to working with the Authorized company. Said they'd work with my availability, promised great pay and compensation. However the location is very slow. I'm not continuously moving and helping others like typical retail."
good,Training is the absolute worst. You get paid very well but this is the most stressful job I have ever had. As well as no sick time and they do not expect you to ever call in ir be late.0
good,"very young and eggar executives , With very forwarding ideas when it comes to marketing and campaigns . Very helpful with new hires from different walks of life .They had different activities weekly that helped new hires settle in"
good,Metrics constantly changed which made meeting work goals difficult to obtain. Call center environment that had very tough regulations that had to be followed.
good,"Be prepared to work some long hours do the job they expect also overtime is offered at any time"
good,At&t is nothing but politics it’s not what you know there is who you know they promote who ever they like not who deserves it. you are not valued for your work ethic at all and most of their managers are trash they only got there by kissing the right butt.
good,"This is a good company to work for. Great benefits and  Opportunity to move up but you have to play the politics. Company is very ""cliquey"" in many respects. They want you to do your work their way. Even if you are innovative and successful in your approach, they will want thing to be by their templates. Management does steal your ideas, many times giving you credit, however, their careers will advance fast on your ideas than vis versa. It's typical corporate America."
good,"Great Tech, good to learn state of the art technology for Big Data, but need to work hard to get used to the environment, no one helps you set up, you need to find your way around."
good,"A typical day at work involves dealing with a dispatching system that will never work correctly. Products that only work if conditions are all but perfect. They dispose of high level programmers that have developed great products, allowing those programmers to go to the competition."
good,Benefits are decent and enjoyed working with my peers which was a nationwide environment.  Also enjoyed working with several different organizations to create additional standardization
good,"as long as your face fits it is a good environment to work, there are benefits but a lot of muppets who have advanced careers but can not manage basic things"
good,Heavy pressure for sales goals along with very poor work/life balance. You have to fix a lot of problems that do not pertain to cellular service at all. Pay can be alright though.
good,Many job title and many years the best part are the wages and benefits because we have a union. Advancement is a joke in my book education gets overlooked easily.
good,Not a family balance job. Does not care if you make home for holidays after 10 years of service. Go s on numbers not behaviors but pays well and has benefits
good,This is a great company to work for.only if management was just as great and fair. Things need to be more organized and employees should feel as part of a family to the company.
good,"Good total compensation package,  but a painful culture. The company has been really struggling. Despite its enormous size and scale, the company can't innovate so it buys dying companies to temporarily  disguise its revenue and earnings issues. This strategy is not working"
good,"You get access to exclusive deals to drive sales, but this is an old school door to door, credit check over the phone, you earn what you sell. Up to 60% commission on bigger sales, $80 per smaller sale."
good,"All  the  company cares about is profits! "
good,"AT&T was a great place to work, learn, and grow. Unfortunately it is going through massive downsizing to meet its new network/company directions and it seems people don;t really matter anymore."
good,Good benefits but not family oriented.  No schedule flexibility.  Pay is good.  Very micromanaged.  Company and employees do a lot of community benefits and donations.
good,AT&T has reached is maturity in its product cycle and doing the dumbest things it can to try to stay in the game. Needs to go back to focusing on the wireless side instead of doing all the extra things that don't work like Directv and demos on it. definitely starting to nickel and dime their reps in commission while incentivizing its manager to get reps to upsell their customers with products that do not benefit them at all.
good,The pay was great but I didn't really care to work collections and felt bad having to harass people into trying to get a payment. My direct supervisor was not very good at knowing how to manage and had a lot of complaints from her employees but upper management wouldn't do anything about it because her sibling was one of the directors of the company at our location.
good,"Managed 12+ trainers throughout the SE, Gulf Coast, etc. Management was sorely lacking. The hardest part of the job was watching workload diminish. The people from AM below were great."
good,"Hardest part of the job is the hours and work life balance. For my working late nights, weekends and holidays is hard on my family when i am a single mother."
good,"AT&T help provide for my family but to this date, it still has a very high-stress environment. I had less stress as an EMT during a life and death situation than I did in meetings with AT&T leadership."
good,Leadership vision & mission was fragmented. Several managers were not qualified to manage. Also true for a few directors. Unfortunate since teams were willing and able to work under better circumstances.
good,"enjoy working at at&t "
good,BIG LOB low salary needs to have a good management balance life and work ethics. No allowance no approachable officers they need to increase the salary because the scope of work is really big for the salary.
good,Not a clear path to grow proffesionaly. The structure within the company are really flat and there is not real interaction with other areas or departments.
good,"Not family friendly, management is poor and union is non existent."
good,"Very sales driven environment,  to the point that monthly you are given unrealistic goals that you must hit to even get a commission check,  unless you do shady things to pad your numbers. I'm more of a customer service background.,"
good,Hard to meet sales goals only due to the fact of foot traffic being slow and 80% of the people having issues a sales rep cannot solve due to the company giving you the ability to only sell.
good,"Some of the mgt were horrific to work for and some were exceptional.  Competition was encouraged and often brutal with peers.  However, they did pay well and offered decent bennies which is why I went to work each day."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of signing in to a computer, putting on a headset and greeting potential customers through a series of outbound calls."
good,The job was great in the beginning. Once they changed management things went down hill. They even had me training new employees who were staring out making more money than I was.
good,"In the call center that I worked for management would often promote those that they were friends with and didn't give a fair shot to those that were in the ""In crowd."""
good,Was fantastic the first 7 years then everything went downhill.  The company changed ownership many times along with name and brand changes.  The company was eventually sold as YP to a capital management company then to Dex Media.
good,Very stressful environment due to management mostly and outdated policies. This is at my position. Other positions might feel differently. That is all.
good,It is a high passed and stressfull job with quotas. Micro management is very high at this company. The pay and benfits are very good but would not reccommend this job if you want a work life balance.
good,"Good benefits and perks."
good,La empresa cruenta con un problema de sueldos en cuestion del àrea de servicio tècnico cuando era nextel  se tenia un sueldo de 14 mil pesos y en la actualidad  bajo a 7500 cuando la matèria prima que està a cargo de los tècnicos es responsabilidad muy grande ya que se resguardat mas de 4 millones de pesos por almacen.
good,"Most of the work for AT&T relies on being dishonest with a customer in regards to promotions and possible credits they could be eligible for after their promotional period ends. Lunch periods are only 30 minutes, which is hardly any time to do anything.The whole job is convoluted when it comes to trying to balance a regular lifestyle outside of work."
good,"Valued technicians are more likely to have the potential to move up. Installations and repair tickets are completed each day with measurements on dispatch efficiency, quality, and customer surveys."
good,The hours are take up your entire day which is difficult to balance life and work.  You are expected to prospect which is difficult to do with no management guidance.
good,Great company but the work schedule make it very difficult to balance especially if you have young children. No set schedule make it difficult when you have a family and want to be an involved parent. Excellent for individuals that are single.
good,Challenging and rewarding work environment in all aspects.  All of the roles I held there provided opportunity for personal and professional advancement.
good,"I worked there only seasonal, during Christmas season. Fun place to work at, but also very busy and not boring at all. I got along with all the employees"
good,"pro:"
good,Fast paced but fun to work. A lot of calls you have to know what you are doing and how to manage your time. Work pace is stressful at times but while you are working you learn a lot.
good,Blah on them left after 11 years with nothing but a poke in the eye.   Might be a great entry level job and they talk about hiring within and job advancement but really is far and few between.
good,Good training. Work life balance is tough at times especially holidays. Decent pay and benefits. Advancement depends on who you buttered up to not on performance.
good,"You never know what you are going to get and policies are not applied fairly"
good,"not a good place to work,started out really good but bad management ,pay and benefits were ok but kept going up every year ,training was bad,you had to find time while on the job to do training on ipad"
good,"The job was fun and lucrative at first but the management started making huge mistakes. They would more often then not short me on hours, which would in turn make my paycheck suffer."
good,"I thought AT&T was the pinnacle for telecom jobs.  Found my employer antiquated, stale and inappropriate for my needs.  I left after 2 years.  No real career path."
good,Stop micromanaging you’re reps let us do our job and give us more incentives to help us with attrition. Stop working on the numbers and keep or gain new customers.
good,"One of the best places to learn the latest technology on broadcasting at their DirecTV Los Angeles broadcast Center. One is constantly challenged by the constant upgrades to the latest technology and by learning the multiple systems in broadcasting."
good,"Good place to start, constant threat of layoffs in all areas of the business.  Training has fallen from previous year and is mostly self taught.  Perhaps this is the way of corporate America."
good,"Buen trabajo sólo si tienes experiencia, no te enseñan bien las cosas y los de calidad se ponen súper mamones sin darte ayuda"
good,"We went through several manager changes. Some were terrible and some were great. It seemed like commission was always being restructured and we were starting to get paid less. The company expects you to sell all services but does not pay fairly. There are good perks like employee discounts, tuition reimbursement and other benefits. If its understaffed, its very stressful. They expect you to take your time with every customer but also sale to pitch everything to every customer. They expect you to meet sales goals every day even it's super slow. There is alot of micromanagement and expect your manager to ask you alot of questions about every single customer you get. There are occasionally extra incentives to get you to sell and contests as well. Hours can vary as you can end up staying really late with customers."
good,"This was once a great company to work for and call home for a long time. Over the years they have chased good leaders away in exchange for horrible managers. Don’t ask, how can we make things better? When you aren’t going to change. Don’t put incentive plans in place with a planned 60% success rate and if you get. Make sure you are prepared to get audited."
good,"start work at 8 a.m. work until they tell you to go home. difficult to plan for anything after work when you don't know what time you will be finished working, adding more job tasks, and more work load and expecting higher work quality with less time per job to complete."
good,I did 10 years with the company and it was an experience.  Managers get moved around a lot so it was a lot of new management.  The culture is good and they have good intentions but I felt it was way too much favortism.
good,"Very fast paced, long hours, possible working many days without break. If needed you will need to travel out of town anywhere from 30 days to 90 days. Work/Life balance is more to work. if you are a field technician due to working long hours it is very hard to pursue a higher advancement."
good,"Would have loved to have been turned over to a permanent role. Senior Leaders need to be more respectful and lead by example. Senior Managers would benefit from communicating desired outcomes with those supporting them. Was impressed with the advancements in Security and Branding. The work was interesting, but process was lacking. Always room to grow."
good,"call center representative"
good,The Job is stressful because of job security. They have fired over 40 people in my yard alone and the writing was on the wall when it came to my job unless i left to another city.
good,High stress environment.  Micro managed according to metrics. Given iPads to do all of your work on that the programs constantly crash which makes it hard to do your job and adds constant frustration. Metrics are unrealistic. Your constantly embarrassed by the way the company gets orders wrong and you have to try to straighten everything out. Everyday you have to deal with angry customers.
good,"Store traffic is not going up, as corporate hires more people they increase sale metrics. Hard to reach goals for commission. Corporate is separating from the lowly sales people."
good,"After three years of working at AT&T, I've realized that it's solely up to the individual whether to work at AT&T temporarily or to end up being micromanaged for the rest of their life. The only positive thing I could say about being AT&T's frontline was meeting new people. Those customers who I had something in common with made my day much easier and enjoyable."
good,"The culture is not always what it seems."
good,The expectations from management was extremely stressful. The job tasks itself and customers weren't so bad. The way management trained and handled their team was very bad and made many people want to leave.
good,"A lot of pressure to perform when there isn't much traffic flow into the store and no advertising dollars or promotions to drive customers into the store. In fact, they have increased their online only deals to justify reducing staff and closing stores."
good,"If you are looking for a company that cares about its employees, this is not the place for you. the only reason the benefits and pay are good is the union fought for these perks. The union is less powerful now and AT&T is pushing people out and around as much as possible."
good,"Expect major changes in any marketing role- like a new VP every 12 months, or sooner! Lousy data systems, over-taxed tech support, silo-ed work groups"
good,I was the Assistant Tour Manager for a multi-city mobile tour. The lead Tour Manager was extremely disrespectful and made for a very difficult work environment.
good,"A typical day at the store was usually slow and it barely got busy. Worked in a private store, and the owner wouldn't give a quota but expected us to oversell as much as possible which wasn't feasible given the low volume of traffic coming to the store."
good,"Ambiente grato de trabajo, lugar seguro, locomoción accesible."
good,Working at the call center was very stressful. Some things were not thought about before implemented. With the changes made within the company there were to many lay off.
good,It depends on what department you are in on how you will like the company. I run into techs all the time and  everyone seems to be disgruntled about something at the company. Supervisor will keep you in horrible jobs because you are good. It’s hard to move if you do your job. Also it’s a seniority based company so if you don’t have any it doesn’t matter how good of an employee you are. You are rewarded for how long you stay with the company. Work ethics means nothing here.
good,Taking calls from customers who wanted to pay their invoices or set up new accounts.  Was able to add personal touches to work station.  Able to verify information back to customers.
good,"AT&T has a lot of managers, but very few leaders. This makes working for AT&T very challenging at times.  I have been with AT&T for 17 years and have learned a lot, but the environment has become very negative recently and team work is no longer encouraged."
good,AT&T is a huge company with a lot of benefits. with such a large company however the demand is just as high. work life balance is almost non existent . you are there at least 10 hours a day and you are expected to finish 20 hours worth of work
good,"AT&T was a good place to work and offered training in skills that might otherwise be difficult to acquire, or have nearly as much relevant troubleshooting in. The trouble is that the company frequently has layoffs for the frontline and does a VERY poor job of communicating from within; what I mean is that getting anything done outside of your scope of work/ability is tedious and sometimes impossible which makes it difficult to truly do right by the customer. This is because there's nearly no communication between departments and there's no communication between those on the front lines and anyone above your direct supervisor. Everything rolls down hill so it's always the wire tech that ends up getting layed off or being at fault for a situation they may not have any control over. Hours can be from a standard 8hr day or maybe even a 13hr day, it just depends on the jobs you get that day. Benefits are fantastic and the discount on products is nice. Overall not bad, and the pay is pretty decent; the only trouble is that they keep changing products and what a wire techs scope of work is, generally meaning that you have to become proficient in things that you're not truly trained on."
good,Management forces you to push sales versus building rapport. I did learn a lot about sales and telecommunications and how to analyze. The discount is a plus and the pay can be good.
good,High stress job. Not a job that will accommodate work life balance. Good pay but not for the amount of stress. Hours continues to change every 3-6 months based on seniority.
good,"AT&T had been a great place to work until recently.   Location based job eliimination started in 2019.  If you are not in 1 of 10 target zones you will loose your job.  Was not given an opportunity to move.  Receivied a letter that my job was eliminated, no other explanation,"
good,Working at AT&T was a tough place as they have over 250K employees to manage with boots on the ground work policies. The acquisition focus of senior leadership has been critical to the workplace day to day environment with DIRECTV and HBO/WARNER BROS.
good,First year is difficult; they intend for it to be difficult to weed out anybody not committed to getting the job done as fast as possible while finding ways to short-cut safety rules without getting caught or injured.
good,Good place to get started up and make money but does not offer career positions. After management there is no more room to move up. To be fair it is enough to provide for yourself.
good,Many departments have been outsourced or moved to another state. Most avenues for advancement have been closed or made almost impossible to move into.
good,"Not entrepreneurial.  Numerous opportunities to learn, but often bureaucratic.  Account teams have high turnover (~every ten months) making long-term customer relationships challenging.  "
good,I was treated fairly as a contractor.  Overall a great working experience. Employees were willing to work as a team with no differentiation between contractors and employees.
good,Management moves constantly without a steady base. Everything you do is judged and documented. Enjoyed working here for some time but the way they have you sell is not moral
good,Over a hundred years worth of problems created internally that will never be amended.  You live and work in a constant state of mental warfare in order to get things done and nobody really cares.
good,The company offers many opportunities to move into different positions but you should be willing to relocate. They do offer  some incentives for most sales positions and  benefits are great. Hours are demanding especially during the launch of new service or product.Culture of the company is great in theory at the end of the day it is who you work for that can make your experience uncomfortable and hard to do your job well.
good,"do  not work here horrible management, if they do not like you they will be out to get you and keeps outsourcing jobs overseas to get more profits while incurring debt"
good,My 20 years at AT&T gave me an opportunity to obtain valuable experience in project management and business analysis.  I enjoyed working remotely for 12 years.
good,it was not bad but managers would give out the work and sometimes unfairly. you would make your money by the number of installs done per week and if they were close togeather than you would recieve a better check..
good,Job was very demanding and not very rewarding. Management was not up to par. This job is ok for highschool dropiouts......................................
good,"Supervisors were not helpful unless you were a ""pet"". Union was worthless also, Direct supervisors and those above that position look at you as expendable and worthless unless you decided to kiss up to them."
good,I would give customers better options on them being able to save money and I was penalized for it. The sales goals were constantly being raised to where it seemed not possible to hit your sales numbers every month.
good,AT&T is committed to reducing it's workforce through outsourcing.  The only real positives are the benefits and wages.  Even high seniority union positions have relatively little security as AT&T can surplus positions at any time.
good,"Very busy call center. Unfortunately the contract did not last long and it was given to another Contractor. Due to the contract being awarded to another company, the call center was closed and all employees were laid off. The call center was relocated to MI and relocation was not an option for the existing employees."
good,Lived on the road for 3.5 years being loaned to other markets. The work is good if you are able to work in the market where you were hired. On the Job training.
good,"sick policy for employees is horrible "
good,"Es una empresa que al parecer se pone solita el pie para evitar el desarrollo de sus ejecutivos de ventas, problema serio en escasez de equipos."
good,nice company with good benefits. culture hasn't changed and become modern. It just depends on which group you are with and the manager that you have. It's a huge company
good,Telecommunications have changed in the time at the company.  It has gone from enjoyable to not knowing what will happen next.  2019 is now the year of the layoffs and cutbacks.
good,AT&T used to be a company where the Manager was a Leader. The company promotes a way of performance but the fact is that the leadership team is formed on who is a friend of whom terms. The Global Supply Chain is completely damaged by senior management. Management is not engaged and makes decisions looking down to the reports with disrespect.
good,Not much structure as to helping employees advance up the ladder. They have lay offs at least once a year and you never know if you are going to be on that list.
good,"To many changes on a day to day basis. To many changes in upper management. My last supervisor really had any care about his employee's. Breaks were taking more while driving to next customer, opposed to and actual break."
good,"Constantly being micro-managed and told sell things Customers didn't need, and then held to meet efficiency standard, the company set technicians up to fail."
good,The company had great minds and solid technical product but after the stock meltdown in the 2008 time frame the company was taken over by Alcatel.  This resulted in closure of US locations in favor of our European locations.
good,"AT&T pays well, but they have a re-org about every 6-8 months and often have layoffs. It seems they like to move people around to different roles as soon as they learn their job function. Middle management appears to have no idea what the people they are managing actually do to get the job done, or what their actual skill sets are."
good,"I worked here MANY years ago. When the company gave you a very good 401k, health insurance and PTO benefits. Many things have changed since then. The management was horrible at that time. The managers will not have your back and will walk all over you when a customer complains about anything. "
good,I would install and repair services provided by At&t to subscribers. Help customers with problems and solve issues. Make sales of products to customers to help lower monthly rates. Some managers where micro managers and others would let you do your work. The work culture was not the best at times due to the uncertainty of the direction of the company. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers due to other departments promising services not available. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people.
good,"The culture nowadays is one full of angst among existing employees due to cost reductions, over spending by executive leadership.  Morale is way down."
good,Better backgrounds and requirements for third party owners. Many third party at&t do not treat associates fairly and cause poor associate reviews on the entire company.
good,this job was very stressful it was not a fun job for a college student. If i wasn't in college this job would have been very fun. They made us sell products and plans that I didnt believe in
good,"AT&T is a prime example of your typical corporate structure with all the good and bad. Large corporation with a wide range of personalities so it depends greatly on your manager as to your experience.  I have a wonderful, inspiring coach who was reluctantly replaced by a horrible manager whose reputation preceded them.  "
good,"Productive workplace with sufficient incentives.  Plenty of ""training"" and ""guidance"".  Sometimes too much micro-management and not enough relevant ""coaching"".  Guidelines for goals were always changing.  The sales requirement became unrealistic at times, as it was a ""customer service"" position."
good,Work orders constantly created incorrectly. Managers expectations unrealistic.Techs blamed for everything. Equipment issues very often faulty software
good,"after the acquisition of DirecTV and Lusa cell, everything went downhill. Employees are dispensable. "
good,"It was a good place to work and get experience. They offered quality training. The pay wasn't too bad, however in my years with the company I went through 3 different lay-offs."
good,A fantastic brand and good people make it a great professional environment to work. A lot of effort is made to provide employees opportunities to learn and develop new skills.
good,"Pay is good but not enough for what is required "
good,"Go to the garage in the morning load out the van and then begin install jobs."
good,"Backfilling of vacancies slow resulting in overload.  Returned to work after a 5 year hiatus to care for children and was started at the minimum entry level management salary despite the 14 prior years of service with the company.........have been in place now for 5 1/2 years and the salary has not caught up to the wage I earned in 2009."
good,"for the most part a lot of things you were measured on was out of your control, its a numbers game . the rest of this im just typing to reach one hundred and fifty characters"
good,Already closed and moved to India trust me it was a recession and in desperate need of a job I was glad to have a paycheck. The Management team finally changed and started treating the employees like humans right before they closed the doors.
good,"Clock in using the phone system "
good,"The job itself wasn't bad and the pay was above average pay for the area, Management could use a lot of work and work/life balance was not existant. Overall it could have been a better experience."
good,The company is great to work for in the sense of pay but if you are looking for normal hours and flexibility this is not for you. That was my issue I wanted a set and normal schedule in which AT&T was unable to provide. The sales and targets to push were a bit much especially with Direct TV but sales and pushing to sell Is expected in this kind of environment.
good,Pay was good but there was little to no work flexibility. They were very strict about tardiness to the point of disciplinary action up to and including dismissal.
good,"Dozens of rules were introduced mostly to discourage people from staying there. There is union representation available.  The union selling point is that you can only get fired for cause. With dozens of rules its easy to find a cause."
good,If you have never worked in a call center environment this may not be for you. This is fast pace job that requires a lot of patience. Mostly in this environment you have to deal with angry and upset guest so just be prepared.
good,"I enjoy working with technology and the federal agencies."
good,"stressfull job envoriment"
good,"AT&T was a great place to work many years ago, promotions, merit increase and knowledgeable  management. However it has become a place where advancement is rare, layoffs are constant. Great people are pushed out the door, while the average to below average workers are kept on."
good,"It was an okay place to work, especially for their benefits. There were always issues with the coworkers and favoritism. Management could use more training."
good,"I loved my job and pay. The thing that I didn't like was AT&T's management style. You had various quotas that you had to meat. Some were under your control, some were not. You received an allotted vacation time based on seniority, no sick time was given. I worked at a call center and I was expected to be there everyday and on time. I had no issues doing that. It taught me how to be a dependable employee. But, for those that have children and don't have a support system, this job may not be for you."
good,AT&T is a large company that provides solid opportunities to develop technical skills. They do this is the form of classes & courses that focus on new developments in network integration.
good,"You are a number in a spreadsheet. If you care to manage yourself according to a spreadsheet, you will thrive there. If you have integrity and care about your family, customers and have a work ethic (care about actually solving problems vs treating symptoms), good luck. This is for Premise Technician role specifically."
good,Great place to work also could be fun and stressful some days. Depending on who your managers are they will manage your make day  your day or break it. Overall no complaints.
good,Great work setting working and getting along with co-workers. customers tend to be more respectful than not. That comes along with any sales opportunity.
good,"I worked for ATT for over 11 years. It was a fun and challenging environment for most of the time I was there. We received raises through a bargained union contract, not on the merit of your work. I didn't like this as I was an exemplary employee that always met and exceeded all goals presented to me. "
good,"This job is ok if you do not have a family, and don't mind working crazy hours. This job was the call center for AT&T Convergy's. I think the AT&T is a great company, but call center are a little much for me in this company. Would work for another call center that is more friendly in job life balance."
good,"Decent pay but split off days and no control over end times is tough for folks with a family.  Management can be unethical and ""good ole boy system"" is rampant."
good,"Company politics and lack of advancement is why I left. Discount for cable and internet along with mobile was great. Last manager I had was awesome but we had lack of leadership from above. New AM manager when I left, he seemed legit."
good,The compny’s attitude is do more with less. The company Expectations are very demanding. There is no work life balance. The job consumes your life. Not for the faint of heart.
good,"okay company to work for work life balance sucks. they say there is room for advancement but honestly its all about seniority, no one cares about your worth ethic. something to keep in mind."
good,Had good.work you'll like it as long as you can stay busy work slow at times and hours will get cut if there is no work good health and vision covered
good,Forced sales environment add products to consumers they do not want. Only praise top sales people even if they deceived customers for the sale. No work life balance.
good,"decent pay, very little room for advancement, benefits good, management has never done the job but can tell you how to do it, company discounts are good"
good,I loved working for AT&T for the benefits and pay. I loved my co-workers and skills I learned along the way. Poor management and no room to move up is whats driving me to look for a new job.
good,"Upper management is slow to adapt, and takes the wrong path quite often.  Get used to being hated by anyone outside the company when they learn where you work."
good,This is a great position for a younger person looking to get started.  Excellent training and education opportunities.  The work day changes with every customer so boredom is not a problem.  If you enjoy working outdoors you will get plenty of time outside.  Compensation is fair for the work you do.  Due to corporate cuts the work force is understaffed and leads to long work hours.  If you want to be home at a steady time this is not the job for you.  Very poor work/family balance.  Mandatory three weekends per month.
good,"When you start, you go through a seven week comprehensive training process that teaches you everything you need to know. That plus a few ride days with senior technicians gets you going on the job pretty well. As the title says, the work isn't hard but dealing with constant micromanaging is. There are unrealistic performance goals the company expects us to perform at and if those goals aren't met managers are expected to micromanage you till you achieve those goals. Upper management only looks at numbers and expects regions to perform perfectly and the top people just want to make money. All of this leads to a highly stressful work life (for every level) and the feeling that the company doesn't see us as an employee but just a number thats supposed to make them money."
good,"Typical day starts at 8 am and ends when all the jobs are done or 7pm comes.  Driving hour to first job and going back and fourth 1 hour drive through out the day.  Hardest part of the job is customers and how they live, most our jobs is in low income housings, and the customers don't have a phone that works or answer there calls.  The most enjoyable part of this job is meeting people and talking to the customers, and also you are out by yourself."
good,"My experience working for AT&T, to put it shortly, great pay and benefits, but after the nice schedule of training, expect 70 hour work weeks and many calls that have technicians working as late as 10 at night on some calls to fix a solution. Plus, micro-management makes for a challenging experience especially during hot summers in South Texas."
good,Not family oriented. They work their employees as much as possible without being penalized. AT&T finds ways around the union contract for their benefit only.
good,"AT&T at one point was a great place to work 8yrs with the company then the shift started to change with the new products such as Direct TV, Home security etc and lead to increased pressure on the sales reps from management and subsidizing stores and countless lay offs very greedy company and work place is very stressfull and some managers are shady and some sales reps are shady and poor sales tactics and lying on accounts"
good,"It's a great company to work for, but they have the worst attendance policy and the management is really bad, not to mention the stressful environment and lack of support from management."
good,No opportunity for advancement unless want to be a manager. The company has unrealistic sales target and make it hard to reach the target. The only good thing are benefits.
good,It is a company that provides great benefits to its workers.  There is alot of turnover. There are alot of opportunities for training. My locations and business vertical as little room for growth.
good,"It was an ok job for the time when I needed it. I guess I have to write more, so here it goes... Great benefits and pay, not so great micro management."
good,Not a bad place to work. No work life balance. Everytime they buy another business they lay off people. No job security. Heavy sales driven. Lots of angry customers
good,"Good company to work but if they issues they will hire you. Long hrs. For working for 17.00 per/hr. Some days are good however, it is back biting.. pretty much, you take ur chances with several contractors"
good,"The job was stressful.  Schedules changed every day/week. We were judged on metrics that were unrealistic. Great pay and benefits,  Good jobs over the years."
good,"This work is diverse and challenges you, which is great if you like variation and thinking on your feet. Support is available, but you work by yourself, following At&t's productivity expectations.  You are exposed to the elements, and the exposure of being in customer's homes."
good,AT&T focuses more on blanket policies to protect itself rather than working with employees. They are draconian in rules and regulations. They do however pay very well for the type of work.
good,"Es una empresa donde el ambiente laboral es muy agradable con los compañeros, pero no tanto con los jefes, en ocasiones sentía que había cometido algún crimen y que tenía que pagar una condena, cada vez mas exigentes y nada de los que enseñan en los cursos de motivación para crear un mejor ambiente laboral se aplica en el campo, solo castillos en el aire."
good,"Interacting with customers on a daily basis. Installing television and internet. Climbing telephone poles, working in attics. Dealing with lots of bureaucracy every day."
good,"Thoroughly enjoyed working with customers. Enjoyed installations, but having to meet quality and efficiency standards was bad.  Liked the crew I was on, but managers didn't give me personal help I needed to succeed"
good,Not a good fit for me. Finish line always moved.  No matter how well you do there is always more.  Never felt like the job I did was good enough even when I was t the top of the charts
good,"When I was working with DirecTV the middle management was under scrutiny on a regular basis. The rates and services were never good enough, expectations were set to a near impossible level. Even with a 94% customer satisfaction rate for 3 years I never received a raise. Things many be different now, but I still would not recommend working this type of job."
good,"Not enough training was given, there were not enough people available to help you when you had a complicated situation, it was a very fast-paced go-go-go environment."
good,"Company is the epitomy of big corp America.  Yes, I do mean the steriotypes.  Great incentives for young grads initially but long term attraction fizzles out after around 3-5 years.  Depending on area of expertise."
good,"I love doing what I do at AT&T.  My job and it's funcitons are fun and challenging.  However I feel that in order to advance in this company is NOT what you know or how well you do your job or even how successful you are at your job, If you want to advance one of 2 things need to happen; 1. You get lucky and you are at the right place at the right time (which hardly ever happens because of number 2) and 2. You need to be hand picked by the hiring manager, this means that most of the time the best qualified candidate is not chosen.  Don't get me wrong, I believe a hiring manager should be able to pick who works for him/her BUT I also believe that if there is a qualified candidate along with their choice, both should be interviewed and given a fair shot at the job.  Unfortunately here at AT&T that does not happen and unqualified candidates are chosen left and right."
good,I enjoyed working at beginning when we have to talk to customer on phone but later on they asked us to do selling and then use Chat and then use 3 chats per window and so on.
good,No learning opportunity. Works as silos. Don't care about employees. No correlation with speciality and available job. Good facility. Encourage studies
good,Never know what time you're going to get off or when you will get a new manger with new protocols. No room for advancement. No room for advancement or tuition reimbursement
good,"Easy job to get comfortable with. Very political place to work. Not great work life balance with upper management. Very flexible hours as a territory sales rep. Too much pressure from upper management, with unrealistic monthly goals."
good,"Treat you like adults when started. More micromanaging and odd rules to demean workers as time went on. "
good,"AT&T is such a large company that the employees are just a number. Most of the time the human aspect of things is a non-factor for decisions such as layoffs or many times promotions. It is more about the numbers (number of years of service or salary) rather than the quality of a person's work history. Upper management is so far removed from daily activities that they could never see an individuals worth. But AT&T was an enjoyable job on a daily basis. If you can get past the fact that you're are a number and nothing more, then you will be fine."
good,"Inbound call center environment, constant coaching and evaluations, call flow and regulations strictly enforced. Daily calls answered averaged around 60 customers or more."
good,"The company has the union screwed down so tight that each contract is worse than the last.  The union gets a ton of money, but can't seem to bargain for a good contract."
good,"irate customers, untrained techs, poor management. they tend on outsourcing everything with poor or no training programs. even internal techs are poorly trained, making job difficult for existing t3 csrs"
good,It's ok but they keep asking for the world while cutting pay. Upper management has no idea what its actually like. IHX does shady sales practiced like discounting devices
good,"It wasn't for me, but I'm not the salesman type. They want you to sell all their products to every customer and that's just not realistic as far as i'm concerned. You're also penalized for being sick, needing time off etc."
good,The job pays well.  Your work day varies from 8 hours to 16 hours a day depending on the job.  Often an unprofessional work environment.  Very little opportunity for advancement unless you have a friend in management.
good,"Basically, a typical call center. Fast paced, competitive, some of the managers probably shouldn't have been in management positions. Very unprofessional some of the time. Preferential treatment given to some agents and others were penalized for standing up for themselves and trying to asking for equal treatment. Good bonus system for exceeding your goals. I learned that I not to stay where I'm not wanted. It pushed me to find something better."
good,"From the 6 years of being employed by AT&T, I have been placed under half a dozen of different supervisors, experienced several upper management changes, and seen great leaders quit due to overwhelming corporate politics.  I was frustrated that my employee profile was twisted and mangled by many hands whether each of them had my interest or not to the point where I was made to look like a horrible employee while being the department's super star.  If the supervisor felt threatened that I was going to take over their position, they would write things into my employee profile that would prevent me from advancing such as ""He threatened me with a baseball bat"" when I had not held one since High School PE class.  Go figure! This is why people quit AT&T.  People quit their bosses, not their job."
good,Working at AT&T was good money but they have no morals and I didn't like that. Management tried to make you sell things that they couldn't even sell and then try to write you up for it when the entire companies score was down for trying to sell HOME PHONES!!!! no one has hose phones anymore!
good,"The company afforded me the opportunity to gain experience in a multitude of areas and structure my career the way I wanted due to all the available jobs.  However, HQ jobs are extremely stressful and the corporate culture does not support work/life balance.  When I worked there, they kept cutting head count and would just pile the extra work on the remaining employees.  You were always in fear of losing your job or being reorganized into a group or department where you didn't want to go."
good,"They provide great training, the job isn't overly difficult, and have excellent benefits and perks. However, the hours can vary and without knowing when you will get off it is difficult to make plans or have a life on days you work. Also, there is very poor communication between departments and can leave you feeling quite frustrated with reoccurring issues that should be much easier to resolve. Management shows little care of employee concerns. The most enjoyable part of the job was the autonomy and being on my own most of the time. The hardest part was dealing with management that seemed to lack a understanding of what really was going on, constantly demanded more, and did not take any suggestions."
good,Union dues are a complete joke and the union is paid by ATT. It created more problems than it was supposed to solve by not allowing management to be part of the union which causes a lot of animosity at the workplace
good,"Te pagan buenas comisiones, pero"
good,"Inbound call about service, billing and equipment  Most calls were complaints about service or lack of. management only cared about getting their numbers. Customers came second."
good,The company is known for setting expectations that are hard to meet. They have a habit of adding more responsibilities to your position.  There is the opportunity for advancement in the company.
good,"The two years I spent with AT&T Retailers was a very tedious experience. I was put on the sales floor WAY too early, and customers would come in angry with me not knowing what to do. Management was poor, I had to run the store by myself with no experience. No manager, just me. I worked 12 hours a day."
good,"Ability to make sales goals varies wildly by location. Choose carefully. Management will not accept any excuses. Requirement to make cold calls as a storefront sales representative was not included in the information given before hiring. If I wanted to do that, I would have applied at a call center."
good,"Enjoyed the job for the first 2 years but dreaded every day of work the last 2 years.  It was frustrating to see a big corporation who would rather pay people dirt and in turn get low quality work from the employees.  Bottom line is ""you get what you pay for""."
good,"wouldn't recommend working as a premise technician."
good,Atypical day at work wasn't to bad. you wont see you manager very often at most once a week. the other employees was most enjoyable about this job. ATT don't value employees much
good,I worked as a contractor for at&t for two years. It started out good until I realized that my supervisor only had one weeks worth of actual field experience so he was absolutely no help and often would ask us what to do or how to do something. Eventually he was replaced and things looked up for a few months until I noticed we were being lied to about or money. They started taking money they said They wouldn't take from us when we signed our contract. A few months later I started noticing  $45 deductions from my weekly pay.working as a contractor for at&t was the most stressful time of my life. Also we were promised paid vacation. We've been working for a year and none of us have any paid time accumulated.
good,"This a great company overall but the culture is slow to move in the direction that leadership discusses in the broad messaging. Red tape is everywhere and slows the process to get work completed. "
good,"No opportunity for permanent employment. Union forces you to pay dues to work there even though the union wont doesn't want terms to be moved to permanent full time. Great place to work, supervisors were great to work for. Company perks were good. Wish there was a real career opportunity with them."
good,"Co-workers are where its at most of the management is getting abused by their management so they are always stressed. Its a hard job some days, others its the easiest."
good,ATT is good as long as you are performing or if they like you. If they don't like you expect them to come after you to get rid of you. My time there was good for a good amount of it but with the whole strike with ATT and the union it went down hill from there.
good,It was interesting place to work when the customers were nice it was easy going. when the customers were having a bad day it was rough going. the management was great and supportive.
good,"At first the metric system for evaluation was ok, it took tine to adjust to them but within months it got worse and overwhelming. There was no way to win when it came to thw diference between the sales associates on store and what we could offer at the call center."
good,The benefits are great with the company but it is very unorganized. Management is very inconsiderate of the employees and they make it really stressful. Not enough money for the stress level.
good,"6 years ago, being a phone sales consultant was a viable 100k a year job. Now, the metrics have changed so much, that you will not make more that $40k a year, if you're lucky and hit 200 percent each month. Promotion takes years, unless you're a female--then promotion is within 2 months so that AT&T can hold a standard of ""promoting both genders equally"""
good,Worked with great people in a difficult environment. A great deal of turn over in upper management made it difficult to create or maintain stability.  Constant changes in direction.
good,"you have to be a suck up to work here, not have an opinion, shut up and do what your told, i was a union steward and i was fired for the first line in my job title. Union did nothing to save my job and it was mainly retaliation for being a union steward and sticking up for the employees that had issues. Good pay back then. i dont know about now."
good,Not an easy call center to be in. Stressfull and few advancement opportunities unless relocating. Metrics you have to meet aren't always easy to do. Some managers are better than others.
good,"AT&T is one of America's most trusted brands, but the company lacks diversity and inclusion across it's leadership teams, especially in sales and marketing."
good,"The pay and benefits are decent for where I live. AT&T only sees the bottom line.  Despite their claims to the contrary, the company is slow moving and gets caught up in its own bureaucracy. "
good,"I enjoyed my time & meeting new people."
good,"Have thick skin as a manager. Things will changed constantly so you still need to make yourself very adaptable. If not your stay will be very brief. As a tech, be a sponge."
good,"was expected to work long days and hours, had to work all jobs till you were texted by supervisor that you were able to go home, never knew when that was"
good,Good company to work for but overtime mandates makes for a difficult work/life balance if you have a family. Training is good. Constantly changing job duties.
good,"Our division was sold to a Holding Company out of Dallas with no fair warning.  We were offered no severance just ability to work 2 weeks.  We were not offered relocation, extending our Health Benefits was going to cost triple of what I was paying."
good,"Management constantly saying need to improve your numbers, even if they're good. Treated like children. No loyalty. Added Direct TV with no pay bump, expected to do UVerse and Direct on single dispatch with unreasonable time frames."
good,I enjoyed working there but there are project and budget reductions due to the company's expansion in the entertainment industry and reduced focus on its core wireline business.
good,"I worked at DirecTV in Huntsville, Alabama before it was AT&T.  They let a lot of good people go unethically, but Alabama is an ""at will"" state so there is nothing you can do about it.  If I needed a job and they would take me back, I would go, but I quit them for a reason.  I still have friends there and they say it has not change much even though AT&T has taken over.  They still fear for their jobs."
good,The pay is great if the goals are achievable in the area that you are working. Management is pretty horrible so you’ll have to learn and adapt on your own.
good,"The title says it all. The corporate culture of AT&T fantastic. Great pay. Great education opportunities. Great benefits. However, your Store Manager can make life a living nightmare. If they have a lack of moral compass, they'll lie, steal and cheat to make their numbers. And they won't have your back in any scenario."
good,"Work on new wireless technology to support remote mid size cities for internet/data service. The technology was great and team work very hard on it to deliver it, however facing the market downtime, the overall results is under expectation."
good,In a broad sense working for AT&T was like a dream job. Until my managers starting to cut hours for his benefit.Things started to get worst as he started to take advantage of me by TAKING MY SALES! Eventually I confronted him about it and he stated that it was wrong of me to be upset. I then proceeded to put in my two weeks and quit the following month.
good,"This job was not your typical answer the phones and place orders for customers.  This job is definitely not for everyone or your average person.  A typical day at work is answering the incoming calls, consulting the customer on product knowledge, fixing or reviewing billing, investigating issues, taking payments, setting up arrangements, notating the accounts all while answering email and instant messaging meetings with managers. and making sure you get quality assurance. The hardest part of the job is trying to meet the quota monthly and the surveys that could count against you when it was meant for another employee.  The workplace culture is highly stressful.  The most enjoyable part of my job was getting letters or emails from customers thanking me for taking the time to help them and not just shrug them off.  Management was like any  other place, you have some good ones and you have some really bad ones.  The incentives, compensation, pay, and benefits are really good."
good,"Good people, pay is decent for entry level, but very little room for advancement without relocation. Would recommend for people looking for steady paycheck."
good,"From 1998 to 2007 this was a great company until they lost focus and bought cheap software to bring the company down. Just google ""Siebel AT&T Wireless,"" as the system was not designed for a multi-million customer base, and this led to angry customers, and frustrated workers."
good,Had to work until jobs were clear  from the que so we sometimes  could work a 12 hour shift. Not a family friendly company. They don't care about you or your family
good,If yhou put costomers first and follow the training then you will have a fun time and good work experience.  The work is demanding and stresfull at times but you learn a lot.
good,"High Stress with a competitive environment that has you competing against your peers on a daily basis. Long hours and unpredictable schedule that includes nights, weekends and Holidays."
good,Typical day at work can vary depending on the work load. What I have learned while working for my present job is that there will always be changes. Nothing stays the same however some of the changes were not thought out. Management at the company depends on which department you are in. Nothing to hard about the job other than always trying to advance within the company. The good part of the job is having vacation and personal paid time off
good,"There were times when there was too much and too little work. Directions and goals were vague and most managers were not clear on what should be done. we had to figure out or guess. too many lengthy meetings."
good,"I was surprised at the training and development provided to the staff at AT&T Mobility. There was the real opportunity for a career there with positive upward movement for those with only a H.S. diploma. I know several people that have advanced to upper management, making six figure incomes who worked hard, developed excellent leadership skills and were promoted on merit. I would recommend this as a great place to work if you did not have the opportunity for a college education. On the other hand, you have to SELL. They give you the training and tools you need to be successful, but if you are not in the top 50% of sales people, you are managed out of the business."
good,As a wire technician/premises tech you are expected to work in all conditions and be productive no matter what.  Working aloft and in attics are a daily expectation.
good,"I started as a Customer Service Rep with Southwestern Bell.  During my career, I held several job titles from Customer Service to Technical.  Eventually SWB bought at&t.  I saw many changes over my 30 year career.  I am grateful for the experiences."
good,Attendance based on a point system. Horrible. Change of focus monthly. That's ok but changing focus monthly then changing the rules as you go based on trying to get employees out is not.
good,"I was a part time rep, the job was good at first but management kept changing so its kind of hard to stay consistent. Managers will be on you about selling Direct TV and if you basically don't they try threatening you like your not going to last working here. The job can be really stressful especially if you are a student. When you walk in that door and clock in forget about your personal life and focus on your sales."
good,It was a good wage for Florida standards but you worked long and hard to earn it.  There was an active union but Wire Technicians were the largest in number and lowest in pay for AT&T/Bell South technicians.  There were many waiting for an opportunity to move up into management or a higher paying/less work position but it rarely happened(almost never).  In the end it was all about the numbers and clearing the load.
good,"AT&T used to be a much better company. They add more things to do the job, tools that are out of date, the salary does not match, and the appreciation is given less. It does not matter what job you do, it is now a taking kind of company, and very little a giving type of company. Some managers are understandable, some are not. It is not they are a bad company, because they are not. There are companies that are better and treated better."
good,"Overall the company provides a fair wage and benefit package but you must be able to deal with overbearing managers and high stress.  Not for everyone but for those that strive on stress this is the place to be. "
good,"Morning meetings, learned how to install cable dish satellite, internet install from outside to inside the home. Managements communication was not consistent with employees and lack of support for technicians. Workplace culture was not conditioned for a productive condition for employee management relations. The hardest part of the job was me being a great technician with manners, professionalism, and customer service in an environment where teamwork, compassion, and protecting an employees personal pay rate information from spreading through the building. The most enjoyable part of the job was the work in itself, customers, and completion of the work."
good,"This company has good pay and benefits depending on what your job title is,it will take awhile to get there though, you dont make it overnight. However, from upper level management down , is a joke,They have no idea what its like to work in the field. The numbers game is always being played and as an employee it gets really old because the bar is set to high for everyone to reach,unless you totally lie about what you have done so that your numbers look good to the bosses.This is a production type job,that does not really care about customers let alone employees,would not recommend working here unless you love being harassed all the time.Expect to work long hours til work is done,junior men and low overtime guys for the week will get browe beat into submission to pick up last job,then get sent 40 miles to and back from job site.Your direct manager will be a joke,they cannot give you any help on jobs and are always on your back,because upper level management jerks are always on theirs at every conference call daily..Overall bad place to work I drove a bucket truck,and when they layed  off other job titles,as well as my own I was asked to do their job as well with no extra pay. In a nutshell,life at at&t was a nightmare..."
good,It started out as a great job helping customers solve their mobility issues and answer any questions that they had.  Towards the end the made us turn it into a sales call to try and sell uverse
good,"I would get to the office, we'd have a team sales meeting and then be put on the phones for 8 to 10 hours a day depending on the shift we were able to get.  Had set breaks, adherence and stats we had to meet daily."
good,Muchos reclamos de clientes. Estresante. Los supervisores eran inhumanos
good,good money horrible work culture. The wireless industry is dying out so they're trying to decrease in house help and have all business online. The location where i worked has a high turnaround.
good,"Okay, call center job. So, it was better than other call center positions. Had it's limitations in what tools we had to assist customer with.  Many outsourced and contracted so there are different ways each call center conducts business. No uniform guidelines, lots of transferring between departments."
good,dependent upon the group and the politics you are either rewarded for growing to fill needs and gaps or discouraged from going outside of the silos. Tons of favoritism
good,"I started as a Prem Tech in 2014. I loved my job and every aspect of it. As time went by, things changed little by little. My daily duties almost doubled, I am forced to do work that other positions get paid almost double to do, possibilities for advancement have just about disappeared, and management now seems to look for reasons to let you go. All of this while being in a Union that does not fight for you. I dread going to work now, and I am seeking employment elsewhere. The pay is pretty good considering this is an entry level position, but for someone who has experience, or understands fairness, the pay doesn't line up with the work performed. The company is money driven, which is great for the big picture, but doesn't seem to care about taking care of it's employees to keep them happy and productive."
good,"While I personally can't refer a friend to work for AT&T, I can say that I was exposed to the culture of telecommunications.  I learned about great new technology ,along with gaining networking opportunities that blossomed the more you dove in!  There is a reason for everything, so I am grateful for the experience."
good,"work starts at 8am, not off till close to 8 or 9pm on heavy days. good management is rare. work/life balance is horrible. you would be lucky to get off by 5pm"
good,It is very hard to sell these packages to customers.  It was extremely difficult to go to work every day and not make any sales.  You never knew if you were going to be able to keep your job.
good,"Scheduling, driving and installing home entertainment systems all day and into the night 7 day a week. Dealing with a wide range of personalities daily. Management was a bottom-line only style with little compassion for the life of its employees. Co-workers were friendly and somewhat helpful but mostly required my help. Working up to 80 hours per week in a contract labor situation begins to wear on a person. Interacting with really good folks on occasion and getting large paychecks made this job worthwhile as a young person."
good,"Environment is way to stressful and management is too cut throat , do not care about employees . I would not recommend this as a place to work for anyone who does not being in a repetitive environment"
good,"Good Place to work, good Compensation/Benefit, good Job Security/Advancement, good, Management, good Job Culture, good Job Work/Life Balance and good  Overall rating."
good,"You meet great people, it can be fun and stressful at the same time, great outcome if you can withstand the stress levels of high traffic and high demands."
good,You will get fired if you do not make sales goal very quickly. Training is pretty thorough but definitely aimed towards more sales oriented personality types. Decent comission pay
good,Great job that was made a nightmare by young and inexperienced management that has no ability to communicate or effectively engage  with people. The pay and benefits for the job were above average however the stress induced by dealing with employee / management relations was unbearable.
good,"Sales goals are ridiculously high and unrealistic. Due to goals that high, cut-throat and back biting occurred frequently. Many of the employees have to have a second job to be able to make the monies needed to pay bills. Compensation is pretty poor."
good,"AT&T is an excellent company to work for. However, due because I came in at an entry level position with Senior level education and experience, I felt the company did not value my skills and worth. Due to being in a call center environment it is metric oriented and upper leadership like to group the sum together vs individual talents."
good,"I moved my way up from a rep into management and honestly, it sucked that my reps were getting paid more than me. onto of selling, coaching, and baby-sitting I was responsible for all daily operations, cash management, and other programs (small business, win local, audit, etc.) inside and outside of my store. the position was stressful. and AT&T started reducing headcount, which made stores short staffed, and managers had to put in long days to make sure the stores ran proficiently. But then, we'd get disciplined for having OT."
good,They are continually laying people off and cutting jobs and pay. Not secure. Good mobile discounts for those that work in that department. Better healthcare plans for lower level employees than for managers.
good,"My mother and father taught me if I don't have anything nice to say, then don't say anything at all! Great coworkers, a lot of them retired in place, though. :- )"
good,The job position change in regard to salary and benefits. The hours vary depending on staff availability and seasons. Hours are very demanding during the holidays.
good,"The nature of work is very exhausting. Maybe it's because of the account that we were handling. A lot of customers were irrate because of increase in rates and policy changes that we have to explain. AT&T is very strict that it's hard to make them look good to their customers. I like that we have mini events in the office. I like that there are christmas baskets, give aways and yearly events."
good,"ok in beginning when worked in Princeton, company relocated several times and finally to Bridgewater, different management, changed managers and this is when company went downhill. worked business part of company. did like it before relocation."
good,productive fun and pretty much the same everyday.  It is not a learning environment.  You do that on your own time and dime.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with 2nd level engineers--having to learn that tightrope.
good,"Working for this AT&T call center had its ups and downs just like any other place of employment you may encounter. The people that work around you on your team make working in the call center environment a little better everyday, but the work load and the stress of consistently making ""sales"" while handling the stress of customers while coming up with a solution for their issues is very boggling. It was kind of difficult assisting a customer with a complaints and issues while also trying to convince them to purchase something else from the company. All in all, the job itself is okay if you can balance assisting the customer and making sales and the management team is okay."
good,"Part of the purchase of DirecTV. 2 Companies couldn't be more different. Directv was younger (my AVP was 35) and a prototypical entertainment company. Fast moving, young, new ideas were always welcome."
good,"Muitos desafios, empresa gigantesca mas gerência limitada e com pensamento antiquado."
good,"Working for B2B sales at AT&T was an interesting experience. There were stressful moments, however it was a great environment to be in. There were great leaders in management that constantly helped improve efficiency while maintaining a relaxed environment."
good,"Great benefits and pay, growth opportunities are dependent on who you know.  Work life balance depend on your superiors.  Too much focus on documenting than actual conversation."
good,This job is very easy seeing as it is repetative. You do practically the same thing everyday. You have to be good with people since you cant always do exactly what they might want.
good,Lots of required overtime with no prewarning about it. scheduled worktimes can and will change daily. scheduled days off can become required workdays with 48 hours notice. Not recommended for people with small children or outside work commitments. Great pay and benefits though.
good,lots of hours and driving management at the time was veryyoung due to merging markets and communication was not well thought out but loved being a technician for overall company
good,"Management does not have your back. They spend more time creating problems for the workers then making the customer happy. They say "" Saftey first "" but what they mean is Saftey record first. Management ruined the work place !!!"
good,"Crew meeting safety review., visit troubleshoot or install telecom and data services."
good,"I worked for AT&T in both sales and service for a few years, and over my time there things went up and down, but overall as a company I think it was a good place to work.  Lots of locations and plenty of jobs, but really hard to move up to new positions without REALLY making an impression on management."
good,"I worked for Directv first, AT&T then bought Directv. This is when everything changed and everything I loved about the job was taken away. My team leader was always away from her desk and I always had to go to other team leads for everything. My team leader never really worked on development, only would listen to calls then say you did everything right, but lets work on this (something that I aced)."
good,"This is not information that can be disclosed. Everyone will have their own option. "
good,"It's who you know to gets you noticed and promoted  inconsistent with company policy.  Not much opportunity for advancement unless you want sales.   "
good,"Manager very nice.  Office is clicky. You are ignored in conversations.  Too much cross talk and personal conversations.  Too many personal calls; talks loudly, very interruptive..  Annoying banging of metal bracelets when typing all day in a very quiet environment. Input same data every day."
good,"to help customers with cell and phones and bill payments."
good,Working with the company for 16 years I experienced changes from a being a family to a corporation. Years of service and retirement was the game plan.
good,This company only hires contractor.  If you are a contractor hoping to turn full time do not waste your time because it wont happen.  The environment is corporate stiff and bland.  The only concern for the company as whole is its bottom line and there is no room for innovation.
good,"Stressful work environment with little or no positive feedback or encouragement from management. Long days. Need to be available at any time of day or night. Pay and benefits are good, but there is very little work-life balance. Advancement or job movement is almost non-existent for most people."
good,"management only cares about you if your hitting numbers, but you have to lie to customers to hit those unrealistic directv numbers. best thing about ATT are your coworkers"
good,Based on who you know for advancement. Great pay and good benefits. Managers and Directors spend too much time and energy on monitoring calls to use for discipline and not for oppurtunities to evolve reps. Managers are rarely available for reps.
good,"Very ""click"" like environment...advancement depends on who you know and not what you know. Many nice people but have also been exposed to a ""cut-throat"" environment."
good,Work - life balance is poor.  Benefits and pay are great.  You are micromanaged in every facet.   The company is so large that it is cumbersome.  Getting the smallest task accomplished is a tremendous undertaking.
good,"I am not writing a review for this employer. I was surplused so my review will not be good.  "
good,"The pay is average, benefits are pretty good and a nice amount of vacation time. They are trying to improve work life balance at the moment at the same time trying to limit work from home days. Though most people want to stay, it seems like a safe comfortable place to stay as long as you don't get laid off, which there are a lot of layoffs. Promotions are hard if your not in there base of Dallas, and even harder if your outside Dallas or Atlanta."
good,"The support center in Lafayette does not care for their employees - after you pass the probationary period and go onto the support floor, the managers then try to find any and all reasons to write you up and get you fired - not an encouraging work environment."
good,It's  a good job with great benefits and pay. You are provided with excellent Apple Support training and the resources to solve most customer's issues on the first call.
good,"Having the right resources is imperative in an organization that is based on services.  "
good,They provide no assistance when life happens and is out of your control. They find a way to get rid of you. I left because of being discriminated against.
good,You quickly get out of retail. Retail is not a great place for a person with young kids. Especially since we can't schedule our kids sicknesses. Get in retail to see where else to go.
good,dont do it  they just want you to do the minimum and you could potentially get in trouble for going above and beyond.  the required union is terrible.
good,Obviously a huge company. Steady pay raises and great benefits. As a field employee you may not be able to move up unless you're willing to move. Union protection is nice. Local management can vary greatly. One shop may have incredibly hard headed rule with an iron fist style mangers while a shop 15 miles away has more of a relaxed style of management. Relaxed style manager will have great numbers and iron fist will have average numbers. Nobody picks up on that. Surpluses/layoffs can happen quarterly and if you don't have enough tenure you can be bumped out of your position by someone from a position that is being surplused. As a new employee be prepared to not see your family much.
good,"I am working for the call center which is a union controlled job. The company broke contract by turning the job into a sales job without discussing with the union first. They also paid us in incentives which could be changed every month. They added additional hoops to jump through to get paid at all. The company also have taken almost 9 months to negotiate for a new union contract, and have not given one bit. I am looking for an new job due to lack of job security and lack of stable pay."
good,"I help uncover the customers wants and needs, guide them through the interaction and provide the best customer service i can provide."
good,"ATT has good benefits but the stress they put the employees through is rough. Managers show favoritism to certain employees and you can be written up very easily. Employees with health issues whether it be physical or mental stress are treated differently and you have to jump through hoops to get anything approved, you have to constantly be logged but if you are a favorite it doesn't matter."
good,"The pay vs your work is completely unbalanced. All the work you are required to do, the money is not worth it. They have begun to get greedy and not want to pay their employees what they deserve. Also they offer you ZERO sick time. So if you do get sick be prepared to get in trouble if you call out. They also push  you to trick customers. I've had managers try to pressure me in adding in things on customers bills and not tell them. Managers will say ""If you're saving them money then you're not doing your job"". I want no parts of this company."
good,"wrok from 8am to whenever the jobs are clear with an hour break in between. Jobs very stressfull, and you work in all types of weather. You learn how to install and repair uverse services."
good,"not a very fun place to work, not very family oriented, they do pay very well which helps put up with alot of there.......... i worked here for 4.5 years"
good,"Overall this is an OK place to work, but Customer Retention is one of the more high stress positions. On a normal day you were expected to help between 75 to 100 people to try and dissuade them for disconnecting their service. Help was regularly right at hand for support. Benefit wise the pay was terrible and the insurance was not affordable."
good,I've never seen another company give employees the opportunity to move from department to department the way AT&T does -- it's awesome!  But there's an unspoken and contagious culture that just isn't good.
good,"On typical day at AT&T was always a good day. I would learn a lot from customers who would express how they like banking with the bank. Management was great, nothing else to mention. The workplace was great everyone would help each other out. There wasn't a hard day at all. The most enjoyable part was helping all the customers."
good,Working for DirecTV and Sprint helped me understand how to close and sale and communicate with customers. I would recommend any beginner who wants to learn how to sell these companies
good,"Stressful only certain shifts avaliable for tenure people, no longer have monthly bonus for meeting metrics, your schedule never consistent. No-one knows the direction it's going and fail at communication."
good,"Work atmosphere is that of a robot.  No group meetings and rarely any departmental meetings.  Even though you are working with high-tech issues, it is up to you learn how they impact your project."
good,"With AT&T being a communications giant, there is a constant lack of communication between everyone at our office."
good,"responsible for all inbound questions to deal with cell phones and there services, incufinf billing,plan changes and any issues with varios services offered."
good,"As a long time AT&T employee it is disappointing to see what they have become. The employee no longer seems like a main priority, it is all about saving money and cutting costs. From the Store reps to Management it is a frustrating situation. It can be a very rewarding company, just be sure to be on your toes."
good,"long days with minimal support, culture was about P&L bottom line. Hardest part of job was meeting and or exceeding metrics that were not realistic and totally based on opinion."
good,Overall it was an average workplace. It was a knowledgeable position and demands that you stay on top of things. Some locations are friendly and helpful.
good,"money maker, but you have to learn how to talk to customers. a lot of training requirements but the more hands on the better. Attitude will matter a lot in a job like this"
good,Since becoming a sales call center the stress to constantly push products is there.  If you don't sale you don't have a job. Overbearing managers too.
good,"Could use a little work on the management deparment. Very hardcore on the no phone policy (which is good, protecting their customers.) You recieve 2 breaks and 1 lunch. An hour lunch with 2 15 minute breaks,"
good,"I have learned a lot working here, especially in the Supply Chain Organization.  AT&T do a lot for the community. The volunteer program is really good."
good,"You make very awesome pay, but they don't tell you you work nights and weekends for years on end. You will never find this pay for this education level anywhere else."
good,Dedicate your life to work.  Compensation for loss of life is extra vacation time as well as be\\health benefits.  Does well with family emergencies. Family type atmosphere
good,"The company is pretty hard to work for, my job at the company was fairly easy. The management is micromanaged from every level of the company. There is never any real answer to questions"
good,AT&T's training was awesome.We were able to go out of town and train for 4 weeks.I was also able to see first hand how it worked in the store as well. After that I worked long hours. worked on weekends and never had a steady schedule. When a new manager was brought in she fired everyone that did the slightest wrong.
good,"The company started off as something exciting because of the pay. The longer you worked there you can see how greedy the company is.  Managers were surplussed a d demoted 2 times in a year and a half. There was no opportunity for growth. The managers micro manage too much. Even on good months you're reprimanded for not selling enough. They just wanna shove more and more products and services down the customers throats. I liked it at first but for what the company offers, it was no longer worth the retail closing hours."
good,"Att company has excellent benefits, but its a lot of work. I really don't care about for the Policy. You can't miss a day of work. I like the different relaxation room they have setup for the workers."
good,Sitting around taking customer as they come in. help fulfilled all the customer needs and make sure they leave with a happy smile on their face. I enjoy working there because of my co workers.
good,Fast paced environment. Very sales driven and expected to provide the best customer experience possible while offering all of the products and services
good,"Steady work days, happy environment. Management stinks. Enjoyable part of the day is closing. Learned that AT&T isn't all what its hyped up to be. Hardest part is keeping up with promos"
good,"I do not wish to fill this out. I learned that it doesn't matter how hard you work, that it is only about who you know in the company that will get you any type of advancement. There is absolutely no work, life, balance. Its only work work work or quit."
good,"It's been ups and down depends on the Area Manager you have, the company has been going through lots of changes and you will see lots of managers come and go, I've learned a lot from the managers that I've worked with. Most were good."
good,Provides flexible work hours which allows for more of a work-life balance.  Management would benefit by better utilizing their resources.  Level conscious environment.
good,AT&T is a better job than so many low paying jobs out there but the company is getting greedier by the day and management needs to be practical and realistic.
good,"Each day was different. Each day was interesting. Each day provided challenges. A lot of days tested one's patience. Between new technological advances and new company policies to support those advances, things constantly evolved - and sometimes not in a good way. Sometimes the policy was not written well (or clearly), and interpretation as it traveled to the lower levels of management was a problem. Other times the policy was so broad it enabled employees to better support customers in spite of how it was written or meant to be understood."
good,"This was a contract with AT&T and IBM, therefore it was a shared contract. With this said, I couldn't really give you an adequate review of AT&T because of the shared responsibility."
good,"very fast paced. can be stressful. certain depts. pay well, some don't. layoffs are common. also insurance can be better. company products are ok. discounts are ok."
good,"Learned how to make payments over the phone & changes to phone services, learned better multitasking skills, gained diversity knowledge, very great challenges just needing more organization!"
good,Help customers with billing mostly. Upgrade their phones. Up sell the products they do not have.  I learned a lot on how to control the customer that is irriate. Management team is strict if you like that environment.  The hardest part of the job is to up sell home security.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting different customers everyday.
good,"This job has no compassion towards family time or life/work balance.  A typical day exists of troubleshooting issues with customers that get treated like a number and not like a person.  All they care about is efficiency, then try to demand perfection at tech level expectations.  its all about the bottom dollar, and nothing about how well you do your job, and how well you keep the customers happy."
good,"Daily life can be a grind due to spreadsheet mgmt. Sometimes it seems the only focus is a techs numbers not genuinely taking care of customers. Most managers are upbeat and good with their technicians and have an understanding about daily life in the field. "
good,"The pay was low and the job was very demanding."
good,the job was okay. got let go for  reasons beyond my control would go back if i could do so. i hated the drive into work and got burnt out at the end of my tenure due to no advancement opportunities
good,"Not a very good place to work at. No room for advancement, horrible pay raises. Always moved to different managers and there was no room for advancement. Department closed and they hired people while they were letting people go, instead of moving people around. I would not recommend ATT as a place to grow at or retire at. Medical Benefits are horrible. The only good thing about ATT is that if you are a man or know how to do things hire up you will get compensated very well but the benefits are still not that very good."
good,Was there over 5 years. Some work locations are great with great managers... others you hate life and dread going to work every day. Super high stress company so if you can't deal with high stress and policies that frequently change then it's not for you.
good,Met some great fellow emplyess at the job. But the level of organized competence is very low. It's almost a fairly new branch so it's still rebuilding though.
good,"Unstable work environment (always layoffs going on). If you are not in sales do not look for any promotions. Upper management does not get input from lower levels. Mid management encourages you to come up with ideas to make your job easier & then passes them off as their own to upper management. "
good,Same old story that tends to be sadly popular in this day and age.  AT&T formerly SBC Southwestern Bell...used to be a company you could retire from.  I worked there years ago and they were already started to become a company that cared more about sales than customer service.  The Area Manager and Supervisors there were required to meet certain sales numbers.  This made for a stressful environment where you were rewarded based on sales and not for providing good customer service.  If you didn't meet sales numbers that meant you would eventually be fired.  I witnessed lying and fraud of adding DSL and very expensive phones added to peoples accounts without their permission so they could meet sales numbers.  Supervisors even added DSL on accounts fraudulently.  This was all based on pressure from the Area Manager to meet sales goals.  They are very strict on attendance and won't allow you to use time off even if you have it available.
good,Great company to work for.  If you are buddy buddy with the right people you'll go far.  If you want I have a life outside of work it is very difficult.  Upper management has no idea about how to do the job that is expected of sales reps or first line managers
good,Corporate politics at its best.  continued cuts that lead to no job security.  do not work for corporate at&t. COR locations are closing.
good,Can't complain about AT&T.  I am grateful to the company for getting me through the recession. While a lot of people were struggling to find a job mine was secure and I was flourishing.  I worked in a call center and it was extremely high pressure. If you cannot handle stress well this is NOT for you.  I literally have seen people neighbors faint from the stress and be taken out to the hospital.   They put a lot of pressure on you to do your job well.  The pay is great!.  I paid off my home while I was with them and both my cars.  Benefits were good too.  Work life balance is hard.  The needs of the business always supersedes employee's needs.
good,Unethical mangers create high stress environment. Micro managment in the Uverse/Direct tv departmant. Co-workers make this place bearable. Helping customers by fixing their technical problems is the best part of this job.
good,"Ok place to work at, management is the only thing that needs improvement, other that cannot complain. Working in a call center environment is always structured, so you know what to expect."
good,"The atmosphere has changed over the years. Now it's all about sales, sales and more sales. Management is overwhelmed with finding ways to meet and exceed the required daily sales goals while agents are finding ways not to come to work as scheduled."
good,"When I first started, this company seemed like it wanted to take care of the employees that worked to make it great.  Over the past few years, I believe that focus has shifted, and more outsourcing is being used, dropping the level of service the company offers, as well as certain changes in the company recently make it seem like they are still cutting back.  The job security i once found, i now find abundantly absent."
good,"This job is very stressful. You cant go to the bathroom without being worried about meeting their numbers. You have to handle the customer, even the elderly, within a certain time frame, or again you will not meet your numbers. Not being able to meet the numbers is grounds for termination. There is no work-life balance. You can leave the job on ambulance and they will still hold against your attendance. Your job is based off of surveys. The only issues with that is sometimes the customer makes an error (which they will not remove) or the customer is upset about issues beyond your control such as outages. This job was once the best company to work for.  The management team was awesome! For the most part they were always willing to help, since they job was based of your performance. The most enjoyable part of the job was the fundraisers and activities. They would give a small monthly bonus if you were lucky enough to meet your metrics for a month."
good,"I completed my work well and reliably."
good,"Sadly, little chance to move up. Unwilling place to cut one slack when needed. Bidding for hours required having worked many years in order to get a good schedule."
good,When first hired in I had hoped to stay there for a while. With the new change up buying Direct TV and having rounds of firings from managers to techs. Its a clear indicator things are only going to get worse working for att as a premise technician.
good,Job was to work from home and everyday a person receives more then 200 calls and can not be with customer on the phone for long period of time.  Management was ok but barely could get a hold of anyone
good,"I have been in management for 15 years with AT&T. I started out as an agent over the phone in Customer Care. I was then promoted to Lead, Manager then Area Manager. The most enjoyable part of my job is developing my employees to their fullest potential. My day involves running a Technical Center, doing everything from escalations, performing HR duties, to assisting my managers and agents with their needs. I have been with the same company for 18 years. I take pride in working hard and further improving my skills as a leader."
good,While working in customer service I took incoming calls from customers.  The management were not always available for assistance.  I was not always given the proper tools to assist customers.  The most frustrating part was when customers were wanting things that I could not provide.
good,take orders for toner and fax copy machine supplies. take inbound calls to schedule copy and fax repair technicians customer site visits.
good,"AT&T tells people their employees that they care about work life balance, but they don't. They continue to ask individuals to do more with less with no change in compensation."
good,"Taking calls, helping customers with technical issues, de-escalating upset customers, billing, sales, product knowledge, following script, ability to think outside the box and find the best resolution."
good,"Very team based sales environment. Represenatives are taken advantage of with the possibility of advancement. Management is fraudulent and staff has to pick of the pieces. Great place to work, but management is comfortable and lazy. Moving up is hard to impossible."
good,You're just a number to AT&T retail management. Manager's and Leads are just struggling to keep their jobs. There's a reason why AT&T's always hiring at the retail level. I left for the same reasons the FCC fines AT&T.
good,"Check email."
good,Worked with different customers daily learned great customer service skill a lot of micro-management amazing coworkers Working with amazing people. Its a great company to work with if you like to be micro managed.
good,"I would open the store as a Assisnant manger. Perform managerial tasks in absence of managerIn charge of quarterly inventory audits"
good,Would be a great place to work if the leadership in the store did not create such a negative environment and cause conflict with and between employees.
good,Overall job is okay. The hours are long and you really don't have a life outside of work. Management is okay but doesn't engage a lot with employees and don't try to keep team energized
good,"If you do your job than there is no issues, but there is a lot of favortism and there is very little to no advancement unless you are one of there cronies."
good,"Raises every 60-90 days, Bonus Points (Cash), Discounts on services. CWA representation on site. Food Trucks on site for quick lunches."
good,"La empresa tiene un enfoque totalmente comercial lo que provoca que el ambiente laboral tiene a volverse tenso y provocar fricciones entre compañeros. Se otorgan prestaciones de ley, aunque existe una clara diferencia entre las prestyaciones de empleados (Iusacell y Nextel) Los horarios son muy poco flexibles y con jornadas que rebasaban lo establecido por la ley (y obvio sin pago de horas extra) Ademas de que muchas de las capacitaciones son fuera de el horario laboral."
good,"Worked at AT&T for two and half years. Typical work day I follow my calendar and any extras that need to be done by end of day. I've learned a lot working for the company from inventory, merchandising to coaching peers. The management is pretty cool everyone knows each other in the company. I for the most part love my co-workers you get to meet so many different people. The hardest part of the job is scheduling. There is no set schedule which makes balancing your personal life very difficult. Most enjoyable part is the atmosphere at work, we always have fun at work which is hard to come by."
good,"Corporate culture is very positive but those ideals do not filter down to the front line very well because of the the low pay, high turnover and low moral."
good,"Hands down one of the best companies i have worked for over the years, they defiantly compensate you well. Vacation time, 401k the works. I will say this the commission structure changes frequently so making money can be difficult at times. Management changes very often which can be difficult especially when you get used to one managers style of leadership. It is a fast paced industry so get ready for changes weekly. Quotas can also be very demanding but its a  sales position that is expected."
good,"If youre not ready to break your back and sell your soul to get any and all opportunities to sell what you need to, dont work here. You need to be a shark, and not everyone is cut out for that."
good,Day to day operations employees are excellent to work with and are passionate about their jobs.  However management teams are poorly trained and often have no experience in the areas they are supervising.
good,Before the merger of the Bell South and AT&T telecom group...Bellsouth was a great family oriented place to work. After it became AT&T if started to lose it's soul and became very corporate. Meaning the customer service definitely took a back seat. And although AT&T is a big company with great benefits...they are definitely not a Job/Life place to work. Overtime is mandatory and the management is known for being sometimes unqualified and very unprofessional.
good,decent job constantly changing field ran by idiots. Supposedly a team atmosphere and environment but management consistently set team members against eachother. A metrics driven company with unreal expectations
good,"Higher ups decided we would go from Tech Support to supporting all things AT&T: U-Verse; Direct TV; Pre-Paid; Web based services, etc. Train us for 2 weeks then send up back to the phones to take the calls for anything & everything."
good,"With the acquisition of DIRECTV by AT&T, there is a strong feeling of uncertainty within the corporate environment. There is a strong culture clash between the two companies and shake ups in management occur weekly."
good,"Davenport Call Center is in the midst of a political power struggle between their management and an over zealous, discriminatory union leader. The union itself is set for a reason and has a purpose but unfortunately it's leader makes it a priority to make the work environment and culture a negative experience. Their number one goal is to stir up trouble, bully and strike fear into employees. When management doesn't roll over, they get personal and unprofessional attacks causing a hostile work environment. If you stay a rep and keep your head down it's fine. If you chose to better yourself, you may as well paint a huge target on your back."
good,"Worked in this company over 5 year's, renewed contract, however, did not get picked up full time, as other's did. "
good,This is a production environment with a very fast pace and physically demanding environment. Managers watching your every move regardless if they are yours or not.
good,Daily tasks include reviewing personal and business accounts to offer options to grow and maintain customer base. Working side by side with all levels of management to grow and bring a diverse client base to the company.
good,"Answer calls from customers to help with any technical support needs. "
good,"I've learned how to work with diverse groups of people and complicated sales systems. Some transactions really allow you as a consultant to provide value based solutions to customers. SOMETIMES."
good,"- day usually busy"
good,It was difficult at first to get the flow of everything. and this is where most people quit. however once you get past that bit it is very easy day to day work. and easy to get even better. the only issue is that you will likely never find advancement regardless of your performance. only if you are a favorite or a friend prior to joining of someone who is in a position to promote. and the leadership has only been declining over the last few years. its a great place to get skills. but is a leading no where kind of job.
good,At&t is an ever changing business when it comes to products and structure. There's always something new to learn and the technology that comes and goes is exciting to see and provide to the public. It's a great place to learn to sell a service according to the needs of the consumer. There are many dynamics with each individual you encounter and it keeps your mind thinking of new problems to solve while maximizing on personal and/or location goals.
good,"ATT is a good place to work if you like low pay and long hours managment has no clue what they are doing"
good,"*Install and repair U-verse services"
good,"Lost Food & Beveridge Director, Sales & Marketing Director and all Outlet Management except me in a three month period after a odd on-boarding process."
good,"Worked in a retention call center for uverse, "
good,"My experience was not very good; the training was thorough if you ae familiar with their products and services. The work environment can be hostile depending on the manager you're assigned to, the bathrooms are horrific at times. The change of shifts are not stable, and you may be required to change your desk and cubicles at times. Overall, if you are use to this type of thing, then you should have no problem. The pay is decent and the benefits are not bad, but they could be better. Some floor managers will often disappear, and cannot be found when you need them."
good,Great peers around you that would make your time go by quickly. Best part was to be with them and have a great working place.
good,"Great Company when it was Directv, Not quite so good now as AT&T."
good,Work culture is good. Great work/life balance. But career growth is very slow. Promotions happen very rarely. requires region head in India as all policies are US centric.
good,"Directv is a solid company. But if you take your job seriously and you are a performer statistically, this is not the place for you."
good,Not a good company if you are an older worker. The corporate culture is cut-throat and not employee-friendly. I would not recommend working there to anyone unless they do not care about staying the course.
good,"Working there was a fight to keep the job. Management had many issues with lower leveled workers. Most co-workers on the same level, was fairly friendly, but when it came to supervisors, seniors, and Team Leads; there was a lack of consistency. The hardest part of the job was trying to maintain the job. Due to the fact management was always looking to fire people based off of personal issue, rather than business. Too many workers in the job was either falsely excused, or fired due to outside personal issues. The job was not completely horrible due to the few peers who are consistent and trying to help the company."
good,AT&T will give you great benefits and compensation however what you'll give up for that is another story. If your looking to have to work basically all the time and it never be good enough this is the job for you.
good,"Lots of Layoffs within a year or two. lots of fear of job loss"
good,"There are benefits to working in the operations sections.  It does bring to light the how and why a telecom company operates.  This is a very procedural positions and advance out of the Technician role can be difficult.  "
good,The pay is what will keep you there not the company appreciation for you or what you do.  Nothing is secure with at&t and there were no opportunities for advancement.
good,"It's an exhausting job.  The hours sometimes get long. The schedule for new techs is terrible and will be a long time until you can get a decent pick.  The starting wages are also low but will get better over time.  There will always be a bunch of techs not wanting to work and will sit on jobs.  Unfortunately, this affects the ones who do work hard and so we are all treated like children for it.  They have added so much to the list of job duties that it seems like there is no end to it.  Time and quality expectations can sometimes feel unreasonable"
good,The company was better to work for before the buyout. The quality of the company changed immensely.  The pro of the company was very good benefits
good,"Sales training from 8 until 11, interviews from 11 to 1, and actual sales from 1-8. Although the pay and the ability for upward movement turned out to be misleading, I learned more in a year at this company than I did in years of school. I learned what hard work truly looks like and also learned techniques that have improved my ability to interact and connect with others. The hardest part of the job was the unpredictability of the income (because the sale relied on many factors that were based off of the public). The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely the atmosphere. I loved everyone I worked with, we seemed to all have very similar traits considering we all performed well within the sales program."
good,"I have been in sales for many years now, and all of it has been in electronics, with a focus in mobile devices. Coming to At&t I thought would be refreshing and invigorating. It was a great place to work in the beginning and the pay was not bad. I quickly figured out that the only way to have any work life balance was to have high seniority; and in my particular store that was just about impossible. Being low seniority requires you to work all nights and weekends, and that is not easy to do when you have a family and children to take care of."
good,With ATT acquiring DirecTV there was a lack of management. Hard to get direction and work effectively. Compensation promises broken and benefit packages reduced.
good,"Plainly, ATT sells tablets, cell service, direct, UVerse, wireless home phone and digital life oh yeah accessories. Management simply measures every interaction based on how well you sold all of these products. Every time, every customer. Someone comes in to pay a bill at the kiosk, they better have bean demoed digital life home Security!  Get the picture? Everyday there is formal documentation on nearly every word you say. The manager assumes the context of every word you say and documents it formally. Basically you need to offer everything every time. That includes demonstrations of the products. The pay is darn good though. Not enough to keep me though. After 5 years in a highly scrutinized and oppressive environment I walked out and absolutely have not regretted it. The people, the managers and the company as a whole doesn't want you to consider the customer, just push a lot on them! If you are a used car salesman this is your gig!"
good,"I transfered to another market and I lost faith in the company, the markets are different and what you may get use to in one market there will be changes in another."
good,"A typical day starts with arriving at the shop to pick up your van (unless you take your van), you pick up your equipment if you ordered any and proceed to your first job site. I learned that being a satellite installation technician is not for everyone, the job is very demanding and strenuous not to mention you have to battle the elements and environment around you on a daily basis, some of the co-workers are pretty friendly, reliable and dependable with the exception of a few others, the hardest part of the job was trying to explain to a customer as to why I could put a dish and that customer becoming irate, the most enjoyable part was getting off work."
good,I have developed a great skill in Sales management thanks to the training and development given by AT&T. The day to day activities included overseen the daily goal and closing gaps when needed.
good,Good place to start your customer service experience. Laid back environment. Management always available and willing to assist you.
good,lame job with little pay for a lot of work.  was promised i would make good money but that was a lie. i actually lost money each week i worked there because of the commute.
good,I received my MBA in IT but there was no room for upward promotions.  I want to broaden my IT background and move upward.  The company is more into group movemnet and not individual movement
good,"I've been working as a Uverse Field Technician for almost 4 years. The management style is that of fear and intimidation. They are constantly threatening discipline for not meeting unreasonable metrics. There is no such thing as a work/ home balance. Work days start at 8am, sometimes 7:30, and although the schedule says 5pm you will never be off then. Winter months you get off around 4-6pm. Summer months you get off between 8-11pm. 5-6 days a week. Only One Saturday a month off. This company has set appointment windows of 5-8pm so that tells you how much the expect you to be off at 5. It is full time work with very good benefits. Health, dental, vision, retirement etc are all very reasonable costs. These wages and benefits are bargained by the Communications Workers of America Union so that has a lot to do with the cost. There is much better jobs and employers out there. Ones that appreciate the front line employees. My job is designed to hire fresh out of high school, teens or early 20 year old with no spouse or kids. You make more money than you can spend in summer months and starve in winter months. The CEO is a member of a prestigious, nationally known private golf course. He comes to town one weekend a month and goes out of his way to avoid his employees."
good,Good company fun ppl made great connections with ppl there who are very hardworking and are an assets to the company. Sorry I don't know what else more to say.
good,"cubrimiento de rutas"
good,Great working environment with colleagues that are very supportive and helpful. Hardest part of the job is not being able to help your customers solve their internet connection problems while the most enjoyable part is being able to interact with different kinds of people and learning from them.
good,fun and friendly place to work  very nice  get to meet different people at all time nice place to work. Go if you want to be in the sales field
good,this company gives great benefits but may not be the most flexible for someone with medical needs or family issues. Very great pay.
good,"Training was 5 months monday - friday 8-5pm sitting in a room listening to someone talk and following along on a computer. Easiest $25 an hour I have ever made in my life."
good,"I felt it initially had solid potential of being a great place to work, but it changed as time went on. I witnessed a decline in employee morale over my eight years of working there and it was sad to see hundreds of truly gifted team members leave to go elsewhere.  "
good,"The company pays very well, but there seems to be little advancement despite being such a large company.  If you start in the union you are probably going to stay there.  Everything is getting outsourced too, which is scary."
good,Challenging job that required a lot of overtime hours. at least 50 hours a week. I learned a valuable trade that I can use in my future.
good,"Management is constantly shifting and lay offs occur every 4-6 months. Management is vague to their requirements and won't communicate with contract employees. There is ageism running rampant and older experienced workers are replaced with younger, cheaper labor."
good,"Fun workplace,lot of learning opportunities, challenging work environment. Friendly people and client. flexible hours and work from home facility."
good,Technical resources where professional and adhered to project direction - Management direction was chaotic and not professional.
good,"a typical day started with management telling us what the goals were for the day. after a little bit of harassment, and belittling, we started the day. high stress, being told to sell products in a borderline deceiving manor, having to give a 2 month notice on any days you need to take off, sick days get you written up even though they give you days to ""use"", upper management is clueless on how to run a retail environment, co workers were great but morale was completely gone."
good,great compensation and benefits once you pass a certain amount of months and probationary periods. Very unprepared store manager with no ambition to develop a strong team or prepare employees for advancement.
good,I learned a lot in the 13 1/2 years working there. I loved the managers that encouraged growth and willing to teach you how to accomplish it.
good,"Typical day consists of incident response, change management, troubleshooting, configuration, documentation, and phone handline/escalations."
good,"Initially with the Real AT&T ,before bought by sbc ,now the new at&t ,I couldn't wait to get to work to help the customers and see my peers.once the ""merger "" took effect it all went downhill with very poor training, unrealistic goals to up-sell to the poorest of customers that wanted to get a cheaper rate . The center was turned into a RETENTION center .Some reps were caught doing bad stuff , cramming ,use other info to classify a customer , having to track your sales . Unattainable sales or retention numbers ,example a team of 15 could only cancel a total of 5 customers per day , before lunch it was easy for 1 single rep to have 5 cancellations per moves to non at&t territories ,other company already was providing service ,etc,etc . The new at&t was , is oblivious to customers or employees needs ."
good,"Union contract provides good benefits, but the company demands are unreasonable, and keep employees from spending much desired time with family."
good,"there are multiple metrics which need to be hit and hitting 100% is never a good job. Expect 125% to be the minimum."
good,I rather keep my opinion to myself. The pay is great and it is a very competitive market. Commissions are worth the pain. thanks
good,"Corporate culture is one of outsourcing jobs.  "
good,"open case close case"
good,"A typical day includes conference calls, training, motivating, inspiring to high performance, hosting daily sales huddles, managing sales operations and inventory, driving results, and building a strong team environment. "
good,"Typically handle basic troubleshooting, share new products and share the value of the products. Learned how to work hands on with customers. Management was okay. Loved the relationship with my co-workers. Most challenging part of the job was trying to assist upset customers. Most enjoyable was learning new techniques and meeting new people."
good,Working at At&t- My Wireless has been a great time experience for me. Its a very knowledgeable work environment that provides a steady work schedule that balances out with all employees. Co- workers at all locations are fun and enthusiastic about selling but management there can be a little unorganized. Working for At&t-My Wireless has been a wonderful experience but its time to advance with my career.
good,I get up in the morning with a route on my hand held if i need equipment i got to the ware house earlier in the day  around 6 or 7am to pick up an order i placed the day before then i go to several jobs through the day installing and repair Satellite TV and Life Shield Security Systems.
good,"A day in the life at AT&T. "
good,Working for this company was a blast. I was able to learn about the technology on the phones that were about to be released as well as greet customers.
good,"Benefits were good.  No sick days available.  Company controls its employees using the fear tactic.  Constantly reminded by management of the amount of money made per hour and that it could all be gone."
good,I worked for Pace under AT&T U-Verse for 6 months and while i was there no one would help you i would come across situations that not even higher teir agents had expeirnced and when you would need help from a supervisor you would not be able to find anyone or if you asked for help the supervisors would get upset because they didnt want to do anything or answer your question with etreme attitude.
good,I feel as though this was a great job. At time it became hard with so much pressure. I would love to work here again just not up un the same contractor.
good,Day started at 6am and I would be on the phone until midnight every night. Compensation was good but did not offset the work environment.
good,"This job is simple, you greet the customer ask what they're visiting for and help them based on this response. The worst part of this job are the customers who come in yelling at me for bills that are super high. Their bills are high because they haven't put any payments in them for a couple months and then blames you for it anyways. Don't get me started on the most negative district manager in the world. He never gave our store positive remarks just negative ones. That definitely doesn't make me wanna come back in the morning. Obviously all stores have different types of people; I wasn't blessed with the good managers. I loved the people i work with though and they all quit due to bad management."
good,"It is a good company to learn, but they do not support career growth. They often do re-organizations and left behind peoples as Individual Contributors."
good,"As my one and only work at home experience, this was a solid if somewhat difficult position. While my coworkers were friendly and my trainers we really good, the supervisor I had left something to be desired and any time there was a technical issue, it was my fault, or my computer's fault, despite my computer qualifying every single one of their inital tests."
good,pay and benefits ok  you will never see your family  if you are planning to go to school do not take this job  the hours are long everyday
good,"Sales can be stressful anyplace that you go, but in the account management center, it's not just sales that an employee is responsible for. Between billing issues, escalations, customer situations, and irate customers, the time spent on selling and truly hitting the required quota is combated against on a daily basis. There is no typical work day, and scheduling out of the day is not useful seeing as to how the day will change each and every moment. It's enjoyable to assist customers and solve their issues, but stressful when you are not compensated for as much work as you do, and the quota continually rises abruptly at any moment. The hardest part of the position is the fact that your work and the completion of your work solely depends on others doing their part to complete your work."
good,"The wireless industry has changed, so there isn't as much money to be made compared to say, a decade ago. AT&T is a good company with a good product, but there are some issues that can be extremely grating."
good,My experience working at Convergys/Directv was fair. I enjoyed the training before you actually start working on the sales floor. Management wasn't the best only because the wasn't much order. About every manager didn't like how another manager done something which caused confusing on what should actually be done
good,"since I worked 3rd party call center not once but twice for two different companies I have a good idea of how ATT treats them, they pit them against each other and in tech support side you can fix some problems but when you use the tools provided you end up making a case that will never get done, or rejected. This will give you a since of no job satisfaction. also on the call center side the need to use tools over save the customers time and fix the problem has become an issue, granted some of the tools are useful others no so much and since you are a call center oldest computers you can use so even slower. last no one ever calls tech happy most of the can be pleasant but after a few cases and how much the phone bill is every month some can be very rude. YOU WILL BE CALLED NAMES. this is not a bad issue but after so long it will start to break you down."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job to me was training new employees.  I knew the company inside and out.  I helped teach three incoming teams and knew they had learned from the best, so they would in turn do the right thing and do their best."
good,"At At&t I enjoyed a flexible work schedule, a decent culture and good coworkers.  The company is not terribly responsive to feedback and I was not compensated well."
good,"This was back when the .Com boom was going, the company was also a victim of the boom bust.  DirecTV had decided to get into the internet service provider business by buying a small DSL provider that was already established and aggressively growing it.  The setup was too confusing to be successful.  "
good,Customers would call with billing issues.Many were very rude and upset and yelled. Management was unhelpful. Work days were long and stressful.
good,A typical day at work consisted of me taking inbound calls from customers that called in more then 5 times within a week. Mind you the customers 90% of the time were Irate so after a while it gets stressful when evrey caller is screaming at you to fix their services. I'd say the most enjoyable thing about the job was probably the fact that i can do some interesting things with the tools they offered us to fix the services.
good,"The normal day as an agent for AT&T consisted of making 80-110 outbound sales calls to California business for AT&T. We sold a variety of items from telephone access lines, local and long distance calling, high speed internet, web hosting, tech support, and cell phones to meet business needs."
good,Stricktly a sales job even though unsuspecting customers believe they are calling for customer service. It's either sell or you're gone.
good,"My work day was similar every day, yet differed from day to day. Managing the attendance and leaves for a call center group of 350+ seats kept me extremely busy from the moment I entered my office to the minute I walked out of my office. That is where similarities ended in day to day ended. The differences were in that each day brought new high level attendance cases and high risk matters that needed to be addressed and resolved. Each day brougth a different set of individuals that impacted my day in some form or another."
good,"Very political environment. No upward mobility if you have no sponsor. Overkill on rules and regulations. If something bad happens 1 time in 100 years, everyone has to be aware of it right away and add 17 layers of extra work so there is no way it could remotely happen again."
good,"la verdad q la mala administración y el discurso del dueño de la empresa fueron razón suficiente para q me aleje de la empresa, sin embargo pude adquirir conocimiento tecnico importantes para crecer a nivel laboral."
good,"AT&T is a great place to work.  Throughout 17-years I was able to gain experience in:  Emerging Enterprise Operations, Web Analytics, Network Finance, National Distribution, Internet Services, Marketing and Accounting."
good,"I enjoyed the job. "
good,"DIRECTV is stressful workplace with high pressure. Job security is low. Leadership and co-workers are friendly, nice, and great to work with."
good,Management micro manages. Things change daily and not for the better of the employees.  Benefits are great if you can handle the rest of the job.
good,Management out of the RLDP are robots and ill informed. AT&T should focus on promoting from within. My team was enjoyable but everything else definitely was not what it was hyped up to be.
good,"AT&T is a great company to work for. The pay is pretty good but the hours are long. You won't have a great work life balance. It's been a great job, but its not a career."
good,"AT&T is a good company to work for if you don't mind a bad work/life balance. As a father with two children I felt that this company did not care about it's employees lives outside of work."
good,"I've learned allot throughout my work years. Mature is a key word that I""m happy I've became. I'm still  & have allot of learning to do as well. Still in need of a job were i can grow experience at & grow with that company."
good,"What could be better than getting paid $70k a year to sell iPhones to walk in customers?! "
good,"The Fayetteville call center attracts a lot of employees due to the fact that there are not a lot of qualifications needed in order to obtain employment and the pay is better than the average job for this area. Turnover is extremely high though"
good,Rating 2 out of 5 stars... all emphasis is on sales only!! Total sales driven environment regardless of what you hear.
good,The pay is the best part of the job. Company does not reallly provide a work/ life balance.
good,"took calls 7 hours / day. Scheduling flexibility left some things to be desired.  Otherwise, the job was fine.  Management was somewhat culturually biased / even disorganized and 'cliquey.'  Otherwise it was a fine job."
good,"I have learned the importance of customer care and have developed better skills in customer service. The work place is not the best, but it was definitely an experience. Management could be better, there are so many workers it is hard to keep up. The most enjoyable part of my job is the coworkers, they make the job fun and it is great to meet new people. Hardest part of the job is having to sit for so many hours out of the day, you can get restless. Overall it is an ok place to get customer service experience."
good,"most of the time you are getting the short end of the stick, unless you have time in the company you wont advance. numbers are hard to make a day due to horrible coordination with sales reps and facilities that dont work. company is just greedy and doesnt care about customers only surveys that lie and say we care about the customers."
good,"good to work for short term"
good,"A typical day at AT&T was filled with conference calls with project team members (on and off-shore). I learned how absolutely vital it is to deliver projects with desired quality on time, and within budget in the hightly competitive consumer telecommunications arena."
good,"Fun environment, you meet many people. Work rewarding and difficult. Lots of responsibilities and heavy micro-management."
good,"Pros:"
good,Customer service call center. I've learned the value of a customer within a call center environment.
good,It's an okay company to work for. Very difficult people. Race does play a factory in ones job ability
good,Very strange management style at company.Most of employees WFH on most of the week. Hard to keep in contact with needed contacts from departments.
good,"AT&T Wireless was a good place to work, but at that point in my life my family had to come first. Mr wife is active duty, and we had 3 young kids, that needed at least on of their parents on duty full time. AT&T's work model was on a narrow rotating shift, that made it difficult to manage a good work/life balance. I did however learn quite a bit about wireless and wire-line sales and service. Management was ""Ok"", but solid and well trained to get the most out of the sales and service staff. My overall experience with AT&T mobility was both productive, and increased my telecom skill-set."
good,"Good money. "
good,It was nice starting out but there was definitely not enough training for real life experiences in the job.  The trainers need to take calls before teaching a class.
good,AT&T  probably is a great company to work for outside of the department I was employed with.
good,Young sales staff with an elementary and punitive management style.
good,A typical day would be greeting customers and maintain the cue. I learned about ATT products and service as well as policies and procedures for accounts. Co-workers were very political and often took sides. The hardest part was standing all day. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning about the products and services.
good,Mgnt needs work to be more professional with the way they speak and treat their employees.
good,"Accepting phone calls asking for help with internet services.  Some needed help getting started, connecting with modem for the first time, or setting up email at Att.net.  Another reason for calling was interrupted service or slow service.  These calls I would trouble shoot thru the ADSL system or make appointments for repair teams.  Often I would walk callers through home networking, giving information with a large catalog of computer information"
good,Working for AT&T has been a very difficult challenge and repetitive.
good,Beautiful place to work.  High stress on sales.  Would let people go after years if their sales slacked.  Didn't feel stable.
good,"my typical day would be to get in sign in my phone and begin taking calls for the whole 8 hours. I have learned how to go in to different systems  at once  and correct accounts , credit accounts,  adjust minutes on cell phone plans,  make sales on new accounts and  old accounts. management  was nice . most co workers were nice and easy to get along with. hardest part of the job was trying to juggle  my life as a mother of 6 kids and high demand of the call center  at that time .  the most enjoyable  part of the job was to make each customer fill like I just gave them a million dollars  and to know they were happy, and also the pay."
good,"Report to work in timely manner, 15 - 20 calls a day with disgruntled and happy customers."
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in logging in and then helping AT&T customers with their issues. But it never got old. It never felt like I was doing the same thing everyday. Taking chats was awesome. I loved it. "
good,"So typical "
good,A typical day at work  would be a morning staff meeting and then heading out in the field where I am assigned a repair or installation assignments. I spend my day problem solving and trouble shooting to provide our customers with the best AT&T U-Verse service possible. Management is at our back and call if a situation arises that you need another opinion or suggestion.  Co-workers are also just a phone call away in case we are short or missing equipment in order to complete assignments. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with constant change in technology as well as the high demand for service. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and being able to travel for the company to other locations sometimes out of state.
good,Wasn't there very long.  I would give them a C Grade overall.  Seemed to be a lot of people coming and going...  not much job security.  management team was not that impressive.. average at best.
good,"AT&T was a great company, the employees were the most dedicated and always willing to help.  I loved dealing with the customers especially when they felt like their needs were not being meet from previous telecom companies."
good,Provided outstanding customer service and sold various products. Strict company
good,"Overall this is a solid company with big demands from the public and investors due to the name on the outside of the building. They have gone through a lot of changes trying to adapt to the new era of technology and still have a long ways to go. The biggest hurdle to their future is getting past their reliance on legacy telecom services with outdated billing systems and support in order to be nimble enough to take advantage of new opportunities in the marketplace."
good,it's what you make it.  You can be really successful or go no where dependent on your attitude
good,"AT&T isn't going ANYWHERE so if you are looking for job stability, they maybe a good fit.  They are notorious for underpaying their staff."
good,Directv With Teleperformance is a good starting job into the call center industry
good,"As a Prem Tech day would usually start with your manager reading a hot topic for the day and telling you to be safe."
good,Ambiente laboral ameno y entretenido.- Sin horarios fijos y ventas a comisión.-
good,"Very stressful workplace, but great pay. There was mandatory overtime each week, resulting in 10+ hours per day. Worked for the company almost 5 years and never was able to change shift hours. "
good,Tough expectations with constant fire drills. Many conference calls which pulls managers off their floors too often.
good,Typical day at work involves solving customers issues and to recommend additional services.
good,"* working different hours, retrieving hours that may not be available at times"
good,"Typically, you make it to work at 7am and leave the work yard about a quarter to 8am.  You grab your laptop to get information on your first job.  Contact my customer and pretest before arrival.  Determine whether the problem is inside the customer home or on the AT&T network.  Take steps to repair the problem and inform the customer that the repair is completed.  Verify customer satisfaction with their service and my work/effort.  Go to the next customer...  and repeat the process.  Skills include using high-grade test equipment, plat reading, computer software installation, troubleshooting and identifying some network issues and points of origination."
good,"AT&T was my first experience working in a corporate environment. It left me with many skills and learning the politics involved. AT&T overall provides several tools to train and groom their employees. With any corporation there are several changes that can take place and you have to roll with the punches. There are several opportunities for networking and ability to learn several different aspects of the company. "
good,"A typical day at work would be loading my van with all the supplies I will need threw out the day. The going to customers house to install their services, but before leaving the customers house I make sure they are very satisfied with my customer service to them. "
good,"when from entry level sales person to assistant manager"
good,If you can handle the call center world and deliver scripted calls for 8 hours a day plus overtime then it is for you.
good,This job taught me to me think quick on my feet and be a problem solver I had to teach myself how to do pretty much everything. I learned the computer system on my own and has to be self motivated.
good,"The pay used to be desirable. Under previous companies the benefits were much better than they are now. They have systematically dismantled any progress made with individual or family health insurance, but they continue to provide fair wages with unionized raises, and great 401k retirement options."
good,"the best part of working for this company was,the insurance benefits and the salary,as well as the co-workers.the down side was the attendance policy did not allow for sick days and computer systems often froze."
good,"-co-workers were like family"
good,"Opportunity for growth, sales cycle through channels effective. Compensation good and benefits."
good,"team  work "
good,Daily sales routine. Meet people and sell. Management lacks ability to design plan to advance reps.
good,"AT&T is a great place to learn about the corporate world and it ins and outs. AT&T taught me how to achieve my sales goals while being a team player. "
good,"Home and business installation of multimedia in non Union environment"
good,The company was a great place to work until the last 2 yrs when SBC purchased AT&T and was wanting to reduce staff
good,It was exciting to go out and meet with people and be able to go over our products with them in detail to find which works best for them. It was definitely a challenge to earn the trust of others enough to invite you in and allow you to speak with them.
good,If you are a great sales person then the retail sales environment is a great place for you. The hourly pay is mediocre but commission is where the money is. Management is the biggest issue. They ride you extremely hard and quotas can be unattainable at times. Co workers are great overall.
good,"If this is it for you and you don't want a life besides work choose AT&T. They have good benefits. Horrible management. You'll have no time for your children once you get off because you are worked 10+ hours daily. They track your every move. Theres no way to chase your dream and have this job. Your quality of life will definitely improve though. This job is for people Ages 25 and up, If your young won't won't be as focused or do as well."
good,The CEO has prioritized employee engagement.    The frequent employee surveys indicate improving results.
good,But those years were cut short because upper leadership in Virginia does not listen to their employees and has become extremely politically driven.
good,Rules are created to be broken in this job. Goals are set which are unattainable.
good,"Hunting and farming existing accounts for new business"
good,The job I did for AT&T as a premise technician was a decent job with okay pay. It required a lot of hours and the ability to work independently out in the field. I liked my job but as a veteran using the GI bill i did not have time to attend my college classes with the heavy work load. I had several management changes to my first line in the little time that I worked with AT&T that created inconsistencies and altered my ability to make it to my classes on time or at all.
good,This was a stepping stone to larger areas of the wireless industry.
good,"I didn't like the company's strategy. Overall, it is a good company to work for if you are a single person with no private life."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of taking payments, disconnecting fraudulent or delinquent accounts, and bill education.  I learned how to explan a billing statement thoroughly. Our team was pretty tight knit like a family.  The hardest part of the job was sittling in one place for an 8 hour shift.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the challeng of getting as many payments as possible."
good,"Assisting customers in a retail environment"
good,Coached/advised employee about requirements and addresses any non adherence issues.
good,The management at ATT needed to be more compassionate for the customers and not focus so much on the employees. The hardest part of the job was the evaluation and the score was always low when I know I provided quality service to the customer. I have learned the difference in management.
good,It is a great company. For some people it could be a career or a great stepping stone.
good,"When it was time for you to start work you clocked in and the timer begin. Form that time forward you told the timer when you went to the bathroom, went to break, went to lunch, you clocked everything and they knew how long you used in the rest room. You got 2 breaks and a 30 minute lunch.   I learned a lot working there.  Management was the worst I have ever worked with. They didn't care about anyone accept there selfs. I loved the people I worked with and still keep in contact with them. The company did pay very good.  But money isn't everything.  When I left I didn't have to take my stomach meds any longer."
good,"The money will keep you there. I worked open to close and sometimes without a lunch or break, even when I was pregnant."
good,Company has a lot of top professionals working with you to make the sales.But the traveling is a bit much and the benefits are not as good as you would like them to be
good,"Temporary job until become full time, but didnt recieve full time because they had already stop hiring by the time I applied for full time."
good,"Great company to work for! Sales, Customer Service, troubleshooting customer problems, account management and inventory management"
good,"Here is where my HR experience began. HR Director provided me with hands on experience in several HR areas. Enjoyed working there, as it had an on-site daycare."
good,Constant changes in goals and in policies without communication of changes.
good,"co-workers were great! no complaints about them. "
good,"a typical day with AT&T involved going into peoples homes and no matter what the condition of the home, we were required to complete our job.  With AT&T you are required to work until all the jobs in the queue are completed which means 10-14 hour days everyday coupled with the fact that you hardly ever receive two days off in a row.  Having any kind of life out side of AT&T is next to impossible."
good,Overall the other associates were very pleasant to work with.  Management and store owners did not support teamwork but would talk about using teamwork to close sales.  It was a very competative sales environment reminiscent of a car dealership from a century ago.  Also the management routinely supported the idea of telling a customer anything just to make the sale.  example being lying to customers to fluff up a low quality item that sells for a higher profit.
good,I left because the bureaucracy had gotten so bad that mangers were required to micromanage
good,This was and excellent place to work till SBC took over .The management is not respectfull the the Techs. They need better polocies and people managing.
good,"To many cons, not enough pros. Go in every day I work at the same time. Get off when they ""release"" me. The favorite saying in late afternoon for the managers is ""AM techs, you know the drill, keep dispatching"""
good,"Check live display devices on sales floor. Greet customers and assist in the sales process. count inventory and file daily sales reports. "
good,"management will never help on tough situations "
good,Assist customers with their internet needs reather it be conectivity new orders or email.
good,have been there for some time they tend to not care so much for u
good,"The benefits are good and the pay is good, but the management and ethics leaves something to be desired. "
good,"A good place to work and learn daily."
good,"A great place to work if you like sitting behind a monitor for 8 to 12 hours a day and constantly talking on over phone. You can expect to attend to anywhere from 80 to 200 calls per day."
good,"The store ive been at is Great my manager my coworkers. As a whole AT&T is not a bad company. I feel as though im ready to move on to more advancement in my career. I dont think they are willing to allow me to do that, know matter my ability. Good benefits, Good compensation."
good,"The job itself was easy, but at times could be taxing emotionally.  If you were looking for great pay and benefits, then this is the job for you.  If you want to have life, work and family balance, then there is absolutely no way to work at AT&T Relay."
good,"This company is all about sales.  I worked in an extremely slow store and the sales quota was almost impossible to reach.  It didn't matter if you were in a busy store or slow store, your expected to sell.  If you are written up for not meeting quota, then you will be written up for being in the bottom 10% of sales reps.  Also had a lot of drama between coworkers.  If you need a decent paycheck to pay off some bills great, if your looking for a career go to another part of AT&T.  Just stay away from the sales area."
good,"AT&T wireless is retail so the hours of operations are Monday-Sunday, 40 hour weeks. Atypical day there was meeting a greeting customers as soon as they walked in, built rapport to find out what they are looking for in a phone and selling the phone that best fits their needs. I have learned to provide excellent customer service, have improved as a sales Rep and became a better leader where my employees followed me. Management can improve there because most of the managers there know how to manage but not lead and the company's focus is to built better leaders by providing courses, which is mandatory to complete. The hardest part was to reach monthly goals but at the same time the Most enjoyable part was over delivering monthly goals and being recognized by the VP of the LA Market and all the other District managers.     "
good,"not a horrible place to work, but not a great one either. for a college student with  no kids that doesnt  need a ton of money to survive it probably works out, for a single mother who needs to work daycare or school hours and is trying to support a family on one income not going to work out. the closest schedule i found to what i need is 8-40 friday-tuesday. Monday-Friday doesnt exist for csr's in this call center. Pay-if you work a flex shift or a late shift is ok, working a day shift, pay is just not what it should be, this is a very stressful job, the company asks a lot of their employees the pay should be much more competitive. I know other call centers in the area pay significantly more."
good,"No review needed, I just disliked my job... The only thing that appealed to me was the pay and the benefits. Everything else about it was a terrible experience."
good,Good place to work if you work for the right manager. Some are in it for themself and some truly care about your success. You need to be cut throat in order to survive. Pay is average and no negoations are allowed with salary. 
good,the company would send everybody 2 hours out of their way instead of putting them in there respective counties and you would never know where you would be going until the morning of making you guess what you would need for the next day.
good,At&t is a great place to work if you have very thick skin. You have the pleasure of working with great people in a fast place environment. The hardest part of the job at least for me was sales since I didn't get hired for sale it was a rude awaking only after about a year my s\center became sales.
good,"Managed the entire service order life cycle by analyzing fallout within all fiber optic cable lines, internet connections and telephone systems. Effectively met and exceeded goals of 17 – 20 fallouts per day."
good,Monitoring CS agents and responding to Customer complaints.
good,Co workers were great and worked together. Management looked at everything in black and white without considering the human factor when dealing with customers. Most managers did not support their representatives
good,"AT&T is a great place to work if, and only if, you have been within the system for a while or if as a new hire off the street, you have a manager who is welling and able to mentor and help you to grow. There is very little training for new hires off the streets and you are basicly thrown in and you have to ""sink or swim"". On the bright side, if in managemnt, I had a great team of employees who had years of exoerience and were diverse and extremely helpful in teaching me the AT&T lingo and culture."
good,"doesn't pay enough for all the hours. never no overtime, unfair on pay, you stand 48hours a week and you don't get paid for it"
good,"uin dia tipico es mucho trabajo, la gerencia lleva mucho descontrol no es organizada."
good,"AT&T was a good place to work as far as the pay and benefits, but the work environment left a lot to be desired. They didn't treat their employees with a lot of respect and I always tried to have a friendly relationship with my co-workers, but I didnt get a real sense of a team, I didnt really enjoy that aspect of the job. I did learn a lot of valuable skills and enjoyed working with a wide array of individual customers, and it always made me feel good to make someones day and assist them with any issues that would arise and have a smile on their face by the time our encounter was done."
good,"This job was nice, especially since you are working for one of the top cellular companies. Not many complaints, thankfully. Pay was alright, nothing too special and the hours were decent. Always secured 40 hours."
good,"Buenisimo el compañerismo,el ambiente de trabajo,la manera de trabajar.La escala de comisiones buenisima."
good,"Always interesting work,need a TS/SCI clearance to work on site."
good,Typical day of work was to field phone calls and train Technical Support Agents to solve the technical issue and provide attentive customer service.
good,Took job at the daily record when it was offered to me. The policies make it hard to maintain employment
good,"It's a good job for salary bout the cliche hierarchal corporate mentality reigns. The company has gone down hill as an employer over the past 5 years as many others have. Every year the commission structures are changed. Every year a great deal of effort is given to showing the sales team how the changes are so very beneficial to them. Every year the sales team works harder for less overall commission. This is sadly not a trait AT&T holds a monopoly on. Nevertheless, this is a very difficult company to work for long term."
good,I assisted customer with technical issues with the internet service. We worked 9 hour schedules with a hour for lunch and two 15 minute breaks. Management set restriction on call but did not have much experience in the taking calls themselves. Hard for them to relate to your concerns with calls. I enjoyed helping customers.
good,"part sales, part customer service, part tech........"
good,At first it was a pleasure then new mgmt came in and made it a nightmare
good,The hardest part of the job is being on the phone with incoming calls.
good,"answer phones, assist customers with troubleshooting phones, bills, and any other problem they may have. I have learned the infinstructure of the wireless world. Management was just there to manage the people, not for questions. Co Workers some were great others not so much. Hardest part of job is to remember the scripting. Most enjoyable was dealing with the customers."
good,I love my job but the lack of advancement is frustrating. Also the hours are the toughest part with a family.
good,"It was a decent place to work, job was challenging and fun and the pay was good. Job security was no where to be found and politics in the work place ran amuck."
good,"Great insurance, benefits, retirement plans. Pay is a little low for premise techs but the work is constant and the company is stable and secure. They will teach you everything you need to know. Starting right away they tell you that your time and time with your family takes second seat to the needs of the company, you have great vacation time and personal time which have to be requested 2 weeks in advance. Here you will be penalized for being out sicks or having to handle any kind of family buissness. However as long as you go in on time and show up most days you can be a horrible tech and recieve very little recourse. Company cares more about saftey than anything else, on one hand thats good, They dont care if you fall through someones roof or damage their home as long as your no hurt then you wont recieve any action but in case of any injury you will be suspended, investiated and even fired."
good,"Working in a call center environment was something new for me when I started almost 5 years ago. I had the typing and customer service skills, but I was not too confident with my own multi-tasking skills. A typical day at AT&T for me at AT&T is to answer incoming calls from customers who need technical assistance with their devices, the overall network, or just general inquires. The most exciting part of the job for me is when I'm able to resolve my customers issue; knowing that I put a smile on their face. Management is wonderful. Always near and willing to help if needed."
good,"The environment is your typical, tense sales-based job. As a retail store manager I am responsible for ensuring sales quality and operations. Management sees employees as numbers, not people and there is little security. I have learned a great deal from working for this company and am grateful for that. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that I get to work with technology in an ever changing environment and get to spread the joy I receive from this technology to my customers."
good,"At&t offered a great benefits package, the pay was excellent for those of us who were lucky enough to have been hired as Service Representatives, however over the years they hired Sales Reps whom performed the same job we did at a quarter of our pay, and after that everything went downhill. The company was all about money (which I do understand it is a business) as employees we were merely a number, and our personal needs were never cared for. Atypical day of work consisted of talking to about 50-70 customers, a lunch and two breaks. The hardest part of the job was trying to meet all of the 20-25 different quotas the company had for us, our job was never secure because the minute we did not meet a quota it can lead to termination. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to and assisting our customers who called there for us to guide them in the right direction as far as their bill, or the products they needed. Although towards the end of my career at AT&T it felt like I was fighting for my job (which they wanted to outsource) I am very thankful for all of the skills I have learned there."
good,"Long hours with every minute of the day you are working counts against your overall performance for the month you work. If you run into a problem doing an install and cant resolve it in the alloted time, it would destory your performance metrics for that day that overall can pile up and result in negative counseling and ultimate firing."
good,Directv used to be a nice place to work. We used to pride ourselves on customer service. Directv has loss sight of the fact that rural customers are the base that made them what it is today and have moved most of the developement to benifit the suburban customer. The focus went from Pure Customer service to a number based company.
good,Competitive environment and great interaction with co-workers.
good,Paid By Job You Can Make Money Once You Learn Shortcuts To Save Time Never Know Time You Will Be Off
good,Typical day at work would be the first day when I hit the floor where I had to take calls which I really dont know about
good,Benefits and pay are great with company. Went thur many mangers and other premise tech. Manager was shaving time to get bonus and i lost hours worked..
good,commission goes down every year but sales double. good thing we are all part of the CWA union.
good,Not a great team atmosphere
good,I worked with some of the brightest and best people of the industry and use of technology was cutting edge for telecommunication
good,"AT&T is a big company with great reputation in the telecommunications arena. It's a leader in many fields and #1 in Global network. Also, it's a great place to know very smart people with strong technical background's and comprehension. However, the corporate politics make it difficult to effect change in the business as the company is run from the top down."
good,no work life balance
good,Various departments to work for and great training program.
good,If you are good with customer service and selling this is a job for you.
good,Printing and Enclosing AT&T Bills
good,AT&T was an ok place to work in the beginning but after a while all you became was a number and moral was very low.
good,"On the Wholesale side of the business, because of the volatile environment within the telecom industry, there is limited movement with the organization. Many employees are shuffled from various positions to where there is a necessity. This is a positive aspect of the situation because it allows an employee to gain a multitude of skills sets which might not otherwise be possible in other organizations within AT&T."
good,if u want a sales job this is the one to get into
good,Great place to learn and/or improve sales and customer service skills.
good,"I enjoyed working and doing customer service, familiar with inbound calls and system. Fast and punctual on the computer! decent call center to work for! Not enough experience management, benefits were okay, job was not secure at all, the always fired and hired people repeatedly, to reduce pay rates."
good,A typical day at work would consist of a mad rush to complete installs and maintenance in a given amount of time. I learned that cutting corners will eventually come back to haunt you. Getting the job done with the least amount of errors given time constraints will benefit you and the customer.
good,"Built racks, implemented equipment on a tight window as we were working with a 99% uptime gaurentee. Worked with Citrix and PDU, xseries."
good,Deal with customers and sales while working with other reps and helping them get the sales to make them hit their goal. Teaching Reps how to transition into sales to make a successful sale and to continue to set high goals!
good,Working for AT&T was stressful and took a lot of time away from my family. One thing that I learned during my years of experience with AT&T was customer resolution. The thing I truely enjoyed about working for AT&T was assisting customer with issues until they were resolved. My co-workers were very nice wonderful people that shared the same passion as I did.
good,"While employed with AT&T Authorized Retailer, my typical day was standing in a kiosk at North County Mall and attempting to distribute cellular phones and home connections. I learned a vast amount about cellular phones, and how to handle and compensate frustrated customers. The management for the company was unbelievably unorganized. My co-workers were easy to get along with and very knowledgeable. The hardest part of the job was attempting to attain a certain quota for our personal monthly sales. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to converse with various customers about intriguing subjects."
good,"Title says it all, hours kind of kill your day and the monotony eventually wears on you. Coworkers are great and every situation is just a little different."
good,"Typical day - Get work assignment, stock assigned truck with supplies for assignment, drive to job site ( anywhere from 2 to 60 miles away) work job from aerial to underground in all climates or site conditions, return to work center."
good,"The hardest part of the job is the frequent management changes, and the instability of jobs security."
good,"A typical day at work involved numerous conversations with job applicants to conduct required screenings for AT&T's internet-posted jobs. The substance of the conversation was determined by what stage of the hiring process the applicant had reached, i.e. testing, background check, drug testing, salary negotiation, job offer, etc."
good,"While better than the last business I worked for, not quite solid enough to live on. I have been asked to return to one of my assignments many times. But, in the end, I would rather have more permanent employment. Typical assignments include; loading and unloading, light janitorial, and working a packing station."
good,"The job is fun and exiting, but if you have any kind of family issues within the first six months you will be victimized by the points system that is in place for attendance. The typical workday was fun and exiting because you were always busy and customers were always coming in with new and exiting issues. I learned a lot about the technology side of life and a few new tricks in the required 4 week sales training. The hardest part of the job would be standing all day in one spot really."
good,"AT&T Mobility is a great company to work for with great benefits and with a large amount of carrer paths.You learn alot you also can move up in different poistions. My typical day at work is pretty long greeting and assisting customers with customer service issues. We have alot of long hours that management are not to fexiable. Management isn't the best because of lack of communication some cases we have to go over our store manger to get things done witch I feel we should'nt have to do.My co-workers are nice people we all get along like a family.There really isn't a hard part to my job, I think I have the easiest job to be honest I wish I had more work. The most enjoyable part of my job is When everybody works as a team and were all on the same page I feel like that makes the work environment more productive and positive."
good,"Management is out-of-touch with it's employees and subcontractors. Could use a major overhaul. The hardest part of the job is in each person acting exactly like the next person, leaving no room for expansion and upward improvements."
good,"They are like most customer service companies. You take an average of 40-50 calls per day and it's imperative that you follow the script. Zero tolerance for not doing so because of ""quality assurance"". Points system for attendance that evaporates yearly, rather than 6 months like most other places."
good,Only one constant ... prices will go up and customers will be calling to cancel over it. At first I loved my job and was and still grateful for the opportunity. The benefits are what sold me and the pay was good for my skill level at the time. Over the years I became disenfranchised with the company. Constant rotation of senior management and mid-level management didn't help the situation at all. In my tenure there I saw at least 3 site directors come and go. Management was a constant revolving door and now that I recall everyone came and went at a some point during my tenure at that place. The job was grueling mentally because of the repetitive nature of the situations I was presented with that could've been avoided 95% of the time.
good,"SBC was the place to work when I started with the company over the years it has more bottom line driven than customer and employee orientated. Still a overall decent work enviroment. I am just looking for an employer where the upward mobility exist, which unfortunately doesnt at AT&T"
good,"A day in the Tech support office consists of being yelled at by customers for hours while having to achieve certain goals for the day. Some of the ""metrics"" were balanced unfairly and this could cause an employee to have a great overall rating but not actually helping the customers. I found that many employees had their jobs constantly hanging in the balance, days away from being fired due to low metrics. The people were all wonderful management and co-workers alike. The customers were generally upset, but not at the tech staff just AT&T usually. I am a leader and could not take all of the micro management. I wanted to help customers but I didn't have the authority...just not the job for me, an educated video game designer. The turnover rate was extremely high with new employees constantly being trained and people either leaving or being fired...no real job security to speak of."
good,"I am a 4 year employee of the company. I love most of the people I work with, but the advancement is slim to none in my department. I would love to stay with is company if it was room for growth. It seems like its who you know not what can you do."
good,"was treated more like a property than a person, not much more to tell but you are like a line item on a spreadsheet. corporate needs to spend more time with the people and less time in the ivory tower"
good,"Work with excellent co-workers. Tons of overtime, Home dispatch, work in different weather, places and environment. Meet and help different customer."
good,AT&T is a decent company to work for. The compensation was low.
good,Great oppurtunity but after a few months you realize that its the same thing every day without really having any imput in the daily workings. They are constantly pushing for lower project time even to the unreasonable.
good,Hveing worked for SBC/AT&T there have been many ups and downs and many many changes over 11 years. I would love to stay with AT&T but our groups are slowly being outsourced.
good,"AT&T is the largest telecom company in the world. The pay was good, management changed often. I did not have a set schedule, as far as work days or when the work day was over."
good,ATT was a stepping stone for me and my start to a sales career. I met a lot of good people there but after 6 years. It was time for a change.
good,"AT@T was a great place to work before u-verse tv, the company is centered on that not telephone. customer service isnt what it was a year ago, tech jobs are gettin surplused in the telphone side of the bussiness and customer service and job sercuirty is no more.Was a great place to work when the company and management allow the tech to do there job and allow customer service to be taking care of.."
good,"Extremely Stressful, Great Pay, Poor Management! The management doesnt care about the customers, its all about making money! Good Luck"
good,"People I work with are true professionals. "
good,"As a Network Manager you are expected to travel 200 - 300 miles a day in order to meet manager expectations of doing inspections.  Expected to spend 50% of time in the office and 50% outside, which can be very challenging."
good,Only problem with this job was management and stress. One day you'll have a great manager then the next day you'll have a horrible boss. Employees were great and never had a problem with the customers. Stress from the job will overwhelm you at times but you must rely on yourself not the managers ortthemonthem.oththemtheanyway.
good,"Company is very unstable now. And the growth in career is very limited.  Always re-structure, and put you in different teams every few months. Make it hard to build a good team."
good,"Benefits are awesome, incentives and pay are decent for a job without a degree. Very tough hours for anyone working in retails. You will not see your family much and they will not support you doing so;Even when they are ill."
good,The company is going through staff reductions in annual basis to reduce the overall debt. Before then employment survey to recommend it as a place to work was about 75% now it's about 25%.
good,"AT&T offers plenty of exposure to various leadership programs, but after several years in these programs there has not ben any advancement opportunity."
good,Company was ok I thought the way the company treats you in the beginning lots of false promises I enjoyed my time with the company and appreciate the opportunity
good,"Job is extremely tough without prior experience"
good,"The major problem being that commision structure is too high, managment is a mess since they need to hit thier goals, and will do shady things in order to hit them sometimes at the expense of your own sales."
good,"I really love what I do in terms of my job title and duties. I investigate all new accounts for possible subscription or theft of identity fraud. I have been lucky to have some of the best managers to work under. "
good,"I really want to compare the 'old' AT&T of the 90's against the 'new' AT&T Entertainment company. The culture was wonderful, opportunities boundless, and the education opportunities outstanding."
good,AT&T dismantled a thriving DIRECTV work environment in order to cut costs but ultimately drove customers away. Employees are constantly under the threat of layoffs and the company offers little in terms of advancement in a declining industry.
good,"If your management doesn't get along or doesn't communicate with you well, your experience will not go well.  Everything is up to managers discretion at the store.  You have the option to be union but the union rep might be friends with the store manager.  Sometimes employees will gang up and write grievances on managers or managers will call HR.  Therefore if management doesn't get along with each other and or like the employees, it becomes a super toxic environment in an already competitive environment."
good,Great team members to work with.. hours are flexible.. hardest part is getting customers to get some of the promotion deals.. that are being promoting
good,I wouldn't take the position again for an assortment of reasons but the main reason is that the company plays games with commission should be criminal
good,When making promotions supervisors base the decisions more on whether they like the person or not than their pure ability and growth with the company.
good,Unrealistic Numbers and pressure provide unsafe work environment.No real chance for advancement from premise technician position long hours forced overtime off days canceled.
good,"Fast paced with little to no recognition, issues with culture, low work life balance as a manager. Upper management is constantly changing and revolving, some with little to no experience in the role."
good,"While there are definite perks of working for AT&T, they are constantly restructuring their commission goals, making it harder to make money. Depending on the manager, some stores have toxic traits, and others are very tight knit. If you do get a manager you really enjoy, do not count on it lasting long as they are constantly shuffling management between stores. In the two and a half years I was with AT&T I went through 5 manager changes and 3 assistant manager changes."
good,"Good pay and benefits but employees have a union representation that does not put members first. I had lower time with the company but my metrics, as an employee, exceeded most of everyone in my location and was let go due to company wide layoffs. They chose seniority over productivity."
good,"I worked for APAC Customer Service, which had a contract with AT&T. Loved working here, the only issue was the little to no notice when a company decides to pull their contract, terminating over 350 employees with only two weeks notice."
good,Offers competitive pay for the work. Continual changing and adapting to different systems and technologies. Management structure and direction is lacking.
good,This company is laying off not hiring so dont take a job here. theres no longer is job security with this company. most employees dont want to work here anymore
good,"If you have a sales background or would like a career in sales I would not recommend working in an At&t retail location. "
good,Managers get replaced for little things. Co-workers are nice and that is what makes going to work fun. But the upper management demands too much of the workers and it could get stressful.
good,The place of work is overall fun. Very relaxed coworkers and space. But as soon as customers would come flowing through there’s a sense of overwhelming stress. The location didn’t get enough customers and when you rely on commissions you have to fight over these customers.
good,"There are many great things about working for AT&T. Flexible hours, work/life balance, full benefits, an inviting work environment and more. However, I believe the lower and upper management is holding the company back from being the undisputed wireless telecommunications carrier. Store managers are more worried with following instructions to making a good sale more than actually making a good sale. And upper management is more obsessed with Directv sales more than actual wireless sales, which in my opinion is baffling to me seeing as though its a wireless carrier that doesn't prioritize wireless or mobility products. Theres nothing wrong with selling home entertainment services, its just a little misleading that its not really expressed to you how much they value home services over wireless services until after they hire you."
good,"Inclusive but management can be better."
good,"its ok for a period of time, the management does not care about you personally. I was blindsided by a car in my work truck, and had my back hurt. there was no concern about my therapy appointments. I had to quit, because I couldn't carry the ladder anymore."
good,"AT&T is a good company to work for.  The pay is good and the benefits aren't bad,  The work environment is not too bad. The job will keep you engaged."
good,"This was an inside sales position. Managment continued to raise quotas. Made your numbers then quotas raised. Turnover was constant. The managers also had a draft each quarter with each of us. They would look at our records and then do a draft, just like a fantasy baseball league. You wouldn't know who your manager would be next quarter."
good,"My time there started off okay, but the long hours started to wear me down. Its a hard job, but if you stay commented to it and have a good manager it can be very rewarding."
good,Love the role I’m currently in but in the 9 plus years with AT&T we go through a lot of layoffs which is constantly a worry.  Upper management and re-organization is constant.
good,"Much has changed since I started 30 years ago.  There are no pension benefits for management employees joining the business at this point, and many of the management perks are now a thing of the past  I would not recommend for anyone fresh out of college, bright-eyed and ambitious.  Choose a more progressive tech company if given the opportunity.  AT&T is now a dinosaur in a modern world"
good,"make sure you're a hardworking individual, there is low staffing, so it might seem overwhelming at first, but you'll soon get used to it. There are good benefits with the company but make sure you're well read in them."
good,"Generally a good place to work if you have an empathetic supervisor. Not much regard for work/life balance among some management supervisors."
good,"Southern Bell was a customer focused, family oriented company. AT&T has changed the business to a numbers only conglomerate.  Real live product training has been replaced with computerized infomercials.  This training practice leaves the employee unable to assist real customers that may fall outside a script."
good,"arrive at work at 8am, you dispatch on your first job, you stack your truck with material you will need through out the day, you get ice, you call your customer to make sure all there information is correct then you drive to the location."
good,too much backstabbing for the center to be successful. the options for getting promotions are a joke. you only get into management if kiss up to management. the company keeps you under their thumb by using point systems that you can not escape from
good,"I feel these reviews do more harm than good. Pretty sure these are gathered and found who's writing them. I don't mind working for a place like that as long as management understands having a realistic approach to the business, and not an idealistic mindset."
good,Read between the lines when interviewing and be observant of the surroundings.I would rather not write anymore about myself or the company. Use every experience as a stepping stone.
good,The hardest part of this job was not having a set daily schedule.  This issue makes the employee scramble to carry on daily life with juggling the schedule and family.
good,"I had just entered the work force after having my second child. She was having complications with breathing and the manager acted like the world was ending because I was taking her to the hospital and not coming in. No job should put you down for putting your family first, especially in emergency situations."
good,"Working as a wire technician gives you a sense of satisfaction with a one-on-one interaction with the customer on there wants and needs for service. Every job and customer is different so patience is a virtue and job knowledge is key to succeed. Once said and done, the running of lines can be grueling with no real fair compensation in the future with added skills and efficiency built over time. Job security is scar ya d likely non-existence in the fire"
good,"If you are hard working, with a sales mentally you can easily move up in the company. The culture is declining and is very aggressive. The money and ability to make a decent living is probably the best part."
good,The enjoyable part of the day was being with your coworkers and helping each other succeed. It was important that we all met our goals to ensure good customer service
good,"Typical day was anywhere from 8-12 hours/day. Would often come in early to prospect for the day (call most of the day trying to setup meetings) and stay late building proposals for clients and researching AT&T's products. (sometimes would work on Saturdays and Sundays too for 4-6 hours)"
good,"The job was good but management was unfair. The sales goals was forcing people to buy stuff they didn't really want, and this review should also be optional."
good,Era una exigencia muy exagerada ya que ni la misma empresa te daba las herramientas para realizar tus actividades
good,"pay okay, job security is horrible. 3 strikes you're out, regardless of doctors notes for serious illnesses of children, how amazing your job performance is, etc."
good,I definitely would have stayed if I was accommodated  with a morning shift seeing that I did 4 mini shift bids the last months I was there and still never got a morning shift so I could accommodate my young children’s schedule. I had to resign and the Union was no help at all and never even responded back to me when requested to looking into why I was never given a morning shift. I was sadly disappointed in my outcome.
good,Poor management with a lack of good decision making skills. Advancement opportunities are so limited with mostly self driven training. Work schedules were hectic in the retail segment.
good,recomiendo que sea un lugar donde sean más tolerantes más pacientes más profesionales que sepan resolver problemas y que se hagan responsables de su trabajo al igual que apoyan al equipo para que se pueda desenvolver de manera correcta
good,"They push and push even taking away incentives you worked for because of things you had no control over. You're a number and they make known you're replaceable."
good,"Was bounced around a lot. Many re orgs and down sizing. Management "
good,muy bueno el servicio de limpieza y mi supervisor per RH no sabe hacer bien su trabajo al momento de una situación médica y prefieren despedirte
good,"It wouldn't be fair for me to give an overall review of the company because most of my discrepancies were site specific, and most parties have since parted ways with the company..."
good,Very poor once you got a work force reduction No HR to speak of. The company has really changed but would probably be a great place for the upcoming technical generation.
good,"I would not recommend working for this company.  They closed/moved an entire dept. without notice so many people lost their jobs, homes. This company also fired employees to assist in firing other employees that deserved firing."
good,It was a decent place to work at. The people I worked with were fine but the district managers were lazy and were able to help when reaching out. They recommend that you call customer care or *aid for assistance.
good,"If you want management hounding you all month long about your sales, even when you are meeting your quota, then this is the company for you. they couldn't care less about the customers now, it's sell them everything  they are eligible for or be put on discipline."
good,I was impressed initially by the department make-up however it was short lived and leadership quickly laid off valuable people due to executives' budget spending.
good,Las políticas q tienen laborales no son las mejores
good,"Att is a good company to work for if you love working long hours and spending little time with your family, the pay is good but not the flexibility, I am very family oriented, so if you are not willing to sacrifice family time att may not be the for you."
good,"I'll try be as unbiased as possible. The CEO tells the media that they're transitioning the company to be more internal. That they were no longer going to outsource their intellectual property. The CEO did this to boost their stocks. However, AT&T immediately outsources thousands of employees to offshore cheap labor. It's truly no mystery why they are losing business left and right. The quality of their product and consumer experience has plummeted."
good,Working at AT&T is fast-paced and meet new people everyday. Goals for sales are a key part to success in the retail environment. I learned how to know my business better through weekly meetings as a manager. Going over our weekly read outs and MoM & YoY details and how they relate to our sales currently. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the sales reps succeed in their sales. The hardest part of the job was to break bad habits and bad attitudes of the veteran sales reps.
good,"The job I left was only a shell of the career I started with AT&T Wireless. Initially provided dependent lines, excellent incentives, but reduced and eventually eliminated most of those over a few years. No longer values employees, and focused strictly on becoming a major conglomerate."
good,AT&T have competitive environment and they are using latest technologies. they have very good project. AT&T are using Jenkins pipeline and Spring boot etc.
good,"AT&T was a great place to work for as far as commission went, and you did get to work in a pretty relaxed work environment, besides having to hit the sales goals, which weren't too hard to hit if you did your job well."
good,"AT&T was a great place to work but so many things have changed for the worst compensation going down, while goals are going up, products keep changing not just cell phones anymore. Benefits for reps are good management sucks, they is also so many politics in this company it’s ridicules if you can play the game better then the next person like I did you’ll be ok but glad I’m out now."
good,Att work environment is good but it seems like att doesn’t care about there employees. You feel like just a number working there. Benefits are great but that’s about it.
good,"My location was characterized by poor management, and an unfriendly atmosphere. Most of my coworkers were over 25 years old, yet they gossiped amongst themselves like high schoolers. The sales targets were difficult, but obtainable. Selling direct tv felt like a rip off. While Direct TV is cool and all, the 3 year commitment really does trap customers. Direct TV now is cool because it is more like Hulu, a monthly base plan that can be cancelled anytime. The only issue is that, management pushed for DirecTV instead of the Hulu like application. It was hard to see the good in what I was selling."
good,"Focus is on satisfying shareholders, often at the expense of its employees and customers. "
good,"Great Job with work life balance but the pay was bare minimum. If you weren’t making sales, your job was basically on thin ice. I loved the people who I worked with but management could be a little better. Also training could be better more structured."
good,"Es una buena empresa tienen una forma de trabajr y de remunerar a sus empleados muy diferente a como vuene yrabajando en mexico, pero por lo que no le doy una mejor calificacion es por que para Atencion a clientes no cuentas con el soporte y respaldo para hacer tu trabajo , no acaban de unir los sistemas de las compañias que adquirieron y no puedes dar solucion a los clientes ."
good,"Great benefits and discounts.  Poor work culture, and work hours.  The front line (techs that deal primarily with customers) are not valued as much as other departments."
good,The company is great to work for. I am just not fond of the district managers way of handling things. Great job otherwise. Their is a lot to learn so come ready and willing.
good,This company micromanages you like no other. Watching your every move. The product and services are decent but in my opinion overpriced. Dont do much to keep employees happy which would result with the high turnover rate recently.
good,"If you are content in a position this can be a great company to work for. There are opportunities to learn new skillsets with a focus on continuing education. The salary is decent although not necessarily fair across peers, decent perks, and culture can be great with the right leaders."
good,"The pay and benefits keep you working at AT&T, but the work environment has become difficult, because of the endless surplus announcements since 2016. Regardless of your success, it is difficult to feel anything more than a number in such a large company enslaved to the shareholders."
good,"Too much micromanagement! Bottom line driven not employee driven , highly political .Benefits are awesome , chances of promotion are not . The tech that I work with are the best ."
good,"Upon my resignation the manager had one of the supervisor give me an exit interview on the production floor.  I felt that was very unprofessional and inpersonable, the company does not comply with EEOC rules and hides behind the union BWA while doing so."
good,"Set a plan."
good,"Coworkers were cool but the managers sucked and showed favoritism when it came to enforcing rules. Call center environment so your phone rings nonstop especially during peak days and holidays. Pay was okay for the area we lived in. Overall, I’d return if they had new managers."
good,"Overall, my experience with ATT was less than stellar. This is only my experience, and I'm sure this is not typical. However, I will say the root of all the issues I experienced was due to poor training. It is a web-based training platform and my trainer seemed out of sorts and disorganized. You will need to make sure you pay close attention and reach out to peers for support. If working in a retail store expect to work every weekend for the foreseeable future. Some AT&T retail stores are unionized and scheduling is based on seniority. AT&T will often promote ""top"" sales people into management regardless of managerial skills. It will be a mixed bag of sorts with the type of leadership you will interact with. Also, this job is NOT for thin-skinned individuals. Customers will harras and belittle you for seemingly minuscule issues. "
good,"When I started working there it was Ameritech. When at&t bought the company, the layoffs began. Managers get laid off as well. Very fast paced job and stressful."
good,The pay was decent compared to the other jobs available in the area (FL).  Work life balance is not good. You usually start around 8 am to finish when there are no other jobs available. Managers usually don't have an opinion other then it can be done. Just make it happened my last boss would say. Overall it was an ok job that would be great for a single person or one with a partner who doesn't mind you getting home whenever you're done.
good,mainly worked with sending dispatches. as long as you can memorize common issues the rest of the information you can look the rest up in knowledge tree
good,"Everything was about DirecTV Now when I left the company. Commission goals constantly change, so never get too comfortable once you figure how to reach sales targets."
good,"Got billions in tax cuts. Promised jobs. Cut more than 12,000 jobs. Initially started with a stable work schedule. Thru the years, company used the ""needs of the business"" excuse as a way to change scheduling until it felt like a retail store, for my call center. Uncertainty of schedule, lack of work life balance, and high stress from irate customers, and overbearing management"
good,"el pago de comisiones era sujeto a la aprobación"
good,"Management rides the installers and techs really hard because upper leadership only cares about numbers, this pushes the first line supervisors to make rash decisions to meet these numbers, having a adverse affect on the entire work center and quality of service able to be provided."
good,"I have been employed by this company for 12 years.  Started taking calls for tech support. Moved to workforce management. I loved workforce, pay was low, no bonuses but was a low stress pleasant position.  The company provides  7 paid sick days.  If sick time was not covered by FMLA they were attendance affecting. There is rampant FMLA and disability abuse in the company. Vacations and other paid time off was granted according to seniority.  Bereavement time needed to be covered with a Letter of Attendance from the funeral home. ATT is a union company.  The union seems to side with the company rather than the employee. I applied for a job posting that would double my pay.  Training was 8 weeks. This was a pass/fail position.  Weekly tests with a required 85% pass rate.  No retreat rights to your previous position, even if it was still available.  Out of a class of 19 tenured employees, 9 were terminated. Call me disgruntled if you wish.  I call it thanks for your service, your fired. Benefits and discounts are awesome.  They do take care of their employees in that aspect."
good,The company has excellent training. They have a very competitive environment and rigorous action plans designed to help you achieve your goals. This job is not for the average person.
good,You are nothing more than an employee number in the system. Can be very stressful trying to meet all of the matrix numbers. Decent pay but it should be a lot better
good,The shift changes every 6 months. You have to bid on a new shift. The score card system was their way of firing people so they can get new people in. I showed up every day a was never late. But still got the pink slip. You get two ten minute brakes if your a minute late you get in trouble.
good,"As a retail sales consultant my job seems to be coming to an end. Customers do not come in the store to purchase anything, usually just billing or tech issues with their phones. We do not make good money anymore because AT&T has spent all of their money and resources to purchase Directv and Time Warner. Which good for them but bad for people who work for them. Daily we are sitting around waiting on customers to come in the store because many customers are buying everything online."
good,"I enjoy my customers but we do not have the tools needed to provide 5 star customer service . There is definitely a lot of micro-managing. Also you have stats you are required to meet including: sales, % of disconnects, surveys, etc."
good,"Started off answering phones went to floor support then to order processing. Tried for a Team Leader position and was never  considered. Good enough to cover and fill in, not good enough to give the position too. "
good,No longer customer focused.  Trying to do everything at the lowest cost possible. Was different in the beginning but has started to change over the years.
good,The job was great until it shifted into sales. The atmosphere became very competitive and managers became oppressive if you didn't drive sales. This was a huge shift from being soley focused on customer satisfaction.
good,"Working at AT&T can get pretty monotonous. We went through several Retail Store Managers who all had different views on how to do things. But most of them ask you to do pretty sketchy stuff just to get a sale. Many of those things come fromt the top down from my understanding. I never participated in those types of practices and treated my customers like I wanted to be treated."
good,"Working in the call center is stressful but at At&t is worse.  Yes, I had good benefits, salary but no work/life balance, especially if you have kids.  For new job opportunities, you need to relocate to the USA because in PR there are none."
good,I quit due to being disciplined for putting a customer on hold while looking for one of there incompetent managers for a override. Even though my ratings was good and the customer I did put on hold was happy with the way I handled the call they was going to let me go.
good,Priorities continually shift and too many changes occur in same space which does not allow for adequate analysis to determine feasibility of change.  Lots of conflict between leadership teams which causes chaos.
good,"Corporate greed hidden behind ""vision"" discards loyalty of employees. Jobs are threatened multiple time per year to balance the overall balance sheet and to satisfy stakeholders."
good,"Excelente experiencia !"
good,"Typical work day consisted of 2-3 conference calls. I managed a group of people that I never met in person, only through phone and email conversations."
good,"Managers care about stats and numbers.  Field is poorly run.  Bachelors degree and applied for over 15 jobs to advance, no interview or help to advance."
good,"It was overall good experience, I got an opportunity to learn and do different things in AT&T."
good,"I was an employee for several years. I was there when it was still Directv. There was definitely a change in the environment when AT&T took over and not for the best. Pay was good, but opportunities to grow were limited. The call center environment is like being in middle/high school, even when you stay to yourself. its just a lot of negativity and drama."
good,"Decent job, not worth the extreme stress they put on you to work 8-4:30, then expect you to set up appointments with customers after work hours and literally have you working from 8-10pm on salary pay."
good,"To some, the job might’ve been worth it. To me, it was stressful and hard to do. Hours were long and at times management would force you to go on loans to other city’s to help out. That is hard to handle multiple times in a row with a family that needs you at home."
good,Lots of changes have happened in the last 5 years. Layoffs seem to happen every 3 months.  Very disappointing as it is an amazing company to work for. Hate seeing so many good people leave.
good,"AT&T is in the process of becoming a software defined/entertainment company. With that being said, lots of major changes are underway. Looking forward to seeing what the new AT&T is going to look like within the next few years."
good,"Cingular was one of the best companies I have ever worked for, att came in and cut the commission pay scale for their sales staff dramatically.  "
good,"In the 11 years I worked for the company, I watched while good, hard working technicians were let go from their positions based on metrics that were out of their control. When telling management about problematic situations, they were more concerned with hitting their numbers to achieve bonuses rather than try and remedy the problem. The actual work is great, as long as you are allowed to work safely. Sometimes you are put into situations in which the judgement call is on you, but more than likely needs another's intervention for a second opinion."
good,It started out as a great job. They don’t give enough training for everything you need to know. They do not care that you’re new. I worked hard to reach the top. In my first three months I was threatened with termination that I wasn’t meeting my stats even though I was new. Management is not very understanding at all. I feel they hire you to fire you just as quick. I left willingly as I had another job lined up. It is very loud and a bit too casual. Co workers are not so nice. It is a very high school setting. Most days you wear sweat pants and jeans to work. They don’t give you enough to actually help customers or your stats. Expect to have crazy stats and not enough to work with. Don’t trust management but they do have a union. Eventually you’ll look for something else.
good,Not really bad. not all that good either. One of those jobs where it’s like flipping a coin. You either enjoy or despise your time there. All depends.
good,"Home/work balance, while talked about as a priority, has practically vanished in the last 5 years. Compensation is hardly ever based on your results and achievements, and instead on whether or not your immediate supervisor likes you personally or not."
good,Was happy working here for years but with extreme budget cuts and the constant cutting of union jobs this is not a place I would recommend working for any longer.
good,"In an agile/scrum environment, the typical day starts with daily morning scrum followed by smaller strategical meetings to cover the team's daily goal(s). The practice of defining daily goals kept the team members stay on track, removed work duplication and helped with synergy. Synergy within the team has contributed to a positive team culture cultivating open communication between peers and management. "
good,"Great benefits, Decent pay, stupid union that doesn’t care, CEO that doesn’t care. Work and home life balance is horrible. You make the same money as lazy coworkers that do less"
good,Over the years AT&T was good to me as far as benefits and salary. I learned a great deal and had the opportunity to grow and take part in many different types or jobs. I worked with wonderful people and made many friendships.
good,"Always looking to get rid of workers that had high tenure, unattainable job expectations, pressure from management and customers, loyalty was never rewarded"
good,"A typical day at work starts around 8am with a group call,during which you are told how many and what items need to be sold today to make goal.These unrealistic goals are set by upper management,  most of whom (90%) have never worked in a customer facing sales environment and have no idea the effort it takes to close.Company is moving away from customer service first model to a sales first and on the spot forced sale.You get one message from Vice Presidents and another from Directors and down. The culture is impersonal, competitive and stressful you are a number,employed to make numbers.Training is minimal, at best you receive one week riding with a coworker learning the ordering system ,and one week shadowing an overworked company store associate doing the same.The hardest part of the job is a lack of support from management when you have an issue (system or otherwise) in the field.You are expected to find a solution most of the time this inconveniences the customer and makes for a less then stellar experience for them.For your effort you will be paid ok and receive one full weekend off a month.Most days you will work a minimum 9 hours in the field and 1 to 2 at home doing paper/computer wor, no overtime as you are salaried and considered management.The most enjoyable part of the job is the freedom of working in the field,and meeting people in their homes delivering one of a kind customer service experience."
good,"I came in to this position at a time of transition for the company. There were many things changing and the people that were on my team were not assimilating to the changes well. It was not an awful experience, and given the chance I would work for this company again."
good,everything is changing as far as payment and keeping employees employed. the managers ask a lot of the employees and the compensation isn't what it use to be.
good,Good company to work for. Good benefits. Many long days as the center was continuously changing its direction on what those involved actually did. Lots of changes during time there.
good,"Working in the cell phone industry is simple enough for someone my age (24) who is adapt and very much into the technology world. Sales ability, computer skills, customer service care, all go hand in hand in this type of work environment. It is a good stepping stone towards something greater."
good,overall the environment promoted a positive work flow also offered several benefits including life/health insurance and also vacation days and a 401 k plan.
good,The call center work environment was not meant for everyone.  The job in HR was extremely stressful with constant conflicts every day.  It was hard to all away at the end of the day and not think about the problems experienced through the day.
good,"The largeness and scale of the company are interesting to observe and learn. There are pockets of innovation and many bright, capable people that I've enjoyed working with over the years. Reorganizations are a constant as the company attempts to remake itself as a media/technology juggernaut."
good,"No job security, just a number. Constant reorganization when ATT spends billions on obtaining other giant companies.  Every day you go to work you wonder about if you will have a job the next day."
good,"As we approach 2020, AT&T is not the place to be for longtime job security. For the past 3 years the company has constantly downsized. Benefits and pay are great but job security is not."
good,"I took a *Customer Service* position at AT&T that was focused, collaborative, balanced with flexibility and consistency.  For two years I really loved my job, my pay, my Union, and my coworkers. Then AT&T bought out DirecTV and our division was suddenly REQUIRED to incorporate hard-selling of DirecTV services to cellular customers. That's when it stopped being fun and became exceedingly stressful."
good,I worked here for almost 22 before I was laid off for the forth time.  It is very difficult to work for a company who sends jobs overseas.  I would love to have stayed for many more years.
good,To the company as a technician you were never valued as  person but as just a number .. when you did good you were never praised but you did bad you were disciplined and punished either 3 moths 6 mth or a year
good,"The comp plan consistently changes and you are required to sell everything from cell phone packages, home security tv, internet, tablets, hotspots, wireless home phones, accessories, insurance and more."
good,At&t is a good company to work for with good benefits and 401k. The work hours  decent and you will receive overtime. The problem is with upper management not  communicating with employees.
good,"Just like any other company, ATT has pros and cons.  I am not interested in discussing here."
good,Management was not technical enough. When you are not technical it can sometimes lead to decisions being made that do not align with the team. That's a big issue.
good,"A typical day at work would start with me signing into my computer and getting my microphone on for the 1st call of the day. I'd go about selling DirecTV Products along with AT&T internet. Often in bundle packages. I learned a lot about selling language and mannerisms in speech to use when selling. Management was always hired from within, however, I often felt that management was chosen upon a base of favoritism and not necessarily selling ability or record. The workplace was quite lively, with celebrations for sales and other achievements. I'd say the hardest part of the job is getting into the selling mentality when first starting the job. After a couple of sales though, one usually gains enough experience to sell routinely. The most enjoyable part of the job was building rapport with customers. I'd have honest conversation with people around the country and I found that to be very interesting."
good,Thought job was secure and was surplussed after 17.  Not loyal to loyal employees.  You are very replaceable.  You get paid less than people coming in
good,I work in a call center and there's hardly any advancement opportunities available. I wish they have opportunities for internship for job promotions. Typical day at work is mostly taking calls and working offline. I work for the business department so we have better customer relationships. The most enjoyable part of the job is camaraderie between team members since we've known each other for more than a decade now. The job is easy but I am looking for more things to do and to get into a different role but it's been difficult.
good,ATT doesn't really care about their employees        There is constant flux and change between policies and leadership. One day a new idea is the latest and greatest the next day they go in a completely different direction.
good,"It's a big company going through massive changes and with an unforeseeable future.  Some changes are good, some not so.  Morale is declining due to the many layoffs and forced moves."
good,Just like every other corporate job you are subject to layoffs at anytime! AT&T taught me a lot about the communication field that hopefully will result in finding another job
good,"Our team was very productive and supportive. But culture is taking a big shift backwards...again. Teams are becoming more siloed, more off sore counter parts who can not communicate effectively,  no more remote work, no advancement for any lower management, no meaningful training for technical jobs, and no longer any real job security for the hard honest workers. Hours worked are growing longer as teams shrink beyond what is good for the business."
good,"I had poor experience with management staff, did not promote a team oriented work place always pinned every employee against one another. Store manager would attempt to over sell each customer which would result in returns of product and hurt employees over all numbers and pay."
good,"Malos jefes, buen sueldo, mal ambiente laboral, te tratan con la punta del pie, pero ganas súper bien.."
good,"About 70% of the employees within At&t are contractors. They do this so they can easily let go of people if needed. I was one of the 7000 people laid off. "
good,"They provided opportunity to learn and train, however they did not follow through with opening those opportunities. I personally found it difficult to transition to roles that would further developed my skill set or desired skill set. Working remotely is an option on some occasions to help with work/life balance."
good,I enjoyed the teams that I worked on during my time with Bellsouth/AT&T. The biggest negative is that the company is downsizing it's workforce. Another incentive to my job was the ability to telecommute.
good,Typical day was to login remotely and work and learn simultaneously at a very fast paced position working with other teams to provide security solutions.
good,I was not impressed by management. I was number one in sales the first month I was there and I ended up leaving the company because I had to have knee surgery and I never received my commission check.
good,AT&T is a company that is undergoing radical change right now.  They are changing their core businesses and shedding employees in large amounts each quarter.  Their enormous debt load has placed them in a poor financial position and they are scrambling to pay down that debt quickly in order to maintain their corporate credit rating.  The company and the employees are suffering as a result of these decisions by the corporate officers.  AT&T is not a good place to work right now.
good,"You have to be okay with consistent change to work here. From structure to where the company is headed. It changes by the day. "
good,ATT is an ok place to work. I don't think they offer much for internal improvement nor do they allot time for person improvement. I would have been much happier if they assisted me with internal promotions and received better pay.
good,"Company doesn't really care about employees, only the bottom line and company image. They are willing to spend $100,000,000 on a building while terminating thousands of employees. Wrong priorities."
good,Working at ATT was stressful. Management tended to overlook a lot of things. There was hardly room for advancement because they would bring outside people in before they would promote anyone .
good,The job was not ideal for the career I am looking for.  A typical day at work was getting customers to sign up for AT&T television services and making sure each customer was satisfied and well informed.
good,"I had an amazing time for the first 5 years I was working at AT&T with fun crew and we're successful but the management and direction and culture of the company changed and the company went brutal, finding every way to cut commission and starting to fire every old crew. I left when things start to go down but heard AT&T pretty much fired all the crew I used to work with."
good,It was the best job I had ever had and intended on retiring from the company. The senior management lost any kind of spine or respect from the rank and file when the only answer to fixing cost was to lay off more while buying more companies in the billions.
good,The company is in flux.  The mission is uncertain and they seem to be shifting their focus from infrastructure provider to entertainment. Lay offs are as as common as two to three a year.  They do not hire from outside and have been down sizing for years.
good,"While the job is extremely stressful, the benefits provided can't be beat. The hours are very long and management will be on you for every little thing."
good,"This is what it has been like working for satellite television.  I worked there for almost a decade.  Fallowed all the rules, even managed to get promoted.  But it all changed when AT&T bought DIRECTV.  We have a union now.  They bat for you, which is good because if you do anything out of compliance AT&T does whats called an ""Investigation.""  A very intimidating process.  We call it the ""Interrogation.""  Never got water boarded but it was very uncomfortable.  I was a good employee.  I left because the grind would have eventually left me crippled at age 65.  Lots of drive time, then you have an install with lots of heavy lifting.  So if you have chronic body pain, I don't recommend it.  But if you are young its not a bad gig.  Just be prepared for working a lot of 6 days, long hours and not being able to make friends or visit with your family.  This job has a tendency to isolate you and grind you down so you end up drinking too much and feel depressed.  The guys here are amazing.  Management is OK, they have unrealistic expectations to meet from above them so I don't blame them for the way they treated us.  It's hard to float an idea that has empty promises.  The company is always pushing some sales tactic or money promise.  The bonuses do not exist, so don't even try.  Completely unrealistic metrics.  They feather it out always just out of reach to so they get the hard work but then don't have to pay you.  Do not let the shiny external temptations fool you, it will only make you miserable if you buy into the empty $$$.  Like I said, I worked there for years, I was a top performer,"
good,"My career at AT&T spanned over 35 years. The first 20+ as a technician working in the field, at that time AT&T was a great place to work. "
good,no work life balance as a manager. take calls all morning then have to close at the store. no staffing in stores right now so that makes work life balance even worse.
good,"Simply put, the company's words/directives rarely aligned with actions taken. It is a rigid culture. First level managers were told they were valued and respected, but they were asked to perform front line functions, and track hours like a criminal. Just sad."
good,"AT&T was a great place to work until now."
good,"-Labor de 6 horas."
good,una empresa divertida con buenos beneficios en el mundo de call center
good,"Hours are uneven and you'll never know what time you get off work.  Meaning, you go into work each day at the same time, but you may get sent home after 3 hours or after 15 hours and you won't know until you are told that you are allowed to go home.  After 5 years I was tired the inability to schedule my life around work and the company doesn't care. "
good,Company forces their people into different positions. Pay is great and Health benefits are great Management is not good in call center but upper management is good.
good,Overall decent place to work except the way the supervisors favor certain techs.sometimes I was sent on jobs that require a four wheel drive vehicle and got stuck for hours waiting on help.then was made out to look like it was my fault for getting stuck.
good,"Overall, my experience with AT&T is mediocre one.  The benefits of being an AT&T employee include, a great deal of training material, good compensation and benefits.  There is a measure of control over work life balance, however, it is minimal and there was little chance to advance from my current position."
good,A typical day involves visiting technician jobs for dtv sales setting up customer apps and bridging to sales. goal at the time i worked was 20 smart phone lines and 13 accessory lines no public ads were allowed main leads consisted of follow ups from previous visits or referrals if you cant hit the goal on sales in a timely manner expect to be written up or asked to resign
good,"As a tech you work very long hours, sometimes work all day with enough time to only get home and sleep just to wake up the next day and repeat. On your worst days you can have an angry manager yelling at you in the morning during the morning meeting and then just to go out and have a stressed customer also yell at you because the service needs repair and then having to trace the origin of the problem, which could mean climbing up a telephone pole in the middle of a cold, windy, rainy winter day, or be in an attic in the middle of summer which equals oven temperatures, and then after or IF you resolve the problem, you move on to the next customer and you better hope they are more calm than your previous customer. On your best day...the manager called in sick. It's a ""Live to Work"" type job."
good,"I was fortunate to land my last position within my disciplines. however, the way I was treated on exit was abrupt and completely understandable. It is just dis-concerning to be on a conference call at 4:30 PM with the European Design heads and be asked after it ended to turn my computer in on Monday. I have not worked within my disciplines since and this departure left a very bad taste in my mouth."
good,"Cons"
good,"Meetings throughout the day, very fast paced environment"
good,I would definitely recommend this job for anyone 20-25 years old its a great job to get a lot of diverse experience at but its for sure not a career path.
good,"You're time working at AT&T will be determined by one thing and one thing only. Your manager. If you get a good one, you'll do great! If you get a bad one, it's going to be a rough ride."
good,"Workplace culture/environment was challenging.  Desks are so close it was very difficult to conduct conference calls.  Contractor environment, no sense of belonging to the company."
good,"Spent over 15 years at AT&T in various roles and the last 3 years during my time there, the culture changed to become a toxic environment. New leaders were brought in who only cared about their career advancement and that meant to get results in anyway, even if those results were not in accordance with company policy."
good,company did not listen to employees new ideas about performing job better.if you are low on seniority you are required to work overtime. makes it rough when you have a family. the overtime came at end of shift
good,"my experience at the company at first was not bad , everybody was kind and awesome im talking about my coworkers ,the management not so much if u did not agreed with their methods ,you were doing a bad job"
good,this job has different areas for improvement for employees to not feel so stressed and so afraid of losing job so easily. I can give more to employees.
good,"Excellent at training customer service representatives and supporting their services. Provides some high level training. Hardest part of the job, was ensuring that all training was understood and maintained higher standards of performance among CSR's. The most enjoyable part of the job, was seeing other employees beam with pride when they knew and understood how to help customers."
good,"Pros:"
good,"Basic day at work is finding contracts and working through them to make sure they're uploaded into the ROME system correctly.  Look out for misprints, alterations, that all the fields are properly filled in on the contracts themselves.  "
good,Great starting point. A place you don't want to stay long. You are monitored on everything you do. IF you dont do it according to there time schedule then you get reprimanded. You should document every job you do and what caused your time delay.
good,Managers have the tendency to single folks out who stands up for what’s right and suspends you . There’s preferential treatment .. what’s good for the goose is NOT good enough for the gander . No integrity . Allows discrimination and harassment and advised you you’re the only one who brings up the issue when you’re standing for what’s right for your peers and calls them coward. I believe in leadership with heart and standing up for what’s right and be in order. I’ve seen so much unfairness but peaceful enough to know it’s tge issue within of individuals who bullies .
good,"A typical day included the monitoring of all existing contract, followed by monitoring the status of the rest of the ongoing project and contracts.  Management typically required status of projects."
good,Processing request to bring service over to AT&T.  Customers come first and to make sure they are satisfied.  Management like every where there is favoritism. Hardest part of job is having to do other peoples work while they do nothing and get paid the same rate. Most enjoyable part of job was that the customer services were up and running they are are very satisfied.
good,I worked at AT&T for five thankless years. Poor work life balance with unrealistic sales targets. You can be the cream of the crop but the second the month changes you are chopped liver.
good,"At the ATT Call Center, the employees don't matter. The bottom line is the numbers.  The managers are cutthroat and not supportive.  There is no training, you are placed on the phone and expected to perform."
good,It was good when it was Pacific bell and when name changed to SBC it revealed its character gradually lol. I worked  at the call center for 15 years. Lot of employee benefits but verry stressfull. You need to love talking and selling otherwise you wont survive the pressure. Hard to meet the good managers these days since all they want is how many and what you sold today. Lack of Communications with in the department and hard to resolve customers issue. There is not much good/smart managers left in the company to obtain correct answers to the problem. But good luck if you are hired. Enjoy all the benefits you can and hop on to your next level of your career.
good,It was a stressful and very demanding job but  Pat was good. If you’re great at selling and don’t mind long hours of standing then give it a shot. You get a lot of opportunities to make more with comisión.
good,I would like to opt out of answering this question. I'd worked for over 30 years and had good and bad times. The culture had changed and became dog eat dog
good,"I arrive at work and log in to my computer and check emails, voicemails and review workload."
good,Felt like it was a high stress low family priority Business. You bid on a new shift every 6 months and during football season there is mandatory overtime if not mandatory 6 day work weeks.
good,I learned how to upset from selling wireless products to wireline products. They gave me the ability to get into my first outside sales job with Wave Broadband.
good,"Was unfairly terminated when my fiancee was hospitalized due to a broken neck injury from his work. Was informed that I was not allowed to be there for him during that time and because I took a day to take him to a follow up visit to his doctor, I was terminated."
good,Offices and buildings receive only the minimum attention required to maintain functionality. Company is in the process on downsizing its workforce for several more years.
good,Would not recommend if you cant handle stress. Pay was really good compared to competitors but they will make you work for every penny and then some..
good,It started out as a once a year thing but by time I left the company it was a quarterly occurrence... You never new when it would be your turn to be surplussed!! No feeling of job security!
good,"management team only wants to push sales, nothing special.  if you want a gig in telecommunication company or wants to work in a unionized environment."
good,"N/A, I was forced to retire due to having 30 years of service and being the highest paid Manager in my Job group. They surplused my position in Toledo because they new I was Retirement eligible. My current boss did not like to be challenged by someone who had 20 years more experience in the business."
good,"AT&T monitors every second of every employees day. Has automated systems to check efficiency, productivity, employee utilization, etc. They bang you over the head with metrics and expect you to do the jobs previously done by 3 people and/or departments. They are in full blown surplus employee mode everywhere which is why all the current employees are over worked."
good,AT&T asks for your soul and then screws you in the end. I worked for 20yrs for this company and tried to do everything they required and never got bad assessment but still managed to get surplussed in 2018 land lose all benefits and retirement benefits.
good,At AT&T a typical day at work is logging into the trouble ticket system and contacting the client to resolve replication issues. I learned how to log into the systems and troubleshoot issues by checking the error logs and taking action to resolve the conflict. The workplace culture is great within the group as everyone is personally invested in seeing that everyone in the group succeeds.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with AT&T leaderships' culture of offshoring all the IT services work and continuously laying off good workers with workforce reductions regardless of the importance and exceptional work that is done.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting the demands of the client for new replication requirements as well as maintaining existing environments.
good,I enjoyed working for ATT.  I started out as a Sales Representative and moved into management within 10 months.  There is a lot of opportunity with the company if you put the hours in.  The downfall is that there is no work/life balance.
good,A typical workday at AT&T included long hours and less time with your family but the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with different people of different cultures. The management was not too much involved with the employees because we were unionized.
good,The culture at AT&T has changed through the years. I loved my years there but they are cutting the people who have been there for years and replacing them with unskilled workers. I think the projects will suffer long term.
good,I didn't find it possible to express ways of improvement without meeting heavy resistance. They were to rigid with rules and not interested enough in improving processes that did not work.
good,"Pay is great, everything else.. not so much."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is that I've worked with some amazing people in which I have learned a lot. I've enjoyed my 19 year ride with this company.
good,There is constantly a flow of customers that want to complain about their bills and the company. They continue to cut staff which makes some days almost unbearable because the days are long and customers get upset for extended wait times. Management likes to sit back and let the reps sink while they do very little to help out. Continue to pile on job duties (not related to sales) while only elvauating your performance based on your sales.
good,My tech experience at AT&T was great until the company started seeing the department as an expense instead of the asset we are to the customer. The sales department they replace us into was a shark tank slamming customers as much as possible and always looking to replace the tenured reps with cheap new workers.
good,"Sale At&t services from mobile to home products. Handle customer billing, device, and service issues. I learned help how to issue with extreme patients. Management rally depends on who you work for, some can be extremely pushy and some are great to work for. The culture is very competitive, you must stay on your ""A"" game. Performance is extreme tracked, so there is not room for down points in work ethic. The hardest part of working for At&t is keeping up with constant changes. The most enjoyable part of the company is the pay when your in the correct position."
good,Not much reason to consider working there unless you want a temporary position.  The company has made it pretty clear that they do not want technicians anymore.
good,"A typical day may last 8 to 12 hours with 50% of the time spent in meetings.  The individual is responsible for having background knowledge of their project. There are many high level overview seminars but few resources with details on how complete the task."
good,Good pay and benefits but very stressful work enviornment. Lots of work and mostly expected to be done all by yourself. Managment can make or break your experience at the company. Opportunity for advancment within the company is more limited than advertised.
good,"Benefits are ok, but job culture is not good.  It's nice to telecommute a couple of times a week.  But corporate makes decisions sometimes that do not seem beneficial to company performance."
good,This company is as big cooperate as it gets. Everything rolled out is a blanket for the entire country or region and it will not include specific territorial challenges. It seems to be all about the bottom line and making profit and less about customer satisfaction these days. They offer bonuses that are un-achievable and most metric tracking platforms are inaccurate and those inaccuracies are what often keep hard working people from achieving the already very difficult to achieve bonuses. Long hours often times.
good,"AT&T is going through a lot of changes. Overall, the feeling amongst employees is that the company has lost its sense of direction. With every new acquisition, the bonuses seem to get smaller, as sales targets are, intentionally, raised.  Also, AT&T is opting for more oversees outsourcing, which really diminishes the quality of service everyone has come to expect from them.  This has made working there less than satisfying."
good,"Was a good job very repetitive. "
good,I would describe the job atmosphere at AT&T as highly competitive. The office is sales driven and the employee is expected to sell AT&T products on every call. High sale performers are rewarded and low performers are chastised up to and including dismissal.
good,"AT&T is an ok company to work for. They do have better wages compared to the minimum wage in the area but you are working an unspecified amount of hours a day, customer service has no training and mess up your jobs, and little to no job security."
good,"AT&T has great training and benefits. Management typically want to help their employees, but their hands are often tied by the higher ups. "
good,Att wants you to push and sel att service and directv. If you can’t sell directv they don’t like you. Numbers are all that matters any way necessary. If you are not selling you get written up. They can’t wait to fire people for doing poorly one month. The union is the only reason many people are still around at all. Customers are pretty rough too. Be prepaired for angry customers 90% of the time.
good,"Was my first experience in a call center, gave me a good idea of the tech support position.  Training at the time was horrible, we were trained for a role that was dropped one week in training.  But was still trained for the defunct position because it was what our trainer specialized in."
good,Very stressful long hours and favoritism. The training they provide is nothing like what you actually see in the field. Techs ride the clock on jobs so they dont have to do another one
good,"High stress environment, walking on eggshells all the time. frequent mandatory OT which made it hard to have a life outside of work. Also, pay wasnt fair for bay area prices."
good,"too stressful of a work environment, constant churn, long hours too many meetings to get anything done, but the employee perks are nice. Overall i would not recommend AT&T as a place to work."
good,"With it being such a large company it is extremely hard to work for them. You are easily replaceable, job duties are added constantly as well as head count with no more pay. Constant surplus's occurring so you never know if you will have a job 6 months down the road."
good,"I started working for Cingular's corporate office and then we merged with AT&T. Things were great, but more pressure was added to the sales team when we started offering home services too. We had about 20 quotas and people do not come to cell phone shops for home alarm service, etc."
good,"As a manager there are more meetings, employee biweekly reviews and coaching than can be competed in a day."
good,Great company with a competitive salary.  The millennials would definitely appreciate the company and 2020 workspace. The culture is very diverse and great.
good,"AT&T was a good place to work and pursue career objectives, however, there was a constant drive by the corporation to eliminate jobs from California, which was one of their biggest markets."
good,I loved what I did I just wasn’t making enough money to support myself . The management could have been a little more professional but for the most part it was a great job
good,"Challenging - day to day assignments help you grow as a professional"
good,Management issues and no one cared including HR. Promoted assistant who was part of problem. Manager was lazy and unprofessional. I left then moths later Manager was fired then District Manager was as well.
good,Assisting customers with billing questions and technical support questions for devices and the network.  I learned that there is not much opportunity for advancement.
good,"Every year to 18 months Contract for updating database would shift to a different company. I moved to wherever the work was. Did this for approximately a decade. All of it was remote/VPN connection to the main database, updating the information"
good,"un buen lugar para desarrollarse y aprender constantemente. "
good,Take inbound and outbound calls help customers take care of their biill.Just making  sure the customer was satisfied at the end of every phone call.Help the customers disputes call on their bill.
good,"fun place but it is hard to maintain steady hours. i enjoyed working with the customers and learning about the technology however, the hours that were given were not standard or steady"
good,The excessive working hours conflicted with my personal goals The job is physically demanding and there was a lot of overtime / AT & T is a good company though
good,Can be a good job for some people but it changes very quickly which can be good or bad. Employee interaction is usually easy and polite but management interaction can become hostile at times.
good,A typical day at A T&T included working with internal and external customers. Most days were fast paced and stressful. There was a lot of rilvalry between shifts and minimal collaboration. Direct management were mostly apathetic due to almost zero possibility of advancement.
good,"I went from Directv, which was a great team - to a team scattered around the country. I worked on a lot of prototypes. But I like production applications better."
good,"Great experience. Pro Work with clients to promote there business"
good,"have to be at your first job at 8:00 am every day except sundays are 9:00 am. forced to work 6 day work weeks for 10-12 hours a day in 110 degree weather where you have to work in attics daily, climb telephone poles and stand on ladders for hours at a time. management decided to refused to allow us to schedule our vacation time because they need us to work. customers are relentless with requests"
good,I came in each day and fixed reports and located property that had not been properly logged. Many of the managers had to and three laptops in their possession. Many printers and keyboards had been double or tripled ordered due to not being scanned as received merchandise. I went from floor to floor room by room and cubicle to cubicle to retrieve merchandise. I had to report back to my manager both immediate and conference call with the department head each week sometime twice a week. Weekly meetings were also help to make sure that all deadlines had been met up to that point.
good,"People constantly getting fired, and new people always being hired. Longest training I've gone through. Associates would scam people. Management was terrible. Only 2 people worked for 3 weeks. Working open to close shifts. ALONE. Moved people up so quick without even the right training. Every one seemed so lost."
good,att is a stressful company that doesn't value family. Yes they pay well but what is money without sanity? I would even say they have good health insurance and you'll utilize every bit of it going to see mental health specialist to help u cope with the companies greed.
good,"Equipment shortages, aged copper lines, overzealous work expectations.  Not a bad place to work, but very stressful. constant rules changes, good-ol-boy promotions."
good,"Very organized in some ways, but you get lost in the shuffle. There is generally a good attitude among employees."
good,The Retail Consultant Sales Position is a great way to gain experience with a customer service commissioned based job. The compensation aspect of the position is tanking because the market is changing. Everyone has cellphones now and the push is for DirecTV Sales and other add-on services. The hourly-rate is competitive in this market but the lack of work-life balance and career advancement is not worth the competitive nature of the position.
good,"Over the years, AT&T has become a tremendous pressure cooker of constant change and decreasing work/life balance.  Because of this lack of balance, AT&T is pushing lots of young workers out of the business because they are burned out early.  On the opposite end of the spectrum, AT&T has reorganized numerous times over the last 18 months and is slashing its' workforce of seasoned veterans leaving a significant knowledge vacuum."
good,okay job doesn't work well with family life. hard to get off for emergencies or other issues unless you use FMLA. would only suggest to single individuals.
good,"Employee benefits are decent for health, dental, and vision care."
good,Fast paced sales environment with great potential to earn money. Base pay is competitive and commission is good as well. Job advancement isn't part of the culture so to get a promotion relocation will probably be required.
good,Great benifits and pay. Stressful environment. Most manager's weren't easy to deal with. At&t set a tone that employees were just subordinates. Because of technology jobs were being phased out.
good,"A typical day began with a motivational meeting. There were always sales goals set, however, i was not a person who needed to be motivated to be successful. There was lot of pressure put on employees, that i felt was unnecessary, therefore creating a high turnover."
good,"Stuck in cubical all day. No windows or natural light. Taking phone calls in rapid succession. Typical micromanaging with metrics to meet, including handle time, CSAT, quality and other factors to consider. Broken tools abound and the typical automation which makes you feel like you're not actually helping your customer."
good,With the upcoming 2020  initiative AT&T is basically weeding out any old employees and swapping them out for younger and cheaper labor. They have no loyalty to people that have given their life to the company.
good,good place to work just need a change . pay is great  good benefit  team atmosphere. no complaints about the company. senority and union is a big factor
good,"High energy, fast paced, a lot of hours.  Loved my customers and still keep in contact with many.  Daily meetings.  Learn a lot of technology on the job."
good,"Work is the culture.  Employees are asset to have complete the mission and not to invest in.  Hours available but you are getting paid so please ""just do it"" is primary the attitude.  Senior management and support staff if it happens M-F I maybe able to help.  Work night to weekend I can't help you, come back during your time during business hours."
good,In any job I have ever worked I have never seen more people so stressed out with unrealistic expectations. It was to an extent I had seen some coworkers develop health problems from the stress. It used to be a fantastic place to work until the company became more concerned with their profit instead of their employees and company as a whole.
good,Working at AT&T is somewhere that has a lot of pressure on an individual for selling. Call reviews are always and they also don’t care what’s going on with your personal life if you need time off
good,All in all a bad time. Unhelpful management with little to no skill in the job the techs are performing. Sick time is punished. Work life balance is horrible.
good,Too much time spent grooming a select group of people.  The rest are ignored.  Boarding on nepotism.  Many people can be promoted or moved but management would rather remove people and hire new than deal with anyone.
good,It was an ok place. But some of the people there were acting like they were better than other people that work there.  The atmosphere was really bad.  You had a certain amount of errors to be upheld for
good,My experience with this position was great. Learned new skills to build sales confidence and work synergy.  Worked directly with managers to learn ways to meet metrics and QA standards. Gained more knowledge for future opportunity.
good,"I was charged with generating new partnerships, as well as expanding the services we offered to our older partners. During my tenure, I consistently met and exceeded the goals set by our department and region."
good,Upper management treats employees like numbers with no mercy. They rope you in with benefits and promises of advancement that never materializes. Allows you to pay bills and retire if you can stand the constant pressure and negativity.
good,Management struggled to remain in tune with the offerings that we were contracted to provide incumbents. Always a power play in that the culture is to work independently rather than as a group.
good,"Liked the work, the independence, and the challenge.  Took over the territory of my original manager.  Put under a new manger that was ex-military that had not patience, and an explosive temper."
good,Good company to work for as far as compensation is concerned! The benefits are definitely a plus as well! The discounts are not just on the services they sell!
good,Money was great. Just a high stress job. Benefits r amazing. So managers are horrible. Use to love it till it switched to sales and you where pushed to sale to someone who called and was mad about there phone bill.
good,Some departments are great to work in others are a nightmare.  There are different standards depending on work group and management at the time.  No consistency in the company.
good,AT&T is killing the retail channel and focused on growing thru the authorized dealers instead of their corporate stores. Constant job surpluses have you worried that you won’t have a job in a year.
good,A typical day of a prem tech consist of installing and repairing Uverse television and high speed internet.  Management is decent but feel the need to micro manage.
good,"se aprende bastante con el trato directo de las personas mas sin en cambio la empresa es muy negrera en cuanto a los tiempos laborables como de comida salidas al sanitario por cualquier cosa te quieren descontar equipos aunque sea culpa se su sistema o de otras áreas, no hay apoyo entre las áreas técnicas para el mantenimiento de las lineas de los clientes por en de quieren cancelar y eso afecta de igual manera la imagen como ejecutivo, por cualquier cosa llamadas de atención , actas administrativas por ende hacen ya un ambiente de trabajo muy pesado sin posibilidad de tener un día ameno."
good,n/a Its and every changing company that keep growing in the technology community// I feel the managers truly doesnt care about promoting within. z\no care for their Employees.
good,"ATT is a great company but your location will determine your experience. In some parts of the country, I'm sure it's a great job. In my BR Louisiana location management was poor and was based on ""keeping it in the family"" by promoting friends and those that got along well personally with upper management. That kind of ""leadership"" isn't conducive to a good work environment"
good,"The specific call center I worked at was poorly managed.  The team managers were knowledgeable, but upper management was rarely seen.  They never made it appear like they cared about the employees.  Processes didn't work as expected.  Employees were promoted based on personal relationship with managers, rather than experience or skill."
good,"Would not go back. Way too stressful,. Good Benefits if you are wiling to work late nights. Most early shifts are given to tenured employees. They have a very difficult time keeping staff."
good,If you’re thinking of being an inhome expert DONT DO IT!! It’s a lot of driving and goals tripled. It’s very hard to sell in rural areas cause AT&T service does not work.
good,"*Productive and stressful workplace with customer and numbers."
good,They don't care about customer service they care about sales. As long as you understand this and you're prepared to sell you'll be alright. Overall they have good wages and benefits are decent though they are always fighting the union because they do their best to make sure they are spending much on human resources.
good,"You're expected to hit numbers every month. Learn all of the "
good,"For the most part the job is not too bad, but they encourage you to go above and beyond the store level to be able to achieve success at the job. Also they are prone to changing the compensation structure every year, which usually functions like a casino, the house always wins in the end."
good,"Over the last couple of years, AT&T has become a volatile place to work.  Opportunities for career advancement are minimal, and the performance feedback loop is almost non-existent. The work is interesting, but the culture makes it very difficult to be satisfied with the company as a whole."
good,Lots of red tape with a  huge company like this. Makes it hard to get anything done. Some people are worked to the bone while others don;t do anything...just depends on your position.
good,"I drove a company vehicle I typically worked alone and unsupervised. I learned a lot working at AT&T I learned to use many different hand tools and I learned a lot of useful information that I could use in everyday life. The hardest part about the job for me was the long working hours, the commute to work, and management structure. The thing I enjoyed most about working for AT&T was the benefits and pay raises every 6 months. I enjoyed the work and learning new tasks everyday."
good,"This company still has many of it's 150 year old policies in place and it needs to evolve, put it's workers first and infuse culture.  The talent level and potential at this company is off the scales however due to lack of advancement and incentives these facets are going unrealized and the bottom line is starting to take a hit.  Quit laying people off, retrain your workforce and maximize your potential."
good,"While 17 days of vacation (total of all the hours and weeks given) seems wonderful on the surface. But when you find out that you have to use it when you or a member of your family is sick or needs to miss a day of school it not as much time as it seems. There is a point system with a max of 8 points. If 4 hours or more of a shift is mixed, you get an entire point that does not expire for an entire year."
good,With the hourly wage being minimum wage and too many different variables to satisfy in order to get bonuses and to qualify for commission. The market was and still is over saturated making meeting quotas for commission very difficult.
good,Lots of meetings. Bland work environment. And they will cancel your project after four years even though your project works better than the competing project.
good,"not enough time off... mandatory 17 hours overtime, no work/life balance. too many hours worked, no time off, no set days off, no supplies, borrow from co-worker, manager sneak to watch you on the job, too many slackers, not enough accountable managers"
good,The best part of the job was the pay. the worst was the scheduling. some days you would close then the next day open hours were never easy to make a living schedule for downtime. it was seriously hard to plan things outside of work.
good,All about making the bottom dollar and up sales on every call!  This creates a very stressful work environment if you are not a natural born sales person.  This job is not for everyone.
good,"The hardest part of the job would be learning the systems in a short period of time while trying to make money. Commission is held for two months, and canceled service by customers affects commission after sale. "
good,In a fast paced industry change is inevitable; though if the industry is striving you will be provided with plenty of work hour opportunity. Growth within the company is subpar due to the fact that communications from bottom to upper management is non existent.
good,Have to meet numbers and managers are always trying to fine you doing something wrong. But good benefits and long working hours daily. Easy job but it takes a while to be persistent at it.
good,Great Pay but always worried about being surplussed and eventually got me. Only thing offered to me was at least 6 hours away and the position offered there is no security within that job title
good,felt like you had to walk on egg shells or you would be having a meeting about what happened all the odds where against you. always set up for failure. just too many cons versus pros. the pros we do have are good. but could be a better working environment. had to bust your behind in order to get a pat on the back and move on. they played mind games with you. its a difficult environment to work in. always having to worry about if you would have a job or not. union isnt worth what you pay for. mine as well not be in a union its still the managers word against yours. never know when you will be clocking out. the bright side is you are in a mobile office so you are independently working with minimum supervision. Get to meet new people working in all the weather you could ask for lol.
good,"Going through  lot of restructuring now so things are a little unstable right now.  Good people, evolving culture.  A lot of long time AT&T people there who refuse to change their ways."
good,"I was loyal to AT&T since my first day on the job and expected to retire from AT&T.  As a Manager, I was successful and was moved from crew to crew to ""fix"" the issues.  I was moved to a new crew January 2017.  I was ""laid off"" since I was the newest manager to my new reporting Area Manager.  Loyalty isn't there from AT&T at all.  There's no work/life balance at AT&T."
good,AT&T in Alaska is different than working for AT&T in the lower 48. AT&T took over a company call Alascom which was a privately owned company . The hardest part of my job is that there was no room for advancement. The most enjoyable part of my job was the customer contact and being able to assist in problem solving.
good,"Answering customer calls, strict break and lunch schedules. Bathroom times limited. Micro management of teams a norm. Achievment goals always changing from month to month."
good,"I really enjoyed working and meeting new customers daily, insuring there experience with AT&T was smooth and friendly. Whether it was an install or repair taking care of the customer was my top priority!"
good,Fairly good place to work if your in the boys club and your manager likes you. Which usually means going above 40 and not getting paid for it. But other than that it ok.
good,"I enjoyed working for the store manager. He was very understanding. They micromanage every transaction. Even if you're doing well, they have to find something for you to improve on. Don't work here if you have a family. You literally get pointed if you call in sick. Expect to stay late if you're a closer and get stuck with a customer. It all goes based on seniority, so if you're new, never expect to go home early. The schedules are based off shift bids, so if you are new, you will get stuck with whatever is left. So expect to work late hours and every weekend. Half the employees show no respect towards women. They were often rude and condescending."
good,"Unfortunately some management personnel can ruin what could be an outstanding career. I don't feel that everyone is on the same page, and some are more concerned with doing what's best for them rather than what's best for the business."
good,"Very high pace and stressful."
good,AT&T was really good when i started but as time went i was getting a lot more of a work load and my pay was decreasing. When i got promoted to a manager i actually made less.
good,"This has the hallmark of companies that only measure success based on their profits:"
good,"I felt the hours were ridiculous and we would work from 10 to 13hrs a day. Most of the time it was 6 days a week and if we were late 1 minute they would write us up. I know this because it happened to me. The managers most of them time have no say, they have to write you up because their area manager will make them. Great people and good learning as far as fiber optics go. ATT has the best training out there."
good,"The job itself is great, with very good pay and decent benefits. The problem is management. They do everything possible to take any enjoyment out of your job. "
good,I worked here because I was able to join the Union.  IBEW has a strong voice in the work place and insures fair treatment of all employees.  Management leaves alot to be desired.
good,"innovative and exciting work but poor management wing. good to have work from home. Interesting platform, co-operative teams and exciting stream to learn."
good,"Great benefits and pay, too much outsourcing happening and loyal employees losing their jobs due to the outsourcing. Not much room for advancement. Difficult to get time off."
good,CEO stated they can run the company on 1/3 of the employees and is laying off the employees to prove it. Unfortunately I was a casualty in the scenario he chose. He will prove his oint with the technology available today.
good,Taking over too many companies which causes layoffs due to too many people for the jobs needed.  No job security and currently hard to get promoted within the company.
good,The work space is open and collaborative and the products and services are of high quality.  The commute to the El Segundo location is terrible.  There were more family friendly events at DIRECTV before AT&T purchased the company.
good,"Managed a base of customers on their networks and customer provided business solutions. Marketed, generated leads and solution sold AT&T services to small/midsize businesses."
good,"8 am Start"
good,The job was more stressful than anything. Dealing with. Iphone orders and angry/mean customers added a lot of pressure. It was definitely quite an experience.
good,"Very fast paced when it is, but very slow at times as well. Customer service is vital even to those customers who are insanely rude. Some days will test your patience."
good,"I got to work as a Front end developer using Angular JS, html,css."
good,Great learning experience. Set me up with the correct skills to handle any task presented to me. As well as met a lot of great people along the way . Excellent job
good,"All about the numbers, sales and how strong you are at converting problems to a new sale. Manager hovering over your shoulders but you can sell sell sell"
good,Process was slow when it comes to adopt new technologies. Still relying on old tools and technology. Need to plan more for automation. Management needs to be more proactive.
good,"A typical work day at AT&T is high stress, high pressure sales experience. I learned to manage to the companies high standards and expectations. Management worked hard to provide a balance between corporate demands and customers needs. Keeping up with all the changes in tech and services. The loyal customers you meet and work with."
good,Union based company for lower level employees that has a strict mindset of do your job or get fired. Unreasonable but also kind of attainable expectations.
good,"Just needs better management, most times through year can work pretty much unlimited overtime.  Good pay and benefits. Can be a lot of drama and gossip"
good,"This is a good job to support a family not a lifestyle.  If you have people that rely on you it does pay well to have a home and insurance if you get sick.  Mental health can be effected due to very high call volume all the time.  Little advancement, who you know not what you know so if your good at your job and don't know anyone your most likely going to stay where you're at."
good,Lo que pasa es que la empresa es bastante buena pero el pago es bajo a comparar con el tiempo y rendimiento laboral
good,"Laid off due to lack of work.  Hired to take on Directv workload after merger but work was still given to contractors.  Instead of fighting for our company employees, they chose to layoff I guess to save money."
good,"The job was not hard, doing well in the job was hard since dsl departments are the bottom of the barrel because dsl is equivalent to dial up so our tools were old, majority of the techs were being assigned to uverse customers making it 2-3 weeks before a dsl customer could have their Internet worked on, and all the techs could do was put a bandaid over the problem(temporary fix) since dsl was no longer being invested in.  In dsl since it was not sales, the department would rarely receive any money to do things for the employees to show appreciation and raise moral."
good,"Pay is good, benifits are ok, discounts are nice. If you can get paid better somewhere else then I wouuld suggest that. Job security does not exist there."
good,"Fear is the new standard, it might be to keep everyone working hard or it might be poor maangment. It isnt a good culture and i hope this isnt the future other companies."
good,Doesn't seem to be much interesting work. Many lay-offs and engineers are expected to do more work in less time with less engineers. The pay is mediocre.
good,Was based on a commission basis which is not my style of work. So did not enjoy my time on the job. Not a place for me to succeed and take care of family.
good,"Been with the company for 6+ years. The pay in the beginning was good, but over the years the company began adding more and more to our work list making us perform the work of about 3 different job titles but refused to properly compensate us for it. There are opportunities to advance within the company if you are willing to relocate or have over 25 years with the company. My position is the baby of the company and a lot of times it feels like we are looked at as incompetent. The company claims to want to give our all for our customers, but only if you do it efficiently to their unrealistic metrics."
good,"Very fast paced , relaxed environment however. Management is ok but it could be better. Great incentive bonuses and also you got free Directv for being an employee."
good,"The environment is good, the only take is the unknown roadmap of the projects. Changing priorities during the sprint. Budgets cuts and furloughs are also one of the things you need to worry about when being a contractor."
good,"Commission checks were never straight forward, so you never really know what you're suppose to receive. Management never gives you a straight answer. Long hours."
good,AT&T is a solid place to work but with the new and exciting technology. The management style is very hands off and very demanding.   Supervisors are hired because of their technical ability and relationship rather than their ability to lead.  The general expectation is that you meet the expected metrics and the responsibility of meeting them or not meeting them is on you as the individual.
good,"AT&T is an high-paced, process oriented and competitive work environment.  It is a Fortune 500 company.  It is a Telecommunication company.  It is a fast paced environment."
good,AT&T is driven to provide top notch and personal customer service. Managers get involved with installations and repair service to ensure the customer is taken care of from start to finish. As a supervisor you are responsible for keeping your crew on track with the quality of their work and the efficiency in which they do it. Coaching your team to best in class performance. Scheduling and approving time sheets and your teams orders for equipment. Managers are also involved in the routing of the technicians workload.
good,work hours are till the work load is completed there fore its hard to plan something with your family.every one gets along.management is all about there numbers.
good,"Hardest part of job is dealing with customers that are not understanding, I enjoy being able to travel to jobs without supervision being present, able to take lunch at a good time"
good,I liked working for Gizmo Wireless unfortunately they company went out of business. They were based out in Reno Nevada. I was stationed in Henderson Nevada but they had me in different stores from time to time. I wish they did not go out of
good,"When first hired to AT&T I was thrilled at the prospects as they were working with fiber and that was the best there is. However, after it bought Direct TV things changed. The company decided to go with an all wireless type of service. Now while some may find this more convenient, I find that both the lack of good signal strength and possible security risks to be very disturbing with an all wifi network. To me fiber is still the future and AT&T has turned away from that. I think the company will fall very heavily for this poor investment in the future."
good,"Initially was great place to work at hire, culture of company changed yearly and job title encompassed multiple  functions. Company  began downsizing  and was forced to change work stations several times moving from an facility  2 miles from home to ending up 35 miles from home,changing manager and task at every move"
good,"High demanding sales environment, not for the faint of heart literally! Place has legit culture, but lacks home balance. Management is great, but sell"
good,"I’ve been afforded many awesome opportunities over my career here. I’ve received the best training for HR, Compliance, Leadership and Management that I believe are available in the marketplace. The company is headed into other areas where the need for call center management is being lessened as it strives to be 70% external vendors vs internal centers. This is in addition to driving the consumer to use online applications for support and assistance. It’s a great place to work, but I’m ready to take on a new challenge as opportunities are now mainly for people wanting to move out of state."
good,"I have no problem with local management. Corporate is another story. When they would rather offshore and outsource everything than provide their workers with a decent contract, it's time to take a good hard look at your employment there. We constantly get new tasks added to our plates, with fewer resources for accomplishing them."
good,"•	Handled employee and guest inquiries and complaints in a professional and timely manner."
good,"The average work day consist of answering multiple emails,  trouble shouting PDA's for about 40 technicians,  keeping accurate count & maintenance of inventory as well as transferring information to company computer database. Create & implement tutorials for different processes on programs & Safety. I learned valuable management skills, teamwork, & the importance of implementing process to create a better work environment. Management was supportive in propelling our work performance. The work culture was intense but enjoyable & a great experience. The workplace culture was interesting & challenging in certain aspects. The hardest part of the job was being having to be a work at 3am in the morning. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting off at 12 noon."
good,AT&T is a very large company with many aspects that cause employees to have a very broad range of experiences that not everyone goes through.  In the outside world the conflict driven management style is very grating over time.  Employees are typically treated like unruly children who will not perform their job duties unless constantly threatened with disciplinary actions.  The hardest part of the job is just dealing with most of the office drama and bureaucracy.  I got some enjoyment out of helping customers and being out and away from the office.
good,"Not a bad company, but not great, either. "
good,"Stores are much slower then the once were due to online sales. Corporate offices are in Atlanta, Texas and California, this means very little advancement options outside of retail"
good,Good benefits and pretty good discounts. Not a lot of chance of advancement to management. Job is hard work but could be much much worse. I have had better and worse jobs.
good,"Benefits were provided that were average.  I performed the role of two individuals, so the schedule was hectic.  Raises are minimal, but the bonuses more than makes up for the smaller raises."
good,Okay company to work for. Work life balance is great.There wasn't an opportunity to become full time I learned how to become a great SSR. And this company prepared me for more to come
good,"AT&T was a great learning experience that taught me very valuable skills that put my career in motion. The structure and evnironement was focused on making work enjoyable, however the pay was poor."
good,"High-pressure environment with quotas. Money was good, but you will be stressed leaving work each day. Advancement opportunities are slim unless you drink the koolaid, and by that I mean smile and listen to each and everything management presents regardless of the intention. Selling home security for two years to uneducated customers made me feel uneasy."
good,"The culture is rigid, you are forced to log on and off of your work PC for lunch, breaks, meetings, etc...."
good,"unorganized, people did not take their jobs seriously or took them too seriously. Good for people who are not easily distracted and are motivated by money."
good,"Trying to be up to date with new work culture but still far from it."
good,the hours are not great you will work every weekend of your life there. It is good pay and if you dont have family its a great job. I think the pay could be a little better but overall all not bad.
good,AT&T workplace culture is one of competition where people are seeking to outshine their colleagues. In that sense they are less likely to be cooperative on sharing knowledge. Plus the company is quick to let go especially when it comes to boosting company financial performance in order for its stock value to go up.
good,Fast paced working with basic troubleshooting skills for UVerse business accounts. Internet issues were top priority and required understanding of basic networking.
good,"Since AT&T's acquisition of Directv, it had gone from being a steady going work environment to an always changing static environment. Every day there are new policies and sometimes those policies impact the lives of the technicians who work there. If you can deal with the constant change in  management then its not too bad. You are in charge of your time management and unless you're messing up your boss is not on your case 24/7. Also you will be expected to work long hours which makes a personal life almost impossible."
good,I was a hard worker and loyal.  Worked for AT&T 14 years.  I worked well with co workers.  Customers were satisfied managing there accounts. Was organized.
good,"Skill and education mean nothing.  During layoffs, which there are many, your annual reviews and performance are not considered.  It's all about who you know and how you sell."
good,Very corporate and stiff.  Limited mobility.  Competitive to the point of harming co-works for personal advancement.  Mostly smart group of employees.
good,"I worked at Directv before ATT took over. Management is night and day difference (Directv being the more friendly work environment).  Benefits are 100% different (and lesser quality, even though there is a large number o them). Pay is different (DTV was piece rate, which is pay per item installed; ATT is hourly, and at a much lower rate than piece rate mapped out to in comparison).  You are expected to work as many hours as they demand without complaint, and they will write you up for just about anything."
good,"Constant restructuring, including layoffs and relocations. Company is too large to function. Great benefits. Workplace flexibility varies by job. I've found good work life balance."
good,"The size of the company makes it very hard to accomplish anything smoothly since you are battling internal groups, processes, and changing leadership who don't abide by processes and rules which aren't enforced company wide even though they are supposed to be."
good,I've worked at AT&T for 16 years and it has allowed me a good income. I've very appreciative of all the opportunities they've allowed through the years.
good,Es una empresa con mucha rotación y con talento joven que permiten ser un ambiente agradable con nuevos conocimientos.
good,accepted early retirement to prevent being surplused again.  company is downsizing by 50% by 2020.  no one is safe.  once you retire they raise the cost of your benefits and reduce them drastically.  meanwhile the ceo makes over $27 million a year
good,"The company itself is would be a great place to work if the level of stress for sales was not a big issue, the benefits are amazing as far as the health and vision are concerned."
good,The work-life balance was terrible.  I had mandatory overtime every week and only had one day off a week.  The pay was great if you were a member of the union.  We had guaranteed raises every 6 months.
good,benefits and pay are great but there is no job security and its a large company always closing locations and relocating or surplus of employees. Union so always fights between company and union.
good,"the people there are great."
good,"AT&T does too many layoffs.  Also, the leadership does not seem to value its employees.  I was laid off with only 17 yrs of service.  I am not eligible to retire (age).  However, I was laid off and other employees that had the age and the years of service was able to stay."
good,AT&T was a well paid starting position but the compensation package was quickly outweighed by the company culture as it crushed its lower employees. The turmoil between the union and management made for a terrible leadership and subordinate relationship that had everyone always blaming the other side for the inefficiencies.
good,The work is hard but important. My only real issue was that the corporate leadership would frequently cut budgets in very disruptive ways. Near spontaneous layoffs are far too common.
good,"Work gets done at a very slow pace because of all the corporate politics. Also, a lot of senior management does not understand how to provide a better user experience for the customer."
good,"In general, it's a pretty easy place to work.  But that's not always good -- there is a general lack of strong leaders who have forward-thinking vision.  Management does not drive the marketplace, they react to it.  Consequently, many good people spend a lot of time and money on projects that are obsolete by the time they hit the market."
good,see above information I have nothing more to add to my comments I feel they speak for themselves. As a retiree I have seen many changes and not for the better but still in comparison of corporations the discounts for their employees are horrible and cellular pricing are pricing ATT out of business.
good,My day would start at 5am when I had to leave for work in a different county. I would finish most days after dark and drive home for a few hours of sleep.
good,"Working at ATT is rewarding and both challenging.  Because it's such a large corporation it can take some time to understand the broader business. However, if you work hard and are able to adapt to change, you can have a successful career."
good,"Inept managers due to the wrong people getting promoted, extreme pressure to perform with little support or resources to get the job done.  The executives seem to promote this culture."
good,Strict micro management with difficult metrics to meet. Very high turn over rate. Manger competence varies highly. Easy to get seniority at certain levels.
good,"Company pays well based on unionization however reorganization of company will land one without a job.  Most job functions have become automated and over time, structure of utility company's has changed dramatically."
good,"The sales support role is less stressful than being a sales rep.  You have a lot to do but if you coordinate with your managers or have another SSR then you'll do fine.  Being a rep is totally different.  The work environment is dependent on the market.  If you're in a market where your ARSM wants to be #1 then it can be stressful because the ARSM is going to force your managers to micromanage you so you hit your numbers, in order to make that ARSM look better.  If you're in a market where the ARSM wants to do good but doesn't want to be #1 then your job is going to be more laid back. During the interview process really try to get to know the personality of your managers and ARSM if you intend on being a sales rep here.  SSR not so much because no matter what market you are in, if you manage you time properly you'll be fine."
good,I loved my position and the people I worked with. But my department was surplussed. I have been with the company for almost 10 years. I'm very sad that we have to leave.
good,Numbers are more important than employees and advancement is scarce. I've known people in other IT and medical fields that suffer the same problems with their management. Making this your typical corporate job.
good,You really have to keep up with 2 different terminals and maintain customer priority. Managers are on a constant move and get back to you with answers you had for them.
good,"stressful to meet goals most of the time if store is slow, management is under the thumb of higher levels of management without much say on how things should be in the store. good pay and benefits is the best part of the job along with the customer interaction for the most part"
good,"If you are young and have no obligations, then premtech  is the job for you. you will make good money. or at least you used to be able to until the direct tv buy out cut our hours but kept the same ridiculous demands and poor treatment. don't make any plans on moving up unless you just want to be a uverse manager because the premtechs are the red-headed step children of the company. We are/were bottom of the barrel. After predicting where the company was headed, after 5 years of devoted employment, I decided I needed to leave the company and pursue education."
good,"I only worked here for three months as Southwestern Bell transformed into AT&T. It got me to St. Louis, and allowed me to job-hunt while I slowly grew accustomed to my new home."
good,"AT&T can be an exciting place to work that offers product discounts, excellent benefits (401k, health, vision, dental, etc) and good pay, but the environment for your average worker (at least in the call centers) is one where you have to contantly worry when you are going to to be the next to be layed off due to company reorganization."
good,its all about numbers no concerns for the employees working in the field everyday. you are always being watched and your numbers are being watched every single day. there really is no personal time. Att always forces you to work overtime everyday every week. You can never make plans to do something with your family because you never get home when you think you will. You are called out on weekends to work because they overload the jobs due for the week and if they are not complete you are forced weekends also. Most enjoyable part is the benefits they offer.
good,"The company rewards it employees financially but if you want to enjoy your work they definitely make it hard. The structure is cut throat and an environment were you have to constantly watch your back. However, you can move up the ladder if you socialize with the right peer groups"
good,Ok place to work if you like working outside in all weather conditions. Great pay and benefits.  Management is not really committed to training you in the field. They dont really give you all you need to be successful.  if you dont get it right away they will get rid of you.  interesting and exciting technology.
good,"Seems like you were written up for so many different things, instead of really being taught and helping you grow when it comes to areas that you lack. Their managers just would write you up and say to change. Constant having observations, kinda felt like they were just watching your every fail than really guiding you into the right direction. although they pay well, their environment can be very stressful and demanding. Irate customers due to certain things the company is really at fault for and while you're there trying to fix the situation. You have work stress right behind with all the micromanaging. I have had both good experiences and bad."
good,"If you are a natural salesperson, who is not discouraged by ""no,"" and is willing to sell products that you yourself do not necessarily see the value in, then you can work here and get paid handsomely."
good,"With the cell phone industry completely changing, it might be hard to find a good paying and stable career working with AT&T.  AT&T says they have work/life balance but I found it most difficult to ever hang out with my family at a decent hour, if any at all. I was with the company for 12 years and every year the benefits got worse and by the end of it they weren't willing to help me with a simple transfer due to me moving locations. I think this job is a great starter right out of high school but it's cutthroat industry and they are paying less every year."
good,"I was always on two chats at a time, management was always there to help, I would learn new ways to provide the best customer service for the issue at hand, great at problem solving and making my customers happy was the number one goal."
good,High performers are rewarded with additional work and expected to work overtime  on a regular basis to get the job done.   Workload is not balanced across the organization.
good,"company made job more difficult while continuously reducing compensation. Not really in it to help customers or employees, but they pay well and the job isn't too tough, but it may cost you your own sanity."
good,The company was great to work for because of the pay. It is a very stressful environment due to the constant threat of job loss. It is an environment where you have to be adaptable.
good,you learn  a lot working for such a huge company but its fast paced and very demanding the turn over rate is very high because you burn out quickly. The hours are very long and room for advancement is scarce.
good,"Great exposure to new technology and opportunity to learn as you go. Reasonably comfortable environment as long as you can produce well. Culture over-shadowed by AT&T squeezing every once of profit out. Many layoffs, remaining good people looking to leave, cut back on product development programs."
good,"Please ask me any questions directly and I can give my feedback. I have almost 17 years with the company. Im thankful I begin my career there, there is a lot to understand about this company."
good,While working with AT&T they not only restructured the commission reimbursement but also changed the sales goals to unobtainable within the northeast market. Some sales associates would steal sales from others to try and meet company goals to obtain maximum commission.
good,"typical day consists of providing offering solutions for wired and wireless products to customers such as selling directv, phones, hotspots and tablets. ive learned how to position sales to help improve customer experiences while meeting sales goals. work place culture is very micromanaged. hardest part of the job would be the lack of having weekends off and constant overtime."
good,This was an hourly rated position that was in a very competitive if not cut-throat environment. Supervisors were great but senior managers were almost non-existent.
good,"Management does not care about anything except sales. If you are not selling the customer something they do not care about your customer service, the only thing that matters are numbers."
good,"See ""star"" rating above. A typical work day is contract billing and auditing. The workplace has a diverse culture of employees. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a great team."
good,"I loved the pay which is what drove me to work here but after a year i moved positions which i felt pay should have went up and it didn't. Call center type job is what i started off doing.We are a unionized job still fighting for a contract so the environment can be stressful at times. I loved my first manager moved teams/ positions never got the support or help i needed. Unanswered emails and questions still and i've been over here 7 months now. collecting can be stressful especially when its busy, prioritizing work lists and follow up is the hardest in my new position. I feel we never have enough time. Team meetings and pep talks in the mornings are fun. We do a lot of activities throughout the year and you can get involved in different things."
good,"Company is full of exciting motivating culture, but the reality is that people would rather not come in and buy things in stores. They push you to meet sales goals aggressively but you are limited to foot traffic."
good,"Worked for AT&T for 16 years and was laid off. Work environment was not bad, I was able to work remotely for the last 6 years of employment. "
good,"Sign in clients and also help resolve technical issues."
good,"Working at AT&T isn't bad it's a pretty good company but i am a truck driver and i love driving so i want a driving job that pays more money. Well you do a lot with the communities, and i love helping people getting there fiber drops put in the ground. Sometimes it get a little tyring because some customers you just can't satisfy.  But thats all part of it"
good,"AT&T is a large company with multiple organizations to attract different talent. Skills and education advancement is encouraged, however it is not taken into consideration with advancement."
good,"What more can I say, it's a call center? The pay is pretty good and the benefits are, fair. Employee benefits are nice and the pay raises are good. The customers are awesome."
good,"There are too many layoffs and re-orgs which gives no sense of stability or job security. They also removed all of our ability to work from home, so we all have to go into offices and share work spaces, so it is a very sterile and cold environment."
good,Typical work day consist of extended time sitting. The culture at AT&T is diverse. Fast-paced and constant changes allowed the job to be more interesting.
good,"I made almost 50,000 last year with over time and incentives, they cut the overtime and cut our incentives. They stop caring about the employee and just care about the dollar... I know money is important but so is the well being of the employee"
good,This was a good place to work for customer service. Plenty of room for advancement. Very good pay and extremely good benefits for everyone. This is a good company to work for.
good,I enjoyed the benefit of working for a largest telecommunications company.  The perks were amazing.  Working with all types of people make the job interesting.
good,"For someone who does not have a college degree and lives in Northern Michigan this company provides a very competitive compensation plan. At&t has a very good benefits plan, as well. They offer a matched 401k and health insurance packages."
good,"Love my training, as well as my trainer. It's such a learning experience. I was on my computer at home for my training and working. It's perfect when you're a busy mom,and or person."
good,There are so many contractors that have been on contract to the company for 3+ years and contribute a great deal to the company. AT&T in my opinion does not invest in those people the way they should by offering full time regular employment. Work volume is too high and it is a severely high pressure environment. The South region is very much an early 20th century 'good ol boy's club'. Senior managers are very unfamiliar with front line processes.
good,"Work life balance isn't pleasant. Your hours vary, depending on your seniority, but then again change frequently regardless of your seniority. It can be a great place of work for certain individuals."
good,"Only work here if you just need some office job that pays $12/hr. Pretty boring and grueling. I worked here for a year and had strong success, but had no interest of staying beyond that. Only took the job to get me into Huntsville."
good,"great benefits......that's it, 1 or 2 good managers, but they over work you and isn't flexible. although they say that they have system set in place to work around your schedule , is a front to beef up benefits. when u actually try to use the service they say its unavailable due to business needs.... only good thing about this job was the benefits..no room for advancements"
good,"A typical day would be servicing ATT Technicians in the field with vehicle maintenance..."
good,Management is out of touch with reality. They are confrontation and will outright lie to employees and customers. I am glad that part of my life is behind me.
good,"The managers weren't trained when transitioning from care to tech, so was hard to het help. They let go of some mangers, so  more people per team. I did enjoy helpng the customers."
good,"Excellent work day if you enjoy autonomy.  Good mix of working indoors and out.  Most knowledge needed for Trouble shooting is learned on your own and from experience.  Taught the basics to perform your installations but the ability to think outside the box and think on your feet are natural gifts or ability to look up answers on the internet. Management has a lot to be desired.  Technicians are union and management seems to look at employees as the cause for all their problems.  Employees are the reason they don't reach their numbers/bonuses instead of the unrealistic grading matrix the company uses to create the numbers.  The hardest part of the job is trying to constantly meet what ever metric is the hot button at the moment.  The most enjoyable part is dealing with the customers, (most of the time).  Usually you are providing them with entertainment means that makes them happy, correcting an issue that has caused an interruption in their entertainment or changing the way they feel about the company as a whole by your attitude and manners while in their home."
good,I enjoyed what I did in marketing but there was no job security with the company and their focus was on the bottom line more than its customers or employees. I would have liked to continue with the company but they were focused on moving most of their jobs out of Connecticut.
good,The politics at AT&T are so overbearing that it makes real work hard to accomplish. People are more concerned about checking off a box than helping someone
good,"As a premise tech you treated like a kid by management, and if you are good at the job you do, most managers will keep you in the same position. Doing the job is not hard, but trying to do the job and keep management happy is very hard. The time it takes to do the right the first time and the amount of time you have to do the job is most times always half."
good,Management has a my way or the high way attitude that does not promote a collaborating environment. The vision is expressed but not followed. Organizations are in need of change and are not going to.
good,"What we expect from you:- Positive attitude- Motivation to succeed- Willingness to learn- Ability to work in a team. If you are wanting to make the most out of your experience in NZ and think you have what it takes to be an excellent member of our team, then please send us an Application with a small description on yourself, your NZ contact phone number and we will be in touch!"
good,"Typical work day: setting up concession, restocking, preparing and cooking food, selling food, ringing people up at register, answering questions, cleaning up, taking inventory"
good,"Every morning to clock into work the first thing you have to do is go over your numbers the shift before. During that meeting, you have to inform the manager on how you will improve your numbers for that day's shift. At that point, you can begin your day's work. Once you get over the sales driven environment the day is full of interesting people and a fun environment we the store is selling a lot."
good,"Descargar Información"
good,"The work life balance sucked the majority of the time, because they had seniority and kept hiring people. The atmosphere is kinda unprofessional with the managers trying to be your friend but really they just want info about other reps."
good,"This varied as my role changed in the company. Initially tasked with turning up remote DSL equipment, I eventually got involved in capacity management, project co-ordination and NOCoperations"
good,"ATT is one of the most backwards thinking operations I have seen. While the leadership it focused on grabbing up more companies and expanding their global footprint, they show no compassion for their employees. layoffs (surplus is the term they like) are a regular part of business and there is no security for employees. While they are told buy the brand, promote the brand call centers are being built at a break neck speed, all of which are over seas. while domestic call centers are being squeezed under ""hiring freezes"" the handwriting is on the wall. ATT loves american money, but not american workers."
good,"AT&T is a huge company and growing very fast.  However, as a US based representative working on base + commission, the company changes the way you earn your commission once every season to make it nearly impossible to be successful with your numbers.  Its blatant how they try to curb how much you can make in commissions payouts to meet their financial goals and save money when they need to.   This creates a very stressful work environment, I wouldn't suggest working here in the sales environment to anyone."
good,"This job is very demanding and stressful. If you are very active with church you will have to give that up, Your hours are never consistent and if don't hit your goals you will not get paid. It seems like hair management will take care you if you have an issue or need time off. Just be ready for lots of change."
good,"You can learn a lot about the telecommunications field because you have the opportunity to work on many different projects. Management is remote. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with, especially if they are co-located with you."
good,"I enjoyed working at AT&T but since it was 15 years ago,  many of my comments are ""dated"" since much as changed in the telecom climate since I left AT&T."
good,"I've worked at AT&T wireless for nearly 4 years now. It used to be a great place to work , but in the last year the job was flipped from being a customer service job to being ""Sales and Service"". The deception there is that there is no longer any focus on the service, only on your ability to hold resolution hostage while attempting sales attempts with any and all services that are available to them. This has changed the entire climate of the job. The management is no longer friendly unless you are getting big sales, the pressure brought upon the sales aspect of the job is nearly unbearable even if you are moving decent numbers in that category."
good,It was an ok place to work.They put a lot of pressure on you with little training based on what you face when youre actually on the phone with the customers.
good,"Analyzed computer and network related problems reported by end-users, diagnoses the most effective method to resolve the problem and implement the solution; install, maintain and troubleshoot the agency Local Area Network (LAN), Wide Area Network (WAN), data and voice communications, microcomputers and all peripheral equipment."
good,"Super high expectations from company, some almost unattainable.  Management expects your work to come before all else, will discipline you for needing to take a personal day.   Laying off CORE techs so they can give the higher paying work to lower paying job titles."
good,"It's not always sunny. Sometimes you have to work in the rain. Sometimes you are ankle deep in mud. Its part of the job. Sometimes you are even 18ft in the air with spikes on your feet and a belt holding you in place. But if you like a bit of challenge, it's worth it."
good,"High stress but good compensation."
good,while the money was really good the work environment was not att/cwa seems to foster a work environment where you are always uncertain about if you will have a job while paying you just enough to keep you on payroll all while telling you your position is secure only to surplus your entire center a week later
good,A typical day at work for me starts at 9am and ends at 5pm.  I work collaboratively with cross-functional teams. I have the flexibility of attending meetings face-to-face or remotely either via webcast or working from home.
good,"It's not quite what it's made out to be. They will tell you whatever they have to to get you to work there, but before you know it you are working a different job. "
good,"As many of my co-workers would agree, the culture at an AT&T call center is very negative which comes directly from the horribly negative management that we had.  They use scare tactics to drive numbers.  The stress level is extremely high and most keep with the job for the income."
good,"Typical day was to make phone calls to businesses to persuade them on buying an ad in the yellow pages or the yp,com (internet)"
good,"Having spent over a decade with the company, I've seen first hand, several great employees be looked over for promotions. Those who were offered promotions have many times turned them down due to low compensation increases. A typical full-level promotion only nets a maximum 10% increase in pay."
good,This job is not for everyone. It use to pay really well but the company change pay structure and you don't make now nearly as much as before. The job pays well but not enough to support a family. Management really push you to be a car salesman instead of taking care of the customer.
good,"Pay is good but, with the ever changing telecommunication industry, job security is lacking. Everything else was ok. Jobs are completely metric driven."
good,Pay is commision based and not that great for the hours you work. Long hours sometimes without sales. Expect to work every weekend and most holidays.
good,"Att as a company is horrible if you have a family. I feel sorry for anyone that is a single parent due to only being closed only 3 day a year, you can only miss 5 day in a solid year. I worked there 7  years and never seen a weekend off unless call in or take a vacation. They have a ZERO gun policy even if you are a license carrier. The only good that comes out of this place is money and benifits."
good,"I work for an unorganized Authorized AT&T Dealer and I didn't enjoy my time working for that company. At the time the management staff was terrible, no through training was given."
good,job is good pay and decent security until the company over spends and merges. If you don't mind being micromanaged then you will have no problem with this job. Not all managers micromanage but that is the way the company is going.
good,"A typical day would be coming into work and helping customers learn how to use their phones. If customer had any issues with device, we would try to resolve them, and if we couldn't resolve issue, we would replace it if device was under warranty and had no liquid or physical damage."
good,"Achieving monthly sales goals, explaining billing details such as monthly services, rates, and mobile devices. Activated home and mobile Services. Pushed business offers, product benefits, and product knowledge to connect customers to latest technology."
good,Day is typically involved with various calls and data entry to multiple programs. telecommute most days and office itself includes only few staff although most of us have worked together many years. Hardest part is doing too many roles and having to change direction in midstream. Most enjoyable is conversing whether locally or remotely with fellow employees both work and non-work related who have been together for over 15 years.
good,Great with work life balance. Good with being involved with the community. Company is making too many cuts. Needs to show more loyalty to employees who have been loyal and worked hard to achieve success within the organization.
good,I didn't enjoy the work due to it didn't feel like a company who was taking care of there employees. it literally got to the point of not enjoying work
good,Company is undergoing layoffs through the 21 state region. Rather then rating their managers they are laying off by location in massive waves. So no matter how good of a job you have done it has no bearing on your future
good,It a pretty good company to work for. work-life balance can be challenging but you learn to adjust. The benefits are nice. the job security however is terrible. the amount of job surplussing is terrifying.
good,you start off the day but acknowledging a job take the job an arrive at the house to start the job u may have to do a pole mount or a roof mount depending on the signal
good,"Supervise daily activities to ensure quality operations, performance, and customer experience"
good,The departmentalization did cause a lot of problems customers complained about being transferred multiple times the call flow and transfer process needs to be reworked
good,"Es muy buena empresa, aprendí muchos conocimientos, buen ambiente laboral, problema es la actualizacion de la oferta de productos, ya que tardan mucho en mostrar la oferta que estamos manejando."
good,"Pays well!  Overtime all the time.  Shift starts at 8:00am and i finish most nights by 6:30 or 7:00pm.  My jobs can range from internet, phone or TV install.  I work with Fiber, Copper and Satellites.  .  I connect all wires and equipment on inside/outside of customer premise which includes wall fishing, drilling and running new cat 5 wire."
good,"Departments in the organization do not share information with one another, each group has their own name for the same piece of equipment so trying to work together is difficult.  AT&T Surpluses employees year round and fosters a culture of never knowing when you may be laid-off or if your department will be dissolved or shipped over seas."
good,"Moved up many times in my career, still room for advancement, but cannot afford to live on my own...this company needs to do cost of living raises."
good,Good place to work overtime almost daily. I enjoyed interacting with the customers on a daily basis to resolve issues that sometimes were complex.
good,I learned many skills. I am able to change process on a daily basis. Work well with others. I have great communication skills. Team player. Hardest part of job is long hours.
good,"As a call center the work is emotional taxing as generally people call in with problems in some cases about 20% I would say without real solutions available over the phone.  For example not wanting to pay bill, technical issues requiring a technician home visit or repeat callers who have been told before no in relation to a credit or other request.  Immediate management is good in my experience.  Recently unionized right before I left.  The hardest part is dealing with people you cannot help or need to say no to.  The best part is the team atmosphere.  Recent schedule changes to a 6 month rolling  shift bid means every six months you may end up on a new team with a new supervisor."
good,"Not the same company as in the pass, now that they own DTV. They out source jobs to much also. Customer wants to speak with someone now and in English.But to cut cost they close and lay off in the US and move it over seas?"
good,"If you like challenges, changes, creativity, and an enormously diverse, global workforce, AT&T is a good match for you."
good,"I worked at AT&T for several years and enjoyed my time there. If you are driven and have the ability to sell ice to an Eskimo, this is the job for you. The benefits are awesome and the pay is very competitive. Management leaves a lot to be desired because they don't coach the representatives and only focus on the negative. I had some awesome co-workers, some who I'm still in contact with."
good,"Got to witness it yourself. I am not the type to give for warning.  When you meet some true people that you can trust keep them.  I know its the South and times have changed but some folks just dont and say ""you trust me""."
good,Work hours get extensive but environment is friendly. Customers complain a lot and pay is not worth it. It's fun to play on phones all day. Not too many benefits though.
good,"Large Business Care handles the setting up service for banks, hospitals and multi million dollar companies. We go between the Sales team and the customer to make sure accounts are set up correctly and are billing with correct contract information. We are the front line for any problems that come up and have to find solutions so the customer."
good,no es un mal lugar de trabajo pero tampoco es un buen ambiente de trabajo
good,"The benefits and the pay are awesome.  It's just a shame that you have to sell your soul. If you are honest, you won't fit in here. I had to take fmla just to go to the dr during a high risk pregnancy. They also told me in so many words that I need to decide what is more important. Well, they didn't like it when I said my child. They worked around my schedule due to the union until I went into early labor due to stress. When my son died, they refused to give me extra time off, and I was back at work exactly a month after birth. Oh, but they said if my child had lived, I would've gotten a year. I lasted another month after that, but eventually just gave my two weeks. It's not worth losing another child to work here. And I was #3 in my department for sales, so it doesn't matter how well you do.  ATT does not care about you."
good,"AT&T Retail is great company to start a career in mobile technology. The hours are long when you do begin as a new employee, often having to work closing shifts and weekends, but they gradually improve the longer you are with the company. "
good,"As a retail store manager with AT&T, I gained a wealth of knowledge. I was expected to learn quickly as our products and strategies change frequently. This position is complex because it entails focusing all of the aspects of the business, juggling sales goals, dealing with union/personnel issues, and operational tasks is a balancing act. The most difficult part of this transition was learning to effectively organize my day and delegate/follow up effectively. It is impossible to do it all, so putting processes in place is essential. I encountered an amazing support team in my peers. I was able to lean on them in various situations and I built long term friendships with many. My leadership is not open to new ideas and people are afraid to speak their minds. I believe that a successful company culture promotes open feedback and encourages ideas from employees at all levels. I truly enjoyed the impact that I was ablate have on my staff. I love developing them so they are able to get promoted or achieve a goal they have been striving towards."
good,"Very relaxed environment; casual setting.  Everyone has been very welcoming.  A typical day involves being on the phone for 8 hours, dealing with various customer issues from payments to restore service from suspension.  It is much than just a collections job."
good,"A typical day at sykes consist of taking 30 or more calls a day. Management isn't so helpful. As a customer service representative, you have to research the answer to the question if you do not know it and sometimes all the information that you need isn't present. Many managers available but not too many know how to help you. The coworkers are great at helping each other out."
good,"This was one of the best working environments I have experienced in a while. My coworkers were fabulous and even a few of the customers, would show their appreciation by purchasing us Starbucks;s."
good,"The company on a retail sales consultant level is the best protection because of the Union. However, management is sometimes the best and worst support system. It pains me to say it but never trust the open door policy it could be the end of your career. Pay is what kept me coming in for three years and the benefits."
good,On an average day managers threatened to walk you out the door and their Supervisor threatened them and told them how to do their job.
good,Was a good job for a young person due to flexible shifts and sales commissions and spiffs kept the environment competitive. Great Co-workers at the time.
good,"It has it's pros and cons. Main cons are 8-9 hours on your feet even at dead periods. No work and home life balance. The schedule is based off seniority. It is hard to move up in management without relocating. The compensation changes. Checks are taxed at 40% "
good,I got to set up meetings with my customers along with other clients as well. I also would train new incoming sales representatives.
good,Good company If goal is to be in Management.  Company provides excellent benefits.  I enjoyed my time working there.  I liked this company better when it was Southwestern Bell.
good,Company is downsizing in California with no regard to it's employees. No hope for retirement. Hours were favorable. Location was convenient
good,I was happy with my time at this job. Just hard to move out a department once you are in it. Great pay.
good,"- Most of the time under staffed, really long hours of work sometimes 12 hours if needed. Day to day job would be communicating with customer and providing them with the best solution, by product demonstration and up selling. "
good,"Never have I worked for a company where people fear for their job most of the time. Many metrics that are used are out of your control. Local managers tried their best to be good managers but pressure for their jobs made them do things they didn't even like."
good,Loved working there until management got a big head and only looked out for himself to make him look better than anyone else and never cared about his employees.  Looked for ways to punish reps even when they were inside the guidelines.
good,The good part is they allow remote working which is a great perk allowed. But if you want to grow faster it would be  challenging
good,"Good pay, decent benefits, but overwhelming bureaucracy. Co-workers are the best, but upper management completely disconnected from workers' reality."
good,"Good Pay but large workload/expectations.  Must be able to handle angry customers, and be able to type fairly quickly.  Will operate lots of phone systems"
good,"The work hours are HARD. If you have a family, I wouldn't suggest this job. Originally, it was great because the commission was with the hours put in. Every 6 months, they change the commission structure and it continues to get worse and worse. The longer you stay, the less money you make but the more the expect you to do. Backwards, huh? They provide hourly, plus commission so if you don't mind the hours, the pay is still pretty good (11-13 hourly starting) but its a very stressful environment."
good,"Professionally handle customer escalations, learn to be coached constantly. Most difficult part of the job is dealing with upset customers. The most enjoyable part of the job satisfying customer needs."
good,"Your day to day overall would be fairly nice. your co workers are very friendly and you are in an over positive environment, that enables you to provide great results! However regardless to how many times they say it, advancement is all but impossible.  and the bonus structure is rigged. all the incentives and drawings are ""fixed"" to say the least. and if you're not best friends with someone who is able to promote prior to joining the company. then all your hard work, and passion WILL go un noticed. and will not be a factor when going through the promotion process. you will be at the same entry level position for your entire stay there."
good,"The ability to have a direct impact on somebody's life by providing the tools they need to be more productive is a great feature about this job. Co-workers are great people and the job itself isn't that hard, as long as you take the time to learn the products. Management only cares about hitting their numbers and wont actively manage unless they are forced to. Pay is very good especially if you hit your sales quota."
good,"Call Center environment"
good,not a stable place to work they already know who they want to work for them.. and  if you are over weight you are done. a lot of politics
good,"After AT&T bought DIRECTV, they removed all part time employees and everyone is on a flexible schedule every 3 weeks. These changes made a lot of people quit."
good,The acquisition of DirecTv by ATT completely destroyed the corporate culture of DirecTv which is one of the many things ATT purported to want to learn about as part of the acquisition. DirecTv's exceptional customer service rating was another. After the take over everything was changed to how ATT did it. Which has one of the lowest customer service rankings in the industry. The environment after the take over became unbearable and no longer a comfortable place to work. You went in everyday wondering if you were going to get fired for some perceived policy violation. The changes made at the Tulsa center forced long term loyal and high performing employees to leave Directv/ATT.
good,"I love their mobile service, plans and equipment, customer care is wonderful. However their is a huge disparity between workers wages and the salary of the CEO. He got a 2 million dollar bonus on top of making $10,000 an hour with all benefits while we were the lowest paid of all the mobility customer care workers, with the highest quota for sales in an industry where sales was not part of the job when hired."
good,"I liked the job but hated the director. There was no work life balance, I was expected to work at all times. There were alot of perks, the benefits were great and I always had new phones"
good,"While the job did pay fairly well, the hours were too unpredictable and the management was disorganized. Some of the practices were unethical, and it led to quite a bit of customer dissatisfaction. I personally enjoyed working with the customers and assisting them in approving their business accounts, but I wasn't provided with the tools to make them feel happy with our service."
good,"I worked in a call center environment. I handled billing issues, set up new accounts, and sold products. My customers were on the verge of leaving the company, so I had to keep them from canceling and sell them new products. "
good,"always problems with supplies, stressful environment specially after buying Directv, good school to learn new skills in general"
good,"At the time I worked for them, ATT was just a long distance company. They had no interest in Cellular phones, they thought it was a niche market."
good,"As with any call center there is constant change. I started out in Customer Service--was told at the time of hire there would be no sales involved. About 4 years into the position they wanted us to not only do customer service, but upsell products and services to customers"
good,"Working at AT&T is fairly relaxing and can even be fun sometimes. The job in itself is easy to learn and do, but problems with different departments can interfere with your duties easily, causing long delays in providing service to customers. Everything is part of a metrics system, efficiency, quality, jobs completed, etc. You are strictly held to meet these metrics, or fear losing your job."
good,"Task varied from day to day this made the position very interesting and challenging."
good,"Very stressful work environment. Does not allow employees freedom of movement, low trust factor, unstable work hours, high termination rate."
good,"It's a dying industry, at least that is what they believe. Focus is on wireless and commercial account, no longer are they concerned about Grandma's phone."
good,I had the opportunity to have many job areas outside of my title and learn allot with out the pay.  Benefits pretty Good.  Good Military culture
good,I had an additional 2-yr contract after completing 1 yr. Was let go with no explanation because AT&T needed to reduce spending when merging with Direct TV.
good,The company pays well but they are not very concerned about the health of the staff. Everything will be fine as long as you dont get sick in any kind of way. You have to have your personal goals and know what you want out of the company because your well being is not a concern or priority to them.
good,"When I first began with the company, I LOVED my job.  Over the years it has changed so dramatically that I find it is no longer a fit for me.  Currently, the entire center is focused on Collections.  All representatives are Receivables Management.  There is no longer any ability to work on special teams offline or ""back office"" work.  Call volume can be overwhelming as there is often not even time to take a sip of water between calls.  Upper management tries to portray the bond of a ""work family"" environment, but often comes short.  First line management varies greatly between managers.  Some are incredible, others not so much.  "
good,"With taking an average of 30 calls a day you find that use of company resources is a must to succeed and from this you learn to trust your company which brings about a better understanding of accountability and resource management. There is no consistency with individual managers, each has their own way of getting the job done and that inevitably leads to frustration and confusion. Thankfully the employee base is broad enough that you never find yourself lacking in variety or friendship. The hardest part of the job is adapting to the environment but once this is done you will find happiness in knowing that you have given your best effort and the best solution to your customers."
good,"We would clock in at our start time and immediately log into the phone queue to take incoming calls from customers.  Building rapport with each interaction and notating account, while effective listening to resolve any issues and provide service and products information on every individual level.  Keeping information on each profile, secure. Reflect enthusiasm, gratefulness, and empathy when needed on each inquiry.  I learned how to be an excellent service representative and achieved small bonuses and/or prizes for performance goal setting. I enjoyed my co-workers assistance and group team work."
good,"cool pace to work , great pay , awesome benefits , terrible management and admin TERRIBLE.....if you need the money and don't mind the BS this is the place for you .......A STRESSFUL environment and they like it that way"
good,Each month I had to being in over 60 new activation's to hit a my goal. Re set every month with very little motivation other then the threat of losing my job.
good,"A nice atmosphere, hardworking people, hard-aggressive sales team."
good,There are worse jobs but I am certainly hoping to find better ones soon.  The work was fine but you are certainly just a number regardless of your productivity.
good,"Work place was professional and very welcoming. "
good,I worked in the finance department for this company. I learned how to be firm and have more of a thick skin. Management showed a lot of favoritism toward certain employees and was not very by the book when it came to company policies.
good,long hours 6 days works weeks ................................................... management dosne't care how you feel or how long you work as long as the job get done
good,"your job becomes your whole life. not time for family and friends. if you get sick and call in, you will be written up. sometimes they let you slide on first one."
good,"Continual change of job responsibilities and downsizing.  Too much asked of few front line people.  "
good,"At AT&T you have the ability to make great pay. Being part of a union you are guaranteed raises every year and great affordable benefits. Because of the sales reps being unionized, management is forced to micro manage all of the reps."
good,"Company has a strong presence in the state of Florida, company brand is all over dealing with cellular and home services, their footprint is increasing every day"
good,"Unionized divisions, large company with different fields to work in and potential for a decent salary. Also has good medical benefits."
good,"no room for improvement ,no hour break,no good pay, good people"
good,Working with my peers to develop internet products and services to aid customers to connect to the internet and internally explaining how the products and services worked and how related to other services from the company.  Liked working with peers in multi-locations with online tools provided by the company.
good,This part of the resume is suppose to listed as a store called Texaco and I was a cashier/assistant manager. I enjoyed the people and employees that was around me. I handled monetary credit cards open and closed the store. I also stocked and cleaned the store.
good,one of the worst places i have ever worked. The management was terrible and never listened to the problems of their workers and just kept harping about the same things that were also driving the moral of the workers down.
good,"Personally, this wasn't a job that I could continue to do.  It's extremely high stress as of course you do want to help people but can't always.  Often calls would be constantly transferred trying to get the right department and by the time that they finally get there, they are already upset about just trying to talk to the right person.  I was under the impression that this was going to be troubleshooting, billing inquiries, programming adjustments, etc.  However the emphasis is on sales, and it got frustrating as management would tell you, you were not a salesman yet all of your meetings, and huddles would focus on how to increase sales, and they masked that with saying we are trying to focus on how to increase your opportunities to make offers.  It became stressful juggling, helping customers on phones, and satisfying management, and also worrying about home life.  Their attendance policy is extremely strict, even when I was sick they weren't willing to really help me out and just kept saying build up your PTO so you can use them in these instances.  I should also say this was my first call center so maybe I'm just not cut out for this kind of job."
good,"As a ASM you will work to many hours and have to deal with bargain employees that will complaint about everything, management doesn't recognize hard work"
good,It is a fun place with great people. The work day does get busy from time to time and it is difficult to not be distracted with twelve television monitors and two computers at your fingertips. The pay rate was awesome; something that many companies have forgotten. Our position are important and the company knows that. There was politics being played as with any company. The best part of night shift is that we knew how to stay out of it for the most part.
good,"work place is high stress, focus on personal growth and analysis is high. numbers may be a focus dependent on department. Great medical benefit and retirement options. Some limitations on advancement."
good,"a typical day of work was to go  to about 4-5 houses a day and perform either a new install,upgrade,or service calls !! we would install satellite dish on house and run cables to desired locations in the house and perform customer education.. the hardest part of the job was in the attics fishing cables which i didnt mind to much."
good,"Extreme pressure for sale. "
good,Can be a good place to work. In some areas leadership is clearly missing. Teams are very isolated and not a lot of collaboration. Work gets done mainly through escalations and directives from department management.
good,I am not interested in commenting on AT&T.  My job is very different than that of the other 90% of work done at AT&T Managed Services and was not handled well by corporate executives who at times are disconnected from what it is that my team performs.
good,Compensation is great.  The hours are varying. The longer you are there the better hours.  You will work weekends the first 2 years of employment at least.  The management team are not supportive they want to know your business but pick who they want to help.  They are out to get you if they feel they dont care for you for some reason.
good,This job was commission based only in an areas that had already been penetrated by other marketers.  You can work for 12 hrs and not receive on sale which means you do not get paid for those 12 hrs of work.
good,"Cool place to intern ,you get to go and see many places and things that they are working on. If you are a people person then you will get to meet a lot of people/interns. Some of the interns are okay, I do not think they put so much into hiring the smartest people so if you would like to work with smart interns this might not be the best place now, but I know they are working on improvements."
good,"I loved the physical component of the job.  I loved the challenge.  Co-workers were very helpful and knowledgeable.  As a new employee there is a steep learning curve.  You are trained to work on the ideal network, but the actual network is absolutely 180 degrees different from the ideal.  Very challenging to overcome being trained one way and then unlearn what you were trained in order to learn the real world methods.  The responsibility level and danger level of this job is extremely high.  Safety is an absolute must at all times.  There are many safety requirements and procedures, and a great deal of safety equipment involved.  Responsible for ordering all materials and tools involved in the installation."
good,The good thing about working as an installer was the fact that you meet new people daily. down falls are that gas and supply expenses where not covered so most of you pay was going to that.
good,"AT&T is ALL About the Numbers; the system is called MSOC.  The problem is only the technician is held accountable, not the Planners, Engineers, Materials Managers or Customer; a good MSOC score requires everything be right and ready on the first trip: if the customer room is not ready (correct power outlet, building ground or space for equipment), or the circuit design is wrong or the office equipment or fiber cable hasn't been installed, the install technician takes the hit."
good,Sales consultant that deal with people that don't know how to use there phone so you do a lot of trouble shooting and setting up emails and random phone problems. You also do upgrades and sales the other half. Management are okay well at least most the assistant managers but the General manager can be great or either horrible and goes by the book and isn't willing to work with you. Your co workers are great and the hardest part of your job is dealing with your managers writing you up for not offering something or for not setting up the att app or not demoing digital life. They run on a point system that is weird and you cant request off and they don't work with your schedule and also you do not have life outside your job
good,"Set up new cell phone service for potential business clients, resolved customer account issues and performed trouble shooting routines to resolve technical issues. It was a good company to work for. At times the call volume would get very high and customer patience would be a minimal thats when your customer service skills would be tested. learned a lot about managing cellular business accounts and trouble shooting technical issues. There was mandatory testing to maintain a level of competency in the call center as to laws that needed to be adhered to and also for the implementation of new systems that were put into place. My co-workers were fun loving people that supported one another at all times for the most part."
good,"I could no longer work for a company that had veered in the direction of mandatory six day work weeks as punishment.  The compensation for work was reasonable, however the culture had changed so dramatically within a short amount of time, internally the company was no longer recognizable."
good,"At times workplace was fun, lot of stress and politics there was a lot of secret circles, if you didn't fit in it was hard. he hardest part for me was working with a person that thought I was there to take their job."
good,Fun place to work if you are in a busy location and co-workers are friendly. Company expects huge responsibility for low compensation.
good,"Everyday is always something different its never the same, the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting different people on a daily basis, benefits are good, union takes care of you, some of the managers don't take the lead, but put some their responsibilities on others. And when you really need them the most they are not there. And the good mentors and leaders just don't get enough credit that they should. There are lots of skills you able to pick up and learn along the way."
good,The AT&T call center is a very stressful job. Customers call in with different problems and we are there to assist. The hard part is that we are getting screamed and cussed at with some of the issues being the customers fault. Co-workers are great and we are all willing to help each other.
good,I was at AT&T on a 3 year contract.  This is the longest a contractor can work at AT&T without taking a 6 month break.  My department could not afford to lose me but because of their policy I had to leave.  The department is now having to train other person who will also leave in 3 years.  The learning curve for the position is about a year so it is a huge waste in resources.
good,"AT&T is not a pleasant place to work for, they don't value their employees or their customers. They train you but when they change their policy or protocols they do not give adequate time to shift your practices."
good,"My experience working for DirecTv has its Pros and cons. However I am a person that has always made the best out of whatever situation was presented to me. A typical day at work for me would be arriving 15-30 minutes early, having pre-shift everyday to dicuss the events, sales, goals, etc of the previous day and for the following week. my coworkers were easy to get along with. Management changed quite often during my experience at Directv, however the manangment that was in place upon my arrival was excellent. The hardest part about the job was the amount/ frequency of changes that were made, such as scheduling (hours and days), benefits, and pay rate."
good,"alot of goals to meet. Lots of coaching. More of a corporate way. everything is documented. Doesnt matter how hard you work, if you dont know the upper level management, you will never move up the company. Its not about you can do, its about who you know."
good,Management sucks in my opinion especially the coaches in OJT. They act like high preschoolers. Im only there cause they pay is good but I cant wait to leave
good,"Classroom training is not adequate for the amount of technology that is covered.  They need to implement more ""on the job"" training and system training.  No sick leave. Very minimal paid time off due to the point system.  Employees abused the previous PTO plan therefore it effects the employees who are accountable.  Inadequate security.  Parking lot was unsafe.  I had the air let out of a tire (I was on late shift ending at 11pm)"
good,The senior leadership does have a strong thought out plan for the future.  There is a lot of work going on that will move the company from hardware defined networks to software defined networks.  Training options are in place that enable motivated and capable employees to stay relevant.  If employees don't re-train their jobs will be lost with the automation from hardware to software.  This will create major future reductions in headcount except for those in the correct fields.
good,"Worked in this role for over 7 years.  Gained a lot of experience in how the telephony network worked.  "
good,During the summer months the call volume is fairly slow. Over all ok company to work for. I have learned a great deal about customer retention
good,".  100+ cold calls from an all american clientel with over %50 ratio of irate customers looking to receive rebates on purchased items and plans."
good,"I loved my job!  I enjoyed the employees that reported to me, they are all great people, and good at what they do. I had supportive co-workers. The most enjoyable thing about my job was that I came into work, and I felt like I had a purpose, I felt like I was part of a well oiled machine. I did not find my job to be hard, I enjoyed it, how could something you enjoyed be hard!"
good,"To whom it may concern:"
good,"the pay is great, but not for an honest person. you are required to sell, people don't realize that everyone in the store is a salesperson not customer service."
good,"I have not worked there for various years, I feel like it is just the same as the other wireless companies. the quota's are becoming outrageous and too many products and goals to push onto customers need to reevaluate the company so that it can go back to being fun for everyone and prosper."
good,i worked for AT&T for 11 years.  however they Layoff rate was high.  In the beginning the company was great however due to sales expectations things changed
good,"Not much of a work/life balance if you plan on getting ahead in the company. You will learn sales and match (or hopefully beat) quotas quickly, or you're gone. Union means you have a lot of protection, but they will drill you for your numbers."
good,Workday starts early with technicians arriving to pick up gear for the day or week. Then we move onto larger orders and the next days equipment.
good,"It was an okay work experience. Management can at times be all over the place and lack consistency. However, there is money to be make in retail sales if you apply yourself."
good,"If you want to experience corporate america, this is your chance. Be a part of the politics that go along with it. It's just like highschool, you have cliques that hang out and talk about other cliques. They don't train management very well so most of the time nobody knows whats going on. Everyday there is a new goal that contradicts yesterdays goal. One day you aren't allowed to do something and the next you are allowed and back and forth you go. Also, about every 6 months the company will change the comp structure and it's never in the employee's favor. They call it ""hiding the cheese"" and you must try to find it. What is on your dashboard to sell is not really what's paying out the most. That's the game tho, find the cheese!"
good,"NO culture In the call center work environment. Its all about work, theres no balance between work and family. So to choose could result in disciplinary actions."
good,"Currently working as a Collections rep in a call center. I have learned alot about the collections process. I have been a Manager at AT&T for many years and it is challenging yet rewarding position. The hardest part of the job is the compensation, but overall I enjoy the job."
good,I learned a lot about Telecommunications connectivity performing Internet Support Level II. Systems sometimes difficult to interface due to archaic middle-ware.  Overall a great learning experience and excellent compensation.
good,"For a fresher CTS is not the place. Very less salary, but experience can make a lot of money. "
good,Good pay and benefits. As a sales rep do not expect much respect unless you sale everything in the building. Co workers are nice to each other.
good,"AT&T has a lot of great benefits outside of pay. They offer great medical, 401K and service discounts. AT&T has several great products and services to learn about as a consumer."
good,"Assist customers in setting up various different services while handling various forms of payment and various different customer situations."
good,The money you get in this company is fantastic. Training was always great on new products and systems. They were very thorough in training.
good,"Technical support for DSL customers.  Troubleshoot and resolve connectivity issues, password resets, email issues, remote access to pc and devices."
good,Analyzing problems as soon as you begin to speak with a customer is a way to show your professionalism while also boosting your own ability to solve problems and discover new solutions.
good,"My Day include selling phones, tablets and accessories to meet my goals.  I learned to be more aggressive when it came to selling products.  My co-workers was a fun part of my job because we taught each other alot and shared ideas.  The hardest part was meeting goals on time because of lack of customer coming into the store.  The most enjoyable part was learning about new phones and tablets."
good,There's a lot to learn at AT&T and it's a great starter if you're going into technical sales and or sales in general. Great place to practice up selling and solution selling. Co-workers all get along pretty well and you can really fit in easily in the team atmosphere. Difficulties of the job are quite technical when it comes to solving complex problems. Most enjoyable part of the job is that you get to do all of your work on an iPad that's dedicated for you.
good,"Agile coaching, Scrum master, program Management for various AT&T projects."
good,Decent Compensation plan and good peers. Very high quotas and little work and life balance. Very Sales and number driven organization.
good,"Entrar a mi horario laboral, y comenzar a llamar por teléfono ofreciendo el servicio, aprendí el trato con las personas, como poder expresarme sin trabas y el poder vender un producto satisfactoriamente.  La dirección siempre atenta a lo que yo hacia y si notaban que me ponía nervioso o andaba mal en el sierre de una venta, aclaraban mis dudas para poder progresar y hacerlo bien en mi próxima venta. mis compañeros siempre fueron muy agradables, lo malo de ello que al poco tiempo renunciaban, la parte mas difícil de mi trabajo era permanecer mucho tiempo haciendo el mismo eslogan, parece que no, pero a la larga eso te llega a molestar. Lo que mas me agrado del trabajo es el poder llevarme un poco mejor con las personas mediante el trato que les daba, aprendí mucho de los clientes, yo no savia vender pero lo aprendí gracias a los clientes , en lo personal ellos me enseñaron a vender."
good,Although the compensation was excellent the work life balance and room to advance was very slim. At&t offers excellent benefits.
good,"Long hours. No set schedule. One week you could be working 9 to 6 Monday to Friday, and with only two weeks notice you could be working 4pm to 1am with Tuesday and Thursday off. Sometimes the schedule would stay for a three months and sometimes only one month."
good,"-  good working environment."
good,"sales, customer service, technically savvy"
good,"The position is inside sales as to which sitting inside a cubical all day long might drive you crazy!  I learned that knowing your resource contacts will simply make the job that much easier.  Co-workers are fine, very sociable which is good while sitting in the office all day long.  Hardest part of my job is generate meaningful leads. Most enjoyable part is working from home several days out the month."
good,"I would be to work at 7:30 am every morning ready to answer the phones. I worked in the call center as inbound sales. I had a base salary of 13.75 per hour plus commission for anything sold above the sales projections. The draw-back to this company is that the focus was so much on sales and not on customer service which led to many customer complaints. Also, if a representative did not meet the sales objective, they were fired at the end of the month, regardless of how long they had worked there or previous accomplishments."
good,great team fast paced atmosphere. love for technology is a must. advancement opps are very slim
good,"Forecasting, scheduling, Vendor Management, on shore/offshore call arrival, ASA trend analysis."
good,Great pay and good benefits but the atmosphere was stressful.
good,the company direct sat does not play fair with there technicians. they will have you working more than 8 hours without pay ...
good,"Working for this company allowed for the interaction with many new people. The daily tasks were managing the people (schedules, training, sales coaching, development). Here I learned to always be selling. My co-workers were as diverse as they come in a company. The hardest part of the job here was the retail hours. The most enjoyable part was getting to interact with the people."
good,The turnover rate is extreme. They would let people go for no real reasons at time. There is a chance to grow within the company because everyone quits or gets fired. It's a stressful micro managing company. Your schedule can change every 6 months.
good,AT&T has great potential however changing priorities have hampered significant progress/
good,es una empresa que no deja de ser importante tanto como para el buen servicio que entrega & la orientacion que hay que darle a las personas de vez en cuando es 100% transparente
good,"This is a work@ home position I trained representatives to take billing calls, process payments and renew contrasts. I also took a minimum of 15 hours in calls weekly as a representative. The communication between other IBO's needed improving, the pay did not coincide with the work required of the employees, paid per call not by intervals. The hardest part of the job was communicating updated information in a timely matter due to the way we received information. I enjoyed getting to know people of different cultures, backgrounds and beliefs. It has been a great experience with dealing with and helping people all over the world."
good,This company is all about the numbers. There was no understanding that some customers just give bad scores. They did not appreciate the hard work done on a daily basis. The human connection between management and the employees was extremely lacking. They are more concerned with the customer than the employee.
good,"•	Develop and attain customer experience and sales objectives for store.  "
good,"Good experience with customer's. Union environment. Union is good for some things, but most of the time their grievances are useless."
good,"They overbear their employees with work, give no perks, the management is poor, the working conditions are poor, they pay well but that is about it. Not a very good place to work in my opinion. Very corporate environment, they don't care much for their employees needs."
good,"Work days vary.  Sometimes you get off early and there are other times that you get off late.  But other than that, it's okay.  Learned how to install ""small"" dishes on house tops compared to what I'm use to.  Co-workers are okay.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with bees in the spring, summer and part of fall.  The enjoyable part is meeting new customers on a daily basis."
good,"Very easy to be a middle of the road employee, but someone that exceeds targets and wants advancement is met with resistance"
good,"The Support people are terrible, everyone is trying to stab everyone else in the back."
good,"Help with opening procedures, manage money and take care of inventory. Learned how to take care of all back end procedures, inventory aspects, paperwork, etc. Hardest part of the job is not being able to move up in the company."
good,"Being based on the lower eastern shore of Maryland and your salary and job security being based on sales, you already have an uphill battle to face since the clientele is of a lower income (and educational) background and the local population is in no hurry to stay current with ongoing technological advances. "
good,started out as a customer service help & tell customers about products by the time I left it was throw everything at the customer and hope it sticks.  customer not first concern money is more important
good,"A typical work day involves many things including the following: "
good,"Go in and take phone calls about bills and packages "
good,Job environment was good because of the fact you worked alone. It was a decent job but I never felt as though my job was secure. I constantly felt as though I was about to be fired and that whatever I did never met expectations. This resulted in a very stressful environment with management.
good,"Day to day is about how fast you can get job done and then want to write you up if any little mistake, Some positions do not have any formal training, expect you to pick it up as you work with coworkers. Company does provide good pay and benefits, but seems like a change is coming soon to those also in the near future."
good,10-12 hour days.  Learned about home wiring.  Got long with co-workers and learned something new almost everyday.
good,"If you are interested in working with AT&T and have worked for a Fortune 500 company, be prepared for a job culture shift.  If you are not downtown with the glitz and glamor, you may be stuck in an office of the 1950's.  Expectations for managers may exceed 70 hours in a work week, with no additional compensation.  In addition, nepotism is alive and well."
good,"The job is great. The pay is excellent. There just is zero work-life balance. Very demanding hours and a constant threat of being fired for not ""meeting numbers."""
good,Not the easiest work I've come across but it was challenging and I love a challenge.
good,Great job for teaching me organizational skills and practices. Director was awesome at taking my feedback and allowing me freedom to implement different things.
good,"Friendly environment"
good,"Great job, but there are limitations.Unfair blame, unrealistic expectations,sometimes hazardous working environments."
good,"laid back, listen to music. the owner brought his dog into work daily. the people were nice."
good,"This is an okay job with decent pay. Not as professional as I would have liked, due to too much noise and having a demanding policy about handling our call flow.However, I loved being around my co-workers and developing new friendships there."
good,Could be better.  Poor upper Management and play favorites.
good,"I worked for a 3rd party customer service company through AT&T servicing AT&T customers in the southern United States. While I loved working and communicating with the customers, AT&T was very scripted and by the book. We had a flow sheet that we had to follow which is a script used throughout the entire call with the client. Seriously you had to follow the script on every call word for word...so much so that even annoyed the customers. Nobody wants to feel like they are talking to a robot which is what AT&T makes their employees do. On top of that more than half of my co workers were very young and immature, it felt like high school all over again!"
good,six days a week paid every friday. You should be ready to relocate at anytime because it is a fast growing feild
good,"just adjusting antennas all day. "
good,"My day starts with getting my workload from the computer.  I am sent to whatever should be the most important, but the company does not agree with what I feel is the most important job.  Management has to make sure the numbers work out right, which puts pressure on us to complete the work quicker than is required to make sure customer is happy."
good,"Okay company to work for, management is not all too great. Love the customers and co workers"
good,"Retail hours "
good,"Worst Attendance Policy no work life balance"
good,Great pay but lots of politics! Got to rub the right people the right way or you go no where even if your in the top 5%
good,"Contracted to work Gov/Ed vertical markets for eRate season as a Technical Sales Consultant. Responsible for responding to F470 requests in assigned States, with focus on Ethernet WAN and Internet solutions. Interact with customers to design, propose, and contract network solutions."
good,Not a good place to work employees are justt pawns in a game that the company want to play.
good,"If you want to be micro managed, this is your place to work. If you want an environment that promotes laziness, this is it."
good,"employees work hard for management, very busy work days, the hardest part is other managers don't like to discuss reviews or statuses(for themselves(instead of teamwork). Being part of a fantastic team was the best part!"
good,"Great compensation plan- although the job is very stressful and pretty miserable so if the compensation weren't as good, turnover would be extremely high.  There really isn't much flexibility and unless the center manager really likes you, there is no opportunity for advancement no matter how well you perform."
good,supporting network integration team with project integration/implementation. end to end verification and Defect root cause analysis and resolution.
good,The managers there are the WORST they don't take s.harassment important.
good,the typical day is often fast paced.  You must be on your toes at the open of business.  The hardest part of the job is the lifting and time required to complete processes.
good,"My day starts at 6 am with reports to supervisor of consumptions and on hand equipment. Technicians start to arrive with their used equipment,and request hardware for the week since most come once a week. After 8a.m. daily warehouse count is done followed by scanning in used receivers by type and classification. Then it is on with pulling locker orders for those who have a meeting the next day. After that is done all cardboard is put in the compactor. After lunch a second count is performed to make sure no equipment was missed during locker issue."
good,"pick up paperwork,and phone books enough to run your route.Deliver phone books have companies sign off on paperwork.How to run a route and handle paperwork.Management was good,Never got to get to know any of the co-workers everyone had their own route when you got done with one route you'd drop paperwork off to the office and pick up another route until all the routes was done.finding certain addresses.work at your own pace."
good,There is limited advancement due to they refuse to train for other positions and people refuses to retire.
good,fast paced inbound call center handling customer inquiries and requests with emphasis on upselling new products and services.
good,"Customers Service, Meeting Quotas and expectations with customers."
good,"ITS ALL ABOUT THE NUMBERS, nevermind your life. Moving up in the job is all about who you sleep with, or if you hang out with them outside work"
good,"A typical day at work involved dealing with customers face to face. We were there to resolve technical issues with cell phones or provide a warranty exchange. I learned a lot about how to deal with people and how to de-escalate situations dealing angry individuals. The management team was very reliable and focused mostly on inventory and generating report. I did also take on this role, as the evening supervisor/manager on duty. The position was a contracted position with AT&T, therefore the two management teams sometimes were not on the same accord. I did get along well with all co-workers and staff. This is important due to spending a great deal of time at work together. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customer, and understanding that no situation should be taken personal. The most enjoyable part of the job was resolving the customer's issue and seeing them completely satisfied with the service they had received while in the device support center."
good,"Good quality people to work with, just part time hours. Worked with senior citizens."
good,"I loved my job running the cheese island it was my own little world to with what i wanted i had the freedom to decorate as needed, and i loved working with people all the time and getting interact with them."
good,"Bom ambiente de trabalho, restrição de acessos a alguns clientes e tecnologias."
good,"Great training, Learned all of the AT&T systems, applications, wireline and mobility products at a B2B level. Management was professional and helpful. Co-workers shared the same values and positive attitudes. The hardest part of the job was to obtain sales though mandatory cold calling. The position does not require an MBA or a Bachelor's degree, just a desire to learn. The most enjoyable part was to acquire the extensive and complex knowledge."
good,typical day would be 8 hours on the phone handling billing calls and question on accaount usage. I was able to gain more knowledge and build on my already existing customer service knowledge. The management and training staff are overall good. I was forunate to get one the highly respected trainers there. My co-workers and I got along very well. The hardest part about the job was honeing my navigation skills. What I enjoied the most having those customes that were greatful that I was able to resolve their issue
good,"Compensation is good, good benefits, very fast paced environment. Very stressful. If call center work is your thing, go for it."
good,"Working for AT&T, you can learn just how little some companies can care about individuals, they expect too much from their employees and based their performance on things that are out of the employees control"
good,"You're doing long shifts of constant calls in the call center, answering the same multitude of stupid questions. If you can stand it, then the pay and benefits are worth it."
good,"Installation of satellite systems six days a week."
good,"DirecTv is a diverse workplace that is accepting of various cultures, genders, and multiracial people.  There is no discrimination towards sexual preferences and is an excellent example of how companies can meld together for the common good.  Dealing with irate customers who are not respectful is the hardest part of the call center environment."
good,i was doing door to door marketing by not only selling uverse but also explained to the people what uverse is and the difference between the others cable and internet company out there. After my training the next day i did 3 sales that i received a reward from my manager for a new seller to do that great on his first day.
good,overall i liked this company to work for.. the only thing was that they worked me to much.. it was over 90 hours a week.. but overall i liked it there and the managemnt was really greatr and friendly
good,"Long hours in a call center, customer service part of job is enjoyable."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of receiving inbou500nd calls from AT&T customers and prospective clients interested in services. I learned all of the processes and systems, and how a typical billing and sales department works. The management...well, I never got a chance to meet the upper management of the company. My team lead was the only ""upper management"" figure that I had the opportunity to come in contact with. Co-workers were nice and friendly for the most part, but Convergys does house a lot of negativity I will say. A lot of drama and gossiping. If you don't stay to yourself, its easy to get caught up in it all. The hardest part of my position was the ""sales"" aspect. On every call, you at least had to offer or attempt to sale one service to a customer, and you had to meet a certain dollar goal everyday ($500). But the difficulty in this was persuading a customer to buy something new, when they were already calling in complaining about the service, or why their bill was so high. But the most enjoyable part of the job for me was navigating through the systems. I'm just a computer person though, so maybe that's why I liked that part so much. Another negativity was halfway through my employment there, they cut our hours to part time, when I was originally hired for full-time because of lack in call volume. They would VTO us without warning, and just send you home. This greatly affected my livelihood and my bills at home, because I was not prepared for the change that came so suddenly."
good,A typical day was selling cell phones or doing upgrades for customers. the best thing about it was selling something.
good,AT&T is a giant company with archaic practices of people management. The environment pits permanent employees against contract employees. Contacts employees are taken advantage of with forced overtime and poor work hours where they rarely have weekends off.
good,"despite decent pay and good benefits, this job is less than ideal. the metrics that you have to meet are not impossible, but getting good numbers is out of your hands most of the time."
good,I worker at the inbound good thing u get surrounded by friends but manager screaming behind your ears!
good,"Typical Day:"
good,"Get to the workstation, log into each of the 8 different programs needed to take calls. Answer all kinds of wireless data and cell phone related issues. Take payments for services. I enjoy talking to the customers and helping them with their device issues. The older generation were the most fun to work with because they were so happy when everything would begin to work. The hardest part about the job was trying to sell customers something on each call like a different rate plan, an upgrade, or other wireless features. The worst part about the job was listening to people yell at you for something that you would have no control over. Or those that would have one or two calls drop and they would want the whole month of service for free. All we could do was sit there and listen."
good,"My day use to begin with logging in to mark the attendance and be ready to begin the working hours. "
good,las personas muchas veces contratan personas para trabajar muchas hs y pagar poco
good,I enjoyed working for AT&T for the most part. They train their managers to develop you and make you grow into the position you want to potentially get to.
good,Die position ist gut fuer studenten die noch nie ein arbeits erfahrung hatten
good,"At  A&TT I installed telephone, television and internet for AT&T customers, this consist of running inside wire, coaxel cable, installed residential gateway and  programming  at the customers site DVRs for TV viewing, telephone service and internet service."
good,"	Conferred with customers by telephone or in person to provide information about products or services, take or enter orders, cancel accounts, or obtain details of complaints."
good,When I worked at att it was part time in a small town. We had shorter hours so the work life balance was pretty good. Pay wasn't great as a part time rep but it also wasn't my main priority. I was a full time college student. Management at the time had no experience and reps took care of more management stuff than the actual managers.
good,This was a great job. The only thing it was missing was the promotion program. They had no advancement program when I worked there.
good,"AT&T started great. Pay is higher then most retail places, although it is constantly changing it is still realistically better then most. The issue is they are constantly looking for ways for employees to make less, so after awhile employees become bitter of the changes and cut backs. The commission structure isn't the only constant change, management of all levels changes constantly, which leaves stores unorganized and feeling uncertain. Expect to go times with no straight direction. Sales are very competitive, if you are not aggressive you will not enjoy the constant focus on sales. Job security feels unsafe at times due to the focus changing so often between both products to sell and expectations on employees. In reality your job is secure as long as you do not fold under pressure and hit goals constantly. Work life balance is nonexistent, say bye to your family and friends."
good,"AT&T was a good place to work with room to advance for many years.  I learned a great deal both professionally and personally.  "
good,"Fast Pace Job with a lot of changes. Employees are great to work with, local management looks for moving people out then developing them."
good,It was not a very stable work environment.  Management was hard to get along with and did not seem to care about life out side of work.  Not a very fulfilling job as customers always seemed to be upset about one thing or another.
good,I started off with a training class of 30 after training there was 4 people left. 26 people quit before time on the phone started.
good,"Multi-task using computer, navigate several programs, provide professional, friendly customer service, offer other services on every call and meet time constraints and sales quota."
good,Do not work in the call center!!!!!! You cannot even take a bathroom break without a coach coming looking for you to get back on the phones.
good,Buena empresa pero con no muy buen ambiente de trabajo y beneficios como empleado.
good,"I did not work for Directv. I work as a sales consultant for Verizon. I do however, sale Directv products to customers that are unable to get Verizon Fios services."
good,You develop great communication skills but call center work is not for everyone.
good,Decent job three years ago when I started now it is difficult to make money and the job is more about selling things not related to cell phones
good,"The compensation is amazing, but the stress of the job is beyond words."
good,Work started out being tough with very long days until I became more comfortable doing the job. It became  easier and easier and more profitable after about 1 yr. But after awhile I started getting a little burned out. They started pushing us harder and harder. Then I got injured on Christmas eve. I was put on light duty till I was cleared to go back to full duty. But  they put a performance expectation on us that I was not able to keep up with following my injury. Then they let me go.
good,I enjoyed the pay and the benefits. It seems they can't keep anyone because they have a point system that anyone with children can't go by.  It is a great job for single person with no children .
good,I worked with this company for 5 years and let me tell you it had ups and downs.
good,"empresa onde trabalhei com bastante satisfação,tinha excelente slário pela minha jornada de 6 horas excelentes benefícios e ótimo ambiente de trabalho"
good,"Directv wasn't a bad place to work but there was no job security. The policies and procedures were changed almost daily from procedures that worked to maintain customers to procedures that made it difficult for tenured agents to maintain goals. The benefits, pay and incentives were excellent. My co-workers were like family which made going to work every day the best part of the day. Typically we would sign into our systems and be ready to take calls. Breaks and lunches were often stretched out too far which made it difficult to focus."
good,"The job had its ups and down but for the most part it was ok.  I learned most of my customers service from here, dealing with all types of customers."
good,My job will be eliminated on 10/11/2013. It will be outsourced to India or Brazil
good,"A typical day involves installing U-verse services "
good,My employment with at&t has allowed me to expand my knowledge in many emerging technologies.  I have had extensive training here but I feel that I have reached a plateau and cannot progress further in my current position.
good,Promised a certain amount out of the army and didnt get it when i was officially offered the job.
good,I have worked there almost 3 years and over all very happy. Just want to move up and have been top 3% in sales in the country 2 years in a row and for some reason they keep promoting other people with less experience. 
good,"fast place installation and repairs"
good,loved my job in the beg. everyone i worked with was amazing no le-way on points. was let go for denial of fmla when i was out due to surgery 
good,"The hardest part of my job was producing a 30-minute show"
good,Its not a bad place to work but it is very annoying to hear customers complain about there services and how they cant figure out their remotes. guessing they dont know how to read the manual of operations.
good,"They dont care about their employees, they arent considerate of parents when it come to emergencies with their kids. They care more about the customers than they do the employees. You dont have a set shift and you work wkd and holidays."
good,"I like working a Direct TV and enjoy meeting new people; however, the pay was not steady.  The paychecks varied greatly wek to week"
good,Difference in Philosophy from Top to Bottom. Leadership and Management needs to be on the same page.
good,"I have been at At&t for alomost ten years enjoy helping customers with conflict resloution of services.  At&t has taught me to be patient and always listen to the customer and provide them with options of At&t to help with other service in their home. Some Mangement in the call center is just ok, they need to be trained on handling situation with both employees and customers situations.  My coworkers are the most helpful people they are my second family.  The hardest part of the job is knowing how to resolve the conflict but not having access to resources to fix the problem.  Most enjoyable part of my job is making my customers smile when they start off being very upset."
good,You don't feel that you are valued. Love the work I do the customers are nationwide-- 
good,"Company got so big almost impossible to feel like you could make a difference. "
good,"I enjoy the freedom of working out doors. I deal with all types of people, some customers were very pleasant, but others were not interested. Some days I made good money and others none, but its all about how long I dedicated to go out and work ."
good,Poor upper management. Middle management was restrained to much to assist employees
good,"The only typical part of any day was that there would be a que of calls.  Each call was different in that each customer's problem or issue was theirs and they wanted quick and correct answers, not always the one I could give them. I learned the inner workings of the cell phone industry and that cell phones could be a pleasure as well as a burden for our customers.  Management at the team level as adequate at best.  I found the competition between co-workers more of a distraction then a motivation.  The hardest part of the job was not being able to solve a customer's issue and having to pass them alone, not knowing if they would get resolution.  The best was helping the customer, especially a new one, navigate and understand not just their bill but their service plan and all their options. "
good,"The benefits are wonderful but the hours are hard. I have learned a lot from AT&T, got a lot of great experience. However, some areas that we work in are not very safe"
good,It could be a very interesting job as you were talking with different customers every day with various problems and questions. That was the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part of the job was trying to meet company requirements which kept changing and were sometimes unrealistic to meet and still maintain the service to the customer.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of handling the customers concerns about their wireless services. I have learned that patience is a virtue when it comes providing excellent customer service. I have also learned basic technical aspects about wireless devices. My co-workers are super. We work together as a team to ensure that our customers are satisfied and happy. The hardest part of my job would be not being able to always provide the customer with what they may be requesting. I do believe that when their request are valid, we should be able to go the extra mile to fullfill their request, within reason of couse. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I hear in their voice that they are geninely happy with me and the company. For them to let me know that I have fullfilled their request and helped them, it makes me smile. I love going above and beyond to ensure that the customers are happy. Happy customers means more customers; which also means more revenue for the company; which eventually helps the employees. "
good,great working hours and easy work simple easy to ways to pick orders.
good,ATT was a great place to work and I enjoyed many of the people it came into contact with
good,"A typical day at work involved learning about managing my own company and how to create for myself a better future. I was given people weekly if not daily to train for my team, it was a sales job. My manager is an awesome guy and a very good boss. My co-workers were not up to par for some of what needed to be done. In my opinion the hardest part of the job was just trying to sell Directv to a market that became more and more saturated. The best part of the job in my opinion was talking to the various people that came by throughout the day."
good,"A typical day for managers at AT&T is a very ""full"" day - rarely an eight hour work day.  I learned that establishing your own work/life balance is very important.  Regardless of what the company ""line"" is, only you can determine what is acceptable for you and your family. Being a part of a good team is the most enjoyable part of the job, so it's important to build good working relationships.  "
good,"There just have been drastic changes where i can't afford to live a non stressful life. Management micro-manages, i would prefer to be work environment where we can have fun and not be so tensed up plus make more money."
good,Working for AT&T was one of my best jobs i have ever had becuase of all the knowledge i got on cellphones and all the fun i had with my co-workers.
good,I started with this company when it was owned by Pacific Bell. They were an excellent company to work for. They showed that they really cared for their employees. Over the years it was clear that it was all about the bottom line and less about the employees. They did have good benefits and 401K. Management was a mix of either great managers or managers who had absolutely no clue what they were doing.
good,"PAY IS GREAT! HOWEVER THE TURNOVER RATE IS REDICULOUS. Management does not care about your problems, as longs you are there ready to sell and no excuse! You must be logged in no more than 2 min after your shift starts or you will mark an occurrence! 3x and you're out the door!"
good,no teniamos descanso los francos los trabajabmos medio dia o todo el dia aprendi a socialisarme con la gente a ser una buena vendedoras con objetivos de trabajo q me ponian me gusta superarme en todo trabajo mis compañeros muy buenos la parte dificil estar trabajando 8 hs corridas y salir y tener q seguir andando en la calle sin tener un minuto para star con la flia lo que me gustaba que podia conocer mas a la gente y aprender cosas nuevas
good,The store was usually busy and chaotic. It lacked proper supervision. A maximum of three people worked there. I really didn't enjoy working with a particular co-worker but rode it out to keep my job. I ended up quitting because I felt unsafe working there. Security was a joke.
good,Hours are between 10 am -7 pm. You learn how to do sales and hire and build a sales team.
good,A typical day at work was making sales and assisting customers.
good,"Over the ladder years at AT&T the culture changed drastically. It went from being an environment completely focused upon customer satisfaction and the happiness of employees, to one that was centered around only trying to achieve goals by any means necessary. This caused for a very hard work environment where everyone was always afraid of the managers above them."
good,Most mornings there were in office sales meetings where we
good,"Basically we deal with cell phones, u-verse and any wired products from TV, internet, and home phone and we take care of service issues whether it's billing or phone questions. New customer activations or upgrades, setting new phones up, etc. I've learned to be more patient with each customer coming into the store because a lot of them know what they want, some need help with using new phones. Co-workers are a great asset and we all help each other in the long run. The managment team could be a bit better. A lot of micro-managing that doesn't need to be part of the work area, lot's of exaggeration and ""power trip"" managment. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and they open up to us about everything about their lives. The hardest part of the job is the managment team."
good,"Lindo trabajo, para un estudiante, te ayuda mucho."
good,There wasnt any room for advancement. I was not satisfied with the job responsiblities I was given
good,"A typical work day at DirecTV consist of a lot of traveling from job to job. One hard thing for most tech would be mounting satellite dishes on 2nd story on windy and rainy days due to the fact that it's slippery and a danger to the tech. The good things about job is that it's peace work, meaning the more work you get done, the bigger your paycheck. Co-workers tends to help each out because you can each done quickers."
good,"Inbound calls to sell produce. Sold local service, long distance and toll free number. Lots of employee support and encouragement. Almost like a family environment"
good,A typical day at work: waiting for customers to come through the door and assist them with any questions concerns or problems they may have. I've learned that every customer is different and each of them need to be treated differently. Management is helpful at times but mostly inconsistent. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the office politics. Management isn't very supportive of their sales persons and each person is only out for themselves. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with co workers because they're helpful.
good,aprendí a tener mas personalidad a lidiar con las necesidades de los clientes y a buscarles lo que mas les acomodava
good,It was an ok place to work. Good pay and benefits. The hours aren't flexible if you're in school.
good,Era Un Trabajo Muy Facil Los Companieros Eran Buenos Me ayudaban Me Gustaba Porque Era Part Time y Me Permitia estudiar.
good,"A typical day, come to work ontime clock in and answer inbound calls, helping customer with past due balance, trouble shoot their phones, general questions about a product. Then LUNCH AND BREAKS , clock out and go home"
good,Enjoyed co-workers and working with the public. No job security. Temporary job. Assignment ended.
good,"The job itself is not that bad, sometimes like with all customer service you get bad customers. The job left me thinking corporate types do not care about employees, they only care about the bonus they will get at the end of the year."
good,AT&T was a great company to work for however the civil lawsuit filed by several AM's in my position against the leadership at AT&T regarding the unethical commission payment practices lead to me leaving the company.
good,Work/life balance is nonexistent. Dynamic and growing company but very cut-throat and political.
good,"Thats right thry are growing but sometimes they have more growing pains than they plan, and it all falls on the technicians to bear the pain but Management dosent care about that. its all about their numbers."
good,"I received incoming calls from customers regarding all AT&T account services needs, from inquires, payments, changes , selling products, retention, tech support etc"
good,"procedures change on daily bases so you have to stay on top of all your emails, training, great co workers but managemnet is not all the great . your team leads sometime dont know how to answer your questions because they have never taken a call in that center before.. but in all a good experince"
good,Responsible for organizing computer systems knowledge and time-management skills to attain sales goals in a efficient manner; Work within a team setting; Communicate effectively with customers as well as co-workers within a sales environment; Able to multi-task sales and customer service within an extremely fast-paced work environment.
good,"Very ambitious atmosphere, a lot of motivational offers to help you do well at your job. I really enjoyed my co-workers. They were the best part of working for Directv. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with the constant changes and the increases in the charges that are added yearly. A very stressful place to work."
good,"Excellent pay, but very stressful. Bad management. No upward mobility for jobs."
good,"A typical day involves speaking with customers regarding their account. Questions about the bill, looking to cancel service, looking to change service and rarely setting up new service. I had a thorough training in multiple systems that I use while speaking with customers. Multi-tasking is a must. Customer Service is part of the compensation as well as sales. I enjoy my manager very much. He really knows how to motivate. It's wonderful when you are able to help a customer that is really frustrated. Unfortunately, some customers aren't able to be satisfied and use some harsh words."
good,Work in retail enviornment with great employees and good managment.
good,Worked 9-6
good,"Hardest part of the job the management and policy changes that are contradictory , one day you are to do this then the next it changes"
good,"Good benefits.. health insurance, vision, dental, 401k, vacation, personal days, sick days. Management and co-workers are very friendly and willing to help when you need help with job questions or time off. Unfortunately, very little opportunities for job advancement."
good,"This would be a great job for someone who is a natural sales-man. Far me, the lack of stability, career advancement did not out-weigh the benefits."
good,"Not an employee friendly company to work for. Outrageously demanding expectations of employees, and no negotiation as far as performance. Management states they want feedback about the working conditions, but do not act on valid suggestions."
good,"Working for 24-7 Intouch, selling cell phones for AT&T was a nice place to work. I enjoyed the people I worked with, and the job was repetative but easy to do. You had to follow a 5 step sales program, which really helped with making sales. I did a good job there, and I made many sales for the company. I had to leave because I moved out of Winnipeg. My typical day at work was get to work, load up the AT&T website, sit and chat with people wanting to buy cell phone contracts. I learned a lot of about cell phones and the benefits of each phone. The management kept to themselves, but the team leaders were great and very helpful. The hardest part of the job was when you chatted with an angry customer, but the supervisors were very helpful in those situations. The best part of my day was working with my co-workers."
good,"Every day at work is the same, I do the same thing everyday. Once a week we have an hour of meeting/training in whch we learn what policies and procedures are changing. You are pushed on a daily basis to make sales. The hardest part of the job is the stress level., the most enjoyable part of the day is when i go on my lunch break."
good,sales on a daily basis
good,llegaba y repartía volantes explicándole a la gente las promociones del servicio.
good,"Not an overly energetic company at the time. I learned from a great mentor, and a handful of other innovative people, but they were the exception rather than the rule. Compensation was solid and competitive, however the future outlook was bleak."
good,"A typical day at work was constantly busy I learned how important time-management was in order to meet the demands and goals. My management practices was consistent, fair and I gained the trust of my direct reports in/outside the work environment. My co-workers were great to work with and would freely consult with me on any issues they had or were not familiar with. The hardest part of the job was getting everyone at times to get on board with the drastic changes we sometimes faced. The most enjoyable part was that I would win many contest because of my teams performance and get to go to lunch with the Director or monetary gifts and prizes."
good,"n/a Was full time almost 10 years when layoff occured due to surplus, was brought back as a temporary employee for a 6 month contract 7 months later.Att was fazing out CST's"
good,"Over worked, not enough selling time, learned about search engine marketing, search engine optimization, advertising practices"
good,At&t is a large corporation that is not very personal with their employees and customers. I enjoyed my job because I was able to accomplish things that I worked hard for and complete objectives. The company is a decent company with a large variety of people.
good,"A typical day at AT&T involved; arriving at work, if early you have to wait to sign into computer and head set, once this is done you have to be ready to take calls a minute after signing in. The day starts quickly once you are signed in calls start coming in on you line, each call is an oppurtunity to make a sell but each caller may not be interested in buying a product. I learned a lot of motivational and interpersonal skills from manaagement. They were great at giving u skils on time management and over coming objections from our customer base. My co workers helped in the learning process by either helping you with an account or sharing with you a script that helps make a sell. The hardest part of the job is the routine of every call, which was untimatley every day. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customer at those that were nice and the pay and benefits."
good,The company has a great history and definitely something you can be proud of. Management is knowledgeable. Co-workers are professional and helpful.
good,"There was a day what AT&T was rated the most desired company to work for where employee moral was high. Moral is no longer what it used to be, employee recognition is little, benefits have diminished (as it has with most corporations), however if you can handle the union mentality a person can work with this company for several years."
good,"Expect unrealistic goals, favorites hired in management, labels employees instead of allowing each department/team member to form their own opinion."
good,Depends upon where you are located globally the work life varies. The Health care and compensation is ok. The office environment is very serious no non sense.
good,A normal day would be greeting customers and taking care of any issues or purchases they need to make.
good,It's all about Management with this company. There are a lot of people in management who are not people friendly. AT&T started out as a very fun working challeenging environment. Toward the end it became very stressful and thats only for people with disabilities. If you have an illness than you cannot take off without the worry of loosing your job. So if you have any disability this is not the job for you but if not than a great company to work for.
good,A typical day was very routine.
good,"As a sales agent, the pay is great. You receive hourly plus commission. Also benefits are fully paid. Job is stressful as it is sales driven, time off is close to impossible. Vacation time is discouraged as it affects your numbers. Environment is very noisy and sometimes club like. Music plays loud and workers chat loudly about things unrelated to the job. Sometimes unprofessional! Great company if you can get pass those things."
good,Very focused and organized company. Numbers driven. Trainng and development focus.
good,At&t Advertising solutions was going thru a turbulent time when I left. Advertising sales in general anywhere are under great stress and this job is no exception.
good,Each day was met with intense pressure to meet sales goals on a daily basis. I exceeded these goals but most employees did not. The co-workers were highly trained and committed to their jobs and the satisfaction of the customers. I learned how to work in an intense environment with stong sales goals.
good,"A typical day at work includes, answering phone calls from anywhere in the US and selling At&t products. I have learned that customer service is a plays a big part of sales. There are some managers that need a little work on how to be a manager. They need to understand that it takes more that an title to be a leader. The hardest part of my job is that it is the same thing everyday. The most enjoyable part of my job is talking to different people everyday, you never know who you will get on the other line. My co-workers are great."
good,"This job was extremely fast paced and challenging at times. Much of this was due to the poor job security and inconsistent leadership. Learned alot about business and enjoyed the product. However, the organization needs some changes in its leadership to improve it customer service for its consumers and employees."
good,"a typical day at work consist of answering calls after calls after call and fixing technical, billing, general inquiries, and collections."
good,"I was taught how to deal with customers both friendly and upset. Typical day at work required lots of talking, and standing. I had to offer solutions and build rapport with customers. My coworkers are my family away from home. We have our disagreement but we love each other. The hardest part of the job was leaving. I enjoyed helping people solve their problems."
good,its has decent pay and great benefits. However the ever changing polices at this company will eventually get old to you. The customer are never satisfied expect to receive an irate customer at least every hour. and if u are not trying to make at&t ur career then this is not the place for u to move up. There are opportunities for advancement but only really in a call center environment. ive worked her for 5 years and have had 2 promotions which is great! but if u have a particular area that u might have went to school for and are hoping to use it as this company its probably not gonna happen. Its a call center environment most of the opportunities are at the call center. Overall its a great JOB. But not a great CAREER.
good,Age & Gender discrimination
good,Great learning experience. Very busy days taking care of the customers.
good,A good job for the most part if you can put up with production matrices and rude customers/
good,•a typical day at work:40
good,A typical day at work consist of assisting the customers with issues with their phone equipment or their ipads. Assisting with payment arrangements and billing issues and credits as well as technical support and warranty issues.
good,Very satisfying work developing employees with a fun but challenging environment. Most difficult aspect as a supervisor was the ever-changing approach to management where not all members of management team were on the same page.
good,"Great pay and benefits, not a good work / life balance. There's a lot of knowledge gained about the communications industry and technology."
good,Company was great when it was LA Cellular with Hank Bonde leading the way. Once AT&T came in everyone became a number instead of a person.
good,"A fair company overall. However very stringent job growth development. Opportunities to grow within the company is limited. Organization is undergoing a restructuring and weeding mentality. Thus, limiting bottom to top growth but on the other hand embracing newer outside talent."
good,"Working at AT&T is a constant challenge due to the evolving nature of telecommunications. These challenges are welcomed for the most part, because new technological advancements are exciting. Being able to demonstrate to consumers how these advancements can make their lives better is a welcomed reward."
good,"Work Life Balance is dependent upon your leaders. You will enjoy working with new people on a daily basis, also, if you enjoy change, this is the place to be."
good,Corporate Culture limited by time constraints and drowned in cycle time. Ideas are shared but not put into play.
good,the money was NEVER what i was promised ...management has the take it or leave it feeling
good,"AT&T is a good organization to work for if you have a sales background and looking to make good money. If you are looking for career advancement or a work/life balance, then AT&T is not the job."
good,"Selling cell phones is fun for a while, but working with an authorized retailer has its downsides."
good,"When I worked for this company, I liked working with my store manager and coworkers. The district manager I worked for could have used some people skills. Overall, I as happy with the company, but the pay and district manager is what forced me to leave."
good,The jobs that I was sent to were pretty good jobs and the pay was pretty good.
good,Pays well but not much job security unless you have been there for 20+ years. No real oppurtunities for advancement
good,"I learned how to deal with many people, and to assist them in resolving their issues"
good,"AT&T has an excellent benefits package, including paid vacation, medical, dental, and vision for individuals or family. The company also provides a competitive 401K, and Pension plan."
good,not good to work for threw contractors. they seem to only care when sales are high and fire u if it drops for a few days.
good,"It's great to have a job in which you are able to build working relationships with customers and coworkers. It's also not the most challenging position, when it comes to your immediate duties, though it is sales oriented, there for you are expected to meet quota. The downfall of a retail sales consultant position for me, is the lack of benefits for part-timers, as well as, the never ending rising of goals. Stress comes with any sales position, it's something you must be prepared for."
good,Fast pasted office driven by the sales. Great compensation package. Strict attendance policies and daily sales goals must be met. Constant monitoring of calls and feedback from management.
good,It is not the company I hired on with in 1973. It was a great company to work for. The only jobs available now are contract jobs less than 1 year. I would not recommend this place to work.
good,"Cingular Wireless provides a comfortable business casual atmosphere and contains a variety of well qualified, serious, career minded professionals. During the a t & t and Cingular Wireless merger, Cingular Wireless, one of the fastest growing wireless communication service companies in America, has given me"
good,coworkers were great and management was fun. I loved the benefits and many rewards that came for being successful at my job.
good,At&t is a fun place to work and there are always exciting new products that you can share with customers and colleagues. It would be nice if they offered some more flexibility with shifts
good,Layoffs quarterly to meet stakeholder numbers. not a stable company and advancements are terrible. the only people advancing are the ones already in executive positions.
good,"Good benefits but the Leadership needs a lot of work.   AT&T care more about the bottom line than their employees, they prefer to outsource and get cheap labor instead of keeping employees who are knowledgeable and already trained."
good,Was a neat place to work just would have been better if was easier to advance and not have to keep raising sales quotas. Every ring you hit you goal was not good enough
good,"High pressure sales environment. Great training. Long hours. Good benefits. Salary plus commission. If you're strong in sales, you will advance quickly."
good,It has changed year after year since I have been employed-it's not the same as when I started. But overall a good place to work with some good people.
good,Very fast pace and stressful.  Lot of information to learn to be successful and training is not complete.  The flexibility to work from home when needed.
good,"This was a sales position, first and foremost. So it wasn’t at all what was described in the initial job listing. There was a pressure to stay at your desk and take as many calls as humanly possible. If you have a seller’s mentality, this is the perfect job for you. "
good,"They are not flexible about their hours, commission structure always changes in the interest of the company, and always seem to micromanage you about most details"
good,"In my option I did not like how they sabotage there employees , and set them up for failure.  Any employee that had long time employment they would find ways to get them out for the new hires and cheaper labor.  The team leaders were general very good to work with.  Area Manager was not and would pretend that they are for you and as long as you was doing something for them rather it was in violation or not it was good until they wanted to gain points for themselves,"
good,"It is an okay place to work. It is a good place to get your foot in the door, but the company does not care about their customers. It feels like its our job."
good,"Only certain departments are flexible on working from home. It used to be so much nicer working at At&T before all the mergers and downsizing. Towards the end, every year was a roll of the dice about who would get laid off."
good,"AT&T is great because they do actually promote from within, and they provide training internally to their employees. That said, their benefits package is pretty awful, and they pay as little as they can manage."
good,"Great benefits, better than any place else I've worked, but on the contracting side the pay is very low. If you want to make a career there, get out of the govt solutions side and go to work for AT&T proper."
good,"One thing that becomes apparent is that you have a lot of leeway to decide how to be productive but it is important that you are so. "
good,Then as time went along you noticed the continual layoffs and you knew you would eventually be let go too. it's a bad feeling waiting for your eventual last day. the company gives you the feeling that they are more concerned with their profits then the employees or even the customers.
good,"Seems a bit chaotic at times, but the people are nice to work with; more documentation and following Agile Scrum religiously would help; flexibility and being a team player are a must here."
good,"That there is a lot of goals to hit and you really need to be shark. You also have to make sure that you like working nights a lot so if you think your going to be home at night, this job is not for you."
good,"It’s a great place to work if you have no opinions and no life. You will go far. Just follow the yellow brick road. "
good,"Overall the team was great, consisted of contractors as the majority.  Management wasn't as impressive as had hoped bit. Very delightful experience, developed a great relationship with Dev teams on and offsite."
good,Comp structure went through a lot of changes. Corporate focus changes weekly placing a lot of pressure on management and employees. This results in a very stressful/negative work atmosphere.
good,"Es una empresa que tienes muy buenas comisiones, pero en algún punto se vuelven inalcanzables debido a estos generan malas prácticas, descuidan la atención al cliente por las ventas"
good,"AT&T is filled with people who respect one another and are consummate professionals. They own their successes and failures, and strive to improve from each."
good,No job security even tho it’s union. You never know when u get to go home because u have to clear all the jobs for the day. It’s was all about you metrics and how fast and accurate you did your job. You can’t get fired for numbers but can get written up. You work all day by your self which is nice. Some managers are micro managers and some leave you alone. They were laying off people everywhere. Over all the job was nice but no job security had me leave.
good,No Job security. Layed off after 5 years along with hundreds of others. Great pay and benefits. upper management rides you everyday about unrealistic expectations.
good,"Ive enjoyed my 19 years with AT&T and have been a part of several transformative projects and acquisitions.  I was a key player in the launch of the original iPhone, Ive have been a part of merger acquisition teams for DTV and other high profile initiatives and I am ready to move on to something new."
good,"The job was very relaxing, sometimes stressful but other than that. I learned more about customer service because it was a face to face contact. Would very much recommend to a lot of people to seek out their customer service skills."
good,Quaterly lay offs no job security but great money good vacation time I never felt comftorbale in this job but I learned a lot of things that may be able to use elsewhere.
good,I love working with the people there but little by little they started to take the power away from customer facing employees. Their only purpose was to sale. We can hardly give any actual help to upset customers which actually upset them more.
good,"Long hours, number on a spread sheet feel. Management really only cares about number. Although pay is great, its not worth the stress don't recommend job if you have a family."
good,"This was a good career opportunity with benefits, 401, and little opportunity to move up. I managed 7 years after 4 1/2 years in the field and it got more demanding as the years went by. All employees were micromanaged, whether you  were a technician or upper management."
good,It if a fun and competitive environment. I feel like I have bee surviving for the most part. The hardest part of the job is feeling absolutely no job security.
good,"this is a high stress job not cut out for everybody. It’s a great job and pays well, but heavily micromanaged and your job is always on the line. “Coaching” is more a prosecution. Do not expect to be rewarded or recognized for things you do here. If you need reassurance in the workplace this isn’t the place for you."
good,AT&T is a massive company with many different divisions and many different types of jobs. Depending on the position held the hours can be challenging for people with young children.
good,You learn to constantly make adjustments. The work environment and duties are constantly changing. It can be extremely competitive. I personally enjoyed the challenge. I didn’t enjoy the pay cut in commission.
good,It was busy and there was a lot to learn at that job. I learned a lot about construction. The most enjoyable part about the job was getting exercise working outside every day.
good,"Learned a lot at at&t, however the ability to grow and move up within the company was not at all possible. If sales goals where hit, they still wanted to more and commissions were okay. If a manager was not happy with your performance then work environment would suffer."
good,Great place to work with loads of discount and benefits. This place can be stressful and toxic when it comes to reaching goals.  they often want you to do some shady stuff to get the sale so be careful
good,"When I first started with ATT I was on call 24x7.  Then system administrator work was offshored to India.ssue  I moved to a group of sys admins who worked to reme "
good,Benefits were great job security was good as long as you did everything exactly like they wanted you to. Work life balance was horrible as they would change your schedule whenever they wanted to fit their needs
good,"Store management was not consistent in handling correcting behaviors, if youre new its very stressed but if youre a veteran employee then it doesnt matter and isnt a ""problem"""
good,"If you need a job with great for the job you actually do, this place is great. If you expect anything else, you will be disappointed. Basic knowledge of SA and networking with clearance is only requirement."
good,"The company does very little to attract, compensate and keep young talent. Most people you work with will have 20+ years experience with minimal career ambition. It's a very lowkey work environment with not enough work to go around for non technical positions, this makes working from home and raising a family ideal but it's not much good for spry up-and-comers. It is a nice and welcoming work environment, in a quaint senior home sort of way. If you want a more engaged and lively experience, absolutely do not work anywhere outside of the Dallas HQ or El Segundo... every other location I have experienced are ghost towns with ""culture"" or ""engagement"" events equivalent to elementary school get-togethers in a suburban small town library."
good,The job was okay. You just can't be late or Miss more than enough of days. There's a two-week training in class on the computer. And you can't take anything home and you cannot miss any days
good,"There should be more room for improvement and failsafe. Every one has room to improve.  Be sure all assignments are completed according to company Guide lines and ""Document"" all duties performed and any possible persons giving alternate direction."
good,"Good union job, they take care of you. Can be stressfull. Just remember to offer accessories, internet and direct tv to every customer. Managers will be watching and observing you. Be on your game."
good,"My experience with AT&T has been through a 3rd party company, but the sales plans are fair, the job is repetitive, it is hourly and commission, and they are flexible with your schedule. If you want more money stay motivated and get more sales, simple as that. If you are producing decent numbers they will give you more hours if you should want them. You basically are inside of Walmart trying to get new phone activations or upgrades with their exclusive offers through Walmart."
good,"If they change management, it would be a great place to work. Too many thirsty men work in management. The job was a little stressful because a quota of calls had to be met. It was ok but the pay could have been better. You have to take outside calls from AT&T customers and try to up-sale them products such as cell phones. All call were monitored and I was let go because I called a crying baby a girl and it was a boy."
good,"No se lleva control del personal, mucha rotación,  se requiere mucha paciencia"
good,They pay and benefits are better than most employers. The drive for profits puts customer service on the back burner and as an employee you are left to deal with the repercussions.
good,"Job was constantly changing, which was fine,  but there was no real training to prepare for the changes in my job title.  I had to make the effort to reach out to those with more knowledge and learned by trial and error."
good,Great place to work. You must be commission driven as well as motivated to work here. The management structure is okay but politics plays a big role with moving up.
good,This is ridiculous. I do not want to take this survey and to be honest feel annoyed that I have been forced to do so. As you can see from the rating it's not that great of an experience.
good,Never felt so stressed to sell. I don't mind offering service to people but to be pushy on each call is not me. This job is not for everyone. It seems cool at first but the job is stressful no wonder it pays good. They pay you for the stress but I rather get paid less and be happy to go to work.
good,I was very good at my job. The only reason I quit was to further my education. I was fresh out of highschool when I started. I needed something that was more of a face to face job.
good,"No work/life balance, you work the schedule they give you. Expect to work mandatory overtime, no Mondays off, work weekends, quotas constantly changing, unrealistic sales quotas. They fire very easily, no job security even with a union."
good,"Although the company pays good, working 10-12 hrs. a day with one weekend off a month is not good for the family man. Working a forced 6 day week continually means you miss almost all important family events (especially if you have kids)."
good,"In the beginning it seemed to be a great place to work. Now that everything is ""metric"" driven, the company seems to be going down the drain. Forced 6 days, they're pushing techs to sale wifi extenders, management is nonexistent because they have unnecessary work to complete. Dispatch do not have a clue about the areas because they're in Michigan while we are in Ohio. There could be a job around the corner from you, but they will assign you one 30-45 minutes away. It's like upper mngmt wants lower mngmt to write techs up over any and everything. So many techs have quit, managers are laid off at a rapid rate. It's a scary situation now here at this company. The physical part of the job is nothing to me, the mental part isn't either, it is the movement of the uppers that is the shaky part. Should I stay to see the outcome, or should I jump ship???"
good,"My employees and coworkers were great, but company removed cubes/offices and implemented open offices with temp workstations under promise of telecommuting flexibility, then forced everyone to be in the office without their own space or telecommuting option.  Constant fear of reductions, outsourcing, or forcing employees to become contractors, all to save the company a little money, resulting in a lot of talent and knowledge being chased away, and productivity lost to open office gossip and rumors and low morale."
good,"Pays well but very poor management. I felt as if I were just another number. Working there was definitely challenging. I feel as if they weren’t so harsh on employees, they wouldn’t loose the good ones"
good,"It’s a decent job, just make sure you’re prepared to not have a life outside of work and also expect to work full time hours even though you’re part time"
good,"Micromanaged to death. Being safe is one thing, using safety as a weapon to brow beat you is another. I enjoyed helping my customers but management hinders you in every way."
good,"If you have many years of service at at&t, you don't have to work much under Union. When time to lay off, years of service count instead of your performance."
good,"The company no longer has a work/life balance and the goals overrule the customer experience.  It doesn't matter if the customer already has a service, we need to find a way to repackage it and sell it to them again.  Or be coached and written up."
good,"great atmosphere and I got to meet different people every day and help them. It takes some time to get used to, but it was all worth it in the end. Customers sometimes have their hard times, and sometimes it just takes some effort from a technician to turn their whole day around."
good,"It was a great foot in the door to telecommunications. The longer I worked there though, the more and more responsibilities were pushed onto us without compensation reflecting these changes. Healthcare went up with my yearly union raises as well so even though you were getting bumps, they really didnt amount to much."
good,"The company is very fair in terms of benefits and pay for their consultants in store. However the commission structure continually changes, as well as the goals needed to achieve the commission. The company has morphed from one objective to another, often leaving the sellers confused on the suite of products the company offers. In turn this leads to a lot of turn over and employees who are well versed in one thing such as phones but completely clueless in another such as TV. It should be stressed above all that the position of consultant is a SALES position. Though you may be told upon hiring that this is a customer service with sales position by some managers, at the end of the day if your table side manner with a customer is awful, but your sales and closing rate is high, you will be rewarded and the company will overlook the latter. There is a lot of potential for growth once you leave the store and work your way into the corporate side of the company. But on the storefront sales side, be prepared for long hours, continually changing metrics/goals every month, and a very inconsistent work/life balance."
good,"they provide good work benefits and perks, but the micromanagement and amount of stress that you have to deal with on a daily basis outweighs the benefits. Work/life balance is unrealistic. There are many things that you get held accountable for that are beyond your control. Overall its a good company to work for, and they provide for your family. You just definitely have to earn your pay."
good,"I really liked this job. The only downside was that the managers all had the weirdest power trip. They didn't like it when you out-sold them, and they would punish you for making those sales."
good,i was a contractor  so i didnt deal with day to day operations of at&t. from what i can tell friends say that is is a decent place to work. so i assume its ok
good,"I worked over two years with company before leaving.  Was U Verse tech during Direct Tv transition.  Take a good look and picture of your family because you will hardly see them as a tech.   Work day could start at 7:30am and your not release until the load for the day is clear.  Which would be cool, if not for the fact load changes throughout the day.  So you could easily be out at 8pm still getting jobs dropped"
good,decent job. little opportunities for advancement. good benefits. most coworkers are good to work with. pay is lacking. training is available but they are not necessarily very accommodating for scheduling
good,"It was an opportunity of experience in a call center. It had its challenges,  however; enjoyed my employment.  The call center environment is fast paced. Different training experience with different leads."
good,"-Average day was at least 10 hours per day."
good,Do your job and you will be rewarded. WFH benefits provided a good work life balance. Compensation plans changed regularly but you were able to make a great salary.
good,"As a premise technician your day will consist of driving, interacting with customers and working in inclement weather. One of the main things you learn is to control what you can control. The hardest part of  the job is the unpredictable work schedule. The greatest fulfillment I from is when my customers are satisfied with their service."
good,"great benefits and compensation, ability to work flexible schedule, n o job security, constant reorganization of management and hierarchy, never met manager face to face, awful IT support"
good,"Don't get me wrong, it's a great company to work for as far as compensation and benefits. When you're new you're expected to adhere to seniority so your schedules are going to suck big time so no work / life balance there until you move up in the totem pole. Commission structure is built to where you don't make money on upgrades, just new lines or service. I'd go back but I don't have time to deal with the seniority bs. If you're young and hungry then go for it."
good,Es una empresa bastante buena en el ámbito laboral. Com mucho trabajo. Pero le falta mucho como tal.
good,"Good Workplace, good people. Also looking to reinvent their business, they need to remember the real business is business and be less concerned about automation."
good,"I enjoyed the work and atmosphere , however they send you out of town for undisclosed amounts of time, and there is no job security anymore. Everyone is constantly worried about layoffs based upon corporate greed."
good,I owe much of my leadership skills to At&t's . They do a great job at training and partnering with employees to teach the latest most effective leadership techniques. The problem is the unshakable feeling of being disposable due to constant center closures and consolidations while overseas vendors are expanding. I cant think of a day where I didn't feel disposable.
good,"I worked with AT&T for over 20 years. The overall experience was great, but as time passed so did the company. I ran my course and retired. I enjoyed a very good lifestyle during those years and am thankful for the experience."
good,The pay is worth the sweat the local management is dedicated to helping you. The pay and the benefits great with lots of discounts for services. Not a bad job
good,Change is definitely constant. Alot of changes. Went from being best job to worst stressful job. Most people stay because if benefits and pay. Good paying job for someone without a degree.
good,The job was okay. Management could’ve been better but they were take the time out to work on that. Most of the older employees had set schedules so the new employees were forced to work around it.
good,Human connection to get things done with there accounts as well as adding features like international plans or changing the rate plans to the accounts or upgrade phones.
good,The pay and insurance is great but there is NO work/life balance. The scheduling system is a joke and favors the more tenured reps. Upper management just cares about DTV sales and that’s about it.
good,"Overall company was great to work for, wished it was more upfront about situations and opportunities. This company offered lots of perks if you took advantage of it and had plenty of on call overtime available to those who desired it."
good,"Retail, schedule is not family friendly. Pay is decent, benefits aren't that bad. However, they change commission structure often and managers often end up dating their employees depending on your store"
good,"To keep it breif at&t was a exceptional place to work with decent commission, however because they're buisness initiative to prioritize selling they're cable and streaming services rather then just starrting phone payment plans and contracts with new customers, it led to the higher ups pushing more aggressively to sell to regular customers who were only seeking services catered to they're payment plan. Making me personally uncomfortable."
good,"This was a temporary assignment that was supposed to last roughly 2 years but was terminated after several months, the union was of no help."
good,"I liked being able to work remotely from home and the pay was good. I also worked as contractor for AT&T in Hawaii 1998-99. Overall a good company to work for and good pay, but I'd rather work as a permanent employee rather then as a contractor.."
good,"AT&T need to spend more money for digital transformation and marketing newer, funner software products to engage customers.  New customers want to see better incentives to join."
good,"You're selling phones. I didn't like pushing products that my customers didn't need, but I understand pushing accessories. My main focus was making sure my customers had the products and services they needed."
good,"Like most big companies, the mission is the culture. Your life to work balance is about mid-range; You'll get time off if it's available and an emergency and you'll have to spend your vacation time to do it. Management is on par with most large businesses: geared toward profit and making sure customers are handled. The current trend is about downsizing and outsourcing, so use this as a stepping stone for careers in more stable businesses. Most employees below senior level management are less than about 5 - 7 yrs, as job cuts happen frequently and involve entire team exits."
good,Very number driven. if you can keep your nose clean benifits are decent and pay is not bad. however. Steps of discipline get handed out by management like Oprah handing out prizes. steps of discipline are often used as a power play. granted not all managers operate in this way. I feel like it is a good stepping stone job into the tech world.
good,AT&T took over and the culture changed. They were all about the money and no longer the employees. All services were expensive and the only way to afford it was with employee discount. Rotating shifts.
good,"Worked for At&t for almost 10 years. Had a problem at home taking care of an infant and they refused FMLA and also fought my unemployment all the way to the court house and basically left us with nothing to live on until I could find another job.. Left with some disgust for the company. The work is not bad but you do get your share of unhappy customer and some in management is weak, but they do have some good managers as well. They pay was low to start but under union contract and went up quickly. They do have paid time off, time off without pay and good benefits."
good,"Buen ambiente laboral,no así sus políticas y restricciones para empleados, no hay equilibrio en vida laboral y personal."
good,The benefits and compensation were very good. However there was lack of job security and it was difficult to try to advance. I would recommend trying to get a job in a growing business unit.
good,Right now the only good thing to say is there are great benefits. Management keeps changing and we can’t get good communication going. The company does whatever they want and expect us as technicians to handle everything thrown at us without proper training
good,"It was a great experience for four years.  Great experience in the data entry and clerical fields.  It helped me grow and expand as a professional, however our relationship ended after four years.  I am grateful for the opportunity to teach for the last three years.   However, I am glad to be moving on in my career."
good,Always provided ways to help each other succeed and strive for more. Rep would be rewarded for hitting goals and can be looked at for further promotions or raises.
good,"Good pay and benefits, but job security and work/life balance are things that are lacking. The dynamic of the company is consistently changing so it makes it difficult to feel like you have any real footing."
good,"The biggest issues with working with ATT is that you are demanded to work 10+ hours of overtime, all the time while they lay off people instead of keeping a balance of work and home life. You pay a union fee to a union that doesn't even help you in anyway while the company walks all over its employees. The job its self was a great experience and I really enjoyed the challenges that it brought, but working for ATT, there is more red tape and hopes you have to jump threw just to pray you have a job the next day no matter how good your numbers are."
good,"Company is in the process of major shift in services, wouldn’t recommend applying to any field tech positions if there are any out there. Managers and techs are being cut as company is attempting to cut costs and shift to app based and online/streaming cable services. Heavy micromanaging, new minuscule tasks every other week that will get you wrote up if you miss any of the 30 tasks outside of actually getting customers services installed within and efficient time with perfect quality to meet daily metrics."
good,"Good work-life balance. Get to interact with multiple vendors. "
good,"The overall scope of working is not bad. however, management did not take into consideration many employees opinions. Workplace culture was manageable but more training would have helped. There's no denying that its a great place to work due to pay and benefits but if management would listen to the voices of its employees then more problems could be better solved"
good,"Learned to deal with difficult customers, development more patience over time but also was able to help those in need of the communication services. Its fast paced and stressful at times."
good,"Management or NON-union jobs: Average Benefits. Good Pay. Job security not very good. "
good,"Great pay and benefits, predictable schedule, and terrible relationship between management and employees. No room for moving deserving employees to higher roles due to the ridiculous policy of I may suck but I have been here longer than you.  Not the worst place to work and if you like to be lazy and just do the minimum and get paid you will succeed at just that. If you have higher aspirations, good luck to you."
good,"Always the fear of loosing the job, they stress you out when there’s an upset customer but your following the policy that by the way ALWAYS changes and we have to go with it, minor mistakes can get you walked out the door, time off whether it’s an injury, pregnancy, family medical etc they make it seem like your covered upon return but your not, pay is awesome sauce and benefits as well, relay to much on customer feedback when they’re upset with the company but customers don’t know that they’re hurting the reps pockets even with giving them courtesy as empathy. You have a couple of good managers but they all promote based on favoritism and who THEY think is worthy enough, you have to stay on the phones for years in order to move up and as stated before if you want to move up quicker you have to be someone’s favorite, work place feels like a high school environment"
good,No room for advancement and pay was not substantial based on current work load or cost of living.  Management was not understanding when it came to taking time off work.
good,"Plenty of room for advancement.  You can go anywhere.  Pay is competitive."
good,Trainings really help you prepare for your growth or career. It will mold your knowledge. It is still under sitel so i have the same comment on trainings.
good,Didnt matter how good you were they had to find a negative in something.  The pay was good. Some incentives.  Fun work environment sometimes.  Hated scheduling.  You can work hard but still not get the schedule you want because its based on who was there longest vs scores and how you are making the company look.  no schedule that would fit me going back to school so i had to leave.
good,"AT&T does a great job of taking care of its people financially, but the stress and micromanagement for frontline employees in unbearable. As a sales consultant, your opinion or insight means little if anything to management. Your job is to sell only, and if you don't follow a cookie cutter, robotic sales pitch, you'll be reprimanded for it."
good,I enjoyed the work but getting laid off from my job was a heart breaker. My immediate supervisor was not helpful at all. The union was more concerned about politics than helping or standing by us.
good,"I loved the people that I worked with at AT&T. I was a part of their business to business sales development program. I made some great friends during my 4 months in this program. I thought that I could see myself working with AT&T for several years because of the relationships that I was able to cultivate. That all changed when I was put under a manager who was not a fan of me. I was hitting my numbers consistently and was at roughly 125% of my quota YTD when I was pushed out. There are people that are still working the position that I was who made less sales than me and less consistent sales but I was pushed out. How can you push people out of a training program, especially people who are doing their job and doing it well, and claim that your company has a family culture. Not to mention the training program was more of a glorified call center. "
good,It’s great that reps were recognized each year for a stretch of a week long however management seemed to have gotten lost to recognize for jobs well done too!
good,"Several different roles and managers. Constant change. Lots of training required, but never enough time to take the classes. Good people to work with. High levels of diversity in teams."
good,"I left here because the company and the union couldn't make an agreement on what benefits to cut and so on. Also, you cap out as a premise technician at 24.10 and really no room for advancement."
good,AT&T offers great salaries and 401K.  The environment has declined since they went to a collaboration zone model no longer taking merit into account.  Getting rid of people based on their geographic location has demoralized low/mid level manages significantly.
good,"Many departments so there is always something to learn. Good discounts on their products.  Moderate pay for the type of work. Not industry standard.  Few opportunities for advancement unless you’re in a"
good,good pay great benefits but not work cause me to get laid off  i did my job per AT&T standards and couldn't make my #'s i tried to tell them im doing it the right way but other techs cut corners to get u earn and management dont care
good,I enjoyed working as a call center agent and was given a management position after only 1 year.  I managed a successful award winning teams for 3 years.  The union came in and agents with no experience was making alot more money than me.  I asked to go back to an agent and was told no.  After that request I was subject to high criticism of my work and was let go.
good,They were to much of micro management company with higher goals for new stores than most company's i worked for in the past..I think they could have had better training to make you manger of a new store they threw me to the wolves and sad to survive mistakes were OK as long as we learned from them but made many customers upset when i could not completely solve the problems do to clerical errors in the computer software has to always call customer care...
good,AT&T made certain to lay me off just two years before I was eligible for retirement.  There are good people working there but the company looks to cost savings first at the expense of quality decisions and product.
good,Too many layoffs every quarter. If you are lower in seniority you get zero benefits because of the union. Their customer service and tech support make it very difficult to do your job.
good,"Great place to make money. Work is difficult have a term called good jobs in 8 how many jobs you’re required to do in an 8 hour day. Almost impossible to accomplish since the outside plant is so lousy. If you have a bucket you have a better chance of getting some work done. Medical is ok, vacation time is awesome"
good,Great sounding position but its lies to get you in. Last second meetings that they dont pay you for. They tell you to do something then yell at you for it. So much red tape in a company this size. They paid you a salary that was for 40 hours a week. So when you have to come in for a meeting at 6am dont expect any extra pay.
good,"Used to be a top tier company to work for 25 years ago, however, year over year, the jobs, benefits and salaries has lagged and fell behind other Fortune 500 companies."
good,It was a fun place to work it was in the mall. management was not sogreat. It was a temp job for the iphone release. I did recieve alot of cell phone training.
good,Make sure you are okay with not having any control over what you do every day.  Managers double check and triple check your work.  And wants you to confirm status on things that are not under your control.
good,"Very demanding, Contradicting rules, Manager discretion on certain things. Will use scare tactics to make employees to due certain task. Great benefits and pay but poor management and empathy for others."
good,I worked for direct tv not at&t and they were fun to work for. they provide lot if opportunity to advance. the hours were a little rough but the job was interesting
good,"There have been large rounds of layoffs every year for the past few. It's an environment of fear. It doesn't matter how talented, resourceful, or informed you are - anyone can be cut at any time."
good,With a fast pace company comes fast pace expectations.  With that said there was little development for leaders as it was always expected to produce and perform.  Any director positions that became available were always given to others either outside of the area or an external candidate.
good,"My day being  with setting up the dock unload the trucks break, down pallets, and distributing to the right department in the warehouse. I say the hardest part of this job is trying to pick up items that is 100 pounds or more like cable reels, and coils of wires. The most part I like when it's time to go home at the end of the day."
good,Overall this is a good company to work for.  But constantly living with one foot out the door due to ongoing reductions can be difficult.  Yet work requirements and training continued to increase.
good,"This company taught me the importance on welcoming a customer & exploring to provide the best solution. The upper highers were always very nice, they recognized hard workers and daily efforts. We received daily huddles, and individual coachings."
good,The good thing about this job is that you start your day from home. you took home the work van with you. With that in mind you stay out till all the jobs are done for the day. Better job if you are single.
good,"If you like abuse it’s the perfect job for you   Last minute schedule changes, forced overtime , little to no work life balance. Techs are treated bad unless you are in core contract"
good,"They used us (DSL tech support) for sales in U-Verse, then after we sold so much, they furloughed our whole dept.  If job security is crucial to you, just say no to AT&T."
good,"It was super stressful because you couldn’t clock in even 1 second late or you would get a write up, plus not too great of hours and you don’t get the schedule you want. Plus customers yelling at you on the phone, but if you can handle all of that, this job is for you!"
good,"A typical day at work could go a number of different ways.  I always had to be flexible, because things were constantly changing and anything could happen on any given day.  I learned that it's all about who you know, not what you know.  And if you are in management you are expendable at anytime.  You are just considered a number, not a person."
good,The people are great to work with.  But be prepared for the yearly efficiency improvements.  Meaning every division is expected to bring more money in or do more with less and if not head count is cut to meet the efficiency numbers.  Even if the head count loss interrupts business needs.
good,AT&T now puts corporation in front of people.  Make no mistake they will tell you they care about their culture and people but then make ridiculous demands of your time and management really will not really try to fix what is wrong because the organizational structure is just not set up correctly anymore.  Mid to Upper Management makes more decisions on gut then data and that's a problem.
good,Unfortunately my time at AT&T was very stressful as we were constantly under threat of having our jobs outsourced. On multiple occasions we were told that we were being laid off only to be told a month later that they were going to keep us on for another 6 months maybe.
good,AT&T has been on a downward spiral since the T-Mobile acquisition fiasco. Layoffs happen every 6 months for the past 5 years and employee moral is at an all time low.
good,"AT&T has been a very good place to work...   it was exceptionally stable and employee focused in 1980's through 2000.  As the company began to expand its scope, there appeared to be less focus on employee satisfaction."
good,"Being such a large company with so many employees, AT&T did not seem at all concerned about the employees, especially those in a department that was not AT&T's focus at the moment."
good,AT&T gave me a solid background in Tax Compliance and Provision.   During a review of our Tax Accounting Procedures by PWC the director recognized my contribution and asked me to join the UTC team.
good,"I had world class training when first taking my position. I feel like they were very cutthroat when it came to sales, customer acquisition and customer service."
good,"I worked for company when it was just Directv, prior to AT& T buyout.  It was a great place to learn how to do CallCenter work and it's training program was excellent."
good,No job advancement really within the company. Waking up everyday not knowing if your job will be surplussed is a huge factor in the bad rating.The job pay is really good with amazing benefits and discounts. The main problem here is everything is being outsourced to other countries or private contractors that they can pay pretty poorly and get rid of the in-house employees.
good,You need to have a back up to your back up as far as if you have children and need to make arrangements on a daily basis to be able to work overtime. We worked a lot of hours and had to be extremely flexible.
good,"I had a good 15 year career at AT&T and felt valued.  I was outsourced to one of their vendors for nearly the same amount of time.  It's all good...I always kept my loyalty. The most enjoyable part of my job as an employee were the people I worked with . It's a tough environment these days for employees and vendors alike due to the never ending waves of reductions.  There are pockets of good leadership and bad.  While the CEO has a good vision, it often becomes blurred the closer it got to those who needed to execute on it.  Plans seemed half baked and project launches often stalled because of it.   The change to collaboration zones may work for the younger and social crowd.  But, as I have visited and worked in those zones, I find them too noisy and unproductive.  It's like the chatty co-worker that won't leave your office (times 20)"
good,FINE i only worked there seasonally dont have much to add. it was a fine place to work i dont know why your require a review. the management was young ad liked sports
good,"learned a lot Results-oriented Sales, Business Development and Management Professional with a track record of increasing revenues through outstanding performance and leadership, seeks a new opportunity to utilize extensive experience, skills and abilities to make an immediate contribution as part of an outstanding organization."
good,People will throw you under the bus to get ahead. The pay scale has also changed and employees do not get what they are worth. The team members are not loyal and it's an uncomfortable work environment.
good,I worked at AT&T about twenty years ago.  I do not know what the current culture or climate is within the company.  I have nothing further I can contribute to this review as such.
good,"Typical day at work includes starts at home with brief meditation.  Do some thing kind during commute.  Start day with a smile and warm greeting to co-workers.  Review yesterdays objective and drive towards today's goals. Plan the next day and assess targets reached today and how they furthered overall management objectives."
good,Very fast paced . people on incoming calls were mostly agitated had to calm them down and were always in a hurry. Training was not the best and trying to get help from a supervisor took a very long time.
good,The constant workforce reductions slows down time to market and costs more money then the original budget for at least 2 reasons: 1 - new people added to replace surplus employees now need to be brought up to speed; or 2 - this is more often than not. There is no backfill so people are now doing double their work and that increases exponentially with each surplus
good,Difficult Place to work due to constant threat of layoffs and lack of opportunities... otherwise the products are very good and cane be easy to sell or maintain.
good,Customer service jobs can be really good or really bad. Depends on your call center and if management knows that to do. I recommend only working at a call center if you are prepared for high stress situations.
good,"Corporate environment that leads to unnecessary hierarchy/bureaucracy, but enables individuals to have many horizontal opportunities. I give it an average rating because there are both pros and cons."
good,"worth working for, easy job to do for the most part. good experience and pay is decent. can be crazy busy during the Christmas time but overall pretty laid back job"
good,Great place to work at. I would love to work there again sometime soon. Not a fan of how they give you your initial shift. Really good food in cafe.!!
good,I worked at AT&T for about a year and a half. I only left to go to another job that started immediately. It is a very stressful job being an inbound call agent. Especially when it comes to making sure the accounts are secure. On top of that there were new procedures that were coming out monthly and most of the time you didn't get time of the phone to learn them.
good,The setup they have for employees compensation is horrible for anyone part-time. They won't be able to save or gain hours to make more regardless of the patience in the employee.
good,"Depending upon which organization and manager you work for your experience could range from the worst to the best.  I have had 3 jobs all lateral moves due to shifting company demand.  The company is ""transforming"" so workforce is being reduced.  The message is your time is coming so leave now if you can.  Overall a pretty decent experience for me. I was able to work from home most of my tenure, decent pay and great benefits.  I had 3 jobs which gave me some good experience.  2 jobs had great people and 1 the people were toxic ...due to workload, stress, nature of the job ...I can say this was the best company I have worked for in 30 years..."
good,"Working at At&t was fun to work at, but management did a lot of unreasonable things that did not benefit the customer. Would love to recommend, but would advised to ask about goals and how to meet them."
good,Can be very stressful depending on which departments and job titles you hold.  However the pay and benefits are excellent and based on seniority.  You get a yearly raise and bonus.
good,training consists of a lot of online classes done by yourself with daily check in with a trainer.  Not much side by side training once you hit the floor.
good,"Great place to learn how to deal with customers. Culture has changed, commissions are not as good as before but it's a good place to get your feet wet."
good,"Heavy corporate culture with a lot of micro-management. You better hit the ground running, because there is little tolerance for under-performance, no matter how long you've been there."
good,This was my first full time position. I definitely learned so much and developed thick skin working in a call center. This company is cut-throat and only cares about your performance and how the customer feels. Customers would call in just to complain and escalate to get account credits. Call center work is always challenging especially when the company has very high expectations of work productivity. This company don't play
good,"Great pay and benefit, but you are constantly looking over your shoulder worried if you are going to be in the next group they announce downsizing in. After 22 years with them it caught up to me for the 2nd time in my long career I was in the group that was affected, this time I didn't weather the storm and was laid off. Despite having great annual reviews and being a great employee of 22 years I lost my job. My assumption is it was because I was within 3 years of being retirement eligible, thanks At&t!"
good,Management was horrible and the equipment sucked. Overall the work load wasn’t worth the stress all the techs had to go through to make the system work
good,"Stressful and inconsistent work life balance "
good,"just very stressful 16 years of Saturday , sunday , lates having to take vacation time to have a weekend micro mangment .most of my co-workers were great they brought in new management and it just went down hill . new manger said .[I will do what ever it takes to move up the ladder know matter who or what I have to do I want to be a 3rd level manger]"
good,"Pros"
good,"Constant reorganizations and changes in leadership.  Lack of clear direction in the group. Many changes lead to uncertainty and cloudy leadership,  Advancement opportunities are based on politics."
good,company has changed a lot in the past few months.  more is expected out of top performers in the sense that goals are being stretched to unreasonable places
good,Not sure when you would get off but this is before they took over but hours would vary. Could not see how many jobs you would have for the day. so not sure that you could plan yourevenings.
good,"Not really the company of the past, Ma Bell, just a repackaged version of SBC, now headquartered in Dallas. Same mentality as before, but adding geographic territories and purchasing a satellite and then a content provider."
good,"To really excel in this position, you have to cut off anything outside of the AT&T realm of reality. They expect so much from you and it's not an easy task to sell people in their homes, when don't even know you're coming."
good,AT&T provides a project manager lots of diverse projects depending on who you work for. The processes are monotonous and hard to follow. As well as ever changing. The company stresses a lot of useless education. Although there are some courses that are relevant to my job. There is no travel. I supported customers where travel would have been good for the overall success of the project. The hardest part of the is the nonsense requests by upper management about finishing useless courses.As well as taking 30 or more courses for strike contingency every 4 years. I had over 70 mandatory courses t take this year in a non strike contingency year. The most enjoyable part of my job was the autonomy my direct supervisor gave me to do my job and be successful. I learned that large corporations make decisions that affect all of its workers in negative ways. Also your job security is threatened at least a couple times of year.
good,Not a good company to work for if you are looking for longevity in a career. Constantly looking for ways to cut cost which mainly includes layoffs. Use this company as a resume builder since it is a global name
good,"This review is pretty invalid. By that I mean, I worked there almost 8 years ago. Before 4G LTE and 3G. Bad cell service was common and I had a quota to reach so I felt like a scumbag when I basically lied to my customers to buy cell plans. Other than that, great benefits and loved my co-workers"
good,"Just have to work here to find out, but the job is stressful and they keep adding to the work load but not the pay its sickening almost feel like migrant workers"
good,"It’s a good place to start your career, however AT&T pays less than its competitors. If compensation was higher, the company would retain a lot more of its talent."
good,"You never know when you are getting off work, so it is impossible to plan after work. Company is constantly restructuring and laying employees off and causing other people to work massive overtime. lower management was always nice, but is also always at odds with the union"
good,"its retail so you are subject to a variety of hours"
good,Definitely a corporate entity. Lots of political actions to get to where you want to be. It seems if you get to a certain level that they move you to another department if you want or if you are unsuccessful at the job you are currently in.
good,Att is a very stressful environment.They don't care for the employees. Management are usually people who care but don't have any power. Culture sucks.
good,"I am still employed with AT&T. Being in management, you have no work life balance. As an assistant manager, it was better because you got paid hourly, so if you worked overtime, you were compensated. As a store manager you're salary, I have been working 60 hours a week for the past 2 months with no extra pay. AT&T has been reducing head count per store and is expecting managers to do twice the work. AT&T recently eliminated our Sales Support Representative (SSR) position, which handled everything that had to do with inventory. AT&  they want us to complete all of the SSR tasks, complete operations task, coaching, and be a rep at the same time. When I ask my boss for help because I did not know how to do something his response was always ""well its your store and you will be held accountable!"""
good,"I worked for AT&T for almost 5 years and started as just customer service and moved into sales. I like doing customer service, however I do not like doing sales. We did not have a choice for the sales and while I understand this for the companies benefit I do not like doing it. The management was never happy with the level of sales and did not focus on the positive or doing positive reinforcement for the workers. We went to lost of positive reinforcement and encouragement to do good to never being good enough for the job no matter how many sales you made at any given time. It sucked."
good,"US based company expansion into Canada but now since divested and no longer operating as such - split into Avaya, Lucent and sold parts to MTS Allstream"
good,Departments are being eliminated as networks (2G/3G0 become decommissioned.  These changes mean frequent surplus situations.  Available training is available and robust
good,work day starts with the morning meeting then the team goes on to there work truck calls the customer to inform them that we are in route go to the warehouse grab any products we need for the job and head to take care of the customer hardest part of that job was having to deal with management and the most enjoyable part was satisfying the customer
good,"All in all, its a good place to work for the money, however, it is very stressful and sometimes the goals aren't realistic. This, in turn creates a lot of stress on employees because management quite literally breathes down your neck. You are expected to sell in every situation, but sometimes it just is not appropriate."
good,"Everyday we have emails to review, as well as phone calls to make with current or new customers. Staying up to date with product knowledge is always a must."
good,Nice place to work but the hours are not family friendly.  The CWA is not something I would want to be a part of again.  Everything is based of tenure instead of performance.
good,"Loved working as a premises technician, then later on just bad management can be stressful at times, very unfair process and numbers system. Long our unfair schedules when it comes to seniority. Forced to work six days consecutive with a last minute notice."
good,typical day was to work with the customer on their projects and to assist with the maintaining that there systems that we supported were up and available for the business with the company that we were supporting via there Voice and Network systems.
good,Stressful environment were supervisors would not follow rules and guidelines or backup their employees when handling calls.   Supervisors should back their team members  who are following the guidelines given.
good,"Very stressful work environment at times, very focused on sales. Management is very nice and cares for their employees. Call center environment was just not my cup of tea."
good,"Spring Mobile is an authorized retailer of AT&T products and services under parent company of GameStop. Just about all of the stores within the Phoenix East district which was where I worked were severely understaffed which caused strain for employees, as well as management. High retention rate also did not help which was a result of mismanaged training."
good,This job was not for me. It might be good for some people. I just didnt like how managment was not even trying to help in anyway. They knew that they could fire you and hire some younger guy for lower pay.
good,"I was a lead/UAT tester for apple products. The team was good but the leadership was not reliable when budget cuts and team issues arose. Contractors can work for 3 years (I think this is still the rule) However, budget and project changes and drastically change your outlook."
good,"ATT can be a good fit for some, but it is still a ""not what you know...but who you know"". Management on the field side is only concerned about their ""metrics"" and or numbers, not the employees or the customers."
good,"Overall a good place to work, but if you aren't mobile or willing to relocate you may find yourself layed off due solely to your geographical location"
good,Depending on which organization you are with determines how safe you are.  The current culture shift is leaving the backbone of the company on the outside with no hope for the future.  This used to be a Company that cared about ALL employees.
good,"Once in a role with AT&T it is easy to keep that job, however it is difficult to collaborate with your direct leadership team. I found it nearly impossible to find a supervisor or manager that would assist me with developing my skills and help me be a better employee for the company. I excelled at my role and surpassed my peers within a few months of hire, this did not end up being a good thing for me with my leadership team, they took advantage of this and gave me more work than my peers in the same role. Attempting or mentioning applying for other roles within the company did not return a positive reaction from leadership (""oh, we thought you'd want to stick around our department longer"" after being in the department for 2.5 years) then not receiving any feedback or assistance with applying to other roles. When slowing down my work to match my peers, I was faced with scrutiny from leadership and those peers, I was essentially required to work more than my co-workers for a lower level of treatment."
good,"Only lateral movement little to no opportunity for advancement, frequent attempts to make the job fun are more of a distraction from doing the job than they are fun"
good,"Union contract determined seniority rights for jobs, which caused loss of a deserved position. Never would want to work for a union again. They did have a good management training program."
good,"The benefits with AT&T are amazing. The company offers vision, dental, medical and mental health services. "
good,The company is downsizing and changing its business directive. Moral is not very high amongst managers and for employees. Most people who have stayed that I worked with are afraid to look for something with similar compensation.
good,"AT&T was a nice place to enter the workforce, but unfortunately there was not a real career path."
good,Great place to work until Direct TV merger. Company became so focused on that metric that they made you feel bad about yourself if you couldn't sell a Direct TV subscription to someone. They stopped caring about customer experience or employee satisfaction at that point.
good,you’re a number to the company and they’re always looking to cut costs. Constant us vs them with the union and management. It’s not worth it. They bought Directv and Time Warner so now they’re in severe debt so now they’re definitely trying to get everyone. It’s very petty and unfair I was treated like garbage
good,"If you saw a company that restructured part or much of its divisions every 18 months, routinely assigned teams to managers with zero experience with that particular area of business, and every 6 months alternated between layoffs of contractors and layoffs of staffers… you might conclude that the leadership of that company lacked any clear vision, and were just thrashing around trying to figure out what to do, year after year."
good,"Challenging, yet rewarding - many layers of management, but bright and interesting people. Large projects, and the silos of different business units can make it hard to get things done quickly."
good,".Hired as temp. Laid off. Job outsourced to another San Antonio. Little to no notice. Bad experience as temp. However, full time employees seemed happy"
good,"Made GREAT money, advanced quickly and loved everyone I worked with for the most part. Managers aren't union but the retail sales consultants are which makes you feel targeted at times. I never intended on leaving, it wasn't my plan, but management drove me out. I would love to go back and work for AT&T. If I did, I would make sure that I work at a different store that has a unified atmosphere and team driven culture. That is what will make going to work everyday worth it. If you love technology, love a challenge and think you have what it takes to outsell your peers, this is the job for you. You'll know when you've found the right store with outstanding leadership, goals and guidance. You'll succeed very quickly when you do."
good,It is a must that sales goals are met to grow with this company if this is a company you see yourself being with long term. Will make it much easier to excel faster within the company.
good,"Very Fast Paced"
good,"felt connected to people, time off phone was good enough to maintain  mental health for a time. Managers were good but I've heard it's gone down hill a lot."
good,The company does not have loyalty to it employees.  AT&T would like you to think that they promote a work environment like that of Google's however they refuse to invest in their offices. They are all about cutting cost.
good,management was horrible. Time off was good as long as you put in work and jobs were complete at reasonable time and pace. I would recommend working there for someone starting out early in their career.
good,"poor management, very demanding place to work, stressful per goals and metrics, no advancement opportunity unless you know the right person. Good perks, benefits and discounts."
good,"Great company. I loved my job and have 13 years of experience with sales execution, leading a winning team etc. I have won many awards including service excellence,  small business matter expert, management development program graduate and advisor."
good,"The company required lots of training and everyone on the sales floor is held to very high sales goals, if you can make them they'll pay you for it pretty good, or at least they use to."
good,Lack standard reporting procedures. Each executive sets own standards with some being burdensome. Reduced time available to focus on improvements and automation.
good,"hardest part of the job is working out in the elements, particularly in the summer time when temperatures can reach 115 degrees high."
good,"Unless you are something truly special use it as a spring board into something more secure and lucrative. Otherwise you will be over worked, and under appreciated.  The pay and benefits are great though."
good,"great company I learned a lot about the importance of providing great customer service unfortunately the schedule was an issue when i had my kids.  They offer great benefits like 401k,  paid vacacion, the commision was great, I like that we had different new product and services and great incentives if we met out goal."
good,Kind of old school management structure. Could use some new management style for younger workers. They do know the phone and internet business. Other companies they have bought did not do well under their leadership.
good,"Not a bad place to work , good people,good hours .Hard work for sure very quick paced.Good money if your will to the work . somedays were hard but other were easy."
good,"horrible experience, your just a number to the company.  if you cant sell a certain amount of products within a month then youre written up until fired."
good,New AT&T more results driven. This has become the rub in the new job requirements. I still seem driven to satisfy the customer needs. I have missed the old AT&T in this area.
good,"Typical day at work- starting work on time to sign into your many application on the computer which would take 8 minutes or more. Being prepared for the constant changes in work processes....example: today you can help a tech and tomorrow you can't. Which sometimes make a stressful day!"
good,the work is okay no work life balance good for people that have nothing else going on because you are at work all of the time and there is no time to do anything else.
good,"As a contractor, my experience with AT&T was different than that of a PW. However, working closely with and reporting to AT&T, I always felt highly valued and appreciated. When the time came for me to leave, it wasn't easy. The relationships and experiences I gained from  my time working with AT&T were invaluable. To this day, I continue to stay in contact with old supervisors and team members, and would quickly return to the organization if the right opportunity presented itself."
good,AT&T is a fast paced environment to grow your problem solving and communication skills to further your customer service career. A normal work day included speaking with customers for 8 hours a day. Management was supportive and positive with their teams. The part of the job I struggled with was sitting in a cubicle for the entire day. I most enjoyed the level of interaction with my coworkers and customers.
good,"The organization's culture was very toxic and catered to a specific group.  Promotions and salary Increases were not done in a fair and just manner.  Disparity and exclusive!  The executive leaders were awesome and engaging.  Unfortunately, the low/mid managers (unethical, bias) had their own agenda."
good,"I thoroughly enjoy my position as a Wire Technician for AT&T. I feel good about helping each customer with their services.  But the lack of ability to be with my family has taken a toll. The hours are unpredictable and can cause you to have 13 hour days, and the lack of a regular schedule doesn't allow time with family. Only one weekend a month off is very difficult to raise children. IT is hard labor, climbing poles and repairing lines, but it is a nice feeling knowing you helped someone."
good,"You will be busy, work and work and more work.  benefits excellent.  Union recognized company, great development, education programs, multiple divisions within."
good,"I loved the job, even though it could be harsh working in the winter, up on telephone poles, no cover from the elements. I dressed well for the weather. Other then that, the training could have been better when the company bought out Direct TV. and when I was trained for fiber optics."
good,really great pay and benefits overall is great hard to compare to other companies get a lot of training to stay up dated in this competitive technology world
good,huge company that can be over run by terrible management due to it size. Corporate policies are in place but not easily enforced because the size of the company.
good,"I currently work in landline repair, because of this advancement has flatlined and because I am a union employee protected by the core contract, I'm unable to move to the growing ends of the business."
good,"It was difficult to get time off. We only had one weekend off a month. hours were extremely unpredictable. family did not come first in the eyes of the company. I was paid well and benefits were nice. Unfortunately, there was little to no room to advance unless you were willing to move out of state."
good,"New policies always being implemented without proper transitional time. Horrible managers, seem to always ger laid off right as they woyld qualify for retirement. Always outsourcing overseas"
good,"Extremely fun workplace when I first started until the company began cutting commission, overtime, and benefits. Basically asked us to do more work for less pay"
good,"You are compensated well and fairly per the union contract negotiation, however there were multiple leadership issues and miscommunications issues between departments . I would say my experience is pretty standard among Premise Technicians ."
good,I greeted customers at the front door and found out what they need help with and then took them to the appropriate customer service rep.  I also sold accessories
good,"AT&T is like a shinny meat grinder. It's nice and pretty on the outside, but inside its filled with fast moving parts so if you don't keep up, the walls start to close in on you."
good,"Was very misleading in interview from what the job actually entailed. There was no room for negotiations, and everyone who worked on the team including management was looking for another job."
good,clock in take phone calls and sell as much you can. i would say the hardest part of working for at&t is training and what i mean by that it all threw a software where they only give you 15 to 45 mins to complete. other then that i would say it a great company to be apart of
good,"Had a fantastic supervisor my first year and a half. After that, they moved a supervisor in to start firing people because of lack of work. He was sent to lower the amount of people working for the company"
good,"Not surprisingly, the culture is a bit different from what I had experienced at DIRECTV, but it generally was not bad.  Unfortunately, I'm unable to go into a lot of detail about how things are done at AT&T as I remained under the DIRECTV division after the buyout."
good,"AT&T is a good place to work if you like a fun paced environment. There is competition in the workplace. The management needs work, There is definitely a lack of communication between some of them."
good,"When I was there a lot of my managers were cut throat, I was glad to not have a manager that was like that. It could have been way worst like it is now."
good,"Fast pace environment, can maximize compensation structure if you meet qualifiers. I enjoyed working with most of my peers and managers. The hardest part is meeting The qualifiers to increase commission."
good,"Working as a tech for AT&T was one of my first jobs, at 19 years old.  I came in with very little experience in the field.  I learned a lot while working here, made some friends, had fun actually doing the job, but the company and management were not always the friendliest."
good,"No opportunities for growth, mediocre performance tolerated a lot"
good,"When the company was Cingular, company cared about employees. When AT&T Wireless took over, company only cared about the profit margin, not employees."
good,"Its a great place to work if you become a managers favorite, the benefits are excellent and the pay is good. but there are a lot of hidden agendas with this company.  they will train you in all aspects of internet and programs, they do offer school"
good,"Work culture was amazing, learned a lot from other at all times. Management was also pushing for your hardest effort. Always making sure everyone was one their A game."
good,"The Area Manager I worked for was the most amazing boss ever. He was easy going and allowed for some of life's happenings without a big deal. He was very supportive in my life and in my job. It wasn't up to him to end my position, AT&T ended it. They wanted to move away from the contractors."
good,AT&T mobility is a job that changes often. You have to keep up with technology. I really enjoyed that part of the job. Commission over the past 10 years have decreased and become extremely challenging to obtain. How does someone with work ethic make less money every year while gaining experience and knowledge ?!
good,The company really tries to push their employees to do the best and a lot of the leaders within the company are great. The commission wasn't all that great when i began but over time had gotten better.
good,"Enjoyed day to to day life with preforming functions as OPT,  very exciting and challenging work.  Definitely a great place to work and experience big company culture."
good,I do not wish to participate in this portion. I do not wish to speak about my employment with AT&T. This should not be required. Thank you for asking.
good,"Si se es joven, es un excelente lugar de trabajo, sin embargo algunos de los supervisores no tienen capacitación adecuada, y la solvencia de conflictos internos tiene ciertas carencias."
good,I had a great experience working for AT&T.  I was treated with respect and given many opportunities for advancement.  However there were times when Human Resources was disconnected with the needs of their workers.
good,"This was an average job that I used to get back on my feet before relocating to Missouri. The training was quite good however, the working conditions were just ok."
good,"AT&T is a large company that needs to provide more internal support for back office functions. Their internal systems for placing customer orders is broken and requires too many band aids to successfully place an order."
good,I was great but unrealistic goals are expected to be met. When Installing services there are any problems that can occur. Instead of weighing each problem individually they have a time frame in which they would like things done.
good,Mangers are only promoted based off sales and not overall leadership ability. Hours are inconsistent and it is a fast paced environment. If you are okay with competition and do not mind working weekends and evenings this job is for you.
good,"Manager was below average, 2nd line manager was a thin skinned person who would fire on impulse.  working with people was great. job parameters were hard to achieve."
good,They provide lots of opportunities to get training for development of skills.  Lots of free training and tuition reimbursement if you choose to pay.  The business is going in the direction of software and are laying off folks who don't fit the model.
good,"Greeted customers and assisted with bill payment or finding the right solution for the initial visit. The customers often came in complaining about a billing error and that is hard to turn around but it worked at times,"
good,"As long as you make sure you’re above target they don’t care, they don’t anything tonclaise the deal, "
good,Es una buena empresa donde puedes desempeñar mejor la relación aa tencion a clientes y prospección
good,Management no fair with all employees. The union was great. There was no room for advancement at our office. Management switched a lot. It is a numbers game.
good,"Not a rewarding job, people yell at you all day to lower their bill. To many goals to meet. People expect everything to be free. You are required to save at a certan ratea and sell cell phone/internate and upgrdae. Basically it is all sales not really customer service."
good,It got to the point that you just did what you were told to do because the company’s vision was much more important to the bottom line than anything a low level manager could suggest.
good,"If you're fortunate enough to be the kind of person who can excel with very little instruction or have prior experience as a Cable Installer / Field Technician you will have no issues with the company or the workload. If you are like me and were completely green you might have a hard time. Also, termination and right-ups or disciplinary actions are brought up in EVERY SINGLE CONVERSATION from day one. The moment you get hired and are going through training you get the impression that they are doing whatever they can to fire people."
good,"Typical day at work is quite relax since im not taking calls , well it depends on the detractors we received if its either were gonna be calling them or  what not. Friendly people and a fun place to work with , since we know how to cooperate to one another and limit its boundaries, What i've learned is time management in At&T , since im already in tier 2 technical support, we need to focus on how to resolve detractors concerned of the customer, Management has variety of areas were most employee's has a pros and cons on that one (you know what i mean) since we do have different strokes and attitudes in a work environment. Workplace has a good ambience , if your not focus , you will go into the light as most call centers agents could do , well culture has an equality since we filipino's are very hospitable and most are straight forwards. Hardest part of the job ,if we received an escalation that even our managers provides options and resolution to our consumers and still disagrees, well sometimes we must think out of shear or out of the box let say to find the best possible experience and resolution of the customer . The most enjoyable part of the Job is the learning curved were it can broaden your horizons with different aspects in work experience or life and most specially nice friends to work with."
good,"My job was surplussed two times and I was taken completely out of the network side of the house to the sales side to keep a job on the first job cut. The next surplus was an office closing and I didn't get a job match, the alternative would have been nice to have as a backup but they have you take a chance if you don't want to be shipped to another city. I loved my jobs, all 3 of them were good positions with decent pay and compensation, but after 19+ years, I became unemployed to my shock and dismay. I have gone to school and am about to get back into the working world. I don't understand a company that pays for training, education reimbursement and experience, then just let's them go without doing everything they can to keep what they invested in for all those years. "
good,"AT&T is outsourcing their call centers to other countries in the Philippians, El Salvador, Etc. Customers don't want this and employees especially hate this since they lack training and just pass the call on anyway as they don't know what they are doing or give incorrect information making customers very upset.  I would say the hardest part of the job is being considered a number and not a person to the company. You are constantly rated and coached off customers survey's whom may have been mad at a previous agent but rated you for their quality of work. I enjoyed mostly making lifetime friendships."
good,"training is fun but, after that it tends to slow down. i work from 12-9 and that is off a schedule bid; you do not pick the days you want. management is nice but, if you arent hitting metrics itll be disciplinary action after another. its not for everyone so if you have an iron stomach, its the job for you,"
good,"Good enviroment for new graduate students who are energizer and looking for opportunity to grow."
good,This was once a great company to work for. When you had a job you knew you were secure and had a future. Not true anymore. Wether due to budget or technology I'm not sure.
good,"Connecting people to the world thru their devices. Typical day was come in login and take calls. I learned how to deal with irate/angry customer, and how to solve issues."
good,"Other than the pay scale, because of the union, this job started out as a dream job then became very ugly and stressful until they eventually closed the call center.  Benefits were amazing."
good,working at AT&T taught me a lot about how to manage and how to stay calm in heated situation with customers. Slowing down and solving difficult problems.
good,"Is a stressful place, yet is a good location to start in sales. The structure has change and the competition in cellphone companies has grown. Depending on location it can be peaceful or problematic."
good,"I was hired at AT&T as an intern doing web designs for the Yellow Pages (before YP became it's own company) with the promise of a certain salary once I was hired full time. There was a group of interns hired at the same time - all told the same salary information. Once hired, HR said they never promised that salary and low-balled all of us. I stuck around because I enjoyed the work and the team. However, most of the team consisted of contract workers who were not motivated. Also, management often provided inaccurate information (like we would transition to a new technology that never came, that we weren't moving offices when YP broke off from AT&T, etc)."
good,"Overall, working with AT&T wasn't so bad. I think the department I was in didn't have a clear vision of what our roles should be. There many changes weekly as to what our expectations were. This led to high turnover and poor leadership."
good,"Things where constantly changing.  Must be able to adapt to changes.  Team coaches are very approachable, and supportive.  Pay is not much at all, and takes 6 months before you receive an increase.  The amount of work is disproportionate to pay."
good,"It would have been great if we could have more management support.. Other than that, the pay and benefits is what keeps a lot of people working there."
good,"A company where the people made the job fun even when days got hard we found a way to smile."
good,"When I was working for AT&T there was a ton of new training between Direct TV, Fiber and initial training. after the initial training they give you OJT and pair you up with a mentor. You are required to hit a certain efficiency mark once you've been working there so long. I only had a couple months to get the ropes down after my initial training but business was slow so either we were sent home early or we were selected for more training in things like Direct TV or Fiber. All that extra training took place in that window we have to hit a certain efficiency mark. When it came time to be at that level I didn't honestly have enough solo time to perform my job at the rate they wanted. So when I didn't meet standards the managers would come out and try to dock you when they had never done it before. Its funny because I was blind to the fact that my initial training crew dropped like flies and it was only a matter of time till it was me. I wanna say the initial training crew was about 40 strong and by the time I left there was 20. The managers would never come to help you identify what you might be doing wrong. Its the kind of culture that if you don't make the cut right off the bat the managers want you gone so you don't hurt there numbers. They will turn a blind eye if you make em look good and do everything in there power to fire you if you don't. I never got the feeling they wanted to help you grow as an individual either. When I requested additional safety training they blew me off. I asked about taking college classes and they acted like I'd never have time for it. I had asked"
good,"Great workplace when it was Directv, not so much when AT&T tookover. Culture became less worker friendly and more towards productivity driven. Work environment needs work."
good,"Very competitive, low pay.  Part-time position.  Full-time wasn't offered. Retail environment.  Customer service driven and focus.  Commission based on service upgrades and add-ons."
good,"Look, it's a big company. All companies are great so as long you aren't in the frontline channel. AT&T has terrible customer service. But it's not just AT&T. All major corporations outsource to other countries and it causes barriers. "
good,"Other parts of AT&T sounded great, but due to red tape and union contracts, it was hard to move around in the company if you start in a call center (Uverse, DSL, etc)."
good,My last manager at AT&T was great!  He was very proactive and helpful as escalations arose.  The pay was decent but I feel the pay/workload was not balanced as more tasks were added.
good,"Managers typically had only high school education.  I manager said she graduated from college, but she did not.  Managers want to be left alone because they don't know what they are doing. "
good,"Diverse products and services in a business where they have scale.  Global reach and partnered with all of the key partner types.  Workplace culture was mature, most employees have worked at AT&T for 15+ years."
good,"No more attractive opportunities,  Is a number base company were you are graded by the numbers by your performance.  Copper and Dial tone is no longer business now a days."
good,"They gave me an opportunity, but moved me twice on my dime if I wanted to keep me job.  My last manager was not very good at all. Pay was below industry standard and annual pay raise was below cost of living increases.  Benefits were good."
good,"I was responsible for over the phone customer service with billing questions, retention, trouble shooting, promotions, and sales of various AT&T Wireless products and services"
good,Fast paced but stressful. Pays well. High goals. Poor management.  Great benefit package with health vision dental life disability and tuition reimbursement.
good,"Sell. Meet your numbers. Otherwise, you are in the wrong place. They will work with you and compensate you well. Typically, you will end up working well over 40 hours a week or you will fall behind. Do not expect much work-life balance because you either work too few hours because you don't enjoy it or you enjoy it and you work 50 hours a week and have no life."
good,working at at&t afforded me a solid foundation to start in corporate america in the telecommunications and the ever-evolving world of technology. solid program for sales training out of college for 6 months to equip you with the toold and knowledge necessary to make a foray into the technical sales world!
good,The job required a lot of information to give to customers. Up sale the value of the company and services to customer. A fast paced job with great on the job training.
good,"Project Coordinator -- Contract position; company had no interest in offering permanent jobs, being willing to lose years of training and client relationships.  Despite that, it was fine while it lasted. Low-pressure environment if you don't abuse the freedom. Understanding management and casual dress code. Much worse places to work; just don't think it's going to last forever."
good,Many employees have a hard time balancing their work/life balance due to the long hours and days off. Some wives tell their spouse to leave the job or divorce.
good,"You are just a number and nothing else. Unfortunately, if you want to advance within the company you must be well liked and be willing to listen at all times but never give your opinion. Management opinion is all it matters."
good,"It is extremely fast paced and there is limited assistance from management. You're pretty much on your own. Difficult to get any time off and it counts negatively against you, even if it is an emergency."
good,"Build your skills, utilize the tools because you'll never know when ""numbers are being adjusted"" for the company's interest. Each organization is different and operate as the lead management team dictates. The policies are not always consistent."
good,"AT&T pays its people, if nothing else. However, management consistently across the board leaves much to be desired. Myself (and coworkers around me) constantly felt as if we were being asked to lie to customers in order to produce numbers--and it is very much a numbers game. Please do not apply to a ""mobile consultant position"" assuming you will primarily be focusing on phone sales--you will also need to balance DirecTV, Uverse, insurance, etc. And you can be written up and progressed if you do not meet designated numbers."
good,"The offered employees decent benefits, but unfortunately they have changed annually for the past five years.  Increasingly bureaucratic policies place corporate earnings to shareholders above empathy towards employees."
good,Although I was ranked number one in my store my commission checks were declining due to the restructuring of commissions which resulted in less income year after year.
good,"ATT is a company that expects you to work hard. "
good,"AT&T promotes internal recruitment, almost 100%.  I am not sure why they even advertise their jobs in external sites, unless it is per Labor Law that you need to (on paper) show you sought external candidates too."
good,As a contractor you were not allowed to attend any fun activities or participate in any potlucks etc.  It created a divide between the real employees and the contractors.
good,"AT&T is only concerned with their stock price and what company they can buy out next. They are excellent putting up a front and showing a good face to the public, but are cut throat to their employee's.  This is Corporate America at it's worse!"
good,Nice work but company was not supportive on workplace issues..........Good working equipment but bad job imput criteria...........long hrs for bad pay............customer service was bad.
good,"Working with customers during the purchase of cell phones and plans, educating them on the plan and equipment they were purchasing. Promoting any sales that were going on and staying on top of new technology."
good,If you a single parent it can be a hard career to maintain being that installs can sometimes require more of your time. Lots of waiting on tech support if equipment acts up.
good,"Working at AT&T is an experience. Its almost one of those situations where its a job that everyone should have one day just to experience. Its a learning environment. You learn who you are and what kind of person you want to be. A typical day at AT&T can be stressful. The customers will come in and ask for everything under the sun, but don't want to spend $1. The managers are going to haggle you about numbers CONSTANTLY. Whatever you do is never going to be good enough. But in the long run, you become first choice for promotions and special events. AT&T takes care of its employees, but YOU ARE going to work for it! Know how to handle situations appropriately because this company will do it their way and their way only. Once you come to one accord with AT&T because there is plenty of bend to all of their rules, you will be good. I miss AT&T."
good,"Long hours and never know when your day will end. You keep going until the job pool is empty. You are required to work in all weather conditions, rain/shine, hot/cold."
good,"AT&T is  a good place to work overall. They provide great benefits and roles are well defined. The drawback is that there are numerous groups and organizations. This creates a silo type of mentality and unnecessary processes. Also, communication between groups and across organizations can become difficult. "
good,Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and my experience may differ from another individual. Pay is great and benefits are good. The rest is subject to preference.
good,I would still be there if a female manager had not decided to make me an example for the rest of the employees while calling my integrity into question at the same time. This is something that I cannot/will not stand for. I pride myself on conducting myself in a manner in all that I do as to not have my integrity and character questioned.
good,"Team environment does not exist. "
good,"If you're looking to just pay the bills without getting too invested, this may be the place for you. Anyone looking for a 'career' with the company will be disappointed at this juncture. The company is in transition (a good thing if you're young); and most jobs that will get you ahead are located in Dallas, TX. If you're already at home office, go for it! The company is downsizing and relocating without any apparent rhyme or reason. It's not uncommon to agree to relocation to keep your job, only to be laid off within 6 months. Even uprooting your life is no guarantee for job security; especially when pay is not competitive."
good,"good place to work if ever you can get on permanent. most jobs are contracted, the training is inferior. but pay if you have experience is good. overall not a bad place to work."
good,"Put in many years as a contractor and never got turned over to full time. Dissapointed. "
good,Way too much to type here unfortunately. But good company to work for overall. But local leadership is a reason for many unhappy employees. Lack of job advancement and steady decrease in commission over the years.
good,"We have now been reduced to 32 hrs  a week. "
good,At&t pushes you to have no home life. Pays just enough where you cant go anywhere else but works you till that's all you think about. I loved the daily day work. I loved the people I worked closely with. Higher ups ruined what used to be a good place to have a career.
good,"Boy do they try to sell you that culture. I get it, but I was not a drone so I took it with a grain of sand. As with all sales jobs you have goals each day/week/month."
good,"Premise Technician was a good job for many years, though it could be stressful with metrics to meet and constantly changing / added responsibilities. Pay is mostly fair and benefits are good. If you like working on your own and feel that customer service is important, this could be a good fit."
good,"There is much to learn as an AT&T employee. If you enjoy a competitive environment and do not mind coaching and development, give it a shot. Again, lots to learn."
good,"In the past 5-7 years the company has been progressing to a cheaper version of the solid core employees that has made AT&T what it is today.  In my opinion, most techs will be either let go or forced to take a lower paying job in the next 10 years."
good,Calls came  in from customers about their phone service.  My calls was about answering questions about bills and making changes to service.  I was happy to leave as I was quite stressed working there .
good,A stressful place to work. Fast paced environment There is support from management but most seem to be interested in themselves. Metrics are key and must be met.
good,Not really much going on at this location. Tech is old. Environment is mixed with old and hip. Very far from the city. Position wasn't really a traditional developer position. We used a software GUI to do very basic frontend stuff.
good,Decent place to get some sales experience. Starting hourly and commission are pretty good. Not enough time for lunch..................................
good,"This is a service job that has timed metrics figured in to how long it should take to perform a task."
good,I enjoy working at AT&T. It stressful because it's laying off thousands of people over 4 month period with more to come over 2-3 years.  There's a lot of stress on the job because it's very demanding.  And added stress because you don't know when you're going to be laid off though you're doing an exceptional job.  Overall good benefits and pay.
good,"As an employer, AT&T does not hold the same expectation of its higher level managers as it does for its frontline managers. They put immense pressure on the managers and do not help to coach, train or develop them. It is a sink or swim mentally. There are at least 15 metrics that you have to hit every day, it’s too much to keep track of. There is not enough recognition for success and there is almost no positive reinforcement. They only care about the numbers and not the people, even though they attempt to portray that they do care about the people in social media. Having fun is a metric, it’s forced and if you do not participate enough you are punished. Fun is not fun if it’s mandatory."
good,"The company was great at one point, now its all about Direct Tv.  Management will micromanage you to the point of exaustion. They want you to demo Direct Tv to clients that dont have it or even ones that do. Sometimes customers just want to pay a bill and not get harrassed. By 2020 their goal is to make most stores authorized retailers, which will lead to even worse customer service. Heed my warning if you dont sell Direct Tv, you wont last that long. At&t is not about cellphones anymore."
good,"Company has great potential, believes in employee success related to the business. Did not give minority employees opportunity to advance career goals and objective."
good,"Fast paced and very competitive. My last role you previous month was good but your next month should be better. If you're good at sales then this is the place for you, but if you want to advance to other areas good luck. They tend to keep you in a sales minded role if you show promise in those areas."
good,"through several acquisitions/mergers, the culture changed significantly which was ultimately deciding factor in my departure.  It became too stressful with regards to security and affected quality of life."
good,"Overall a good company to work with. A typical day includes meeting with Clients to elicit requirements and work with development and testing teams to have the requirements delivered. Company offers "
good,"AT&T has changed from the very first day i entered about 8 years ago. I came into a place where the office setting was calm and relaxed but because of so many choices available for the customer and the company is not making as much money as it used to, upper management is coming down on the workers and now there is so much stress and tension among the workers."
good,"AT@T is a great company to work for if you want to retire there. Long hours pay off, but are you able to do that job for 15 plus years before a desk job?"
good,"I think there was poor management, because they were young, showed favoritism which kept people like myself from  getting the proper help when asked questions."
good,Prem tech position is not a career position. This is a entry level position. Do not stay in this position. The job is easy but he work culture is all about making numbers.
good,"I have had many roles in my career with AT&T.  When I started as a FST the culture was very much like a family, technicians were happy to be at work and very willing to spend more than the required eight hours a day at work.  In recent years, and since I have been a Uverse technician, the culture is very different.  Technicians are frustrated daily because constant changing of expectations, teaching by discipline and because the delusion of advancement that never comes to fruition."
good,"I would not recommend this job as a RSC for anyone that has a family. Hours are not flexible, they are retail hours. This is a great company as it takes care of its employees."
good,"Like most large corporations they don't appreciate the working man as far as providing more room for advancement ,and job security it's tough to work everyday and constantly hear your job is going to be outsourced overseas,and then suddenly it does,my depts job went to India for 1/3 of the pay.Its rough."
good,the atmosphere was more expecting from the standard work. I loved to learn the new things from the atmosphere. our team was enthusiastic for the new challanges
good,"The pay was great but over the course of time, the longer you are there the harder the job gets. They expect you to be above 100% attainment of your goals every month. If there is a month you fall under 100% they put you on a letter."
good,the environment was always fast and competitive....the hardest part of the job was dealing with all the different personalities the most enjoyable part was making sure the customer was satisfied
good,"a place where there were perks and lots of fun, good humor, management  was understanding and helpful when needed, hardest part was having to listen to many upset callers about their bills, but keeping a calm and rational mind was key, it helped and made me happy to know that I helped someone with their bills. many types of people I worked with. a overall good place to work,"
good,"A typically day at work is responding to emails in the morning since most of AT&T is either in Central or Eastern Time Zone."
good,Struggle in year one due to network. Working with angry customers that previously had to drive over 2 hours to get to a store that could help them. Frustration on lack of internet
good,I was given an opportunity to work with great management and team members and rate worldwide call centers quality of work that was meeting company standards.
good,"Structure is lacking"
good,"Stressful work environment."
good,"They changed everything that made it great. They reduced commissions, made even more difficult to have commission. Management is phony and not realistic with their employees"
good,"A typical day at work is a 8 hour work day in which you take inbound calls from customers with billing and technical issues with their account and devices. Your job is to resolve the customers issue and offer additional products and services including tv, internet, and wireless devices. You are held to quotas that are mainly focused around sales rather than customer service. The culture is very stressful, demanding, and fast paced."
good,"While the strategic direction set by Executive Leadership is unique and groundbreaking, the culture is still rather bureaucratic which is an obstacle that will limit its ability to execute on its plans.  "
good,"job has changed quite a bit from a few years ago. no job security with all the corners the company is cutting to save and recuperate from all the investment they have made in Directv and Time Warner. They create new departments and shut them down months into rolling out. No job security, they even bully reps now one year no union contract and offered an ultimatum either take it or leave it."
good,"AT&T will teach you some invaluable skills that you can take with you just about anywhere. This is especially true for management and B2B roles. Unfortunately as the price of wireless service droops to match other wireless carriers, so does your annual salary. AT&T is an entertainment company, and if you cannot adjust to the changing environment and business demands work part time if anything."
good,Nice - people - but very stressful and uncertain environment....No flexibility  - very process oriented and admin - work gets in the way of real work......
good,"Benefits were provided that were average.  I performed the role of two individuals, so the schedule was hectic.  Raises are minimal, but the bonuses more than makes up for the smaller raises."
good,I enjoyed working with the people of AT&T but was not always the happiest about the pay. I learned a lot about technology which I am very greatful for.
good,"This was a very cut throat company where not everyone was on the same agenda.  Often, there were battles, sometimes heated, on direction.  That being said, we were on what was at the time cutting edge technology that made it a very exciting place to work"
good,"Se aprende mucho ahi, pero la cantidad de trabajo es bastante por tan poco sueldo ademas de que no te dejan teenr vida fuera de ahi"
good,"Taking an average of 150-200 calls a day related to billing and payment issues. I learned a lot about customer service, problem solving, taking initiative and communicating with other departments to resolve issues."
good,"Cingular is no longer in existence but it was considered ""orange"" and then when AT&T bought it back, the AT&T people were considered ""blue"".  but we eventually  became one."
good,Great benefits and good pay but the company is very top heavy. Lower management comes from the field and but gets a lot of pressure from above to micro manage their subordinates. The quality matrix forces techs to cut corners and be unsafe to make their numbers which results in repeat visits to be fixed and upsets the customer and hurts the previous tech performance creating a false negative performance review.
good,A typical work day is answering phone calls for 8 hours a day providing technical and customer support. The hardest part of the job is not having a good work to family balance. The schedules you work can be very inconsistent.
good,"Day to day we lose more and more people due to lay-offs, but asked to uphold and increase production. With that said, it's hard to beat the compensation provided."
good,Love the work place. Good coworkers. Pretty good supervisors except a handful mostly in the Savannah and South Carolina areas. Great way to meet entertaining new people and customers.
good,No Thank you. I don't care to be included in this feed back system. I was simply wanting to submit a resume to get a new job and finish out a career somewhere else.
good,"When I was there. management seemed in disarray. Unexpected for such an established ""organization"". Typical day was short meeting, review day/week and then goout into field to sell or educate or manage reps at various retail locations."
good,"Great place to work if you have proficient sales skills, very demanding and stressful fast paced workplace. Do not recommend for people who do not have the sales skills as your paycheck (and job) depends on it."
good,"a typical day at the work site involves, email review and response, phone call response, HR assistance with employees and management, communication with vendors and distributors, order and reservation management. Payroll error resolutions, vacation and day off over-seeing and clarification."
good,"Working for AT&T  was a challenge, you were always on the road never knew which state you were going to next. The money was not bad, but it was 14 days on and 1 day off. It was hard for those who had families."
good,"Facilities are poorly maintained."
good,The job in its self isn't hard at all. Its the management that brings about all the stress. The number system that they go by is set up for techs to fail and every little thing falls back onto you. The work hours have gotten better but sometimes still tends to run quite late into the night making it hard to balance work/home life at times.
good,"Opportunities not based on Merit.  I love working with a varied array of individuals but Executive Management creates divides with an ""over kill"" of Diversity recognition and workload."
good,"You come to work, sign on and start programming.  Talked with coworkers, attended meetings, and turned in assignments.  When it was South western bell people were more relaxed and less stressful."
good,"At first when it was PacBell, it was better. Now its all about widgets and poor management that only care about their numbers. You took a failing company in Illinois and are now implementing their practices. MSOC is no bueno."
good,Sorry any input i would add would be a waste of your time.  It has been too long since i work at the company to being any true value of what it is like
good,"The opportunities AT&T gave me, I will always appreciate and never forget. They took a chance on me not knowing what to expect and, I gave them everything I had. The direction the company is moving into and the culture with has been uneasy as of late, with contract talk with the union stalling, and decreased positions, the writings are on the wall. I enjoyed my coworkers, they are more like family. Ive learned so many different aspects about myself, and great techniques to take with me."
good,"Training was efficient for the job tasks, alot of young people working there, very immature, stressful inbound calls, complaints were a regular task, if you do not deal well with pressure this job is not for you, be willing and able for lots of sales"
good,As a lead I would check in with the manager for any issue that would need to be address and check a special email box for any request for assistance need by field workers. Opening several systems one being a chat room that I monitor in case fellow employee have questions or need direction while assisting the field. I also make flyers and send email/instant message for any event of announces that needs to be share with the floor.
good,No work available so you get sent home with no pay or use your vacation time to make it up.  Union doesn't help to secure uverse technicians are guaranteed 8 hours work.  If theres no work that day they will send you home early.
good,"This was a very fast paced and stressful environment.  We were not just customer service, we were pushed to make sales in order to maintain employment. With the direction of the economy things were very stressful at that time.  I loved my coworkers and management but the job wasn't easy."
good,This was a great stepping stone job for me. It gave me new resources I did not have before and I am thankful for that. I learned a a lot about sales and was able to take free training to help me be a more rounded employee.
good,Al estar en proceso de fusión se genera todo un cambio en la estructura organizacional que provoca una etapa de desajustes en la administracion provocada por luchas de poder desde las subdirecciones de los grupos pertenecientes a ambas empresas adquiridas por AT&T.
good,"AT&T as a company is a great company. They just need to be more selective and sensitive about the kind of managers they select to manage their shops. Some of these managers can be very negative, hateful and prejudice for no reason. But I don't believe these managers are a reflection of the company as a whole unless the company continues to ignore the numerous complaints from employees about such managers.  Unfortunately, my overall rating is based on some of the bad experiences I encountered with the Manager I was assigned to. I believe that if I was placed under a different manager, my rating would have been different."
good,This is a company willing to compensate you for a poor work life balance. It is very competitive and all about the bottom line wherever that line is set for that day. As an employee you understand that neither you or the customer are import just that ever moving bottom line. Up side is you touch a lot of different systems and are provided with access to virtually unlimited training opportunities. Unless you are exec lvl this is a job not a career.
good,"was making great money but then compensation for sales began to dwindle. became frustration, also seemed as though the company was more focused on cost cutting than retain good experienced employees, fun work environment generally, lots of opportunity bu ultimately cuts to commissions cause me to leave"
good,"The managers, general managers and area manager treat representatives as if they are indispensable. Your job is not secured no matter how great your stats are. If a manager doesn't like you they will make sure to get you fired, no explanation needed from you because what the manager says goes."
good,Get to work and work on sales and building a relationship with the customer.  I learned how to give the best customer experience possible. Management can be hit or miss.  A lot of drama with workplace culture.  Trying to overcome no's when a customer clearly does not want something you are offering.  Building friendships with fellow employees.
good,Great place to work. The management team not great to work . Let there egos play a role in how they managed people instead of respecting people and being available when needed.
good,Was a great place to work from 1988 until around 2008.     Now downsizing and loosing care for employees and customers.     I think once the company gets to the right size it could be a good place to work again.
good,This is a standard call-center job - hundreds of employees churning away on the phones for 8-10 hour days.  Very customer service and performance oriented.  Later company was acquired by an even larger global telecommunications company.
good,"Working at ATT Mobillity you better be ready to give up any semblance of work/life balance. Schedules are done based off seniority. You'll never get weekends off, always get bumped for PTO in favor of more senior employees. Pay is ok but could be much better as they've continued to decrease the commission structure for sales reps."
good,This would be a great job if it wasn't for company policies and unreasonable expectations on its work force. Very high stress job and very low morale among workers.
good,It's was a fun atmosphere came with bonuses and benefits. The pay is ok depending if you work for a third party. The customers belittle you a lot and and the end of the day I was emotionally drained as well as mentally and eventually physically.
good,"very high paced environment, great company to work for. always in the know of new technology and devices and friendly coworkers. Hardest part of the job is the hours."
good,AT&T is a very large multi billion dollar company. It is a great place to work for if you're sales driven. You works with multiple different types of people. It's a friendly environment.
good,"The job is not very complicated once you've learned the ropes. The downside is that a lot of the sales goals are out of reach, especially if you are catering to lower income areas."
good,"AT&T is a typical corporate environment. I would recommend this if you just need a job to get you by, but I wouldn't consider it a place where you can have a career."
good,"Customer Service Representative"
good,Everyone would talk about everyone - making it hard to work/perform  as this became a factor in not trusting anyone since people would love o spread rumors.
good,"Call customers that inquired about mortgage."
good,"Again I say, corporate world is very political and if you do not know how to play the political game, you will not make it! It is unfortunate but it is true."
good,"I worked there a long time, and over the last 8-10 years they were slowly out sourcing the work and laying off long time employees.  You no longer had a upper management that was there for the employees, just the bottom line."
good,"Revenue, churn and political connections are all that matter. If you do not clear the revenue and churn hurdles your connections may be able to save you."
good,Management tries to take care of you.  But AT&T culture is to grind its employees that work in the field to the ground.  Dispatch has no problem ensuring that they can make their bonus.  While forcing you to drive your entire service area.  Crossing paths of other technicians that were just down the road from where you are heading.
good,"installing internet.  crawl spaces, attics, and telephone poles.  it works for some people, not for others.  Metrics system is skewed against technicians.  Management bonuses are tied to those metrics."
good,"Trying to squeeze a nickel out of a penny with new pay scale. Losing good employees because of it. Still opportunity for growth and decent pay, but took a big hit the last two years on income potential."
good,The money is great. Management no so much. Very hard to find a way to balance home/work life. Never know what time you will be off work. Makes it hard to make plans
good,Lots of employees are always out on disability due to high levels of stress on this job.  The pay and the benefits are good but the low level of manager training and team leads allows for high stress working environment.
good,"If you're a tech for this company, you're at the bottom of the totem pole and management is terrible. There's no communication at all and is so unorganized. They're always trying to find a way to fire technicians or write them up. If there wasn't a union to protect the technicians, the turnover rate would be at 90% at the very minimum. It's actually pretty amusing bc the technicians are the face of the company since they're the ones that do the installations and reparations for the company's customers. Yet, they're constantly belittled. The only good thing about the company are the benefits and your coworkers that try to help you if you need help, but since the majority of the technicians are males, you also have a lot of laziness amongst your peers. I honestly don't think Randall Stephenson knows about his own employees at this level. There are a lot of dudes in fancy suits in the corporate offices that like to change work environments for the techs even if the solution proves to work. Rather than hearing the opinions of the workers, they go off of their own policies when they have zero experiences in the field. It's a huge difference between working in a cubicle versus working next to power lines 20 ft in the air. "
good,"Definitely a huge learning experience if you have what it takes to excel. Many different opportunities to gain experience in technical knowledge. Culture can be great but there are a lot of associates in your business, as well as management. Hourly wage does not compensate for everything you're expected to do. Benefits are great aside of healthcare."
good,"Company was an ok environment. We would just copy and paste responses to the customer. Pay was kind of low,. You would get paid per chat conversation. Sometimes chats would come in slow."
good,job is a great job but advancement is not there. its more for your going to college kind of job but if your looking for a career you might want to look some where else. They are always cutting employee benifits
good,"My typical work day involves meeting new and existing customers, providing attention to their needs and what we can right fit for them."
good,"Find and fix issues with the cable and or fiber optics, always in the public eye working in all types of weather. Can be a dangerous job and your full attention is needed"
good,back then the customer rate on DTV was bad. the work environment was not pleasant alt of favoritism and unorganized management team no support from supervisors on help request overall was very negative place to work
good,Job was a tense environment. Between customers screaming constantly and the pressure of upper management of moving customers as fast as possible off the phone it felt as if it was a no win situation. I compensation was competitive for the skills provided.
good,"AT&T has budget cuts and don't even keep up with their contracts which are year long. It has been challenging working for AT&T long-term. "
good,"Usually stores have solid co workers, teams become family like but confused management and upper management can make for a stressful workplace. Poor work life balance but better than average pay for retail job. Opportunity for advancement but generally leans towards selling whatever the current hot product to sell is but then new managers are not prepared to lead a team and often flame out incredibly fast or keep spamming the hot product which leads to poor upper management."
good,"It all depends on who you work with, managers and co workers. I didn't mind coming to working because my co worker were cool and helpful, didn't seem like i was at work. Best Part Unlimited Overtime. I made bank doing the overtime. I miss it and would go back for the overtime."
good,"I would arrive to work at about 7 am and would work until 4:30 pm unless required to work overtime. I learned about low voltage telecommunications lines mainly dealing with copper. The management started off better than it ended. I as well as my fellow co-workers were on a temporary contract of 2 yrs with the option of additional months. Towards the end some safety issues arose and management began to question if we wanted our jobs because of the unwillingness to go against company safety guidelines. The culture was nice, the fellow co-workers were willing to help and give advice and share knowledge if it was needed. The hardest part of the job was the winter months when it would get cold working outdoors. The most enjoyable part of my job was the work that I completed and to the effort I put into my work in order to meet the standards that were expected."
good,"no comment. I have no more to contribute."
good,"More work for fewer persons.  Benefits shrinking each year goes by.  Mind set is always sell sell sell, and customer service comes in second if at all."
good,"I had a great time working with AT&T Mobility. The downside was growing pains after merger and poor regional manager. "
good,Free cell service and discounts on internet and TV service. Hard to accomplish goals set by the company. Must have thick skin working in consumer facing retail environments.
good,"A typical week for me consists of on Monday's reviewing all the sales data, inventory, employee hours for the previous week and putting that all into a report and sending out to my team. Conference calls with our inventory, merchandising and sales executives every Monday are also necessary each week to go over the upcoming week and goals. Tuesday, I review all my reporting from the previous day with my team, hold my team calls and weekly 1 on 1's. Typically I prepare for travel on Tuesday evening into one of my markets for a market visit with one of my Market Managers from Wednesday to Friday. On Friday, I usually travel home and write up my week ending reports and catch up on any emails that I may have received while travelling that week. The next week, is repeated in the exact same order."
good,Overall experience with the company satisfactory When I first started with the company it was Bellsouth which was a company that cared for its employees. When AT&T took over everything changed and not for the good!
good,"seniority gets first pick of hours, not too bad though. preferred the 3-12 shift. managers are a little go hard. not so understanding about a life outside work."
good,"The benefit is working for the customer, seeing them happy, and  building great relationship and connections.  Of the many managers I worked under, only one cared enough to show me how to grow and move forward.  The others were just worried about how you could make their paycheck bigger."
good,The hardest working job Ive ever had. They definitely got the butter from the duck. Pay was ok and overtime is guaranteed. You won't have any personal life.
good,"Stay away from wireline operations--look for a big data or similar IT job .  AT&T is large corp that pays well.  It is a company that is in a continual budget cutting mode as they hand union employees healthy raises and benefits while at the same time are reducing management compensation (includes technical management). "
good,Good benefits pay could be better  drama filled work atmosphere and  no family life always working have to be there 10 years to have a weekend off  always have to work closing shifts based off sonority
good,"Most days were great.  As we all know when dealing with people that's subject to change. The hardest part was counting inventory. I started out managing the store, which was a challenge but I was determined to succeed. I could never really take a lunch for a while until they hired someone else to help me. That location and several other stores have since closed."
good,"Company moving 50% of workforce to outsourced jobs, the union is about to strike because of ATT greediness"
good,AT&T Mobility use to be a great place to work but now I dislike going to work everyday. I feel AT&T Mobility value their customer more than they value their employees.  Happy employees=Happy customers.
good,"Great place to learn and interact with customer gain knowledge. However as a company in order to advance you must ""KNOW"" someone. Your honest work ethics does not afford you the ability to move a head and if you don't speak up for yourself you will find yourself out the door."
good,"when i first started working there they weren't union so they could get rid of you for pretty much anything and the employees were treated poorly, but ive heard since they've gone union it has improved some"
good,Not a very good management structure. Not sure about the requirements. Compensation not up to the market standards. Work life balance not good.  Inexperienced Higher staff.
good,"Stressful environment, this company doesn't care about personal/family life. The moral was very disappointing. So depending on location it may be a better call center environment"
good,It's a really good job if you are a good committed worker and don't have much else that demands your time such as a family. Their attendance policy is really tuff and if you want to take any of your paid time you have to do so a month ahead of time.  You also never have a consistent schedule.
good,"Great oppurtunity to make money, however lack of  positivity at workplace. Requires only GED, i started almost right after high school and was averaging $45-$50,000 a year"
good,This company is a company that wants you to succeed in your sales and make sales to all customers that come in the store. This company has great pay when you're selling lots of products.
good,Working from home is great but every year they do lay offs and you never know if you are one that is out.  The position I was in changed every few years.
good,The hardest part of the job is making people want products they have no need for. A typical day is meeting with clients and going over what they have and figuring out how to get them to want more.
good,"Working customer service is very fast paced. Back to back calls for 8+ hours a day (mandatory overtime when I worked there, so 12 hour days when I was there). Pay was stable, but Job security was not. Every day felt like the day you were going to be let go."
good,"Micromanagement, Commission has gone down in the last several years. Everything is based on seniority. "
good,"AT&T has high satisfaction in corporate offices."
good,"Good pay and benefits, but plan on working 50+ hours a week to meet all job duties. A typical day at work consists of teaching and coaching employees, working to resolve any issues with accounts, and customers, as well as any fire drills from your management. Management is supportive, and culture is good, but out of touch on the amount of time it takes to get everything done, resulting in working 50+ hours a week, and even more at home."
good,"They lie and say they care about the individuals that work for them, they demand perfection and hide the flaws that they have behind a decent wage, but expect more work than the wage is actually prepared for now and demand it to be done in an unfair amount of time."
good,"Upper management does not take the time to get to know their employees and is only looking for a number to be hit. Also, they like to talk about following the rules but as long as certain people are hitting numbers they can break as many rules as they want."
good,"ATT is an awesome company,  the micro management and the favoritism in certain call centers is of a concern.  You are pushed a lot and stressed when there is no need for it.  Do your job thats all you need to do some managers take to the extreme. "
good,"Good place to work, overall it was fun.  just be careful of the layoffs.  leadership is good.  benefits are also good.  just be very careful of layoffs."
good,Business closed This company gave me a chance to learn management skills. Company had a great relationship with the community. Overall this family owned business was a great experience for me.
good,"Company does not care about work life balance especially as a manager. It really depends on who your higher ups are. In the Philadelphia market close to Jersey it was horrrible, the district managerso would party with reps and want to come into work trying to be professional. Honestly if I worked anywhere else in another area I would maybe give the company 5 stars. The politics were insane and if you did not go clubbing with your boss you weren't liked."
good,This was an internship. I worked in a diverse team and gained a wide exposure to working in a 24/7 operation center. Applied and developed skills in communication.
good,"its an ok company to work for. the pay is great tho. it is hard to grow at this company. Also, the company morale and value for their techs are low. They feel this way because they pay so well and have great benefits. So, if you are looking for a company that pays well and has no growth and treats their employees like another number than this the company for you."
good,Not a family friendly work space. Hours are erratic and management constantly changes their desired results. Pay is good and job security is as well.  Just dont think of having a family or regular schedule
good,"The company is an exceptional example of how to treat its associates and provide suitable benefits, and opportunities to allow an individual to grow and prosper."
good,"AT&T overall is a great company but they do not know how to treat their employees in all areas the position I was i was worked like dogs told when they can go home after they have already completed a 8 hour shift you don't have sick days  and the pay is lacking, the job is neat because of the differences in technology but other than that I don't recall anything good that came of there"
good,Great pay and benefits and easy work with the right skills but stress is placed on employees for situations beyond their control with little or no help from higher management.
good,"I enjoyed helping customers everyday and I loved the always changing technology. I did not like the sales part, it was to the point that the only employees getting promoted were the ones who lied and cheated customers."
good,DirecTV was a great place to work and treated everyone great. Once AT&T took over we saw morale dive bomb and it continues downward. Frequent layoffs.
good,balancing life and work its alot of over time but they force you to do that. It isn't a pleasant environment cause The managers dont look after you. They want you to work but dont look after you when you have problems
good,The people that work there are great but the company is messed up.  They change pay plans every 6 months to a year and want employees to be a General Manager before moving to other positions in the company.
good,"Overall it's a very typical ""day at the office"" work day."
good,AT&T has great benefits and salaries. Work life balance was not very good. It takes a while for benefits to really kick in if you are part time.
good,This department went under as it was costing too much money. They slowly got rid of employees or became inflexible that you'd eventually quit yourself. The department now only employs college students to do the work.
good,"Job stability for AT&T in general is very low at the moment. They have been laying off employees in large numbers for 1 year not and plan to lay off up to another 40% of the companies total employees by the end of 2017. No job is safe at this point and because of the constant influx of employees being surplused, it is near impossible to change jobs. The surplus employees get the first crack, and have priority fill, for open jobs so if you don't like your job.... Good luck getting a new one inside the company!"
good,typical day at ATT included taking phone calls and working trouble tickets for t1 and land based phone lines. learned engineering and component repair. management was helpful. workplace culture was fun while the training lasted but grew worse as we were expected to train ourselves. we were experienced enough to figure it out in time. hardest part of the job was at 1st learning the engineering and working with outside and central office technicians  then having to find our own training info on new systems and testing programs. at the beginning [1999-2007] most enjoyable part was being trained and progressing in new testing programs but from 2007-2016  it was only the pay and benefits.
good,When I started with AT&T is was a stop or so I thought.  Little did I know that I would spend 18 years of my life building relationships with field teams and that bond would be strong.
good,AT&T is a great company to work for but punctuality is strictly enforced. You will gain sales knowledge and how to be effective in the business world. Management is micro. The hardest part of working for AT&T is dealing with the vast changes within the company. The most enjoyable part of working for AT&T was payday and award ceremonies.
good,"Company had great benefits, they also have a union, "
good,"If you like fast paced constant change, then mobility is the right field for you. AT&T went through a lot of reorganizations and shifted jobs around the country. It was difficult to move up within the customer service structure, and the sales structure was very volatile. I felt like I was unable to get enough ""human"" contact to satisfy my personality and eventually it was time to move on. I was able to be an employee for over seven years, providing some stability to my resume, but working there was always a challenge not knowing wha"
good,High sale pace industry had to multi-task and offers sales and service at the same time. Appearance had to be neat and clean and greet customers with a friendly smile and attitude. Work with sales team to help close sales and observed interactions to show what right looks like and provide feedback
good,Management likes to Micromanage. Never flexible with day off's. commission structure changes every year. Management plays favorites with promotions
good,"Room for growth but like a lot of big name companies its not what you know its who you know which can be extremely frustrating,"
good,"This review is for former AT&T Labs, and most of the Software Development is now part or folding into the AT&T Integrated Cloud. This is not the best / most ideal job for those who want to advance in their careers, at least from what I've been exposed to.  I've taken a part-time MBA, communicated my intent to be promoted, and hit a dead end at L3, and they were not advancing Technical Architects who demonstrate P&L and management responsibility.  It is a de-motivating environment when your managers (if your managers) are not focused on supporting their subordinates projects and also providing them with ample resources to make them successful."
good,Its a fast paced environment that has many daily company changes that may or may not be a downfall to an employee. For this job you need to be flexible both physically and mentally and you must always be prepared for last minute change.
good,Union Job has great benefits.  Room for advancement is lacking at call center.  Not very flexible on weekends which is difficult for work/life balance.  In over 6 years I've never seen someone in my department get promoted.  I do have other colleagues in different departments that are non union that love their jobs and have been promoted.  Anywhere else its a great company to work for but at call center life can be difficult and moral is down.
good,When DIRECTV owned the company things where a lot better. The new schedules and 15k cut was to much. Most people are good to work with if you get to work with someone.
good,"I enjoyed my time with ATT. There was always something new to learn in the world of cell phone technology, thus keeping me intrigued. The product was second to none in its field, so basically it sold itself."
good,Job was okay but didn't get paid enough for all the extra work that i was doing. The hardest part of the job was having to set up for technicians to come out on an all day appointment because businesses weren't okay with not having service for full days.
good,I was a manager in a Union environment. Which means I was required to hit a sales target and my reps were not. When it came time to discipline I had to argue the point with Union Stewards who made any excuse to why the employee should not be disciplined for not doing there job. The pay was amazing but made for no work and life balance
good,"Strong representation from CWA makes for great pay and benefit and good attendance/vacation program to work a family around. Retail means for difficult hours on your feet. Large company makes great opportunity for advancement but exiting union upon promotion means large hit in benefits for a small increase in pay. Management is very good about knowing ground level employees even at a state or regional level but sales focus is extremely high pressure and a constant ""what have you done for me lately"" attitude that can be extremely wearing mentally"
good,I was a salesman where we went into stores like best buy and tried to sell direct TV. I only worked there for a few months but everyone there were easy to work with. I enjoyed it but it was too difficult to convince people who had no interest. They weren't at best buy to sign up with  direct TV.
good,you have to train your employees to be more professional.thats it thats all that was bothering me just some issuses they need to work on. they have to learn.
good,"Good benefits and  good job work, but no job security. A lot of job loss. No room for advancement. Good co-workers. The hardest part of the day  is dong the time sheet, what you can and cannot put on the time sheet."
good,"Enjoyed working with people; lots of employee enrichment activities"
good,As a big corporation it is able to pay more than average. But as with other big companies it is constantly outsourcing jobs.
good,Long hours but pay is good. The hardest part of the day is being out in the hot sun. Metrics could be better because they are always changing for the worst.
good,"Started early at 8 everyday."
good,AT&T offers exposure to emerging technologies.  It promotes working from home and has great benefits.  The only downside is that AT&T offers no job security.
good,I enjoyed working for this company. I loved my coworkers and the direct customer interaction. I think that the location of the store has a lot to do with your success.
good,"A typical day on the job is interacting with multiple departments across 13-states coast to coast. I learned that it is a very fast paced, ever changing & growing company. The management was constantly moving & changing as well. I enjoyed working with my staff & interacting with all the other co-workers & departments I supported. The hardest part of my job was having to discipline someone or unable to support someone. The most enjoyable part of my job was going to work everyday & interacting with all those that I supported."
good,Incoming calls from customers who phone service that is not working and needs repaired. It was a pleasure working for the computer and would like to work for them again in the future.
good,"I learned lots about internet services, signal flow, safety equipment, fiber, wires, and tv services. Typical day was checking in the morning, trying to find the equipment needed to complete the days tasks, pick up a 'job' and go to the customers house to install/repair their service, which each job might have completely different needs that must be accounted for. Some might be as simple as plugging it in, some might take over 14 hours strait to finish an install. The co-workers can help if they have the time, management was mostly loose, I had to rely on myself. The most enjoyable part of the job was finding solutions to unique issues."
good,The system is not tech friendly when it comes to cancelled jobs. Pay is not high enough for the position. Not enough advancement availability. Management puts a lot of pressure on the techs.
good,A position for AT&T as a WireTech is a good job but a dead end job. Any hope for advancement is based on seniority and better positions above WireTech are being done away with so WireTechs do all job titles at the lowest pay scale of the company.
good,I help 15-20 customers a day with technical issues and activations. I've been trained on several different systems and train all new employees on each. The customers are the best part about the job but the company does make the quotas high for some of the slower stores
good,Big companies ... what  can you say just a number... good pay but just a number ... the benefits are the plus... upper management should see first hand what they ask their sellers to do.
good,"Trabajar bajo presion, manejar Multitask. "
good,management and team in my location are definitely two-faced. They promote that att is a family workplace but be careful because one thing I've learned is family will stab you in the back before friends.
good,Technology and communication in one place. Working the billing department is a challenge when trying to balance with good customer service. If you apply yourself your learning will never end. It is difficult to work with supervisors that are limited because of union rules. The employees are great to work with but they are not part of the company and therefore it reduces the collective ownership to be productive.
good,"AT&T provides flexibility, and requires results and accountability.  It enable employees a wide range of  career options and growth. The best part of the job is building, sustaining and expanding customer relationships and providing Enterprise Solutions to enable customers business."
good,"Working for ATT U-verse was a great experience at first, but the company has changed a lot now. The company has scripts you have to read to your customers by verbatim and it can be quite tedious at  times when you discus your calls with your supervisor. They have high expectations on the calls. "
good,This job has changed over recent years so much.  I enjoy traveling and assisting owners and their employees become successful. I influence people to properly sell our product and to create door swings where needed. I learned that success can be viewed differently from person to person.    I take pride is making someone start and grow their business. Part of my day is in front of my computer and the other half is doing a store visit. My local management team is great to work with.
good,"Good experience, room for advancement. Enjoyed being around people and training employees on the job. Would deffinitely recommend to friends for employment opportunity."
good,"It was a good job right out of the service. It made the transition from service to civilian very easy. Good communiation, sales, and customer care skills."
good,Fun company to work for. Good benefits. Friendly staff. Flexiable hours.Company growth. Balance. Security. Unioned
good,"Good company with outstanding benefits and pretty good compensation. However, It does cut in to work-home life balance."
good,"Great benefits, schedule built monthly, choice of hours based on time with company. Unrealistic sales goals, commission structure in company favor. You better be on time to the minute. MUST remain coach worthy. Could be a hero one month and be mirco managed the next.   Hardest part of the job was dealing with customers that previously have had a bad experience and they still have a grudge and it reflects on your customer experience surverys.  Commissions are taxed 40%."
good,"Knowledgeable personnel are willing to assist in any area one may be unfamiliar.  Good benefits and multiple opportunities within AT&T"
good,Had some great inspirational people as a boss but had more friends of friends or relatives of upper management that were of poor quality. Either didn't know what they were doing or didn't care.
good,Thank you for giving me this opportunity and i did learn a lot from AT&T in-house applications. Thank you again for such a nice and impressive opportunity  i got.
good,Worked all holidays management never satisfied always raising the bar with goals that are not in your control hard place to work for
good,"A tough, challenging first role that has taught me a lot in 5 years with the company.  That said, benefits and job security aside, AT&T very much struggles with corporate politics and job advancement/career development."
good,"Great job in a competitive market. I called on several established accounts each day assisting them with their ads for radio, local tv and print. Also canvassed for new dealers. I loved the international interactions with my clients who were from all over the world. Built trust to grow our business relationships that also led to increased sales."
good,"Excellent pay, good hours. The work can be frustrating but manageable. There are days where down time is a guarantee but if effects your numbers. Overtime is available in most centers."
good,Its not the company that it used to be. Many good people have or are trying to leave. Ive been there a year and our benefits have increased in cost by 1/3. Our commission plan has decreased twice. All in one year.  It is still AT&T so you can still have a decent career there. If you like money and seeing your family there are better ways to do it.
good,This is a good stable job with benefits and incentives offered regularly. The hours are long and the job is a bit stressful in the call center.
good,I didn't work her long enough to give a fair review. The job just wasn't for me. Union job and felt like just a number and not a person.
good,"Learned very valuable skills that future employers look for, Management training , leadership training. I enjoyed starting out with AT&T made a lot of money as a seller and was promoted to a sales manager position. The problem with AT&T is upper level leadership disconnect with the business on the front lines. Compensation team operates with eyes closed, AT&T is not competitive when trying to keep talented people, they have a ""we will just hire someone and pay them less mentality"""
good,"On a daily basis you install/repair internet, phone, and tv. It's an easy enough job but literally every little thing gets blamed on you. If you run into line trouble and have to put in a helper ticket for a line tech to come fix it then your numbers are effected for something out of your control. You have monthly metrics you must meet. Efficiency, how long AT&T thinks a job should take compared to how long it takes you to finish the job. So if they say it should take 1.5 hours and you take 2 hours then it's your fault. Also if you need a line tech chances are you'll be waiting about 3 hours for them to show up and then average about 1-4 hours for them to fix it so your numbers are screwed for the day. Dispatch Efficiency, how many jobs you close compared to how many tickets you dispatch on. So on a repair if you find line trouble you have to return the ticket and your numbers get hit again for something out of your control. Literally straight out of training you have a target on your back to meet outrageous numbers for someone brand new to the field. Training is nothing like the real deal. The pay for this position is decent. You start out between 15-20 an hour but once you start dealing with all the BS its almost not worth it. They have us doing 3 different jobs for the price of one. They put you through 1 week of DirecTV training then throw you in the field to figure it out. Fiber training is only a day then they don't provide you the tools to do a fiber job and when you run into trouble finding tools it is your fault for not being prepared. Work/Life balance is a toss up."
good,I have a neutral position and do not wish to submit a specific review at this time.  Thank you for the opportunity to provide feedback.
good,Not a bad job. Just never felt like I was working with a team or toward a goal. Very little coaching from management on how to get better at the job. Training could of been more thorough and emphasized more on sales techniques for the specific products. Great pay.
good,"Took calls for yellow pages, job was okay. Day to day was work,break, lunch ,break again and it repeated every day. Very boring and pay was not good.Entry level position."
good,"The people I work with are great. But the cutthroat sales environment makes each day more stressful than the next. The focus on customer service is a plus, but it quickly takes a back seat."
good,You are just a number and you will be treated as such. Its hard to get real feedback from your leadership team. They are all worried about their own jobs.
good,Work flows were extremely silo'd and the not team oriented and functions were not aligned to achieve overarching goals.  Line management treated employees as untrustworthy and micromanaged unnecessarily.
good,It's a job that pays the bills.  There is very little opportunity for advancement and there isn't a career advancement department to assist with your career life.
good,"Great peers and subordinates..  Upper management and Execs are really shady.  Not straight forward, little coaching.  Every time I asked what I could do different nothing was ever told to me but keep doing what you are doing"
good,Overall a nice place to work. I was in the Aurora store and the other co-workers were very helpful and informative. Some days are late and you will be called in on a regular basis. But not bad if you don't mind that type of scheduling.
good,"I thought the pay was great and I thought it would motivate me to put up with the difficulty of the job itself, the rude uncaring management, the physical hazards of the job, and the unending amount of inhibiting, obnoxious policies you are strictly held to--but it didn't."
good,"It was great as far as money, I would work long hours and so the money I made was good, as far as management went, my personal experience was not so good the reason being was that I believed that there should be training for management since the business changes so much."
good,"The company is customer focused, willing to do what it takes to make the customer happy within reason. However, as an employee at the retail level the growth opportunities are limited if you want to seek opportunities at the corporate level. Benefits are excellent."
good,Great company to work for. Great people and great pay. You make what you sell. You don't sell then you don't eat. Now know this is well past twenty words.
good,"The current culture is shifting rapidly towards future technology as older platforms and services become extinct.  Job growth is available in new technology sectors but, legacy employees have limited access due to constant downsizing initiatives.  Advanced training in several areas is available at no cost to the employee - must be done on personal time.  However, the risk of job loss is very high, especially before transformation of skills or advanced training is complete."
good,"busy at work a lot of business, I learned how to sell, manangement was horrible you do not have their support, coworkers like every company has your back sheep that start drams but others that will back you up, hardest part of the job is having management breathing down your throat. The most enjoyable part is networking meeting new people everyday,"
good,"Development of new employees was awesome.  My own personal development seemed to get put off by my managers. I would recommend working here, just make sure you take ownership of your own development."
good,"People are calling upset because a bill promise had not been kept and it is a requirement to sell then home services when they are angry about their current service.  Home service markets are saturated, making sales very difficult if not impossible in most cases, I was very good at my job but the expectations were ridiculous even for me."
good,"I was with AT&T for many years. Always on time, always should up, always ranked at the top of my department in production & quality, but after 14 years of employment, when the department become obsolete, none of that matter. I was given a severance and showed the door. I just thought after the loyalty I showed the company, perhaps some of that would have been reciprocated. I was wrong. I did enjoy my time there enough to always be motivated and do my job."
good,"-A typical day at work answering billing questions building relationships with customer and trying to sell to every customer that walks through the door."
good,"Working there is very unpredictable, since it is a commission based job. Also, I worked in a flagship store that left a very bad taste in my mouth especially since the employees were committing fraud."
good,"After working here for the past 16 years, they decided to close out this call center so they have more flexibility at their Headquarter in TX, they didn't care what performance status you are in, as long as you carry the title as me, all gone, the whole department is being layoff."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was applying my knowledge. It was a great experience to have worked and assisted Enterprise clients.  The hardest part was the lack of communication with Sales
good,Helping customers and dealing with employees. Learning a lot about products and competitors. Management will help you understand the ways to sell and become better at sales.
good,"This was my first sales position, the best thing about this job was the ability to advance within the ranks rather quickly! On the contrary, there were many other issues that this company had. I strongly believe, that the company should have provided better management, and coaching for the staff and the company as a whole to grow."
good,"Answering phone calls as well as making outbound calls to DirecTV customer trying to get them to upgrade there satellite channels, and making sure they were happy with the service."
good,"Review Team Stats fro the previous day looking for inconsistencies to correct such as schedule and durations.  Work with representatives on Time off, quality checks of work done by representatives and coach if needed.  Provide feedback in both positive and constructive as needed.  "
good,"Everyone you can physically see you will love them because you will see them more than you see your family. Watch out though, Applied math is not common at this place so prepare for 1+1 to equal 3. Find a good doctor because you will need him. Lots of antidepressants will be prescribed but don't worry, working for these people you will need them. If you are willing to trade your sanity for a $50000/yr or more job then this may work for you. Benefits are A1"
good,"Needed something different. Times were great and bad. Hardest thing was to hear people's problems while they lost service due to no payment. Times it was at&t fault, reps were never trained the same. Call centers were trained differently."
good,"Was a great job, was treated very well for 18+ years. Will miss it. Received training in many telecom technologies. Worked with a fantastic crew of technicians. The most enjoyable part of the job was the moment customers IPTV and HSIA was restored."
good,"Te posibilita el equilibrio entre la vida personal y laboral."
good,Great coworkers to work with most are very helpful and believe in team work. Most managers are very tyrannical which adds stress to the job unnecessarily. The executive team ignores the negative attitude and terrible actions of lower management which makes for very dissatisfied employees. If the managers would treat employees more fairly and decent then this would be a fantastic place to work.
good,"The world's largest telecommunications and entertainment company. Extreme amount of red tape, politics and nepotism.  The mobility division is all about the numbers with little room for advancement.  Continuing education opportunities abound however, coupled with the limited growth opportunities, avenues to use those newly acquired skills are narrowed and difficult to traverse.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with my fellow teammates.  Over-hiring increased the sales force and has lead to a decrease in teamwork and commission wages.  The CEO and upper level management are focused on improving the company at every level however area and store management does not attempt to develop and promote front line employees."
good,Very talented and dedicated people to work with. Worked with clients in various parts of the world and enjoyed the challenge.
good,The pay and benefits are great! The management does not have a best interest for your career and the high turnover rate explains that.  You do meet a lot of different people and that is good.
good,"Telecommunication industry is in constant flux, with jobs and roles frequently changing. Due to mergers and industry changes, the part of the company I worked for is no longer in place."
good,"You are never appreciated for your hard work and dedication to the job. "
good,"I was a billing and general inquiry specialist."
good,People who tired paying to much call to cancel the account . you need persuade them by stay by found their needs and wants.  Do a health check on  their account to find out if their package matches. also offered credit available to meet their needs and wants.
good,"Pay and benefits good, but work very demanding and stressful.  Very long hours and additional resources needed to improve overall results of team."
good,Apac is an outsource vendor for inbound call center representatives. I found that they were an average place to work despite their poor reputation in Green Bay.
good,"Its a job which is constantly changing with all the new products and services that at&t comes out with. No work life balance, company must come first mentality, but at the end of the day you are just a number. Store managers are forced to work 50 plus hours a week. The upper management is constantly threatening job."
good,"Several technologies learned, nice Benefits but there are always overwork hours, and little growing opportunities, monthly pay days is difficult to administrate"
good,Great job for young adults or college students starting or older people who don't mind working on weekends. I didnt like the work life balance and having to work every weekend. quotas constantly being raised and commission constantly dropping. overall it isnt a bad place to work just stay positive and motivated ( which was sometimes hard to do. )
good,"A good stead job, with a good company.  Pay is much lower for the job and talent they have.  Benefits are good but we carried most of them through my wife where it was better."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of answering over 200 calls from clients and providing them with helping information'"
good,"They tend to overwork the technicians there. No one goes home untill all the jobs are picked up. High demands for your numbers to be perfect all the time but the bonusus that come every 3 months are great. Management is horrible, no support and you always have to watch what you say, always someone watching you."
good,"Network company, you must have a personal relationship with your boss or you knew someone has the power to promote you in order to get promoted."
good,"It was always nice when I could actually help someone. Management daily would send out the numbers let you know if you were hitting them or not.  If you were, it still could always be better, and should be.  Co workers were nice.  They always would tell everyone that it will get better and that everyone has good days and bad.  Hardest part of the Job was always feeling like they could let you go at any moment.  Stressful working environment."
good,"Sales role where ""fun"" is based on success in the now. Very number driven with spreadsheets ruling much of the decision making. A lot of red tape to get through as there are many departments included in projects."
good,The job would be great if they didn't have so many goals and requirements we have to meet. Some managers make the job harder than it has to be.
good,"As a Technical I get to work with different type clients of AT&T each day is very different to the next, and of course, some days stand out more than others."
good,Like working with different people on a daily basis. also like the fact that you paid a certain amount for your cable because you worked there.
good,"This was a good job, but the only problem was it was commission based only, and I needed a steady check. We worked as a group, doing door to door sales."
good,"During my time at AT&T I went through no less than 20 ""downsizing"" experiences. Despite that, it was a good place to work most of the time. Great salary, health insurance was just alright, but there were a great deal many other benefits."
good,You deserve every penny you make there.  A lot of great people to work with.  Used to really love job when first started a lot of things changed and so did mgmt.
good,"Ok place to work management could be more supportive. "
good,"Good benefits and pay, but the stress level is through the roof. Typical big company politics. Changes are vast and without cause."
good,"I was in a Union protected position, yet only 3 months after renegotiating our contract, they announced my job position was being done away with. I followed all protocol to fight this decision...HR, my Union rep, and even wrote a letter to my chain of command. After the letter I was retaliated against, which was reported to the EEOC. We are currently in a class action lawsuit as there were approximately 2,000 affected. "
good,"I was working through InfoCision at the time. There was ots of calling and being forced to lie to customers and pressure to sell to those that don't need the products we offer."
good,"great job security if you don't have life situations,  great benefits, if you can stay on top of modern technology you can succeed."
good,"If you want to work hard, you can be compensated decently.  The schedule is not the best (weekends, nights, etc), however, the vacation time and benefits are satisfactory."
good,"Assist team of 20 agents with managing schedules, hearing phone calls verifying and making sure agents were following call flow and also making sure agents are making their daily performance stats by making sure there reaching their credit check goals package penetration goals and also most important in closing every sale at the end of every call. If agent did not close sale agent must attempt to get supervisor for assistance if not agent would be coached on proper procedures and would have tough conversation even up to corrective action. Report hourly performance updates to operations manager and explain key metrics and why we weren't at goal. Also would conduct daily huddles with team to let them know how their previous day’s performance was and were they needed to improve on. Also would conduct monthly performance reviews for every agent and let them know where they stand and were there key metric performance and were they needed improvements on."
good,"For the 26 years that I worked for AT&T, it was always a flexible work environment, therefore as I continued there after having a family, it was great for me.  "
good,"This job is mentally and emotionally challenging, but has rewarding moments. A typical day you are educating, correcting cellular and device issues or concerns. Other times are more of a therapist. The hardest part about this job is when there isn't an immediate resolution or one to the customers liking. The most enjoyable part of this job would be the people you come across over the phone and in person."
good,"Day starts at 730am, with very little supervisor coordination, we rush to the customer home to begin the work day. New cat5 cable is installed for most homes, this should ensure stability to the modem which acts as a server to the home. I learned to create home networks to ensure the smooth transfer of data around the home. Management usually allows each tech free reign on how a home is installed. Hardest part of the job is making sure that the network signal is consistently strong, ensuring a good experience for the customer. It is most enjoyable when done at a customers home they enjoy the new service of a new technology."
good,The sales quotas are being raised monthly but the compensation is decreasing at the same time. Very challenging environment
good,I gained a lot of management experience and training through their leadership intern program.  Excellent training opportunities.
good,nothing bad to say this job i would call growing pains. Money Great money very bad management ! Growing Retail Pain..........
good,Preception is everything. Who you know is how you get ahead. Its a good job but requires more than you can handle on a daily basis. If you have no personal life then its a great job for you.
good,"I would say the Retail Management is very poor, Attendance Policy is archaic and the politics run deep; but a great place to begin your career."
good,Management policies are different per manager. There are no set rules.My co-workers were always great to work with! The most enjoyable part of my day was speaking to customers and being able to resolve their issues
good,"Was good years ago but employees are losing more and more perks every year.  Buildings are being closed.  Telecommuting policy has been squashed.  So commute times may increase substantially.  "
good,"During my time in AT&T Government Solutions, they were going through some difficult times. The company was being brought out by a smaller rival and they were not winning government contracts, Internally, the management structure seemed to have a more subjective approach for advancement instead of some clear paths to follow. In their defense it was my first job post military service where the progression is much more objective and clear,"
good,"answer phones, constant change, currently merging with AT&T...gift cards and games made working for directv fun and challenging"
good,"Busy work day. Need to improve the way they train employees to do the work they're assigned to do. Need to set aside funds to give employees the tools they need to do their job. Example: pencils, pens and notebooks."
good,"A good day at att is when you are able to do your job.  great benefits, great pay.  long hours. could be very stressful "
good,"•	Installed and Implementated New Cisco Products"
good,If the work is slow they find reason to suspend people. training is terrible. Start working on your own without knowing how to do the job properly
good,"no work/life balance no room for growth"
good,"I liked this job because im young, but it sucked when you took in account how many hours I was working, 140-150 every 2 weeks. This job pays by the job, not by the hour so you will be working hard for every dollar you will be making."
good,"I worked an 8 hour day, 5 days a week. There are different teams that do different tasks. The problem was that there was rarely any training on the new group. One was simply thrown in sink or swim. With the help of others, I was able to learn new things such as a little JSON and network emulation testing and networking. I learned how to introduce signal noise using a Rain-Fade machine. As far as co-workers, we were all friendly to each other for the most part. We watched out for each other from forces that may try to bring us down. The manager is okay. I feel that he was not right for the position when he was promoted out of nowhere. The hardest part was not being trained and thrown on a project that I had no information for its handling. Also, whomever designed the JIRA database, made it too cumbersome and clumsy to use compare to other JIRA databases I had used in the past. The most enjoyable part was the people. We were more than co-workers; we were friends."
good,Not a practical work environment. Managers are incompetent. There is no HR department and people were very offensive. The training was very short as well as inadequate.
good,Great company with years of history. If you are able to be mobile there is a lot of career opportunity. Diverse and leadership opportunities quickly at times.
good,This is an hourly plus commission based job. When I first started 4 1/2 years ago there were only 5 categories of quotas to maintain. Now there are over 16 categories. It is a very fast changing work environment with new procedures and new products sometimes on a weekly basis. There is a lot of micromanaging and upper management does everything possible to squeeze as much as they can out of you. This leads to uncertain job security. When upper management does not feel like you're performing to their standards they will find a way to fire you. Im glad I am no longer there.
good,When i left the company it wasn't on the best of terms. The associates I worked with were good people but the store owner was a complete jerk.
good,"Very busy office.  Great place to work learned a great deal. Good telemarketing experience, and customer service with customer support for the customers."
good,"It's a great company to work for. But at times it can be hard to move around to different positions like management or departments. There's no sick time. So if you'reokay with that, then this is the company for you."
good,"Inbound call center for DirecTV (Revana) I would take calls regarding customer service, retention, billing and winbacks. They had good training. The management was kind of all over the place, and it seemed like no one was on the same page. It was fun to work there and the people were nice. The only reason I am no longer there is because I relocated to Mesa AZ and the commute was really long at the time and I wanted something closer to home."
good,"Hired on as a a Technical Help Desk person. Has turned into CSR 1.5. Spend about 20% of my day dealing with Tech issues, 80% dealing with Customer issues and Billing and Service calls."
good,Management and co-workers want to work but have been overlooked in favor of in experienced contractors.. Scary times indeed.
good,AT&T's culture was delivered with a fun work environment to replace the lack of developed management. A day in AT&T's technical support was harder with the lack of authority. You received more help from CSR's than management. There training is approximately three weeks and they expect you to grasp all knowledge without proper training.
good,I had to adapt to diverse background of Internetwork experience. The staff was very helpful in sharing information. Management was very reaxed. I learned a lot about the diverse components of triple play services.
good,was not very happy with ATT do to layoff and union structure. was at company for 4 years and found very difficult to grow in my position
good,"a typical day at at&t starts off with starting my computer systems and getting prepared to begin to take up to 80 calls during my shift. co-workers are very helpful. the hardest part is due to certain circumstances i am not able to satisfy every customer. the most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers with understanding their phone plans, bills and setting up payment arrangements."
good,"Great Projects, especially at the Foundry. Depends on where and who you work for. There is always alot going on, and some of the people there can be difficult to deal with."
good,Mainly customer care and first call resolution.  The coworkers are what made the job great. Had to move with wife getting a new job in Denver
good,there are some great people who work here but it is a place where there is no job security. Leadership will say we are doing great and we are constantly purchasing other companies but there is a layoff at least once a year if not twice. This does not lead to an environment that causes people to feel secure.
good,Helping customers with their wireless needs while managing the stores functions. at the time as an assistant manager it seemed as though store manager was rarely in the work place. only to check on numbers of sales and associates numbers.
good,Good company with room for growth. I recommend this company to anyone looking to start a career with a great company. Great company
good,I have the best manager ever!  I really learned a lot on his team.  The hardest part of my job was to be told that I was in surplus status and my job was being eliminated.
good,"I was supporting the President and learned a lot about HR in that role.  Due to a reorganization, the Quebec division was eliminated."
good,"if you want work life balance you will never get it here, the job is asks a lot more than what the compensation is worth. not much room to growth unless you can play their games"
good,"Worked there for over 7 years, pay and benefits are top notch. However work hours are horrible and not much in the way of advancement opportunities unless you want to move to Texas. Typical day is taking back to back calls from customers while trying to work with AT&T programs to resolve their issues as quickly as possible. Coworkers and first level management are great, no issues there."
good,"while working for at&t i was to answer inbound calls and assist customers with any issues they may have had. while on the phones i would do billing and payments , as well as sales and service. i was to provide excellent customer service in an efficient and friendly way,"
good,"Working at AT&T can be rewarding and stable, but in recent years has been a bit of a roller coaster.  In the eight years I have worked at AT&T I survived 6 rounds of downsizing and worked for 5 different supervisors.  Most of my supervisors were great.  They gave me the latitude to do my job and the tools to get it done.  My last supervisor was condescending and micro-managing who was much more interested in self aggrandizement than having the team work well together."
good,"Best part of the job is that you are mostly on your own and just have to deal with customers and see your boss only 4 times a month.  The health care is really good and its not expensive, well it wasn't at first.  The job is union so that could be a good thing if you screw up and need them to keep your job for you. You do have to pay dues every month no matter what. There is opportunity to move up in the company but in my experience you almost need to be friends with the person who is doing the hiring. It seems management only does what they are told by the higher ups.  They say one thing but then will write you up for telling you that was okay a month later."
good,"The day began with setting daily goals for each sales associate. Coaching and role plays to develop weaknesses. Observing and providing feedback sales associates. Assisting in closing sales for cell phone, home services and home security."
good,"its ok to work in alorica tv."
good,"Arriving at 8am to new and existing directv customers homes to either install, modify or fix any kind of issues related with directv."
good,"I worked at AT&T Mobility as a Customer Service Representative in Little Rock, AR. I worked in the Retention department where we take incoming calls of customers who usually want to cancel their account due to some issue. "
good,"My typical day at work for DirecTV was productive, fast pace and competitive. I had billing inquires and Tech Support duties. I promoted products and services to keep revenue flowing. Schedule technicians to service customers home equipment and business."
good,Your work day starts at 8 but could last anywhere from 8-12 hours. I was able to pick up networking and wireless skills. The pay is fair but could be better for the work they have you do.
good,pay isn't what they say and overworked in the summer and no work in the winter. They say in the winter that there is a lot of work but all you do all day is rebuilds on service calls and make only 30 - 60 a day cause your paid per-p rate. no matter how long the job takes.
good,"Flexible hours, excellent benefits and vacation amounts given yearly.  Nice location for bus routes, Nice building with 24 hour security. on site café as well as gift shop.  a lot of parking options.  have 4 different large lots including one under a ramp which is nice for the winters"
good,"It is a daily challenge working to meet an ever changing environment.  Technology change, marketing, and financial considerations continue to demand the flexibility to scope, re-scope, LTE efforts as does equipment mods but keep the job fresh and exciting."
good,"A typical day working at direct tv was realitivly easy, that is if you dont mind working hard. Everyday you were to be at your first customers house by 8am. You would usually load your truck on your ""loadout day"" with the occasional ""5 pull"" throughout the week, but if you had all your supplies, pick up your truck from the office and head to work. Once at the customer's home meet the needs of every customer with a smile. After negotiations, take the predetermined amount of time to install Satelitte and route cable. After completion head to the next customer on the list, wash, rinse, and repeat. During my employment at this job I learned great self-management skills while also honing my cabling skills as a technician. Management was ""skattered"" to stay the least. Managing large amounts of request for individual techs while also handeling their own work load seemed to be challenging for them at times as many of my personal work requests were over looked. Co-workers were great. Friendly and very understanding. Often willing to lend a tip or and maybe a few cabling parts needed for the day ahead. The hardest part of the job was probably ""Finding your flow"" as the managers describe it. The best way to do the job properly, meet the customer's needs and do it in a timely fashion. Every house is different therefore every job had its own obsticles. The job was on a ""piece rate"" pay cycle so time was money. ""Finding your Flow"" could help you find a few extra hundred dollars on your pay stub. The best part of the job was seeing your customers face when the TV started working and of course"
good,"Working with 40 to 50 Customers A Day, work there I have learned the ins and outs of customer service and how to position yourself in a good Way to the customer."
good,"A typical day at work for me was interacting with customers, answering the phones, back office duties such as paperwork, deposits, inventory counts, ordering certain supplies etc. "
good,"A typical day at AT&T is stressful and ever changing. You are required to sit at a desk, with a set break and lunch time, stats that have to be met that are measured for your job performance. The stat are based upon how a customer feels about a company and their experience that may/may not have anything to do with how a individual. "
good,same as before the 1st the coworkers are great management tends to caused unforeseen problems instead of solutions
good,"Generally busy throughout the shift, when things are slow they allow a certain number to go home early. Mandatory overtime is asked here and there. management was always involved when I was an employee and you always had that relationship with them as well as coworkers and team lead. The hardest part of the job was the high call volume and abusive customers. Great compensation in terms of bonuses based on job performance."
good,"A typical day at work was a lot of calling out to customers with eligibility to upgrading their services, by providing the new and latest phones, even adding lines and new devices."
good,"It is good, But i am looking for better opportunity in my career growth as well as financial."
good,I started as csr with BellSouth.  I moved to Network Department as Line Translations Specialist.  Worked a lot with Communications Workers of America.
good,AT&T was good  at the beginning but some changes came through and biligual customer service was having to take over the retention department.
good,"the place had a union that where to help with issues between them & management."
good,"Able to collaborate and resolve new issues."
good,"Multi-cultural work environment.Virtual offices and collocation are the normal work set up. My work days are usually filled with invoices, downloading reports, providing feedback to our customer as to Revenue Accrual numbers, dispute resolutions, etc."
good,"Great pay , Benefits, and discounts. Many locations across country for possible transfers."
good,As soon as I clocked into work the calls started which customers needing assistance fixing their satellite connection or needing to upgrade or downgrade their channel package.
good,"As with any large company, your work experience will depend largely on the organization you're a part of - the leadership, your teammates, the work environment, scheduling, etc."
good,"	Customer Service"
good,Except when you expect them to communicate or take care of you.
good,"Great training and benefits. Horrible way to live. They talk alot about work life balance, but it is all talk.  AT&T does not care about its employees and sees them as a necessary evil/expense.  Great place to get training and then find a job you can live with."
good,"The typical started early, each day was never the same when it came to the customers, for the most part they made the day pleasant and more the made up for the occasional demanding customer. The co workers were mostly fun and interesting. Traveling to the different parts of the cities and learning new areas was always educational The upper levels of management like most companies are only interested in numbers and seem to forget we are on the front lines taking all the fire, but we all have to adjust in order to survive. The most enjoyable part was the sound of a happy customer."
good,They are a great starter company for customer service and has a very challenging people friendly system.  I enjoyed my time with the company
good,college degree has no weight and there is no room for advancement unless you are extremely sales driven.
good,"Hourly and commission based, purely driven off self motivation. The morning conference calls, and the availibility of co-workers and managers via phone call were very helpful. On location by yourself requires you to motivate yourself to work with no one looking over your shoulder. This job was a sales grind through and through, the managers were friendly and supportive, but be ready to get turned down day in and day out. That being said, if you enjoy sales and have good people skills then this job may be for you. As with any sales job, especially a cold calling one such as this was, you get out what you put into it, if you want to succeed you'll have to push yourself and be on top of your game with each and every customer."
good,Managers are horrible! AT&T has a huge turn over because people are over worked. The compensation is constantly changing and they pay you the least on what the company wants you to focus  on the most so there's no motivation.
good,Laid Back great for a first job not a real gateway to middle/upper class though
good,"Everyday is based on hitting numbers (reaching your goals) to get a good commission check.  I've gotten the chance to learn and see different types of personality people have and how to deal with them.  This job has given me good experience with working in public and how i actually enjoy helping people (customer service) and just  grabbing different skills.  Management team I've worked with 8 different managers in a period of a year that I've worked there every one of them is different and approach you as an employee differently.  My colleagues are a big reason why i enjoy my job, we are all one big family together there, so work i always fun!  The hardest part of this job is the level of stress we get if we don't hit our numbers by the end of the month, and we have over 20+ matrix to hit a month. The most enjoyable is being able to work with people, what can I say i am a people person!"
good,"AT&T is a good employer.  I enjoy working at AT&T. This company is great with training and ensuring that their employees know their duties.  The only downfall is that they have many surpluses. Job security is a big issue, I personally was surplused twice. I have vast knowledge of the telecommunications world , unfortunately there are no opportunities for advancement. I learned to adapt as I take on new work, I do not find the job to be difficult, I am a quick learner.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of helping engineers, technicians, and peers with resolving job issues and making sure the customer is provided with great service in a timely manner."
good,"AT&T is good company, however, it was no security at this job.  One day that wanted us to a certain task at work, but by the end of the day, they change that task."
good,I enjoyed every positions I worked in.  Management was helpful and informative.
good,"Worked for the corporation AT&T acquired. Halfway trough the merger, you know what started happening to the employees, permanent vacations..."
good,"Answer customer calls."
good,"This company was growing in size and opportunity, However as an employee I did not enjoy being a part of a company so big that as an employee no value was held for me. Upper management choices aren't so much based on productivity and success, instead there's more of a high school ""who knows who"" process. As a employee there weren't too many guys I knew who were happy with with majority of the guidelines of that company"
good,None- i have no regrets in life its just not the direction i wish to move in
good,as long as you follow the process you should be ok. not that bad if you like working alone. can be hard sometimes working outdoors on ladders and up poles
good,"A typical workday at AT&T was selling smartphones/ 2 year contracts as well as up-selling insurance, mobile protection plans and direct TV.  I enjoyed my job to an extent because I like the people that I worked with, however there was no real opportunity to advance into a position in which I could see myself making a career within that specific company.  I feel that I was doing a great job at what I was asked, however it continued to go unnoticed and therefore I pursued a new job."
good,"A team leader with strong supervisory intelligence demonstrating proficiency in collaboration, teamwork, written and verbal communication, to multiple levels of management, project managers, sales, customers, team members and vendors to ensure events remain on schedule.

good,I learned a lot from my seniors. Work was not that hectic. I learned a lot about new technologies.
good,"Replaced and repaired serving terminals for customer service. Climbed poles, ladders, opperated bucket truck. Co-workers good people to work with. Could count on them for help when needed. Worst part was Micro Management  from all levels."
good,"A typical day for me begins at 8:00 a.m in the work yard where we meet for team meetings. We dispatch, pre-call the customer, the head to the residence. We then begin to install U-Verse TV, high speed internet, or a telephone line. The hardest part of this job is all the technical road blocks you face in the field. The most enjoyable part is bringing award winning service to our customers. Managers are great, and so are my co-workers,"
good,"Now AT&T is a cut-throat, union-poisoned, seniority-worshiping nightmare.  Management sees the wage employee as the enemy, and union workers backbite and undermine each other like some sort of office gladiator arena."
good,"Work at your own pace, never gets boring and its fun to install satellites"
good,"14 years with the company, I feel it is too focused on profit and less so on people."
good,"Mi función principalmente era el manejo de la oficina administrativa y de ventas. Mi día transcurría atendiendo clientes con quejas o inquietudes, informando y vendiendo el servicio, planificando trabajos a realizarse, contactando clientes para generar citas, armando los trabajos diarios dentro y fuera de la localidad para los técnicos, informando a través de planillas excel y  mails cada item anterior. Administrando la caja de la oficina y stock de mercadería. "
good,"Rigid work place.constantly monitored on the phone as well as attendance."
good,"any equipment or customer knowledge failure is upon the technician, and will go against you no matter the situation. All aspects of your job is based on numbers. large company but bad equipment. most new managers for uverse were ""super "" techs and kissed a lot of .....to get into their position, teamwork is irrelevant.  typical day no matter weather, traffic, dogs, indecisive customers you are on the clock and is timed. 8 hour days turn into 12 hour days daily. be aware before applying. the job is a technician but you are really an installer that runs compliance tests all day. and its union based with no protection plus dues. most guys over age 30 who get this job quit within 1 year really in  6 months."
good,"My day consisted of answering inbound calls to assist customers with technical/network errors they may have been experiencing. This was a good job but I stopped wanting to come to work because of lack of coaching and management skills for agents when they were not meeting all that stats required, the job was emotionally draining."
good,"assist customers with payments and posting payments"
good,We worked on a % program which made us very productive. The job was very enjoyable and would have loved to retire from this company.
good,"Like a lot of jobs, it depends on where you enter the company.   In my employment I was hired into a experimental position which did not pan out because numerous reasons.  Poor products, poor management and poor technical support."
good,"AT&T has great pay and benefits. However employees work like slaves to meet sales goals and every quarter sales goals are modified with a new algorythm that is almost impossible to meet. Insurance is amazing. Management is all about who you know, what you know on someone, and who are you willing to sleep with. This would be in the TNKY market."
good,Not the same company atmosphere now as it was when I started with this company. It used to be fun and I use to enjoy and proud of working for ATT but that has changed for the worst in the last 15 years.
good,"Although Target is an exciting guest oriented workplace, the advancement opportunities are very small with the pipeline to advance very inefficient."
good,A typical work day is very fast pace. You will talk to about 60 people or more daily on the phones. You will constantly learn new things because of course technology is ever changing. Co-workers were fun and brought fun to the job daily.
good,"I observed specialist calls/chats/emails to ensure the customers are being treated properly to AT&T standards.  "
good,"An average work day was answering the phone and customers wanting to lower their bill but, once you help them do that you are required to offer things like hbo,starz,showtime, etc which doesn't make sense if they want to lower their bill. I don't like that your QA score for NPS is based off of the customers feedback about the company. The questions that are asked are not based on you and the interaction but, as a company as a whole. If the last 2 people made them mad and you resolved the issue they still rate you a low score and this can cost you your job."
good,"push accesories without client seen them "
good,It is a great opportunity to earn a very comfortable living.
good,i have nothing to say. i thought i did this already.  there is no union.
good,"Providing exceptional customer service to AT&T Digital Life customers by ensuring customer accounts are noted and managed appropriately according to company method and procedures. Thus, working through technical issues with multiple troubleshooting techniques."
good,Everyday is spent taking inbound calls from direct marketing flyers sent to customers.
good,"This is a very structured job setting which made it easy for the company to control their employees. What I learned was never tell the boss what makes you most effective and fulfilled on the job. No time to develop a good working relationship because of the time structure. The hardest part of the job was constant pressure to make a sale, make sure customers do not call back and that is impossible. The most enjoyable part of the job was the knowing I did a good job with my customer and given the freedom to make decisions based on information from the customer and company P&P."
good,"Work hours were terrible"
good,Many different areas to learn in if you are given a chance to explore things beyond your everyday job duties. i had the fortune of ascending to the level Manager within the company based on years of dedicated services and seized opportunity. One of the hardest parts of the job was in a way the most rewarding. I was able to weave pieces of myself into the fabric of the company within the divisions that I worked. To this day i tune to Directv channels and see my influence still a part of the successful culture.
good,great sales team but poor management.  too corporate. manager didn't understand staffs job duties and staff was mistreated by corporate.
good,No advancement- no consistent training- ok co-workers and customers but you had to pursue advancement outside of the company.
good,The company pays good but you have to be very proficient in selling.
good,"Bem corrido."
good,Sell sell sell. Help customers select devices that match there needs.
good,"It's a lot like running your own business. Good and bad. Good opportunity to earn as a sales rep if you can get around the road blocks they put into your way. You spend more time trying to get customer programs to work than you do selling. If an account stops paying, they expect you to become a bill collector and if it goes delinquent, not only does it hurt your performance, but often times you get charged back, even if it is due to a product performance issue. "
good,i didnt really like the scheduling and the stress that came with meeting everyday sales with customers that you cant see.
good,"I enjoyed working at AT&T. Over the last few years our center changed GM's four times and each one had  a different outlook on our center and different ideals to make our center sucessful. However; being a sales center enviroment the calls we received we're billing and complaints which made it impossible to maintain our daily,weekly and monthly goals. I enjoyed being a team player, and all of the supervisors I had through the years were great."
good,"•A typical day at work felt energetic."
good,"review workload, dispatch tech, check emails and answer if necessary, do safety observations with crews, post reviews o website, have meetings with bosses to review short term workload. approve time sheets and get work orders for them if needed."
good,"typical day is meeting new customers and communcation to install or repair their services. you learn something new everyday. no job is or home is the same. management changes pretty often, a high turn over rate with management and employees. co-workers are great, alot of communcation alongs us to help get through and passed jobs that may pose problems. work schedule and time is the hardest part of my job. going in at 8am and not knowing what time i might get off that day. it could be anywhere from 6-10pm i get off. meeting my customer and being able to make them happy before i leave rather its through an installation or a repair."
good,"You sell At&t products, help customers with current issues and set up new accounts. "
good,A typical work day was dealing with the changes everyday and staying busy dealing back to back calls everyday. I learned how to work at a very fast pace. I also learned how to handle the different attitudes that you may come across everyday. My coworkers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with changes and not getting any information about what was going on. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I got a chance to move up and got to do other things that were not just dealing with the customers
good,"answer all incoming calls have requied verbage and disclosures to be covered on every call. must wow every customer to improve image of AT&T.  Correct any problems fast, take care of billing issues,make arrangements where requested, explain charges, Must on everycall recommend other services provided by AT&T. Even if the customer does not want to hear about them. Not doing so, discipline up to and including dismissal. Stressful job. number one is the bottom line, number two is the customer, number 3 is the employee, number four your family life."
good,"learned great customer service skills, "
good,"A typical day at work includes cold calling for sales leads along with helping customers as they come into the store. There are many ways to make money since AT&T has branched out from just cellular and included home phone, TV, Internet and security systems. The training they give you is great and they focus on trying to promote from within but unfortunately this starts with the most tenured people working there. The only downside of this job is the retail hours."
good,"Own office ,Manager in other state, communicate Online to offices. Study data every 15 min to meet objectives. Hardest part was working most holidays. Most enjoyable was the people."
good,It has been a pleasure being part of a company that continually makes history.
good,"This high paced and high volume call center was a very stressful place to work at.  I was forced to work mandatory OT, so I worked about 60 hours every week, including every Saturday.  The sales incentives were very decent though.  Compensation and benefits were great.  They offer opportunity to join the Local Union."
good,"Sales-driven environment"
good,Retention/Sales/ Billing/ Customer Service.  You have to have positive attitude to succeed in this position.
good,"i would not recommend anyone work for this company, the management flat out refuses to take escalated calls until the customers get belligerent with you."
good,"-assist customers with all their request"
good,Working as a wire tech for AT&T is a very good job for a single person with an electronics background. There are a lot of overtime hours during the busy spring and summer months which mean 12 13 hour days 5-6 days a week. The benefits are great but advancement is very slim.
good,"I worked PT, and they worked around my school schedule. Eventually they were unable to work around anyones school so I quit. I made good money for working PT. sales goals are high, and they are all about their money."
good,"Everyday is different from next.  The group meets in the morning and the techs leave for our trucks for jobs assigned.  The tech would get to a location and we would talk with the customer about the assignment. Then assigned work would be completed per trainning and customer reqest. You would learn something new each day, from system operation to company policy change. Coworkers were a bonus, they are caring helpful individuals. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with the rapidly changing technology. The most enjoyable part was helping people who were really nice and needed help."
good,"This place is simply not for everyone, but overall it is a good place to work if you enjoy working with people and helping them solve their problems. However, as an agent you don't always have the appropriate tools at your disposal as the agent answer center is not as comprehensive as it is believed to be."
good,"Project Description"
good,Most work days start and end with the customer service reps taking inbound call from customers. I've learned that I really enjoy helping people by helping to resolve their problems or issues such as technical problems or buy selling them products based on their needs. The employees at this company are very competitive which makes the day go by faster. Management should complete more personnel characteristic training which would allow them to handle more team members effectively. The hardest part of the job was the unbalanced work/life dynamic. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers.
good,"Variety of pay "
good,"As DSC Manager, the way my responsibilities differed from a customer service representative were that I was the point of contact and managerial presence for the DSC; provided hands-on support and leadership to my associates and supervisors; directed all operation activities including, but not limited to: staff scheduling, on job training and development, and administration/ reporting; filing paperwork coordinately for audit purposes; established strong rapport and trust with customers; created a culture that embraced Retail Technical Services values and compliments the goals of our client, being AT&T; conducted regular team meetings; generated all managerial reports; analyzed and resolved procedural problems and partnered with client on issues as needed. As a Supervisor/ Customer Service Representative my responsibilities consisted of providing excellent customer service for customers with device issues including exchanging mobile devices that are under warranty; often sold out accessories; addressed customer’s inquiries and concerns made sure we provided every possible option for them and made sure they left satisfied; tested inventory seed stock; counted daily inventory; transferred new phones in and defective phones out; ran the register when doing accessory sales; ran various reports for management; counted out registers and set up deposits; heavy customer volume. As a Mentor my responsibilities consisted of traveling to locations such as Shreveport, LA, Waltham, MA, and San Juan, PR providing support for new hires while communicating and educating new hires on programs"
good,"Value in operations."
good,"I'm a finance manager on of the retail store. I managed inventory, finance, cash, multitasking-including sometimes taking over sales floor for manager. I have learned that your success is the store success."
good,"Answering calls and helping customers with solving issues with their services. Learned to match the customer's urgency of the call. It helps in having control of the call and managing the call in a timely manner. All of the management had their own style of handling things and talking to people. The hardest part of the job was when you seem that no matter what you did or how hard you trade, you were still unable to get the issue resolved. I enjoyed when I helped my customer and they ended with a smile in their voice and they were glad that they were able to talk to me."
good,my co-workers were fun to be around.  the hardest part of the job was dealing with the irate customers.
good,Every day is a big question mark on what you will encounter on every job.. I've learned that it's tough to carry out company policy while applying customer service on a high demand product. With the right management the experience can a very productive and fun one. My co-workers were the best part of the daily journey - the comraderie is unprecidented. The Hardest part of the job is completing every job within the time frame given for each one. The most enjoyable part of the job was traveling and meeting new people.
good,A typical day at Direct TV would be installing satellite TV and troubleshooting issues and going back to the office and bringing in my paperwork.
good,"Answered phone calls about Customers Directv Service. Helped to fix problems over the phone and send out new equipment. The hardest part about working this job was that there was not movement, once you got in to work you were at the desk for 8-9 hours."
good,"I am a customer service representative. I assist customers with billing, technical, and payment issues."
good,"Installed U-verse services such as TV, phone, and internet. Ran cat5e homeruns to the gateway that provided the tv/phone/internet services. Ran RG6 coax. Learned how to wire RJ-45 connections and make patch cables."
good,"Very good workplace, not many opportunities comp is nice, yet not as customer oriented as I would've liked or expected."
good,They are very strict and do not allow any room for mistakes. Learn about all the hot products out since they are always one of the first to recieve new phones. Management is non existant; they seem to come to work when they please. Co-workers are cut throat to one another due to having so many employees working at the same time.  The money was the best part about the job.
good,"* at directv it is customer services oriented so a typical day you will take calls and provide help to customers to the best of your abilities "
good,"service and sales on wireless products, really enjoyed working with employees there, was a team effort we all worked well together"
good,"Large company that pays well for retail. other than that you're just another person, no matter how well you do."
good,"Pretty decent place to work. They treat their employees pretty well overall, the demand on overtime hours is unnerving with a 1 year old baby and a wife in school. Otherwise good place to work."
good,"When is a cutting edge telecom company like a chevy nova? When it's bright and shiny and new you can't wait to see it everyday but as the years pass, you find yourself looking at the benefits vs the costs... AT&T has produced many technical advancements in my 13 years at the company but since Whitacre left, it's lost some of the mojo.  Outsourcing, contractor management, offshoring are really the true driving forces as innovative resources are displaced and often forced out to make way for cost cutting measures."
good,True customer service where patience and limits were tested
good,The job started out fun and exciting with plenty of extra cash to be made.  By the end everyone was starving for work.
good,"All in All I enjoyed working for C4 Communications, Liked being out and meeting new customers and talking the close of the sale. Be at the office in Fresno at 10:00am have a sales meeting at 11:00am get lead sheets after meeting. Drive out to Lead area park POV and knock doors till 8:00pm Monday through Saturday."
good,This company has very little concern for its employees.  You are just a number filling a hole till your time is up.  Then they will just plug another person in to take your place.
good,"On a typical day three to four jobs can be completed. We do installs and repairs of uverse systems for residential and business customers. The days are often long going over ten hours or more. The job requires technitions to run cable, place uverse equipment, make network connections at service terminals and inform customers of progress."
good,"Its the best cell phone carrier, The customer was very happy with their services"
good,I love working for the company my success has been rewarding how ever the comp plans needs to be analyzed as well as to become America's Premier Retailer we must grow the market and advanced in customer solutions that separates us from the rest!
good,"Driving to customer's homes or place of business and installing or repairing the UVERSE network system.  I had to learn most of what I learned on my own or over the phone with a coworker.  The company is just now hiring managers with experience in UVERSE, the management I was under had NO experience and were not helpful to me in learning the job.  The hardest part of the job was living up to the numbers requirement (Their system for grading a tech's worth) and having things beyond my control affect those numbers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was completing a job and leaving the customer happy."
good,"A very busy and fast paced environment."
good,"I would take incoming phone calls from business and/or residential customers whose internet or computer was not working properly. I had to fix the issue over the telephone with the customer, send a new modem/ router, or send a technician to repair the issue."
good,"I started my career at AT&T and enjoyed the first few years.  Soon there were layoff packages being offered every few months and it became a game of who could get the best package and then come back as a consultant.  Although the facility I was in at the time offered a nice cafeteria and company store, these locations are no longer part of AT&T."
good,"While working at AT&T U-Verse, the work day starts with Long Hours behind the wheel of our fleet Trucks that Never seem to be fixed the right way. Once you get to a Customers House the fun really begins. you have to take all the verbal abuse when its a Repair that has not been fixed by previous Co-workers, or even when there is poor service that Out side elements seem to make worse. The Hardest part of the Job is no balance between home life and work, they will have you work 12 days straight then give you one day off to do it again. It's all mandatory Overtime, Plus there are really no breaks and lunches because they have you keeping getting another job after you are done and don't give you the time with out calling and asking why you have been idle for 20 min. Management doesn't know  what is going on they have been techs and have no previous training being a manager.  The only plus side was the income and the Benifits of this job."
good,"They have a union which is great, however they don't work very hard for you.  They also don't abide by company code of business conduct.  District doesn't assist you either even with sexual harassment "
good,A typical day at work consisted of being on the phone with land line phone providers or customers. While also operating computer based system to fix issues.
good,"you get to meet awesome people from all over the states. Flexible hours , breaks and vacation time. Easy going management . High call volume consistently, An abundance of new data is always expected to be learned and taught.  "
