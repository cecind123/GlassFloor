rating,review
bad,"this place is the worst to work for you have to always look at for yourself there are people always ratting you out if they dont like you the union is all about politics their idea is ! "" its us the union against the company"" the company you work for ! it is the worst place to work for but if you can take it the retirerment package is the best ."
bad,"This was a 'breed'm and bleed'm' company. The position I was in, I worked over 60 hours a week with no over time and was on call 24/7 with 20-30 calls coming in after hours. No time for family, just work, work and more work. Finally taken over by the banks."
bad,"Management lacks professionalism and unclear expectations of employees duties. "
bad,"Job pays 23/hr ,you need to work 70 hours to make a decent pay check, even they have union they find a way to discriminate just because of your ethnicity, dispatch do the same if you don't  like them always find a way to give you the worst route or shift. Others drivers always trying to tell you how you have to do your job."
bad,"Worked at the Corporate Office in Commerce, CA - Company is struggling. Sales declining. Very poor customer service."
bad,"Customers for the most part are nice and reasonable. The ""managers"" are not. Actually their title should be yellers and harrassers. Anytime any help is needed they get angry, yet if you don't ask for help, they get angry, pretty much sums up the ""management style""."
bad,"The company has had many problems, changes in store managers, demotions, firing, and general hard to work under such demoralizing whims of top management. Example one day floral is downsized no consideration of employees concerns for work"
bad,Worked in an administrative position. Most Employees were very competent and hardworking however the company seems to promote either incompetent managers or employees friendly to HR management.
bad,"Department head was a narcissist and sales manager was a impossible to get ahold of.  Neither would answer the phone even when sales reps would call from the field with issues.  "
bad,Just too many changes on the team with new people not wanting to learn policies and the overturn of employees just too high; on an average; almost a new boss every other year!
bad,Union rep has his favorites and likes to skip people in señority so that his favorites can have the days they want off or do the work they want. Workers there influence management on who stays and who gets fired opinions are very bias. Terrible hours.
bad,Fast paced work. Lots of heavy lifting. Equipment often not charged or fully functional yet management still wanted work done. Working crew not very friendly
bad,"Long hours and some weekends. On call everyday for many. At a moments notice you may be required by the threat of losing your job to give up your day and off family plans and work a 6th day up to 14 hrs. Sometimes trying to get a day off for personal reasons may be refused depending on the availability of drivers based upon seniority. "
bad,I worked for this company for a little over five years and found it to be extremely cut throat andalot of back stabbing. It is a free for all if you want to get involved inthat type of mess. I did everything humanly possible to stay free of that type of environment but was eventually pulled into it strickly for survival. I left and was black balled because I did not conform to the corruption of the organization.
bad,Entire team needs more understanding of each other's needs.  It seems like the union and company are at war.  Sorry to say but a very dismal atmosphere
bad,Management for unified is pretty selfish. They don’t really care for the workers they just want the work done and that’s not a good attitude to have. The hours are great and the pay is good as well
bad,Busy
bad,"My typical day at work would be mainly to maintain an excellent customer relationship to retain business.  I learned multitasking skills through several work responsibilities and to work well under pressure. I also accomplished excellent management skills through administrating, organizing, and prioritizing workflow to meet deadlines. Our office staff worked as a team and maintained a great working relationship. The hardest part of my job would have been to obtain information from purchasing department in a timely fashion in order to beat my competitor, as I had to rely on purchasing department for information. The most enjoyable part of this job was building customer relationships, maintaining customer satisfaction, learning of new products through vendor demonstration, and being able to work as a team."
good,"Agency limited on employee support work life balance did not exist."
good,I've been here 3 years and I loved it. Recently we got a new supervisor and some other higher ups. Our supervisor is LITERALLY walking around to see who he can write up and fire. He said it himself. They're trying to change things that don't need to be changed and do nothing about the things that definitely do need a look at. I hate this job now. It's stressful and the supervisor doesn't help at all. There's already 3 people that quit in the produce department and there will be a 4th soon. Good riddance.
good,Unified grocers is a fast pace environment have to pull orders quickly to be loaded and delivered  to customers everyone is timed they have to pull a 95% or be written up management was allways looking to terminate people for any little thing its a union shop no need to say more
good,"Our plant abruptly closed, leaving 132 people without a job. Other facilities have since closed. Beware of job security.  They very minimally assisted with resumes and locating of other opportunities. Nothing was offered within the company."
good,"Completed duties related to handling of mail or packages by performing labor-intensive duties and operating mail-processing equipment."
good,The only really good thing abut this place is the Pay and the learning experience other than that management not good too much favoritism and not enough discipline for peoples mistakes and actions in which at the end can affect you. The majority of people are some what friendly and some what cooperative but there are those others that don't cooperate at all.  Too much seniority pride and unfairness. Schedules are horrible at the entry level but after you have a bid job its pretty stable.
good,Unified was a good place to work for but like good things have flaws the pay was great and the benifits to. I wouldn't mind working for them againg
good,"The Human Resources Department was a fun group in the past, as time passed and management changed, the culture of the department also changed.  Employees then began to resign and their positions were not replaced, increasing work load for those of us that remained in our positions, but no additional compensation was offered."
good,"I worked for this company for 12 years in the perishable meat department.  It is very male oriented and very seldom do women get promoted.  In the 12 years I was there men were promoted 9 out of 10 times over women.  I noticed that if your a horrible person or a good ole boy you excelled or were promoted by your other boys.  This company does not promote for doing a good job.  It's who you know not what you know at Unified.  I saw lazy rotten people promoted time and again.  I saw people who called in sick constantly or who were verbally offensive keep their jobs.  I saw a hard working temp who went to HR and turned in some male employees who were speaking offensively get fired for speaking the truth. This company is extremely shady very sexist and just a foul place to work.  I for one was glad to leave after 12 years of this brutal work place.  "
good,"fun working with great people."
good,It just wasn't the job for me. Good pay and great benefits. But when you have those whose suppose to put you in a position to excel does none of the above it begins to get over whelming. And I was taught if it don't fill you then it will drain you. Life's too good to be stressed out.
good,Nice co workers
good,"stressful because of supervision being in you,n threatining you if youbtalk to much you could get a write.employees are good co workers poor managing."
good,it was all good till they had a new management crew come in and try to change the world.  All there ideas were so wrong just because you went to school dose not mean you know how to rebuild a BPR.
good,A typical day at work includes many daily tasks that need to be done in an accurate/timely manner.  The experience I've gained while working here is invaluable. There are a lot of quality people who work here and that makes it enjoyable.
good,"unified grocers is no longer around and was bought out by UNFI. This was a business that had been around since 1950 or so. Long time and now it is sad to see it go. I worked for company for almost 20 years.  Now UNFI bought it out.  People are finding other jobs and that is good that they can find work."
good,"pick order that were given to me. Do my daily duties. wrap pallets. i did good at what i did and got my job done. My supervisor was a great guy, staff was ok"
good,"Fun work place "
good,Financially struggling company in the midst of a cross-roads.  The upper management team is trying to figure out what is the best thing for the future of the company.
good,"Overall culture and environment could use some improvement. Pay is great, location is good and parking is free. Very little room for career advancement."
good,"I'm a professional behind the steering "
good,The company has been around for a long time and has grown. They are very customer conscientious.
good,The grocery industry has always been conservative. Your job status will constantly be in a state of flux. Many departments will have staffing levels come and go at the whims of the industry changes and company leadership. Lots of departmental juggling. Great team staffs in each locations. Union to administration relationship is spotty. Good work life balance.
good,"Work was good, but sometimes felt unappreciated. Benefits are good and pay was good. When busy season got there, overtime pretty much eliminated your personal life."
good,This role was manageable and somewhat rewarding.  The best part of the job was getting to meet with several manufacturers.  This was a role where the day to day expectations were manageable
good,"Good place to work.  People are great.  Work / life balance is good.  However, opportunities to advance if you're in middle management or below are limited somewhat."
good,"get as much done as possible. don't complain or get upset. "
good,Worked 22 years for the company. had a good experience working for them.
good,"Management for the insurance services department was horrible.  They mock and ridicule employees.  Promoted based on years of service, not skills.  Lack skills and promote hostile work environment.  RUN do not walk from this place!"
good,Called on customers throughout the central valley. Offering new product programs. merchandising and inventory control. Placed orders. Trained customers on product placement.
good,"When I hired in we were always super busy. We would sometimes ship as many as 1 million cases per week."
good,No room for advancement or changing departments. Great place to work but would like to move up. Hardest part of job is the lack of communication betweens department.
good,"Good company with great people, too much overtime. Very physical work"
good,"Unified grocers is a great fast pace work environment. I learned a lot about call orders, truck routing and other wholesale communications and  sales marketing."
good,"This company offers great benefits, hours, and pays well. It is difficult to become a manager as employees tend to stay at the company for many years."
good,"Great company to work for."
good,it was a nice place to work. friendly people and manager. clean warehouse. would love toward there again. have to put in some time before you can get a permanent position
good,your always going to have something to do here which makes the day go by fast. also the management was very great made you want to work harder for him because he went the extra mile for you.
good,Be ready to work hard at a fast paste. The enviroment is a good one. Everyone is ready to help you succeed at your task. The job is hard but the pay is worth it.
good,"Working in the dairy for Unified Grocers had its good and bads. Once you start here you better start adjusting your life to your new work schedule, Seniority is a big factor here and it can get annoying at points. Management is terrible and they never cover people that go on vacation so your always left short handed. You don't have weekends off unless you have about 8+ years of working there,"
good,"Management and supervisors where great. "
good,Dowsnt exist anymore bought out. Company gave us a 90 day notice ofclosing down . 6 months after we agreed to a 3 year extension. Didnt offer us a severence package and I feel after 20 years of service we should have received something but we didint.
good,Very busy warehouse had twenty forklifts in use at all times. We would receive ten to fifteen trucks daily.
good,good place to get the mid level pay and experience required to advance in the trucking industry. However being a union shop you are bound by the will of your union brothers on the direction of your annual raises.
good,Love this place. Most of my coworkers are like family. We work hard and crack jokes all night. My foremen and boss are great. But the warehouse supervisor for some reason has put a target on my back. Other than that I love this place. Great pay. All the hours you'll ever need other than in the winter where it really slows down.
good,overall its a good company with good pay.i was laid off but from what i hear that job security is more stable now. Besides that the only other con i can think of is having split days off.
good,"really tough place to work,  just have to be on top of yourself since they are very strict. job has standards so you have to be mentally tough and physically ready to work overtime. The weekly checks and benefits they offer are really great and would love to work there."
good,"I love the culture. Love the working environment. Great benefit; matching 401K, medical, vision, dental, life insurance, education reimbursement , etc."
good,Company was a great place to work until purchased by Supervalu. The remaining staff after lay-offs is not feeling supported by new owners. Has potential to be great again.
good,Fast pace work area.  Good work ethics.  Hardest part is making sure pallets are nicely built to make all clients pleased with there orders.
good,As an order dispatcher I was in charge of coordinating forklift drivers and order selectors with their assignments. Which included the loading of freight supplies to pallets and then on to trucks for distribution across the state.
good,"Starting from day one of experience at Unified, a different opportunity was available.  As my years with the company increased, so did my responsibility."
good,"Company is no longer in existence but had a great retention rate, lots of very talented and experienced people. Had the opportunity to build projects and programs for them. Loved my HR team."
good,"During my employment, Unified Grocers was a great place to work!  The Benefits are wonderful, my management was great to work with.   They offered me to work remotely from home when needed.  Very comfortable environment."
good,I enjoy working for Supervalu (formerly known as Unifired Grocers).  Most employees at Supervalu have been with the company for more than 15 years.  It's a good indication about the company that employees are willing to stick around that long.
good,"Unified Grocers Inc. was a great family to join.  Work culture was warm and welcoming.  Always an opportunity to learn something new.  Advancement however was challenging.  There was a lot of change which in turn provided instability in management.  However, like any growing company change is necessary.  They provided training for growth free to employees to enhance or develop skills.  Their compensation package was generous."
good,I like the people in Unified Grocers company.  People are friendly and nice.  I thought I am going to work there for life until the SuperValu from east coast bought over us.  Most of us got laid off.
good,"Unified Grocers was a very good place to work.  Good work/life balance.  Open environment with recognition for Hard Work.  Open to new ideas.  Good team spirit.  Recently, was taken over by SuperValu. Not the same place."
good,The most enjoyable part of working for unified was the great management and great benefits. Also all the opportunities that we were given to learn and grow in the company.
good,large company with every program in distribution to market provisions. Large distribution facilities with the latest technology and efficiency. Many areas for advancement.
good,Company is struggling to merge all of the branches and become as unified as their name implies.  Overall there is progress and I feel like they care about their employees.
good,"Controlled chaos, great place to learn about retail and wholesale.  Never a dull day, and always something to learn, or somebody to help.  You can move up here, if it is what you want."
good,"Productive fast paced work environment with great Compensations and Benefits. Easy crew to get along with, who holds a brotherhood mentality. seniority based with room for advancement."
good,"it was union work good pay and benefits .if you go in with bad attitude then you probably will have a bad day. I went with the attitude that I will  have fun with it and get the work done . A typical day at work could mean more than 100 loads out bound plus receiving . there was also perishable building this included meats fresh and frozen , deli , produce , milk , frozen food and ice cream. All has to be loader so as to arrive without the ice cream melting or the produce freezing. I had no problems with management but if I needed them I could count on them like they could on me . my co-workers are some of the best in the business. could always count on them. the hardest part of this job was going in 2 hours after the pickers had started at the time there was more than 100 plus about 5 to 10 bull drivers each picker could pick 2 to 4 pallet per hour depending on product. each bull driver could bring 2pallets per trip so the loading dock was full by the time the loaders walked thru the door the most enjoyable time is when we walked "
good,"Honestly a great company with great pay and hours, just wasnt a good fit for me personally."
good,A typical day at this job was to be accountable for your job duties while working safely. I learn to be responsible and stay on top of my hour on my logs and not go into dot violations. Management always treated me good and also my coworkers for the most part were good people. The hardest part of the job sometimes the trailer got slippery do to a gallon of milk that was leaking and sometimes it would get a little dangerous but it was part of the job. The most enjoyable part was that at the end of the day you felt like it was another job well done and you had somebody waiting for you at home.
good,only bad thing is the management didn't like the conveyors so they did everything they could to have them removed all and all it was a great place to work
good,"These company offers good benefits to employees, there’s opportunity for advancement, they give training to new updated applications. Overall the management are very professional."
good,"Coworkers are easy to get along with, which makes it easy to go to work every morning. It's very team oriented work place. Everyone is willing to help out one another."
good,Ran out of things to do in the 8 hour work day because I wasn't given that much responsibility. Because i was an Intern I went on the field trips to see different fields of the plants production. Good job to see what an office job consist of. 
good,"A really nice company to work for until SuperValu took over.  I used to live My job  it was fun, challenging and interesting   Meet a lot of great people . Always learned something new and the company would encourage further education"
good,A typical day is nice and smooth after you are able to get some nice runs.  I learned that serving your customers is most important. Management seems not to appreciate your efforts. The workplace is okay if you do your job. The hardest part are the long days. The freedom you have is the best part of the job.
good,"Day at work create daily production schedule make sure production is on time oversee shipping warehouse.  "
good,"Unified Portland is a great place to work as a driver, if you can afford to starve the first two winters you're there (they'll tell you so in your interview, and they're not kidding!). The transportation crew is among the best, and the benefit package and pay are great, but their customers (independent grocers) are a dying breed, and they do like to have scab carriers haul a lot of their customer's loads. I was starved out after three years when they lost a major account, but if I could afford it, I'd go back in a heartbeat- the place IS that good to work for."
good,I had to  select orders and stage them I also had to  hand stack merchandise on Pallets also have to refill  empty slots or location and I had to put away the new merchandise that came in on the new truck
good,"Worked with heavy phones , placing orders for our Commerce, Santa Fe Springs, and Stockton facilities.  Negotiated pricing with my vendors for our Diesel trucks parts , pallet jack, and forklift parts also bought office supplies for the company on Office Depot website.  The director of the dept. was great .  It was like a family environment and everyone knew each other which made it very nice.  The hardest part of job was the drive into work from Gardena but after I arrived it was great I loved working with my vendors and end users / associates getting their parts to them in a timely manner each day and building the relationship I had with my vendors."
good,Great company to work for Work/Life balance not so well but super helpful employees. Supervisors are really great work well with anything you may need.
good,Good company. Good people to work with. Growth has been so rapid and has created many opportunities especially in Tech...Company is very behind industry technology but trying to catch up
good,"Taking payback request from vendors and doing research. Answering heavy phone calls, emails and fax request from vendors. I learned how to multitask, pay invoices, document imaging, and micro filming. It was the best job I’ve had in my life time. I was able to learn so much and grow with the company. I started as making copies and mail them out. I left as a payment specialist. Leaving to move to North Carolina was the hardest thing to do."
good,I enjoyed the interaction with Stater Brothers Markets and fellow Unified Western Grocers employees.
good,A typical day you would pull 20 plus orders and must be 100% accurate and you were timed on how long it took you to do so. Your average must be 100% average for 2 weeks combined.
good,Hard work good pay and benefits fast pace.Select orders an load trucks on standards!
good,"Unified Grocers was great place to work, open door policy, team work to get the job done, Holiday gatherings an barbecue, made some lasting relationship, hard part of the job is to see unified close its door"
good,"• Accurately identified, select/pick inventory for loading and staging based on customer load sheets. Picked, corrugated and un-corrugated product (up to 45 lbs) from shelves, pushing/pulling of 7’ high cases of products (up to 200 lbs) and other packaged and un-packaged product. Placed products on wheeled racks 5 ½ feet high and moving throughout warehouse"
good,Recently UG was bought out by another company which sells
good,"Worked here for a few years and really enjoyed it."
good,"Unified Grocers has great benefits and several employees have worked here for over, 20, 30, and even 40 plus years. With a company being so large, covering the west coast, there was opportunity for promotions and crossing over to different departments. Several associates took advantage of the tuition reimbursement program."
good,"most people who start there, don't leave."
good,"This is a great company to work for, I enjoy the people i work with every one is friendly and helpful.  The culture is great and I would recommend this company if anyone is looking for work."
good,you have to go to work on time every day other than saterdays and one day during the week. Work as hard as you can and get paid good for it. i learned that order selecting is not something im very good at. management an co workers are easy to work with and showed me everything i needed to know. the hardest part about the job is everything. the most enjoyable part of the job is the pay.
good,This was my first job and it was a summer internship. I loved it. They take you and show you the many functions of the company and how it works. The people you work with in your department are very helpful and are open to any questions you have. WOuld reccomend
good,"My typical day started out by getting the reports ready for my buyers. After all the reports were done and distributed, I moved into the billing part of my job. Getting e-mails that have pricing, promotions or credits attached to them. Getting the faxes out of the fax room and sorting them by buyer. Once all the pricing, promotions, and credits were sorted and put into order, I would enter them into the Lawson\Portal System (the billing system UG Used). From there, I would move into the new item set-up in the portal. Unified Grocers used the Portal for the vendors to submit new items. I would have to go into the portal print the information for the buyer and from there my buyer would instruct me to set it up or wait for the buyers meeting (this meeting takes place every Friday)."
good,"Was a great company to work for,  they had great benefits.  Match 401k, pension and time off for birthdays etc. Pay was also great and had holiday parties as well as employee appreciation."
good,"Great place to work for.  Fully experienced accounting, A/P, A/R and IT professionals."
good,I learned many different aspects of the wholesale grocery business.  From general office duties to dealing with vendors and brokers.  The best part was dealing with the store owners & staff.  Since it is a co-op the owners are the stock holders.
good,Started with the company as a order selector and advanced to a loader. Learned how to load and secure pallets safely into trucks. Enjoyable part of the job was being able to work and make incentive pay.
good,"Unified has been an excellent place to work for the past 15 plus years.  Though they are going through change, currently, it is positive growth toward a great future.  I strongly suggest this company to anyone in the job market."
good,"A++ culture, all nice and helpful people to work with.  I learn a lot from from supervisor. Great team work when collaborate with others.  A lot of things to learn."

good,"A typical day at Unified grocers would consist of me arriving at the facility. Completing a full inspection of the truck and trailer that was assigned to me. After inspection i would begin my shipment routs. Once at my drop off destination i would unload the product and would continue to the next stop. Further more, upon completion of my delivery rout i would return to Unified grocers facility, drop of the truck and trailer."

Made me the hard worker I am today."
