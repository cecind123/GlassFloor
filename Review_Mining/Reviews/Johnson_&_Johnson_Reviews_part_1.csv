rating,review
bad,"If you make a mistake you will get sacked even though they break so many laws they will make you go out over loaded and come back the same, the supervisor is polish and treats the drivers with disrespect ! You really dont wanna work there trust me you will regret it!"
bad,The other employees where very deceitful and the training was the training was horrific ! and the people would put blame on someone that was training !  I did not feel at home what;s so ever !
bad,Everyone thinks they have a higher power.  Returning back to a job where my health isn't important to them. Account Managers are smh who to call on about my company ?
bad,They are a nepotism company so unless you have family that works there it is very difficult to get hired on permanently.  Yes management shows favoritism and picks and chooses who they in force rules and policies on if you’re a favorite you can get away with anything
bad,"Chefs très arrogants, qui ont leurs préférences, peu importe le rendement de l'employé. Traité comme un pion. Le seul point positif que je retiens est la sympathie des collègues."
bad,Being related and knowing someone important will get you farther at this location. It doesn’t matter about what you know. The challenges will be felt during training. Also when the lies about how great things are.
bad,heard it was like a cult before joining...can't disagree after working there. so disappointed in the amount of power veterans have there despite being morally and ethically corrupt.
bad,Don't join this company if you get a role here in Production/Processing. One of the most dysfunctional supervisors and managers you find here. Beware if you are working in midnight shifts because the supervisor in that shift is a very shady and a con-man. Micromanaging is at its best and rate of hiring/firing is very cyclical. Not recommended at all for long term career here.
bad,supervisors and management think they are better then you wont listen when you have a problem but quick to jump on you when something goes wrong wouldnt wish this on my worst enemy
bad,they have fake people working there and just accuse innocent people..when time comes i will have to tell the truth if the time is not favor of me..thanks
bad,"The company goes through so much reorg you cant grow your career here. East Coast vs West Coast,  he said she said, always traveling and always in meetings and then spending after hours going through email. No thanks to travel."
bad,"Doc Control department is run by man eating sharks. They sabotage any employee they do not ""like"". This makes the sharks look smarter!!! "
bad,"The management doest treat people right. At times you feel like a kind beaing told off by the teachers. Like in many big warehouses, working people are nothing and the management feels like gods."
bad,"This is the kind of job you want to work at if you require no supervision, no sleep, no sanity, and no living wage. Expect 10-12 hour days with no communication from your team members, no support on tickets, no context on submitted issues. Also, expect the clients to not respond to emails, phone calls or anything. Along with this, your clients are almost always either 2 blocks away from you and never in the office, or in another part of the world that conveniently does not have anyone in the office when you're on your shift."
bad,Nem existe mais. Era um negócio informal onde pude dar meus primeiros passos na mecânica automotiva.
bad,Johnson & Johnson isn't a company that help you grow. It is all about pushing their products and not moving up. The training's are quick and you have to catch on the first time around if not your fired
bad,"When I first started I was so excited, then it went downhill.   Contractors are treated like non-humans.  Horrible place to work unless your permanent."
bad,Very poor management. Manager with no clarity of what work needs to be done. No work/process training. No clear guidance. Less pay for a senior position. Always seen unfair and irrelevant decisions from manager. Groupism and target new member. You will always feel down if you are working as contractor.
bad,only good if a person in need of quick money. Poor company overall to work for. Management and line leaders were prejudice and not cooperative. Would not recommend this company to anyone.
bad,"They keep temps for years and years and refuse to hire anyone. It should be illegal what goes on here.  They hire in employees doing the same jobs but are treated better, paid better, get benefits and vacation. Contractors don’t get anything and are treated like second class citizens. They are at work more days out of the year than any employee and do more work. Managers just shuffle people around to make it look like they are temporary employees, but they aren’t. It is impossible to get hired anywhere becuse of the lowly status and lack of development."
bad,"No training , no supervision, bad environment moral very low. Some employees have been there for years and are still temporary employees. I would not recommend at least this division."
bad,"Found the IT Management very weak and narrow-minded. Excellent tools were published to manage programs and projects. However, due to lack of knowledge or retention were not properly utilized and many became a non-value added activity, due to corporate insistence."
bad,"Honestly I was working a night shift for them , the managers were kind of harassing me , like my first or second night 1 of the managers was asking me out to dinner..another one was trying to bargain me with a permanent position.. you will be standing 12 hours - no reasonable breaks .."
bad,"The typical day to day work includes selling and negotiating to see a doctor, practice group or hospital or health care employer or managed market employer."
bad,Long hours body hurt extremely bad the management was very unprofessional and i would never recommend anyone to go there or go back myself hopefully the pay gets better as well
bad,"Learned new things on the job and meet some great people. I learned how to become great with invoices, management skills, and during things in a fast accurate way. I also learned how to become a great leader in controlling my area as an a-frame controller. A typical day at this job is very face paced, you will learn something new everyday with shipping product, invoices, and looking up merchandise for every order before it gets shipped out to customers. The management is Ok they do their job well and they work really hard to make sure that everyone knows their job to the best of their ability. The work place culture is great you will work with all different kind of cultures and you will learn a lot from these different people. The most enjoyable part of my job is staying busy all day and learning a lot of different avenues on my job."
bad,"There is no room for advancement. This is a good seasonal job for people recently released from prison and struggling to find employment. Otherwise, this is a terrible place to work."
bad,"This is just not a good place to work.  Raises are non-existent.  Annual review process does not take into account vastly different work sites.  Another company that claims to offer a lot of extras, but does not follow through"
bad,Advancement takes awhile as the companies seem to be very management heavy. Seem to have been many rounds of layoffs that effect overall moral. Fluctuating hours .
bad,empresa boa pra trablhar so que alguns superisores nao ajudam
bad,"When the company was synthes management cared about the employees, and gave good raises.  Since Johnson & Johnson took over the environment is awful. Their credo is not true."
bad,"very poor management, lots of people that make big money but have no clue what they're doing and hold decision making positions, +30year old technology that has no future for upgrading, s-tupid policies that don't follow any legislation just implemented by re-tarded engineers, that place survives only because we pay big money on the Tylenol they're making, they'll be swallowed by competition soon, don't go there!!!"
bad,"The worst job i ever had, management is rude and unprofessional. Pay is good labor is hard and strenuous. No team effort management takes credit for all praises and workers gets blamed for all negatives."
bad,they treat you so bad there never appreciate the wok that's done. sometimes no 15 minute break. and a lot of favoritism there is not much to say
bad,"•Managed a $10.6 million domestic collections portfolio for  Coldwell Banker Real  Estate. "
bad,"Pharmaceutical sales"
bad,"I would recommend working for this company to no one I like.  I did work for JnJ for over 10 years at another site and it was wonderful.  The Memphis Distribution Center is the worst employer in the city. They do not value their people, race issues abound, and the HR department is atrocious.  Top management is finance centric.  Customers safety is at risk due to the products we shipped and I no longer could be part of it so I took an early retirement package."
bad,"As project included teaching all of the site-employees to use HR software (most of whom spoke Portuguese as first language) there was considerable challenge as I speak some Spanish and some Italian but no Portuguese. However, we were able to succeed. The students were very willing to learn although most had not used a computer or a mouse previously. I had no co-workers as I was a Consultant on this project."
bad,Company have a good reputation. The company is over all United States.
bad,I am a former employee of johnson&johnson. I was laid off short of receiving any vested rights.So as of right now i have nothing good to say about johnson&johnson
bad,They don't pay good they don't treat you as a human and they're not a good company over all their management sucks and communication sucks  It was a good company when it was due-pay synthes but ever since Johnson & Johnson took over its been going down hill fast...
bad,Difficult to advance in your career as co-ordinators discourages more training. Any job posted had a candidate picked before interviews. Shift targets rather than personal targets so lots of people freeloading. Serious lack of communication. Permanent jobs all interview based rather than how well you work within the company
bad,Not a good company. They have very bad work ethics. Will make you work for extended hours. They don't pay well. The job they promise and what the actually make you do is worth less
bad,"Mi evaluación está buena"
bad,"Inept management, negligent and incompetent HR.  Culture of complete chaos, a rudderless ""leadership team,"" back-stabbing, passing the buck and blaming anyone else, be it a lower level employee or the vendor, made this job a daily nightmare.  "
bad,"It is a workplace that chews you up and spits you out!!"
bad,"Entreprise bonne de sa publicité faussement idyllique   mais une fois qu on y travaille c est tout à fait différent pause non payé horaires d équipe à la rallonge mais non payé même pas le temps d' aller au toilette pendant les pauses c est soit on mange soit les toilettes c est pitoyable vraiment comment peut t on a cette époque  traiter les gens ainsi la production se plie en quatre pour fournir un travail irréprochable normal pour du médical mais en sachant que des responsables passent leurs journées de travail sur internet ou à regarder des films et augmentent les cadences alors qu ils ne font rien de leurs journées ,eux ne regardent pas pour le temps pris de  leurs poses et ne les pointes pas non plus alors qu  obligatoire ils doivent montrer l exemple"
bad,"Aprendi a ter cada vez mais autonomia e liberdade para trabalhar."
bad,"responsable sans aucune respect en vers des operateures place de travail instable ,chef sans competences ,"
bad,"Good place to work at night if you want a night shift job. All of the other coworkers get along great, however, upper management can care less about you. One of the managers even had the nerve to tell us in a meeting that ""military experience doesn't count"" as prior work experience and they want better trained people. Huge slap in the face considering more than half were military veterans."
bad,Johnson and Johnson is a masonry company that is family owned and has been in business for over 20 years. if you are an experienced mason who learned masonry as a young age it will work well for you if not enjoy carrying block for 12 hrs a day
bad,The local distributor that I woke for is on his own program and is not well liked.I am not a fan of him.Customer and employee are uneasy on how things are being run.
bad,"Cut throat company."
bad,My sales position at Johnson and Johnson has shown that people are completely replaceable. The management does not feel a need to build relationships or support their workforce.
bad,"Nothing to appreciate.They gave fake promises..but nothing worked as per they said. salary, appraisal, duties and responsibilities.Nothing was followed legally. complete cheating management."
bad,"They will do anything to screw the customer, as long as they can get away with it. The stuff you see on the news is just the infractions they got busted for. Trust me there are many more, and the FDA is a joke ."
bad,"Electrician/ maintenance position. Do not work here! To get me to work here they lied about everything. They were having such a hard time finding people that they will tell you whatever you want to hear. When you start working at the plant full time they will tell you about changes they are making ie cutbacks. They put posters up and make it sound like whatever new they are doing is going to be great even do a town hall meeting and lie to your face. "
bad,"J&J HR has had constant re-orgs and lay-offs for many years especially within Talent Acquisition. Constant changes to reporting structures and processes. Big emphasis on outsourcing as much as possible as quickly as possible to Manila for cost savings. Poor communication every step of the way. "
bad,"too many managers, no standard for operations. too large almost like a government t jobs. not organized. long drive and unsecured positions. tried to learn asa much as I can."
bad,"I should have added to the title the worst I will ever have during the coming life!"
bad,I hate my job and so far it seems impossible to move out of it because they do not seem to give other positions to contractors. You need to be a Vistakon employee to move up or to even get a regular Vistakon job. I have no idea how they hire anybody for open positions outside of Vistakon. Every job I apply for I am told that it was filled with an internal applicant.
bad,One of the best companies I have ever worked. I love using new technology such at hardware and software.  The people or co workers were great to work with.
bad,"A typical day at work includes sitting in front of a computer for 8 straight hours, not encouraged to take breaks/lunch. Management is only pleased with working harder and not smarter. If you work long hours and kill yourself doing manual work is the only way you might get a good review."
bad,"Offers a lot on paper.  However, lower level managers do not understand and do not support these benefits, including raises and work/life balance.  The company will not stand behind its employees"
bad,It's a good place to become a general management. Senior management is hidebound and slow to react to change.
bad,No . the job is not supportive. never know when you will be laidoff or fired. not a dependable place to start a family or maintain a home.the people are totally unfriendly. big turnover
bad,If you do not have a Bachelors Degree you will not be able to grow within the company. This company pays employees less than most other large companies pay their employees.
bad,They took 3 Contract groups & ended their career at JNJ and hired new young people to take over the same jobs everyone was doing.  The ruin people's lives and don't care.
bad,"Can't fully review as I was a contractor.  J&J is very good to their employees, but treat outside contractors like dirt.  These non employees make up a majority of the workforce but are treated as though we don't exist and are not value added.  It's a good stepping stone into the company, or good work for people who need flexible employment, but you need to have a very strong backbone to put up with the mental abuse they dole out."
bad,"Benefits are very good, there are ongoing compliance testing which is very time consuming"
bad,"In order to be successful at J&J, you have to play into its toxic, back-stabbing culture and be passionate about its brands, which might be possible if they could innovate faster and all of their products didn’t cost $3. The consumer division is dying a very long, slow death. If you’re looking for growth, maybe find a position working with medical devices or pharmaceuticals."
bad,There is constant reorganization without any foresight. There is no communication of what's happening in the organization. Everything moves slowly and there is so much bureaucracy. There is a lot of backbiting and politics. Internal mobility is only possible if you have strong VP backing. It's been a horrible few years.
bad,"Conservative, terrible management, lack of transparency. Lack of upward mobility. The Company presents itself as a company that cares about its employees, but that is just another Marketing tactic."
bad,"Empresa bem familia, dinamica, festiva, equipes super divertidas de se trabalhar. Funcionarios responsaveis e competentes. Apesar de não ter muitas oportunidades a terceiros dentro da empresa, a Johnson & Johnson tem um zelo pelos seus funcionarios."
bad,"The pay and benefits are good but no room for career advancement. Poor Management, Supervisors are not making actions for the concerns of employees..."
bad,The most incompetent and over-sized management team you can ever work with. The number of management and engineering are TRIPLE the number of production workers. They are granted big salary and big bonus for their incompetent performance. They are truely micromanaging but have no clue to make a decision and always  want to dump all responsibilities and faults to floor workers. This company wasted tons of money on useless managers and projects but when their business is going down (of course) they show no respect to floor workers include maintenance so the layoffs and benefit cuts always start from floor workers first even cut your safety shoes. Don't move your career DOWN there.
bad,"Arrivée sur le point de vente mise en place de la journée d'animation vu avec le titulaire."
bad,"Overworked and underpaid. Typically worked 45 to 50 hours a week because of the workload. Not paid for any overtime and not allowed to take comp time."
bad,"Worked in engineering + 10 years.    Culture is one of back stabbing and fear for your job.  Current R & D management is delusional with no sense of how to create anything other the a formula change.   Think about the last times new jnj product was introduced.  So with no new products time is spent cleaning up the regulatory mess created by the  supply chain Mba's. "
bad,J&J never call people for interview the H.R never call any person who I know applied for a job while their experience and education is same what the company look for I thought they fill the job internally just advertise on the net to show that we are looking for candidate but the story is different
bad,"J&J Consumer Products Company headquartered in Skillman, NJ is a miserable place to work. there are constant fire drills, terrible tools, late nights and political nonsense. there is absolutely NO work life balance. employees leave work as late at 11 pm every night and that is considered normal. the pay & bonuses are the only things that keep employees there."
bad,"Globalden destek alamazsınız"
bad,"Great products but management doesn't know how to support them. They constantly make terrible decisions that hurt or do not help their products. They also take forever to make crucial decisions and by the time they make the decision, its too late."
bad,"When I moved here from Texas I was planning on going to school and working full time. This company did not let me do that. You had to schedule your school around a twelve hour work day which left you no time to schedule school. And as far as management and advancement, they were not good leaders and you couldn't advance unless you brown nosed. Hard work got you nowhere."
bad,Supervisors do not put workers in check when issues appear and the human resoures may not be responding because the issues are not being passed on. The worst case senario is that they are and are not addressed. Their quality issues became evident in 2010 when I worked for them. They would like to have set the scene that they had all under control but you dont have 43 recalls however voluntary if you are in compliance to all regulations. They were dead set that their submission were spot on but the rest of the year showed that they lacked some of the very things I had issues with. Well as they say I can show you better than I can tell you
bad,"Management is an absolute joke, culture is terrible and moral very low, No accountability and of course who you know benefits your job track, it used to be a great place, those days are long gone"
bad,"The review is for the Consumer Products division. Management was terrible, no communication.  Very unhappy individuals throughout disciplines who ""stay for the money and benefits""."
bad,"In my work i learn so much especially to the customer to be perseverance and patient."
bad,"This environment is not a good one for an occupational health nurse. The inept management style of the GHS site lead is not one conducive to a healthy and productive work environment. The benefits and salary are great, but they are not worth your mental wellbeing."
bad,Fast paced and requires ongoing meetings so it's very difficult to work.  Long hours requiring late nights and weekends due to ongoing emergencies that arise.
bad,"Worst culture in all pharmaceuticals. . ."
bad,"The famed Credo of J&J rings hollow. The company has a neat little workaround that allows it to claim that it treats its employees well on a technicality- the majority of people working there are not treated as what they are,employees, but as contractors. And as such they are not given anything close to respect or decent benefits or wages."
bad,Management is too wrapped up in politics and interpersonal relationships with subordinates. Poor decision making. Even higher ups are letting simple things like paying the phone bill slip. Facility not built future forward.
bad,"not advisable to work there. dead end job. no benefits , no time off. short lunches, only positive thing is that its an easy job. but criteria is difficult."
bad,Line work was very fast paced. Coworkers were very social but love to gossip. Management wasn't so respective towards employees. There wasn't any patience and some lines did catch on fire.
bad,"It was a pleasure working with this company. But I found a better paying job in another state. ........."
bad,"JNJ Sucks. The old Synthes had compassion. JNJ has no standards. You mess up and you are gone. No HR representative involved. If someone does not like you in Management, you are gone. A very clickish company. Sad company to work for."
bad,"terrible bosses with no management skills"
bad,Audit prepared orders
bad,Everything was great experience I have to work on a few things in order to grow with this company I can see the change in me now and I have been with them 2 years so far
bad,I worked through Kelly services with J&J. You are treated second class from the moment you get there. Everything is “J&J employees only.” Even though you do the SAME exact work as their employees. They also will take the word of their employees over contractors even if they’re lying. The culture is so toxic. It’s so disappointing because they promote a diverse and inclusive environment but they really only accept people who snitch lie and fill the work space with drama
bad,En un dia típico de trabajo se visitan los clientes de la zona encargada se realiza inventario  y con autorización de los clientes se envían los agotados
bad,"Great system top of the line Due to great Engineering. I work around great people most of which I have worked with many years. These Techs, assemblers, purchasing, Planners and facilities are excellent, it only the higher up's that don't recognize the the talent they have and the effort the workers put into their duties."
bad,"Customer Service manager is horrible - plays favorites and lets go of those who may know more than her. As soon as you know your position better than her, you are no longer wanted. Also uses termination of other employees as a scare tactic. Lowest man on the totem pole is terminated every 6 months or so. Nepotism is RAMPANT. Training is adequate (depending on who is teaching the section). Contract employees are used and thrown away while hired employees get away with murder (see the comment above re:nepotism...)  Overall a HORRIBLE place to work, which is sad as I enjoyed the work,  customers and sales representatives."
bad,"What I learned about my experience with this prestigious company, in a few words... "
bad,"It was not a job to support a family from,it was very slow and some days or weeks we didnt work. The pay was not agreeable at all but the straff and supervisor were ok"
bad,"Call Center atmosphere in which I took on average 35 detailed calls a day. I learned how to allocate my time wisely to meet daily quota. The hardest part of my Job was allocating the time, the most enjoyable part was the interaction with customers and teammates."
bad,"Other than entry level positions, it is tough to get hired at J&J.  It's important to build a network who can help you grow your career."
bad,"Johnson is a company that says something and does something different, low value to employees, low safe environment due to retaliation, abuse of power and bullying"
bad,"Some divisions are better to work for than others.  Just be picky. Ask a lot of questions.  They don't train their managers very well.  The people that work there that ARE NOT in management are wonderful, but the management team that I worked with were very cocky and passive aggressive."
bad,Very poor management of projects existed. I would definitely not recommend project work here. Contractors should look elsewhere. Consumer was a complete nightmare.
bad,Bij dit Johnson&Johnson werd je zo kort mogelijk ingewerkt waardoor nieuwe medewerkers vergissingen maakten waardoor de werkdruk nog hoger werd. Deze vicieuze cirkel werd door het management getolereerd. Hierdoor vielen steeds meer vaste medewerkers overspannen uit.
bad,"friendly people to work but no job securities. free breakfast and fruit every day. hard place to commute. out of control project structures."
bad,Some days I would work 14 hrs and other days I would be lucky if I had enough work to get through 2 hrs of my day. There was zero balance and I had no growth opportunities. As a contractor I wasn't given anything.
bad,"Working developing software for hospital using .net. Created different modules like for patient, Doctors, Staff etc. "
bad,"I would not recommend this position, there are several supervisor that allow there buddies to control work area. If you go in as a temp just know that if one person is jealous of your success they only have to report or complain once and your assignment will be ended."
bad,"Groot bedrijf , niet veel geleerd. "
bad,It's good to work in AMO if you can happily sacrifice all your personal & family for ever
bad,"Long hours - 10 hours (sometimes 12 - 16 hours), stress-fully job, no work-life balance"
bad,"Bajo una supuesta cultura empresarial de cuidado a los empleados (que se promociona en sus instalaciones con carteles, mensajes, detalles publicitarios, etc.) se mantiene una estructura asentada de inseguridad, temporalidad, despreocupación y falta de expectativas respecto a cualquier desarrollo profesional, con utización desinhibida y excesiva a todas luces de empresas de trabajo temporal y de rotación de personal. Todo ello redunda en relaciones entre los empleados bruscas, desconfiadas, competitivas en lugar de colaborativas, y muy poco sanas, con el consiguiente ambiente laboral. Da la sensación de que es política empresarial normalizada. Los beneficios no salariales (formaciones,  compras de productos propios, etc) no se aplican para trabajadores temporales, lo que acentúa la diferencia entre empleados y la sensación de no pertenecer a una misma empresa."
bad,"The company only follows their mantra when it benefits them. The team leaders are often in meetings and not available to actually ""lead"". Your opinion doesn't mean anything."
bad,"Patético lugar ( Customer Service, Disp. Medicos) con una organizacion desectructurada, desenfocada, caotica, con resultados desastrosos y personal toxico. "
bad,Not bad as a job to start out in but as a career you need to have a degree or you wont go anywhere. As a normal employee that probably works in the springs is not worth it unless you live up north of the springs
bad,"I did Quality Control of the contact lenses lines. It was a temporary position. According to my superiors, I did a good job for my experience. I worked there for a year."
bad,"Okay to work for enjoyed vacation days. Very good insurance.will not want to work for again. It’s a very organized company. If you have a contact, you want be able to work for seven months."
bad,Je déconseille fortement cette entreprise qui va droit dans le mur... Les horaires ont étaient modifié et depuis c l'horreur
bad,"Johnson and Johnson is known as one of the best companies in the world to work for; and yes, this is true, IF YOU HAVE A DEGREE.  I am in the Rework/Reprocessing department.  It starts at 10.00 hr.  And it is very hard work over 12 hour shifts.  Management only cares that you SAFELY (so you dont get hurt and they dont have to pay for an injury) MAKE their numbers, SO THEY GET THEIR BONUS.  YOU GET NO BONUS, YOU CANT AFFORD BENEFITS BECAUSE YOU CANT PAY YOUR RENT TO BEGIN WITH.  They PREY upon those that are 1st time job seekers or can barely speak english and have no place else to go.  Again, IF YOU HAVE A DEGREE, GO TO J&J and LET THEM GET YOU A GREAT JOB AT 100K a year.  IF YOU DONT HAVE A DEGREE, SEEK EMPLOYMENT ELSEWHERE."
bad,"This culture and management, specifically through PRA/RPS  put me in need of medical leave.  I was fired within 2 weeks of returning from doctors care with a work acquired disability.  I never knew a company would mistreat it's highly skilled workers so much."
bad,Perto de muitas empresas a Johnson ainda fica entre umas das boas empresas para se trabalhar; porém quem esteve lá a mais de 10 anos sabe na pele e mente que nem de longe ela presa por sua filosofia - seu credo de conduta. A globalização foi tirando seus princípios e valores morais.
bad,Great job if you are just left to do your job.  Great Money.  Constantly have to watch your back that someone isn't trying to railroad you and that includes management.  Management and Supervisors had no problem talking about and making fun of other employees in front of their employees.  Constantly telling employees things that should not be shared about other employees.  After leaving this company I literally have nightmares of being back there.
bad,"They treat temps poorly and have temps time clocks out on the work floors far away from the locker rooms that you first have to dress into before clocking in. 98% of the time, the time clock doesn’t work and you have to run to the other side of the work floor to clock in late. While J&J staff clock in on the clock that is in the locker rooms. There is a lot of harassment between employees (sexually) and they treat others who don’t engage in their foolishness as if they are less than them. When a temp tries to become permanent. They overlook you (years) and just higher on family members instead.  When you want to talk to a manager's face to face you can’t about what’s going on. You have to send out an email and hope you get a response back. I got fed up and just left. Not worth the stress and hated  being treated poorly."
bad,"Has a credo, which when read, sounds amazing, in reality it is used to justify removal of benefits, jobs and to pat senior management on the back for making less employees do more, "
bad,"Very negative energy in the workplace, no formal policies and procedures, a convicted felon was managing the business at the time of my employment, I was fired on false pretenses, because of management having personal issues with me he had me fired for being a no call no show which was a lie and a few months later the management was completely replaced with all new people because the company was losing so much business."
bad,"My project was terminated w/o cause and manager refused to provide any cause.  No transparency. In hind sight they were anticipating letting a contractor go then decided against therefore terminating my project.  Last one hired first one fired,"
bad,"Johnson and Johnson is a great company in terms of benefits and salary. They advertise themselves as being a pay for performance type company, but my experiences have not been indicative of this."
bad,If you work they will take advantage of you to make up for the ones that don't. Management can never meet goals and their is a constant turnover in their positions.
bad,"Johnson and Johnson is a financially strong and stable organization, but severely lacks consistent leadership.  My experience was working in a culture that was out of touch with their leadership team as well as employee base as a whole.  They seemingly make decisions based on stockholders alone versus market conditions/changes."
bad,"Not recommended. Recently acquired by J&J. Company credo preaches good culture and work / life balance, but it is not placed into practice. Many of the statements made are not actually true."
bad,The 5 stars are false.  The company really over works their employees they have some benefits.  I would not recommend this as a good company to work for.
bad,There is no reason to do temporary only jobs in the current market. There is no room for advancement and no way to improve your situation at all. Not recommended
bad,"With little to no oversight by management of its workers in Quality Control the perm. personnel of Vistakon have an easy ride. They come in late for their shifts and leave whenever it suits them as long as they have vacation/sick time on the books(which is a bundle). Temps. are treated as second class citizens with 3 times being late your out and no sick time. Hiring of temp. personnel is done by popularity, ethnic group or relation to perm. personnel. Quality experience has no weight here. Openings happen when one perm. retires and the manager asks the shift lead for their input as to who gets hired. Asians or Blacks are picked and if your a female your a shoe-in for the position. Why you might ask? All the leads are Asian or black females. Management is clueless."
bad,Incumplimiento de contrato no daban el sueldo completo
bad,Hard to move up anywhere. Management wasn't very good. Other workers there seemed to be very high minded (prideful). High turn over rate.
bad,"J&J has a wonderful reputation, and in some parts of the company that reputation is valid.  But in other parts of the company, it is not.  Overall, J&J is a great place to seek work for younger folks looking to move up quickly.  There is a strong desire to bring in young, green talent and to mold them as leadership desires.  There is not as much opportunity for mid or late career candidates as leadership at J&J does not like to be challenged or questioned or disagreed with.  As a result, younger candidates and ""Yes-Men"" tend to be the most likely to be selected or to advance in their careers.  The hardest part of the job is holding your tongue when you know something is wrong, but you also know that your leadership does not want to hear about it...and certainly does not want you to share the info with others inside or outside of the organization!"

bad,"As a former employee, I experienced many good and bad times. First and foremost, Johnson & Johnson has many attributes. This company offers great products to enhance many people lives. I am very thankful to be have been part of this contribution. "
bad,Just wasn't the field for me anymore. company is also for sale. I need job security.
bad,The customers were what kept me at this job. The job wasnt very difficult. I liked the work. My coworkers were great except for management.
bad,"Contractors are  treated like they were  some sort of sub human beings , the pressure is terrible, to get numbers numbers, and the agency's are as bad that employ you they just don't care about your welfare, its  a dog eat dog situation,"
bad,"The J&J credo missed its mark in the Tampa market. Sr. University Management wad hired in from the banking industry and created an aggressive, cut throat, sink or swim culture."
bad,"JNJ es una empresa que tenía una gran fama, desgraciadamente los administradores de esta época la han dejado caer al grado de rotación de personal como en todas, el salario que ofrecen no es de los más altos, bonos tampoco y es una cultura en donde si no conoces a alguien no sobresaldrás, necesitas ser muy barbero para poder sobresalir en esta industria al menos en cd Juarez chihuahua."
bad,"For short periods of time, this company isn't bad to work for. They start at a competitive pay rate and offer good benefits."
bad,"A typical day at work can have multiple schedule changes. Communication is lacking, especially from first shift to off shifts. Management is either defeated and defensive, or trying to coast to retirement. The workplace culture is toxic in quality; management does not communicate changes very well, then accuses analysts of being unable to do their jobs correctly.  Repeated meetings making veiled threats about our jobs and how bad our performance is just further demotivates people."
bad,"Je werkt in ploegendiensten, dus ook 's nachts. Er zit geen ritme in je leven wat veel ziekte veroorzaakte bij mezelf en bij collega's. Het werk is niet echt uitdagend en eentonig. Het moeilijkste van de baan is daarom het vinden van een weg met verschillende werktijden. Het leukste was de salaris wat aan het einde van de week binnenkwam."
bad,"If you are looking to join Johnson and Johnson Vision, don't. The J&J Credo is preached until we're all tired of hearing it- and we're tired of hearing it because JJV doesn't live by it. It is nearly anarchy after the purchase of AMO and creating JJV.  People are abandoning ship almost weekly.  The head of sales is not a leader and inspires no one.  He is very tough, but it would seem that it's only to impress himself.  The entire organization is having a hard time doing anything to spur sales.  Leadership has lost the sales team.  When the whole sales organization is having a hard time, it isn't your sales people."
bad,"buena remuneracion , poco compañerismo , el trabajo mas pesado solo lo llevaba yo , nada de empatia en ese sentido , aprendi a utilizar mas el correo como medio de respaldo ."

bad,Johnson & Johnson is a dead end for your career if you are a minority. I worked near the diversity office and found that they literally have 0 leaders that are minorities or females. If you are looking to start your career then this might be the right place. If you are looking for a leadership role and advancement as a minority then you are better off going to another company. They don't negotiate salary
bad,"At any one time, I manage a significant case-load including reviewing initial requests, drafting, re-drafting based on comments from Internal Review, negotiations and ensuring that the executed contracts are entered on the Contracts Database."

bad,Aprendi com o tempo a personalidade de cada um dos chefes assim pude negocia mais facilmente.A gerente conheci um mês depois de assumir meu cargo... Os colegas de trabalho eram excelentes. A parte mais difícil era dar conta de 8 lojas mais a de um colega.
bad,Very top-heavy organization with a lot of bloat at the Director-level. Not enough employees actually doing the work at the manager and analyst level. Management has unrealistic expectations of resources required to advance projects. Company is scrambling to stay ahead of the regulatory curve and employees spend too much time managing regulatory compliance issues. The company does produce some of the industry's most iconic products with outstanding brand name. Cost cutting measures have jeopardized quality across Consumer and Pharma.
bad,"I worked here for an internship as a Quality Engineer in Orthopedics. While the people on my team were mostly great, there were definitely some incompetent people at this company (keep in mind I was a student during my time here). It was mostly a good learning experience but by 8 months I was more than done with the place."
bad,Chez Johnson il y a une politique mais pas beaucoup de gens là respecte malheureusement. Beaucoup trop de personnes dont les « Back up» se prennent pour des chefs tout le monde s’occupe du travail de tout le monde mauvaise ambiance dans les ateliers. Et les chefs préfèrent écouter les anciens qui dissent du mal des autres que de faire la part des choses.

bad,"If you do not have any one from the senior managers that ""love you"" not just like you then your career will never go anywhere. No promotions, no career moves, no advancement and you will be the first choice for redundancy even if your previous rating is exceed expectations. In J&J you are nothing without a heavy sponsor."
bad,IT organization much more concerned about internal affairs than focused on business improvements. People are oriented to getting promotions instead of improving their deliverables from IT perspective.
bad,"Tons of consultants who don't know much.  Terrible working conditions.  Oasis of H1B's.  Management snipes at each other.  PMO needs work. Some are downright nasty but when you look at what they are working with, not unexpected."

bad,"If you like to spend your life commuting and working long hours with no notice and work with childish people this is the place. They preach “living well” but it only seems to be for higher pay grades, if you’re a pay grade 25 or lower you’re just an employee number supplying labor. As an exsample I receive tips on healthy living like sleeping, eating and physical activity, but between commuting and working overtime with no notice It makes it difficult to “live well”. I have also experienced management looking the other way when it comes policy, I worked with a group leader that was clearly sexually harassing young ladies but management looked the other way even thought the complaints were there, that group leader is still there."
bad,Environnement intense centré sur le marché des neurosciences en France
bad,I worked there when they bought out a company known as Synthes which was the second largest company in the field. When they bought out the company they changed everything that was got the old company to where it was and started to get rid of everyone. They took all of our benefits which were amazing and replaced them with second rate ones.
bad,"Dias bons, agradáveis e outros nem tanto. Aprendi o que de fato fazia um promotor de merchandising. Direção e gerência com a mente retrógrada, ultrapassada, imposição de poder e ameaças. Colegas ótimos, infelizmente alguns perderam o emprego devido a mentalidade da gerência, onde se encaixa a parte mais difícil, e a mais agradável foi ter saído para uma oportunidade muito melhor."
bad,"J&J Medical UK has a highly sales focused culture, focusing on the top line rather than bottom line margin. Great if you work in sales, but for anyone with a commercial background, this means you take a back seat. The culture is highly geared to the sales teams, meaning other departments and back office staff are treated as the poor relations"

bad,Since adding the new night operations manager employee moral has never been lower in the entire time I have worked here. He has no idea how to do our jobs and forces direct managers into micro management. the direct managers are a joke now. they used to care and provide feedback to the employees but now just want to brown nose the new operations manager. I used to love my job and advancement opportunities available but those are now few and far between. I can see in the near future you will need a hall pass to use the toilet. No matter what quality or level of technician you are you will no longer be recognized for accomplishments only criticized and punished for any mistake.
bad,I was hired on as a temp. Worked there for six months. Management was friendly but they were in the process of completely getting rid of their temps at the time so I have no idea why they even bothered to hire me to start with. Excellent on the job training. Friendly coworkers.  No alot of drama because everyone is focused on the work.

bad,"1) Pre-Authorizations"
bad,"The position is great for work/life balance, however, there are no opportunities to move up to Corporate.  The pay is very low for the amount of work."
bad,no work ethics. Full time leads have no clear cut knowledge on process and don't know estimated time lines to assess deliverables. Looks like higher level managment don't have clear visibility on what happening

bad,"Beginning was good. Later on, if shift manager likes you, and you are saying everything to her what she wants to know, you are good to go. But if you have some ambitious and you are together with people who she doesn't like, your days are counted. She doesn't let you talk or laugh with others. Colleagues are nice, except shift manager."
bad,"Very protective culture at J&J which prevents collaboration and personal development."

bad,"My experience at johnson and johnson was short-lived. I was told that it is a relationship company and that my education and work experience wouldn't help me with my upward mobility in the company if the "" right people"" didn't like me.

bad,"Johnson & Johnson medical nederland voorziet vanuit Amersfoort "
bad,Poorly paid for the level of qualifications required to join. Inherent culture of lack of trust by management toward employees both in ability and character.
bad,"Do not work here unless you want to be a robot for a team of unqualified managers. Despite a huge emphasis of how important employees are to the company (the Credo) that is marketed when you are being interviewed and brought into the company, J&J is really just another heartless company when it comes to their employees. "
bad,Summary says it all.  Management spread out and disorganized.  No defined path.

bad,I wasn't really interested in this job it was just one of those just need it to keep the bills paid type things. It was a warehouse but we worked on assembly lines.
bad,"Empresa flexivel, dinamica, muitas atividades durante o expediente possibilitando maior aprendizagem."
bad,"Nothing to notable about J&J. "
bad,This job requires a lot of physical labor that's not worth the pay
bad,"Management has no clear consistent path forward. This can be illustrated by the number of name changes the division has had over the years. The pay and benefits are excellent, but that is offset by the insecurity. They have a reorganization about every two years so by the time a path forward is chosen, it changes again and everyone has to get used to organizational changes. If you are looking for stability, I would avoid this organization. If you are looking to gain experience and move on, this would be a good place."
bad,nice place to work. supply all needs for working in cold tempertures
bad,"J & J is a great company and has a lot to offer in terms of high salaries and excellent benefit packages. They offer an excellent pension and 401K, which is unusual in this day and age. Their vacation and time-off benefits are quite generous. They offer free lunches and their worksite kitchens are well-stocked with healthy drinks and snacks. They have an onsite gym, which is really convenient for their employees. Unfortunately, their health insurance premiums are extremely high, which is surprising, given that they are a healthcare company."
bad,"Overall the managers are professional however the company truly lacks both racial and gender diversity. The typical sales hires are Caucasian males, a few Asian males. Hardly any females and or other nationalities in their sales force."
bad,it was ok to work there just would have liked to have been told that they had sold out and that i no longer had a job but the benefits were ok and the people that i worked with were ok to get along with
bad,Super easy work.  People come and go as they please.  Management hasn't a clue.  No direction from management.  People seem to know what to do but new guys are left to fend for themselves.
bad,"F****d me in the a** with the contract that they didn't honor. A six month contract became less than a two month contract. My coworker and I did a good job at the company and since we finished the project early and did it effectively, our reward was being let go."
bad,Great place for me to start my career. Upper management is unwilling to change.

good,"Es una muy buena empreasa un monstruo de el ramo medico. Pero quienes dirigen la empresa, team leads, supervisores, no sirven para nada."
good,"Decent pay and weekly pay which is good but there is no room whatsoever to grow sighing the company. Treated unfairly , firing the people who actually do work and make the product move on the lines rather than the ones who don’t and stand around doing absolutely nothing. Also standing on feet isn’t an issue however i’m flat footed and inserts don’t really work for me."
good,"Ótimo trabalho."
good,My day started at 7:00am Monday-Friday.Great place to work.Very respectable people to wrok around.
good,company wasn't very organized . I had many problems concerning my checks and my manager . I enjoyed the job but i did not enjoy working for the company .
good,"Branding of JNJ is well known. However, there are too much politics and legacy employees are jealous of new comers with skills so they leave them in the dark most of the time -- esp. the consultants. They are not consistent with the information that are provided to the consulting company versus the insiders. Technology they use are outdated and are not consistent across the board -- esp. in the global infrastructure environment. They are trying hard to cut IT budget while cannot support them internally. It is a very strange company."
good,I am a Consultant. Good Work/Life Balance.

good,"The job that I currently hold is known to be tedious, but it is more the management that makes it stressful and not enjoyable. There are no benefits, which makes it all the more stressful. The company itself does a lot of good for the community and worldwide, but it is perhaps only the full-time workers (not the contractors) who are able to benefit from working here."
good,Les informations ne sont pas données en amont pour permettre une bonne gestion du poste
good,I like to work in JnJ because my work was appreciate by my ex boss in JnJ as Sales Co-ordinator. Need to improve on HOD attitude . They way to talk with Staff.
good,"I learned a lot working for Johnson and Johnson through Kelly services as a temp agency. The management could use some work on their professionalism however the work and the people that work there are genuine people who really care about the outcome of their work. "
good,"many long unappreciated hours"
good,"If you are a self starter and require little to no supervision it is a great environment since most management is global and rarely available for interfacing.  I was a department of one with a boss in another country on a 5 hour time difference, this was a very challenging position to be in, since I was in charge of my responsibilities for a large site and received little to no training when brought on board."
good,"Very paternalistic culture. Highly risk adverse.  Not willing to take chances on new leaders. Very insular and inward looking. Not focused on the customer or consumer - highly focused on the bottom line.  "
good,"easy work, and co workers are friendly. a typical day to day job, management can be problematic. easy to pick up on other positions in the work in the work place."
good,"New young manager came in who home office wanted to promote. He was terrible. The job was great for four years, and then it was horrible. Soon as my manager was replaced, the job became awful, and I left."
good,Too many cooks in the kitchen.  There were so many items that were in the process of being outsourced.  The new generation pushes everything through without properly reviewing the proposal and contract before having it executed.

good,"Serviço fácil com muita cobrança, para não haver atrasos nos eventos onde iriamos coordenar.Aprendi que nada depende de uma pessoa só, tudo precisa estar em sintonia e sincronizado.Na gerência da empresa tinha muito foco ""chefe"" e pouco foco ""líder""."
good,"Entrei no projeto de Skin Care com prazo determinado, o que me impossibilita de avaliar de forma plena."
good,"They promised a lot but none of them materialized."
good,My work experience at Johnson and Johnson Products was very short term meaning it was a temporary employment job. I was not doing anything  major just shipping and packing. However I enjoyed my work there I had to quit  early due my pregnancy
good,Johnson and Johnson is a decent company to work for if you have the right supervisor.  There has been a change in the organization over the past 2 years that has caused the moral at the Jacksonville site to lower.  This is why I am looking for a new position.
good,I was selected to finish project they recently planned to implement to company. For that work HRs was more then 10 Hrs a day. Particular work assignments was such were I came to know after joining  to team .
good,It was just a temp job for me as they were moving all production to Mexico.  I was offered a perm job but had to turn it down because i did not wish to get laid off or be forced to move to New Jersey.
good,"The company opted to eliminate a distributorship model in favor of direct-hire model, alienating and damaging relationships that had been established through years of working together. Next, they opted to eliminate regional managers which left territories in dismal conditions. Then positions started getting eliminated and that was that."
good,"I learned a lot but sudden restructuring without notice to the employees left me in a position to either accept a completely different job from the one I was hired to do or quit. I went from pharmaceutical scientist to packaging engineer. I did learn a lot about packaging, but my education and interest was in pharmaceuticals. Management varied by individual. Some were interested in their employees, others weren't."
good,Employees are under paid for the quality of work required but overall working for Vistakon was a good experience. The main thing I didn't like about the company was the inconsistency of hours scheduled.
good,"Good and hard working people to work with. Nice infrastructure.good environment, High ethics based, Purpose driven, Employee friendly, Great career path, Diversity"

good,Trabalhei la por 23 anos e teve bons e maus momentos....infelizmente a empresa é mau gerenciada em alguns setores e muito bem em outros...ultimamente o salario pra quem se inicia teve uma queda muito grande e bons profissionais são descartados a favor de apadrinhados.
good,"Es una empresa en la cual el desafió siempre es al máximo nivel, constantemente buscando mejorar sus procesos, lo que genera una relación Vida privada/ trabajo muy exigente y con muy pocas posibilidades de crecer profesionalmente, no existen las promociones pero con buenos beneficios. Es recomendable (por poco tiempo)"
good,"Buena empresa, buenos beneficios, alto nivel de aprendizaje, en proceso de re estructuración constante y oportunidades en la gestión de talento"
good,"Bom ambiente de trabalho, equipe sempre disposta a ajudar"
good,"Repetitive, simple, boring job!"
good,Lack of training leads little room for advancement.  Training is difficult to obtain due to the lack of staffing.  Environment is fast paced and production is done with the least amount of employees possible.
good,"average culture, i had higher expectations of it considering it is a very well known MNC. However, it was run like a local company, with employees talking in the local state lingo even in S&OP meetings!"
good,"Overall Vistakon is a place where long hard hours equate to great technical experience gained but in a harsh bonus driven culture."
good,"Whether new to the company or having worked there for many years, everyone is afraid that their job will be eliminated.  The company seems to enjoy promoting this fear and keeping everyone on edge about their fate, as if that will get people to work harder than they already do."
good,"Decent work culture and benefits, an okay entry point into the working world. Job expectations tended towards long hours and overworked staff. Well located near Herald Square."
good,"I had a very positive experience working at J&J until layoffs began in 2010.  People I worked with were excellent and very helpful for the most part, you always find some people no matter where you work that are not as good to work with."
good,"It was a lot of work for a very low pay rate, stressful at times and management wasn't as professional as they could've been. Ultimately I wouldn't recommend them as a long term job."
good,i will not put a review about a company that i still work for no matter if its good or bad. there is no reason to unless it is part of the interviewing process.
good,I my experience I was working too many hours and the projects changed so often you. wasted so much time.  Too many meetings.  Management did not communicate with he emloyees.
good,"not bad place to work, depending on which department you are working. They have a great benefits and if you are willing to give up your personal life you can grow"
good,"The Ethicon division of Johnson & Johnson is very different from the JRD, the research division of Johnson and Johnson.  These two divisions are like night and day.  Where JRD fostered a culture of work balance and quality decision making, the Ethicon division was focused on just getting tasks done with no real concern as to whether the right tasks were being done.  The goal was to complete as many tasks as possible whether they were the right or wrong tasks."
good,"I haven't received the hours they guaranteed us at orientation, I'm currently seeking a full time position at this time. Ive also noticed favoritism and discrimination toward people. My orientation was great but they have a problem with nepotism."
good,"As a contractor, I was not allowed to showcase my full capabilities as a seasoned professional.  I started in the middle of a project and felt the management was very junior in their leadership skills."
good,"É uma empresa séria, mais não vejo muitas oportunidades para sermos direto, pois atingi o patamar máximo por ser terceirizado, mais lá não temos muitas chances."
good,"The hours are ok, the management is ok, and it is a nice place to work.  The pay is acceptable but could be more as the job is demanding and there is a lot of working outside of your original scope."
good,"work balance great, no advancement, lay off threat constant, pay is okay,contractors treated bad, no communication to underlings,bad moral, good people trying hard to succeed, no support"
good,Job is not secure. Management has a preferential treatment.
good,"Key elements within my role as a customer service associate consisted of daily communication with new and existing clients; via phone calls and face to face liaison. This has allowed me to improve on existing communication and rapport building skills, to ensure that I provide exceptional customer service. "
good,Over all the job was good. Not hard work. Other employees were great. Management not so much. I loved the people who came to the store. The customers were the reason I stayed so long.
good,"Janssen Farmaceutica que es parte de J&J es el peor lugar para trabajar, la gente es mala onda, empezando por los Directores y Gerentes; no se inspira un ambiente colaborativo ni de confianza, y la forma de subir es haciendo la barba a los superiores , ha sido el peor ambiente en el que he trabajado"
good,"Nice place, but have to have patience, management still working on how to make it better. If you know people who work there and your chance of being a temp is high but to get hired you got to go beyond 200%, and still doesn’t mean you will"
good,JnJ is basically a company that looks at bottom line more then the actual people working for them. They will constantly get rid of people and replace them with contractors to then be able to get rid of them when the time is right to boost their margins. A practice seen in a lot of companies now. But don’t let that scare you. If you play with the right office politics you can be assured to stay in good standing and hopefully make something out of it. I’m sure things will change for the better in the future.
good,"Your not compensated for the equipment you have to operate, it is a great control warehouse, and the hours are OK, but they offer no overtime, so your pay isn't enough for cost of living"
good,"Very interesting work but with no direction, training or on-boarding.   Very nepotisitic culture.  "
good,"Rotating 12 hour schedule. Demanding work environment with lack of technical support and poor management. One of the greater benefits of working for Janssen is the exposure and training of many new skills that are applicable to many different industries. However, this is also the companies biggest weakness. The more that you learn the more that they expect out of you with little to no recognition, compensation or reward. The job duties continue to pile on top of you and before you know it you are over worked and under paid. Management has become almost non-existent. You will be spoken to and treated like a child. If you are not in administration you will be treated like and infidel, degraded and insulted."
good,Horarrio muy comodo.. una pena que se hayan ido del pais
good,"Virtually no benefits as a contractor. One does not feel like part of the company as if one would like to eat with ones colleagues one must either empty their wallet as there is no discount, or bring a bag lunch, which seems very strange in an organization like this. Also there are no 1 to 1 meetings with ones manager. You watch as everyone else plans their careers and you get the feeling that you should just be lucky to have a job. I am sure the contractor pay is also much lower than permanent employees unless people are pushing their credit limits for their cars and clothes. "
good,"J&J has the potential of being great, but mismanagement, poor decision making, a consent decree, and various other factors led to lowered morale, and concern at all levels of job security.  Management is more interested in saving their own necks than promoting innovation.  That is not to say that there are not great people in leadership roles there.  There are, but many have learned quickly that if you do not go with the flow, you will not last, and many did not.  There are fantastic people in all functions and levels; however, I do not see that the company is following the credo with regards to caring for its employees.  More than ever, positions are being contracted out, or even sent to offshore teams, rather than hiring from within.  Not only is this frustrating and discouraging, but it also sets the company back.  Many times offshore teams simply do not work to the level and capability that someone onsite, with experience will, which in my opinion, is not the cost-effective solution that the company thought it would be when making the decision to send jobs overseas."

good,"Management leaves much to be desired.  Morale is extremely low.  Company policies not enforced across the board.  It's who you know. Turnover is very, very high."
good,"Is a fast pace environment a lot of pressure sometimes,  hardest part of the job is meeting unrealistic deadlines, i learn  a lot working with chemicals and reviewing paper work to log it in the computer database."
good,"The company does not hire contractors or employees over 50.  No matter how talented you are.  They rotate internal employees, do not train well either"
good,"descordinacion, cuadratura de consumos, empresa contratista que prestaba servicio. por ende no habia preocupacion hacia el trabajador.solo cumplir con lo dictado, mal humorados, llegar a la hora estipulada de la emergencia, tratar con gente muy buenas en cada cuenta (clinicas y hopitales)."
good,Its a strong company to work for with a lot of smart people. Unfortunately its not a stable environment in Canada as they continue to lay off key positions and leave the remaining work force with an unreasonable amount of work.
good,"I have worked for J&J for almost 18 years, over the 18 years there has been lots of changes in management and demands. It is a high paced environment that is constantly changing and with more demands."

good,"As a Regulatory Affair Assistant of the Caribbean I was in charge of the recollection of all legal documents to form the DOSSIER. I was in charge of working hand by hand with the Minister of Health of the Caribbean to approve all products and submit the new ones, which compound the Johnson & Johnson Hemisférica company. "
good,"Overall, J&J is an excellent organization collectively. There are lots of competitive opportunities world wide. Depending on the department and/or the part of the business (Consumer, PHARM, etc) would depend on the culture, work environment management and co-workers."
good,"Started my pharmaceutical career at J&J and enjoyed working there. Not only did I enjoy my in house duties as an administrative assistant but promoting PROCRIT was my favorite product and launched my relationships while teaching me more about HIV and how not only does the disease effect the patient but how important PROCRIT was in providing a normal life for patients that thought their life was over. I was devastated to leave but it was a business decision that had a great ROI. "

good,Need to change the culture it’s very negative terrible job with new drug launch    Not following the credo  it’s changed a lot it’s really sad. Ethics are not what they used to be
good,"good place to work , worked here for a long time, long hours but the people made it. good social club. learned to grow a thick skin and not take things personally"
good,It was always fun working at Johnson and Johnson. The employees are all diverse and fun to work with. Worklife balance is not really present though and overtime is required a lot.
good,"A detailed-oriented team player with proven delivery of customer friendly business results.  Works well independently as well as under supervision.  Expressing strong work ethics, exhibit strong energy and drive."
good,"The culture here is very old school.   If you are looking for a progressive company to work for, this would not be it.   They do have young talent in manager roles, but were trained by the old school leadership"
good,Surprising how a company of J&J's stature could allow a site to flounder like a rudder-less ship. Management doesn't know what their employees are doing and doesn't even take an interest in learning.

good,"I am hopeful that the new CTO abides by the Credo and promotes a healthy work/life balance.. Three year ago, 80% of the IT department had lost their jobs, including myself.  At that time, they did not recognize talented and customer focused individuals whom truly believed in the Credo."
good,"My typical work day consisted of analyzing work streams to find abnormalities in production output and find solutions to resolve them within a short time span (24h resolve). "
good,"Um dia típico de trabalho em vendas com atendimento aos clientes, rotina de campo e burocracias."
good,"Es un empresa que a pesar de tener una muy buena política de convivencia la misma no se representa en el día a a día, constantemente se esta buscando un responsable para justificar los tiempos improductivos y sus perdidas, el concepto de trabajo en equipo aun no evoluciona al nivel que una empresa de este nivel debería tener, pero se encuentran en buen camino, considero los ayudaría mucho en esa dirección el vivir y sentir la política como esta escrita."

good,"Good company to work for with great people, but they will work you to the bone and you will struggle to find work/life balance and promotion opportunities."
good,"J&J is a great organization, but the formation of power groups within the Senior leadership leads to lack of diversity. The great part is challenging assignments, great process for managing performance and focus on training"
good,"Probably the best product, disease state, and marketplace training. The communication throughout the organization is consistently broken making it frustrating to feel that you can be at your best from day to day. Management here is extremely hard working, but they are hindered by the lack of solid communication and transparency as well."
good,"Operator."
good,Management durft geen beslissingen nemen inzake verlengen van contract wat getuigt op geen professioneel beleid.
good,"Leadership is out of touch with day-to-day operations.  "
good,"Thats all they care about. The people are very nice but the sudden change in management has lead to more focus on $$$. There is also a lot of Vendor Politics, so when you go in, go with the preferred for the longivity."
good,"If you are a contractor at J&J, you should do your time, complete your projects, make connections, leave a good impression, and get the heck out. Don't get stuck there and don't wait to become permanent. There are people that have been contractors for 6 years and still have no sign of becoming full time. It pays well but the job culture for contractors is terrible. You get treated like a second class citizen and are labelled a ""resource"" not even seen as a person."
good,"It's great working at Johnson and Johnson Vision, unfortunately the management team weakens the entire team. There is too much micro managing which causes workers to work overtime."

good,I have been working for Varsha Logistics. as a Logistic Executive from 5 + years. I have improved  myself and professionally. In this organization the work atmosphere was friendly nature. I am looking to change the company for my career growth.
good,"During my 4-month experience in JnJ I had the task to supply and distribute the brands of responsibility and ensure domestic availability. The main problem was the unbearable everyday schedule... From 9-ish to 8-ish every day, I turned into a working robot, with no life at all, no time for external activities and no energy to cope with anything else. I recall everybody admitting that from the time they started working for the company time just flew away, without even realizing that. Of course the salary was fixed, no paid overtime or bonuses. "
good,"lack  of training disciplines , did not train accordingly .Work place was very clean and somewhat friendly .The person training me did take any responsibility for training they had blamed me for a mistake in the warehouse and my trainer knew it was wrong  showed no integrity ,the person that was training me would disappear for hours at a time ,they train by shadowing another person  which is a joke !!The other coworkers were friendly until my last day ."

good,"Regular employees treat very differently the contracts employees , meaning they are not friendly and does not like to work in team work with contractors."
good,"great company but bad work place bad culture. "
good,"Very modern office, and some work practices were very modern, and some very traditional. J&J have a large quantity of in-house applications to learn which was fun but would not perhaps be of use outside working for J&J. Co-workers were very quiet in my section, but were genuine, and nice people. Hardest part of the job would vary for each individual.  Location was good, restaurant and benefits were also very good. Most enjoyable part of the job were the PA's who all shared information and the bosses."
good,"O dia-a-dia é bem corrido, existe diversas solicitações da liderança que de última hora e muitas vezes temos que interromper nossa rotina para atender o que é Ad Hoc. "

good,"# nice company and good to work with this"
good,Need their upper management to take courses on dealing with people.
good,"We would show up at work at the time and location that the boss would tell us and we would unload the trailer. We did not have a set schedule, we just had to get the job done in a timely manner and the correct way. The quicker we got the job done, the quicker we would get off for that day. Our boss would come and inspect and we would start again the next day. The boss was great, and had a great way of managing her business alongside her husband. The co-workers were sometimes hard to work with because some of them chose not to hold their own."
good,"if your happy with an industry that ties your hands behind your back and tells you to swim, this is the place for you"
good,"fun place to work at. you can gain a lot of experience dealing with people, especially unhappy people. you learn how to handle difficult situations. you dont get any chance to advance"
good,Work life balance is preached but not followed. Compensation plan is very good but job security is lacking unless you are in the NJ area. Lost my job when they closed the plant and they do not offer job placement when that happens.
good,This is a very good company to work for. During my time there I contracted through another company. Job security is the company isn't too bad for a multinational global company.
good,You can learn a lot of things and gain a lot of knowledge. Employees are very friendly and they have a team work. But the sales is not entitled to over time pay.
good,"Comp doesn't relate to amount of work you do"
good,"Good work environment and opportunity, especially for young people to start the career. Systematic training with internal relocation opportunity. A decent culture"
good,It’s an ok job overall just the hours suck 4am to 12pm I mean it’s not bad if you like waking up at 3am just to go to work the people are nice to work with just not an ideal job for someone looking to save money
good,Am not able to review in accuracy due to period of employment being under one year.  Office location was at International Business Park.  It was a permanent role.
good,"I mostly enjoyed my time with Johnson & Johnson, but the culture at my facility was one where employees were always waiting for the ""axe to fall"". While we were encouraged to be forthright and quality-conscious via our Credo, this was not the actual practice."
good,"Pessimo work life balance"
good,"J&J was an okay place to work but once my manager left, things changed quickly.  I then realized how important having a good manager really is. Management at times was unorganized which caused unnecessary confusion."
good,I liked the hours they had. They under paid you for what your job required. Very big on safety was a plus. They had old equipment. I didn't like how they gave everybody the news telling us they were closing down.
good,"J&J is a good company to work. The problem is that with the ""global company transformation"" they are getting rid of low salary people like operators, floor people, low salary professionals and some supervisors but no managers and upper. In the meantime, you receive corporate emails to let you know when they hired some guru almost from another planet based on their resume or promote somebody to VP,  or senior senior VP for any part of the planet with huge salaries while in the low levels there is no job security."
good,"compartmentalized, no management, contractors do most of the difficult engineering tasks."
good,"As a contractor, I was able to see a definite difference in the way employees were treated as opposed to contractors. I felt there were way too many meetings per week."
good,It was a small company with only a handful of employees.  We had a constant turnover in employees to various reason I prefer not to mention.  Our immediate boss was a good guy but the owner  wouldnt let him do his job.
good,"Cool laidback company. Work was free flowing, got help when needed. Leadership on the floor was pleasant. The company was a in the rise, but the inspection department closed for some reason."
good,"Different companies have different cultures. It has been a struggle not just for me but for most to try to embrace the J & J ""self-service"" culture.  We have lost a lot of productivity with the self-service culture at J & J.  I am embarrassed for our new hires that come in. They do not get an orientation from our HR department. Their day one is literally to sit at their computer and on board themselves.  It has been a difficult transition for current employees and it has been even more difficult for new employees coming on board.  As a large company such as this, I would've expected more help from management and other departments such as IT, and HR but it is non-existent. In general, time is spent by employees trying to find answers and solutions to the problems and getting in touch with a human than we are being productive.  We are getting less done by chasing down someone who can help us as opposed to being more productive associates for the company.  Being a self-service company is not a cost savings."
good,"Everyday I looked forward to going to work because my peers and direct reports are hard working people who strive to do their very best everyday. We worked hard, but laughed hard too."
good,"My typical day would start early in the morning, way before most others, in order to get a head start on my work load. This was necessary because by mid-day I would be in a staff meeting, CCB, or answering questions regarding the project or procedures. My day would end, usually 12 hours after I arrived. If traffic was bad, I would stay until 7:00 when the commuter lane opened to everyone."
good,Place to build core competencies and continue education. Salary was comparable to the area's cost of living. Vacation time was very adequate. Pension and 401K added value to overall compensation package.
good,"Johnson & Johnson is focused too much on deliverables and deadlines, and in turn loses sight of the happiness of their employees. The work/life balance isn't good and most roles entail enough responsibilities for multiple people, but one person is expected to do it. Johnson & Johnson sites are losing focus on what truly matters. Happy employees will perform well, while tired and unsatisfied employees won't. Work/life balance needs to become a bigger priority."
good,Benefits/compensation are great. Management team in the payroll department created an environment of distrust and did not advance within the department.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job I have is the people that I work with. Most of the people are great, they are always willing to help out and lend a hand. I’ve had the opportunity to manage some really outstanding people. Some of these people are very creative. They create outstanding mechanical designs and work crazy hours. Others are hard at work building prototype systems and maintaining the R&D equipment. Still others have their unique tasks that they are trying get accomplished as correct and fast as they can because they know that launch dates are at stake. Some of these outstanding people don’t work in the same department as I do, but that doesn't matter because they know that a success for any department is a success for the company. There are of course those ""it's not my job"" types, that just put up roadblocks, but there are very few of them."
good,bad management. employees get taken advantage of. you stand through your whole shift with only 30 min for lunch. overtime isn't worth it because your paid min wadge.
good,Have multiple high-level mentors to protect you.  I learned this the hard way.  There are huge differences between departments.  My last one was led by a very poor leader who left the Company since then.
good,Decent place to work. Need more benifits for employees.Somtimes required lofts of overtime. Hours should be more flexible. Pays scale could be better with cost of living
good,"Es una empresa multinacional donde te tienen por un convenio que no corresponde sea produccion o en depósito y el sueldo es bajo por esto, exigen mucho a sus operarios (producción - deposito), te dicen que la empresa no hace diferencia entre sus empleados pero el transporte solo es para administrativos"
good,"Empresa com diversos benefícios para os funcionários, porém o desenvolvimento profissional é responsabilidade apenas do funcionário."
good,Manager interacted with the team very little due to their busy schedule. Team collaboration was there but no real camaraderie. Many days were monotonous work at your desk.
good,"Overall an enjoyable employer, management easy to get a long with, co-workers are friendly and helpful.  very much a family workplace culture.  co-workers."
good,"First off, the pay and time off are great.  I work 4 days on and 4 days off.  But, the training of facilitators is terrible and having to work with the union is similar to working with a bully all the time."
good,You can't go outside on breaks can't bring your phone In o don't like it the people is it disrespectful I don't care if you sick or not can't take any off days
good,For commercial roles (Director and above) only candidates who are friends of the President and/or have significant ophthalmology operating room experience should apply.
good,Poor management.  Churn and burn through employees.  Definately a chain of command and several cliques present.  Commission plan is not that great at all.
good,"Muitos projetos simultaneamente, muita burocracia, mas o espirito de equipe é bem rico."
good,"Work life balance is possible with this organisation, good work culture, supportive management, limited benefits getting, opportunities to enhance knowledge of excel."
good,"Good place to learn. Work and life balance is possible but if you are lucky, if not then there is a lot of work to do. "
good,"I've been in many teams at J&J, and this is by far the most challenging because it is the least mature. Management hasn't ironed out the details of how we should work with other teams, and amongst ourselves, which results in a lot of confusion and frustration for all parties."
good,6 days a week. first in and first out product.good relationship with co workers.helping each other.when you are in a hurry because of the demand of supply is the hardest part of it.you feel healthy because of the work nature.
good,The internship was more of a temp job. The work I did was not particularly rewarding but I guess someone had to do it. Company culture is fine and I got along well with my coworkers.
good,good work good management nice working timing good food no personal ..thing but its just a contract work .enjoying the work  live was very very exciting at work
good,they has a lot of opportunities for temporary but too much positions available for get permanent job. Good employer great benefits for permanent people.
good,"Hard Work expectation - with Long Hours."
good,"thanks for the target oriented position which led to learn many marketing skill, removed communication barriers and errors."
good,"Pour regrouper mon avis général, je dirais qu'il y a une bonne ambiance."
good,"The company is very good when it comes to work life balance and they pride themselves on that. They also often have nice perks like a gym in their buildings."
good,"good place to learn and have enjoyable time at work."
good,"R&D at J&D has been going through some time of re-org during the last ten+ years of my employment.  They are desperately seeking to offshore any and all programming work.  That said, the work-life balance is extremely accommodating, and the compensation competitive with industry averages."
good,Work can be slow some days and busy other days. Too many people managing and not enough workers. I was able to learn sales and inside sales and help improve the level of production.
good,"typical day was to have all my numbers and keep the productive line continuously running and ahead of my deadline so that when the turn over of shift I was behind I was always ahead."
good,"Beneficios normales, necesario contar con apoyo interno para poder tener promoción"

good,Elevada autonomia e responsabilização no desempenho das funções.
good,"In questi 12 anni di lavoro in Johnson ho imparato, oltre alle dinamiche lavorative di una struttura aziendale multinazionale, ad organizzare il mio tempo sulla base della pianificazione dei miei obiettivi."
good,"la mia opinione sull'Azienda è variata notevolmente nel giro di pochi mesi: ho sempre creduto che JnJ, oltre che dimostrare una solidita' strutturale ed economica invidiabile, desse ascolto e supporto al personale dipendente. "
good,"Slow paced environment, management is not aware of what is happening in the project and they do not want to know as well."
good,"Reputed excellent company, with good benefits, low pay increases and loss of benefits/merit as position was reduced from professional Field Engineer to hourly Field Specialist, now with no degree or field engineering experience requirement. "
good,"I was laid off in 2009 supposedly due to the economy. 3 months after laying us all off they hired back all temps. They don't live up to their credo at all!!! They had great benefits, but you never got any chance for advancement!!! Not true to their employees!!"
good,a typical day at work is off loading trailers. learned how to operate equipment faster. management gives no feed back. co workers looked out for them self. hardest part dealing with destroyed product. paydays
good,"My typical day is busy. I handle many issues outside my daily tasks. The balance between daily assignments and professional development is challenging. Depending on which operating company you work with view on upholding the Credo differ. Some operating companies focus on employee satisfaction, others focus more on customer and business needs. "
good,Management spouts they live by a very nice credo but violate it constantly. J&J will break any rule and law (like most businesses) they think they can get away with to drive profits - just check the headlines as to their last violation.
good,It is a good company to work for in specificy departments e.g. Sales and Marketing.
good,This is a company who doesn't know what the next step is for them.
good,Co-workers are great. Like a big family. Organization in motion is great. Promote walking meetings. Energy breaks.
good,i work for one of the biggest organistion in the world and for the past five years i feel i have contrubuted much tio the company and its time to move to new changellenges in life

good,Great company to work for I would go back without a problem the people are great management is ok and lunch was served inside a cafeteria plus if you want all the overtime you can get
good,Well I don't wanna share my personal experience I had in this company please don't force me to say I am not going to share here atleast I worked there and I got paid for that..
good,"Really it depends on the position, can be good with the right management.  Lots of good opportunities for co-ops.  One of the few companies that still has a pension, though it is not structured as it once was it does provide a lump sum of 15 percent of your salary for each year worked."
good,"Like the work culture "
good,"Bij Johnson en Johnson werk je in ploegendiensten. Wat betekent dat je nacht/waak ritme nooit constant is. Hier moet je mee kunnen omgaan. Verder zijn de werkzaamheden eenvoudig en eentonig. Wel kon je de taken onderling afwisselen, waardoor er toch enigszins variatie in zat."
good,"Johnson n Johnson company protect baby , also adults female problems also they like to do something new always into their company brand related, we are so impressed to do work."
good,good  team working skills being used workng with coworkers to meet companies expectation you gotta have good people skills and know how to work on a fast but steady paste
good,It was a A learning experience for me The people that work there with me was mean Two other workers they really didntCare about other people it was just a lot so much that was going on that shouldn’t be going on and work with
good,Too many internal processes and meetings. Too much focus on results and not enough focus on input and effort. Voice of the customer was pretty much non existent
good,"Die Gehälter werden überpünktlich bezahlt."
good,Every day at this job was normal I’ve learned allot about working in the field of lawn care. The hardest part of the job in my opinion is making a fit schedule in between my education and work.
good,Everyone works well together with one common goal. It's a very friendly environment where everyone gets along. It is very customer focused. Safety is also something that is very important here.
good,I worked at Abbott medical optics which was bought by Johnson and Johnson but I was not there when Johnson and Johnson was in place.  I can not tell you more because I was not working for Johnson and Johnson
good,"They let you work without micro managing, but are required to do a lot more work than is in your scope of work. It's not easy to become a permanent employee."
good,Esos meses fueron muy buenos aprendí demasiado fue una buena experiencia laboral
good,L'azienda è una delle più grandi e solide realtà mondiali.  Proprio per questa ragione troppo spesso soggetta a grandi stravolgimenti sebbene l'hr è sempre propensa ad ascoltare tutte le richieste e ad agire nel meglio sia dell'azienda che del lavoratore.
good,"The people are friendly. The area where I worked was not a sweatshop. There was a fair work/life balance. The employers were very good at the areas of expertise. The commute is not optimal near the New Brunswick, campus."
good,Change begins with me. A company is a company they have a culture and we have to abide by it. I truly don't have a problem there just that I need new challenges.
good,"Company prides itself on providing a good work life balance which is great, no complaints there.  Overall, if you are looking for a regular corporate job, this is it. Advancement opportunities are really only available for those who have been with the company for a long time. Hard for an outsider to come in and get in the queue."
good,"OK place to work, the amount of responsibilities in the area that i work in does not match up with the wages. Because i am a production tech, i do the same job as a process tech but not the same pay."
good,Work life balance is a little tough to achieve at times due to the company's  re-cyclical study budget dynamics. Great company and opportunities for growth.
good,"It is hard to get things to do as a coop, especially when everyone is so busy and no one has time to train you. That being said, there also seems to be too much red tape, and even responsiblities i tried to take on weren't granted to me as i was an intern."
good,I would not recommend an experienced hire to join J&J. The company culture caters to who you know for advancement rather than what you know or have accomplished. Advancement is dependent on if the right people like you.. Mission and credo are buzz words not actual practice
good,"If you are in a good performing division, it is great. If you are in a poorly performing division or an Enterprise (corporate) position, you are proving your worth every quarter and if they think your salary can be spent better elsewhere you are separated."
good,"J&J is a large company, great benefits, a lot of opportunities, and good culture.  There is a lot of amazing talent in this organization and it is a pleasure to learn from some of the individuals."

Its common stock is a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the company is ranked No. 37 on the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue."
good,"I work for the vision department in manufacturing as a contract rework processor. Not a bad environment. Repacking contact lenses, and converting lots.Big on safety. 50 minute lunches were nice and the two 20 minute breaks. Cafeteria on site and gym. Parking can be difficult due to limited number of spaces."
good,"I started my career as an employee and then went back as a contractor, after several years working elsewhere. I worked there for more than two years, but never got converted to permanent again. I know contractors who have been there for more than 5 years and never get converted to permanent. Supposedly, there is a two year cap, but they bend the rules depending on whether or not they want to keep the person. I can't speak to what it's like on the permanent side; the people are generally professional and nice. But no, it wasn't a good experience for me as a contractor."
good,"Good starter company to consider. Great medical benefits, work/life balance. Prefers to hire from within or by referral. Multiple locations in every state."
good,De réelles difficultés à obtenir les outils de travail nécessaire au Job
good,Even though GPSG was somewhat isolated from the main company the core values of the main company still remained to be true.  They had a work and family policy and there was individual development provided to each employee and you had somewhat of a sense of job security.  It was fast pace and it was forever changing i.e. policy and procedures.
good,"It was very busy, you are standing all day and get two breaks. The first break is fifteen minutes and the second break is thirty minutes. During break, it is very crowded so the break is shorter than expected."
good,Worked there for 3 months at a satellite company of Johnson and Johnson making phone calls to set up meetings for outside medical device sales representatives.
good,"I have learned much about computer system validation from SAP systems, to manufacturing systems to Websites.  I look to put that knowledge to work elsewhere."
good,"I was hired by a smaller medical device company that J&J then purchased.  The environment was better prior to the acquisition.  I was promoting a new minimally invasive technology to ENT doctors, training them on that technology, and supporting them during the surgeries.  Management at J&J I found to be disengaged.  Additionally, there were many marketing programs and trainings that I felt were very beneficial to the doctors practices that J&J discontinued.  "
good,"Enjoyed working at JnJ. Employees were able to take their pets to work. Working from home was a treat. For some reason, the director of the department did not have such a delightful manner, always upset and screaming at employees."
good,"The company focuses on the young employees, most contractors are in their middle age."
good,"Johnson & Johnson is a good company, addressing the times we live in today.  The Company is not set up to monitor negative cultural trends. Management has a bent towards old ideas regarding what is comfortable to work with, preconceived expectations of people and management styles."
good,"Good communication among all staff."
good,J&J is great depending on how well you network. This is the only company I know where you can have a high school diploma and make more than someone with a MBA because of who you know.  They need to figure this out before they get sued.
good,You have to make it what  you want it to be because things are not what they seem to be. Its not the company that make it a bad place it always tend to be the PEOPLE
good,"Was working like a temp employed in different field QA laboratory, assembling line, Dispensing area,we don't have overtime just 40 hours a week and we have a regular environment."
good,"When you come in to work first thing we had to do was exercise and stretch, after putting lunch and other personal items in the locker. Afterwards, we go to our assign line, log in and begin to work. There is no hard part to the job, you just have to pay attention. The most enjoyable part of the job were the co-workers they are nice, polite, and willing to help, including the management. I enjoyed the fact the manager didn't mine helping when we behind on workers. When work finish we clean our area and leave."
good,overall a great organization where the credo is instilled as a guiding principle for all employees. There are some inherent challenges as in any organization however overall a great place to work.
good,I will not be providing any information or opinions about any employment roles I have held. I did not come to Indeed to provide data for your to later sell.
good,Time consuming work practices. Too many chiefs. Not enough Indians. Compensation is on the lower end of pharmaceutical industry. Changes in process are slow.
good,Perform the best you can is all that is asked.  If you cannot produce effectively for any reason you will be asked to move on.  The work you do is important to the rest of the team.
good,"J&J can provide stability in your career and has great benefits. Not a lot of opportunity to move up on the science side, more on the engineering side."

good,"Excelentes beneficios, grato ambiente, excelentes  profesionales."
good,"Large corporation undergoing much needed change."
good,"Micro-managers come to mind and a cut-throat environment. Promotions are only good for those who say all the right words and look the part. The company promotes diversity, which is great.  I think some of the senior managers that have been there a long time may not like it but like the benefits and retirement matching incentives."
good,Joseph Joseph was a very rewarding company to work for. If your looking for a fast past environment then this is the place for you. The most enjoyable part of the job is liaising with the various department there.
good,Geralmente empresas grandes tem pouca rapidez em decisoes. A J&J nao é diferente.

good,"En general todo bien, aunque no estaba muy bien llevado."
good,nice place to work. work culture is good. management is fine. I have learned a lot. The hardest part f the work is stress. The most enjoyable part of the work is people.
good,J&J is a great company name with brands which are awesome! I love  most of the people here however in a competitive field be careful as event your manager will cut your throat as the power of the home office can end your career in a whisper based upon perceptions not reality. If you can stay in favor ... BULLY Good. if not keep your resume ready as this organization is afraid of success from those people which are not home grown.
good,"I do not want to write anything about the Johnson & Johnson, this is a very diverse company, all operates differently, good medical place to work at,nothing negative to say."
good,Big pharma where reps had little control over their paycheck.  Im sure things have changed since 2005.  Not sure how the environment has changed. Small pharma is better for me.
good,"So I come into work on morning and everyday does vary of what we do. Sometimes we are quiet and are able to get on with orders. Other days were are very busy and can spend most of the time serving customers. we do other tasks of putting the stock on the system, filling the front shelf, making baskets up and doing displays. Fridays are the days we get our delivery and get it put away."

good,"Normal 8hrs work life"
good,Love that they stick to the JNJ Credo.  Only problem is the company has an old time feel and did not embrace the bay area and the faster moving environment.  Very East Coast centered company.
good,Nice place to work. Enjoyed my term here. Made lots of friends. Work is cool and no pushy at all from management. You will learn a lot depending on which project you work.
good,"Management needs more experience, since they seem to be lacking in skill and experience. The recruitment of talent should be more precise, since they hire people with different skill set for a certain position. The pay structure is not fair either since they give too different salaries for the same position."
good,"-Typical work would involve developing a testing plan and performing screening experiments to test specific polymers"
good,"Very experienced seniors who help us in understanding concepts and lab work. I was fortunate to work with them and pay is also good."

good,Other than the seemingly semi-annual layoffs in the pharmaceutical Sales Divisions the organization was pretty good with benefits and corporate communication.
good,So far the people at this site have been very kind and generous to me as a new hire.  The organization chart is way crazy as there are no straight lines.  The report to's can be half way around the world so trying to organize meetings can be trying.
good,I worked here so long ago that I dont really remember it.  I feel that my review would not be indicative of what is going on in this day and age.  It was a great place to work
good,They were so mean an horrible. They never wanted to take breaks. Got mad when you slowed down or stay at cooler to long. They didn't know how to treat there workers . Then they never liked to pay right.

good,Exciting company with great employees and culture. Well paying and respectful to all. Strong management team and strong human resources. Very team oriented
good,"The Procurement Leadership Development Program is a great place to learn procurement and to work with like-minded high achievers. However, it's easy to get pigeon-holder at J&J and there is a lot of waiting for others to move so you can move up the ladder. It's also very hard to move out of Procurement."
good,Focus on managing your career rather than moving the enterprise forward. I.e looking out for oneself rather that the enterprise. Individual rather than team.
good,"Started as an intern working in the IT field. I learned a lot about Imagining computers, server backup, creating and maintaining servers, and most importantly how to assist users with their issues."
good,"J&J was a very strict environment. It was very corporate in terms of culture and attitude. The coworkers were all very intelligent, so I learned a lot as an intern here."

good,"Good company culture and work/life balance. However management structure too matrix. "

good,"-wonderful company"
good,"Working in a Global company like Johnson & Johnson has always been encouraging and challenging. The environment is very dynamic and fast paced. Working with different cross functional teams and cross cultural group has always been interesting, different perspectives with same goal helps in overcoming challenges at a faster rate. To me our Credo is very important and I believe my first responsibility towards consumer satisfaction and being in a Quality department I strongly take the responsibility of following the regulatory guidelines to achieve highest quality products.The hardest part of the job is to work under a bureaucratic environment."

good,Working with J&J has been a great experience. The management is very understanding and flexible.
good,"Working for JNJ has been very rewarding with leaders offering opportunities to grow and develop within different geographies and roles.

When first starting a typical day looked like measuring plastic on a variety of qualitative and quantitative instruments. Now I work with all the requestors and manage hundreds of requests that come through the laboratory, as well as still measuring. I also delegate requests to my peers and review the data. Also taking on projects like writing procedures for new equipment and constructing a format for all requests to be submitted, organized and returned. The hardest part of the job is the change of priority at a moments notice. The most enjoyable part is working with a light hearted group of people. As a temporary employee I am limited by my time there and that is possibly the most difficult aspect."

good,Unbelievable opportunity to learn and grow in a safe and fast paced work environment. What you learn at JNJ is valued by everyone else! Some of the best people I know work at JNJ. The hardest part of the job is finding away to get your ideas across in a politically charged environment and risk adverse culture. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that what you are doing every day is ultimately helping patients lead better lives.
good,Great company to work for
good,I was a long term contractor. They treated me like one of their own without having to pay benefits or any overhead. Aggressive Corporate Strategy.
good,A good place to work with decent colleagues and managers but the scope for progression is competitive and opportunities are at a minimum. JnJ have a very structured system which makes it difficult to allow for change.

good,"I have worked for Johnson and Johnson as a student and a full time employee. When Ethicon first began as a company, they were breaking ground in laproscopic surgical care. Today, i believe they fail to innovate and outpace competitors. The strong focus on patents and securing future product lines has led to stale, derivative product design."
good,"My manager was great, but they've since farmed off most of the customer service out-country.  Some odd quirks: fostered a culture of secrecy by promoting hiding information from internal and external auditors."

Cuando se inicia la jornada laboral y se empiezan a  visitar los profesionales transmiten que no es una vista de las tantas no tradicional, el mensaje es diferente y deja huella en sentir un tipo de comunicación diferente y lo respalda su material y productos originales. Lo que más me gusta de mi trabajo es la tranquilidad para cumplir con mis objetivos porque conoce mi trabajo y creen en mi. Durante este tiempo he desarrolla habilidades personales que me fortalecen en conocer que soy capaz de todo lo que me proponga. La parte más difícil del trabajo son los traslados para el cumplimiento de citas y cobertura que lo limita el tráfico."
good,"bonne ambiance en générale, cadre proche de ces employé. possibilité de formation sur divers poste d'opérateur, opportunité d'une polyvalence"
good,"overall a very  good place to work, the job itself was satisfying and the staff and co workers were friendly and supportive of new people arriving. however  the main reason i would like to leave is because its a very long drive and quite hazardous in the frosty mornings. Im also on a short term contract with no benefits."
good,"I would travel to nursing homes and doctors offices and discuss with the medical staff the approved company algorithms and the proper way to titrate doses, or the time it was appropriate to refer to the doctor. I learned a lot of professionalism on this job. I worked with a very patient and pleasant manager. The harder part of the job was the constant travel from site to site or office staff mistreating you as representative. The most enjoyable part was the excellent benefits and the pay.

good,I was able to advance at this job however the low compensation and benefit package was not up to par. 
good,"This would be a great place to work, but the people with the experience and make the greatest contribution to the company are not recognized or given the oppotuniy for advancement. This company put so much emphasis on degrees rather than experiene, that they pass over som well qualified candidates already working for them. If you have a bachelors or masters degree, it doesn't matter in what you will go far with this company....no experience necessary."
good,"Benefits and work life balance at Johnson & Johnson are great. advancement opportunities needs tremendous improvement. As with most organizations advancement only occurs when you know someone. However, Overall, J&J is a prestigious, fortune 500 place to work."
good,"I worked for J&J in the UK on a project that was so badly managed it was laughable, except that I was hired to clean it up and put it back on track. That task would have been easier without the constant interference and rude, caustic, behavior of the IT manager. I have never heard such language used in the work place and I've been in IT for 30 years - hard core bleeding edge stuff too, and mostly male coworkers. Shocking because it was targeted at really great staff members and not an inanimate object. He tried to bully me once by asking me if my mother had dropped me on my head...until I calmly pointed out that he was on the wrong slide for the current discussion. He left me alone because he could not rattle me. You get the idea. I do not think that this is the norm at J&J, but HR was aware of his tirades and the hostility. He was actually ""attacked"" in the parking garage and shoved head first into a trash barrel and left there by his staff. They told me this as a point of pride. Other areas in the EMEA space were much better organized and nicer, but still a bit of a Luddite culture considering the resources. Job finished on time. Happy for the contract to end."

good,"It's a great place to start a career, you will get great experience that will help in the future. Sadly im only a contractor, I get to set up new hires all the time and watch them convert to J&J employee just 2 weeks after starting. This creates an undeniable divide between the kind of experience that you will have. Its not the flaw of the people, its the flaw of the nonexistant management hierarchical communication  which yields a severe deficiency of quality control  being strictly enforced. The employee culture is great, some of the most interesting people you'll ever meet work at J&J. Usually people with very high skill level in performing certain roles. At the minimum, employees have the very least associates degree but mostly employees have bachelor's, with a good amount of people with Masters and PhD degrees. Despite the level of differences between some people that exists, it is invisible to the eye when working with others, people are always helpful and usually politely greet other people when passing in the hallways even if they never met before."

good,Working with Johnson and Johnson was an experience that I will remember for a long time. We got an ok amount of paid off days. Uses a lot of medicine.
good,Environment didn't lend itself to a lot of fun. There were way too many meetings during the course of a week. Some of the managers seemed to be responsible for more projects than they could handle.
good,Johnson & Johnson is a great company form my experience while working there for a year plus. The Data Center is enterprise level. Johnson & Johnson is fast paced and as an Engineer you are involved in may projects simultaneously.....
good,"Empresa com histórico e valores seculares, porem com gestores que distorcem estes valores. Otimos benefícios e grande empresa para construir carreira."

good,"There are still smart people at JJSV, but there has been a general egress of the best minds to startups.  Benefits are great and its a company with a pension!  J&J is supportive of new parents and work/life balance, but this particular division has a culture problem... too many cancelled projects, cutting corners on products destined for use on humans.  Excellence has taken a backseat to meeting deadlines, which I believe is the real reason for the death stench in the building.  How proud can you on that team?"
good,"Positive experience working at this company. Overall, experienced a good workplace culture and work/life balance. Encouraged to take on increased responsibility supported by management."
good,Good environment and quite friendly atmosphere of working in Johnson & Johnson..seniors helped me a lot to my mistakes at my first working stage and helped me to recover my mistakes
good,I worked at an aquired division so the culture wasn't J&J per se. Therefore the rating is probably lower than it would be for say the J&J corporate office. I did workwit  some people from that area of the company and saw a clear difference. So my rating is a kind of blend between J&J and the newly aquired division.
good,"Traditional but reasonable management"
good,"This place can be a job where you can all ""home"" due to the people you work with and the environment. J&J actually has hired contractors through Kelly Services (majority of the employees). So it can be pretty difficult to advance/transition to another role. In fact, it could take years especially since they like to outsource."
good,"Good place to work, but a lot of corporate politics from leadership.  Every department within the company has different corporate cultures and it is tough to advance within your department."
good,"Colleagues:"
good,I did my summer placement here and it was great fun. The employee discounts are great and team building activities are good. The teams are lean and productive.
good,"Like in any large company, there are pockets of good and pockets of bad.  The good far outweigh the bad and a much more frequent.  Most of the people genuinely care about others.  You are the master of your career and you alone; leadership does little to advance you.  J&J is so big that you can work there for 20 years and have 6 or 7 different jobs."
good,"Work at J & J for a short duration. A brief assignment, due to Manager coming back from maternity leave. However, corporate culture was good ! Flexibility in work schedule, team environment, relaxed dress code."

good,"Was a fantastic place to work. Long hours and you will attend many meetings."
good,Good. Well balanced. Nice workplace culture. The most enjoyable part is interaction with different teams. There was always something new to learn every day.
good,There was a very heavy volume of calls.  For the most part our calls were related to redirecting unsatisfied customers to the correct person needed.   Following up on the various complaints accordingly to administer the best solutions needed to resolve thins in a professional manner.  The calls were automatically dropped from line to line not to miss or drop calls at any time..
good,Was able to meeting interesting people. Learning about the development of new building materials and how they are used. Able to show up at work in the morning and have a steady job routine outlined for the day.

good,"The whole experience was very beneficial to the college course, Industrial automation and robotics. We were given a hands on taste of the type of work required of you in Industry. Met production goals, repaired machine running problems quickly and efficiently. The hours were fine, but switching from days to night month after month was difficult at times."
good,"Many branches in many states, especially New Jersey. Work locations could vary but remote work was preferred due to security issues. Micro managed but understood the reasoning."
good,Management only looks up.  It is filled with folks who come to work to advance their careers.  The working people make the products and know what is going on.  Management generally doesn't have a clue.
good,"The work atmosphere was good, with the understanding that well more than 40 hours a week was expected.  The group to which I was assigned had a lot of issues with the work load and balance of priorities, which ultimately lay at the feet of the manager. I did what I could to help remedy this, but much of it was beyond my scope as a contractor."
good,"Enginering department was very small, but there were a lot of technical resources and equipment available. Very corporate and structured company. Overall, good learning experience"
good,I was responsible for the temporary workforce at J & J. I handled work hours and issues with the temporaries. I was only here for a few months because that area of the company was shutting down.
good,"Overall great company."
good,"a typical work day was from 6am to 6pm 4 days a week which was not all back to back. The management was OK they would help if they were available, most of the time they were hard to find for help. The most enjoyable part of the job was the great employee and the attitude to get the job done no matter how hard the task maybe."
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo donde aprendimos a usar el programa SAP para poder realizar todas las tareas que teníamos que llevar a cabo.

good,"Typical day at work was getting in my gown, cap, and booties ready to package screws. I learned a lot while being there, wish i was still there but its okay. Management though kinda sucked, sorry."
good,Pour acquérir de expérience c'est idéale.Belle expérience
good,"•     Initiate and execute testing as per test methods and protocols to meet required deadlines. "
good,Empresa con buen ambiente de trabajo y buena compensación
good,Me encanto trabajar en J&J. Si fuera por mi aun estaría ahí. Es el mejor lugar para trabajar y Crecer. Fueron 20 años en los que aprendí mucho de los procesos y del área de Calidad. Pasamos por momentos buenos y otros no tantos. Pero los atesoro todos.
good,"It all really depends on your team. I was involved with many people leaving my team and I was able to witness an amazing team, go to an absent one. Management and your immediate teammates are people whom you may be around all the time. Lots of autonomy, but there CAN be a lot of micromanagement as well, all depends on your team😬 the team dictates the culture way more  than the supposed “Credo” does."
good,"Friendly environment and good work culture."
good,"Since I worked for a temp service, there was a lack of communication between the temp service and management. The supervisor was the temp agent, not the plant manager or plant supervisor. If you had to ask for time off you had to ask all three and wait for a response. The plant supervisor never reported issue that the temp agent had with attendant or your work in general. Very hard work and very little change in position. Have to stand on your feel up to 8 hours."
good,"Johnson & Johnson has a lot of great benefits for employees.  It offers work/life balance, diversity and inclusion.   Great work environment.  Work with talented colleagues."
good,Good culture at work.Everyday we learned a new things and try to solve it at team.Management still new and still lack to make a firm decission.We gone through everyday with a new problem and try to contain it as best as we can.The part of work friend and the co worker very understood.
good,Manufacturing environment is fast and stressful.  Finding work/life balance is tough while meeting expectations.  Worked with a lot of great people that truly care about meeting customer expectations.
good,"Overall a good place to work, people are great.  Decent benefits and good pay. The training process is very good and extensive. The work is fast paced and always interesting."
good,J&J is a great company with good people to work with.  The leadership is highly transitional.  Reorgs happen every 2-3 years resulting in undue stress for employees and concerns about job security. Advancement is all about who you know.  Moving to other roles is nearly impossible if you do not know the hiring manager.
good,"Empresa dinâmica, e inspiradora. Infelizmente vem perdendo bons profissionais, pois não valoriza as competências e sim coleguismo."
good,J&J is a good company to work for however I feel that I was there at the wrong time. There was a lot fo staff turnover and uncertainty which filtered through the organisation and career progression was tough
good,Great opportunity for international experience. Larged variation (management) from one operating company to another. Many impacts as J&J acquires and divests companies and products.
good,J&J was a good company to work for. They do value their employees and offer some great benefit and perks. They promote a work/life balance by offering a flexible schedule and work from home opportunities.
good,I love working for this company I enjoy the overtime I get and the coworkers. They do great cookouts for us when they can.  My manager is great as he was able to accommodate my work restrictions after surgery.
good,"Stayed busy all day, nice people to work with . worked for temp agency so no paid days off no benefits. learned new skills and new machine operations."
good,Big company but decentralized. Each business has its autonomy. Good culture but not easy to be promoted. Good benefits overall. Provide work life balance.
good,"Overall, a nice place to work and to take initiative for things you might want to see happen.  But these won't taken into account for advancement; which is substantially more contingent on networking and personal promotion efforts."
good,"A great place to work, however, the management is in the downsizing mode since last 10 years (!) and hence, lot of insecurity and instability. "
good,"Meu trabalho era muito dinâmico, ficava em contato direto com médicos e enfermeiros de centro cirúrgico. Acompanhava cirurgias para operar equipamento Ultrassônico."
good,I was a great worker just it was a job to keep but I hired on threw a temp service I like how they treated u If u lacked in a area they will help you out and not judge
good,I worked through a temporary agency and if it wasn't for that I would be with them today.  Then the sell out to Genco happened and that prevented me from becoming full time.
good,"Work for Johnson and Johnson gives you lots of opportunity to learn in terms of technically."
good,"I loved what I was doing,"
good,"Note: Key Local Management was great, except for the new Site Lead, who was relentless on removing all the older staff, even if they where fully dedicated and willing to be a part of the solution."
good,"It is a good place to work in, however the rapid & continuous changes are somewhat distracting. Overall, it is a good place to work with good benefit & package."
good,"Flexible with good training, career and promotions were difficult to advance attain unless you relocated. Benefits were decent as were sales tools. Targeting was arbitrary and did not allow for much on the local side."
good,It's pleasure working in Johnson & Johnson. I learned a lot from this multinational company. I enjoyed moving from position to position and wining market share in different regions through my last 11 years in the company.
good,"Vistakon was a great job with great benefits. It required working in a setting.  We were required to run different lines that we were assigned to, to package contact lenses with a nightly set goal. Our job also requires troubleshooting so if there were any areas that required maintenance we were able to fix it.  This job required to work a 12 hour shift  from 6am-6pm or 6pm-6am."
good,"The company truly promotes work/life balance, diversity, etc. but if your management doesn't than the team doesn't get any of those benefits.  The company takes a long time to fill openings creating a lot of employees carrying the load of multiple roles."
good,"tolerencia, comprension, estabilidad laboral, calidad humana"
good,The program only works if you are placed on a team that will require a full-time spot soon. Most teams are not in that situation which causes a lot of co-ops not to feel like an asset.
good,"It was not really sales to me, but after having a child, I did not want to travel so it was good position.  I was not used to the Pharmaceutical Industry and found it to be a bit redundant and you would be talking about the same product to the same doctors week after week.  With no new studies or information on the product. The company is an excellent company, I just wish I had gotten in at a different time as the product went generic the second year I was with the company and had been out there for years.  As soon as they go generic they no longer use a sales force in the product line."
good,"At J&J, the Credo dictated what you did and how you did it. It made sure everyone was accounted for from customers, doctors and nurses, employees, and stakeholders. The work I did in software engineering was at the forefront of healthcare technology. The teams I worked on had an amazing culture where work/life balance was very important. Everyone wanted you to succeed and helped out as much as possible. I think the hardest part of the job was being younger talent. Management didn't always realize the need to develop young talent and understand how needs/opinions differed. It was hard to get management to see how times were changing and introduce new ideas."
good,Leadership at Corporate level at Johnson & Johnson have a laid out a great credo document to provide inspirational direction for the current management team. The tenets of the credo are followed to varying degree at various operating companies and shared services depending on the leadership at each site/facility/department.
good,Como ponto positivo a empresa oferecia capacitações.
good,"I enjoyed my time at J&J overall. I learned a great dial with respect to sales training & sales management, and continue drawing from that experience."
good,"Hardest part- had to fit job description of 3 people into the workload of one person daily"
good,"The medical devices division within Johnson and Johnson is a very well constructed operation. Due to the severity of the nature of the business, employees become less success able to move on to other companies that are more volatile."
good,"It provides the opportunity to learn and expand your knowledge,  how ever the growing opportunity are limited. Teams are great, people get along well. "
good,"Overall, a great company to work for.  Depending on which organization or business you work in (Pharma, Medical Devices, or Consumer), experiences in leadership, management, vision, talent acquisition/development, and business performance will vary greatly.  Each of the business sectors seem to have somewhat different styles of operating and risk taking affinity."
good,Lo que aprendi fue adquirir gran experiencia y buen trato humano.
good,"La empresa johnson y johnson me dio la oportunidad de trabajar y aprender su sistema de trabajo pero sobretodo daban la oportunidad de plantear soluciones a los problemas cotidianos de la empresa."
good,"Je réceptionne les marchandises, les range. Dans un autre service, on préparait les commandes pour les envoyer aux différents clients."
good,"Although the job was stressful, the people were great and fun to work with.  for the most part, management was very good and helpful.  Too many hours were required, at times, and this led to low moral among the employees."
good,Great temp agency that gives young people opportunities with not that much experience. also gives new employees time to train and get to know the job. Great staff and good pay for just a temp.
good,"Here I learned how to work in MNC and to maintain a balance between different departments.How to make compliance with documents and validation process."
good,"Being in operation theatre with Surgeons and lot of opportunity to learn new things"
good,"Enjoyed many years here. Unfortunately, the plant was closing, and we were all made redundant. If this hadn't happened I would not have moved until I was ready to retire"
good,Good place to make money although shift work becomes draining after extended work period. The ability to work shifts is not for everyone as it limits involvement in sports
good,"Johnson & Johnson is a good place to work with fair compensaion and work life balance.  Moving throughout the company can be challenging, as each site seems to function as an independent entity."
good,"they are really heading in the correct direction, I got caught up in a reorg but i still cant say enough about working for such a great company.  i would and have recommended this company to others."
good,"Otima empresa, com ótimo produtos, porem o ambiente de trabalho é pesado e bastante competitivo."
good,"JNJ  Medical India is a highly well organized company with so many portfolios and vast man power to rule the market."
good,"Ambiente de trabajo agradable, con una organización chata y no piramidal."
good,"gran aprendizaje y una formación tierna a punta de bebes."
good,"Excelente en empresa , muy sujeta a cambios continuos."
good,"The people were professional and wonderful to work with.  However, they constantly reorganize and lay-off which makes it chaotic.  The scope of the job constantly changes.  You need to be flexible to work here and have a sense of humor."
good,Very nice facility. Good benefits including a health and wellness program.  Many jobs to move into if you continue your education.
good,Johnson & Johnson was a great company with good benefits.  I had good managers who were able to introduce me to pharmaceutical sales and learning the industry.
good,"La empresa nos capacitaba constantemente con cada producto que saca , nos proporcionaba uniformes cada cambio de estación, siempre estaba pendientes de nuestros requerimientos"
good,"It's a great company, with great people. Has a strong culture based on leadership imperatives (connect, shape, lead, deliver) and with a very strong focus on our credo. Working at JNJ is exciting, motivational and challenging so it worth our engagement."

good,"Excelente empresa, con muy buena organización y ambiente laboral,."
good,Productive area with great benefits but not alot of room for advancement. Learned many skills while there and was a very stable source of work.
good,"Long hours, 12 hour shifts, month of days then month of night."
good,typical day at work.the hardest part of the job always you have  to be altert. good atomsfeer. you work in international company with people from different nationalities.
good,"Depending on the department you work in, it can go either way.  Many excellent managers that do not micro manage.  Sales side of the company is extremely competitive."
good,"Productive environment, onsite benefits such as cafeteria, gym and store. And flexible hours but management tends to care only for themselves. Great co-workers. The hardest part of the job is there was not permanent seating; seating must be reserve via PC every couple days."
good,"cada dia se encuentra con gran variedad de clientes "
good,"Great company for the right people.  If you're older and/or not in a marketing or finance track, your career growth opportunities are limited at best."
good,Johnson and Johnson Pacific had a Good work/life balance that was Credo based. Working in the field or office I found the staff to be friendly and passionate in every aspect.
good,Excellent sales experience to be involved in the rapidly changing medical environment. Learning to change and adapt has been beneficial.

good,"my position at Johnson and Johnson is great,"
good,"The working environment is good, fast pace, requirement active team membership, get to learn the new skills and knowledge about new processes."
good,"I liked J & J almost as much as Titan Systems.  The main reason for this is that I was given opportunities to grow and learn as time went on.  I was a contract worker there but even though I started as a technician, I had a degree in the sciences and my investigative work as a testing technician led to me being promoted to a software engineer.  The position increase and pay raise was the largest jump I have ever had in my life.  Also, I learned so many different things as my responsibilities from internal job positions changed and progressed through the almost 4 years I was there.  Great Job and Great Learning and nice folks to work with!!!"
good,"Visitar Clientes- profesionales, eduacion continua en prevencion, cumplimiento de objetivos, respaldo cientifico de la marca."
good,"Johnson and Johnson provided me with a strong supply chain foundation that I was able to build on over the last 5 years.  I was required to be a leader and accepted the task with true pleasure."
good,I really enjoyed working for J&J. There was so much opportunity in the company as well as great mentorship available. Affinity groups were very active as well which helped with easing new employees into the organization.
good,It is indeed a great place to work. There are plenty of opportunities to interact with employees from different areas. I was part of the Orthopedic Manufacturing site and it was a pleasure to work with people who were knowledgeable about processes. It could be certainly improved if remediation approach can be less centralized and individual site management is empowered to make major decisions. It certainly provides great opportunities to grow but it can be very hard to move internally to different departments. The management has some of the best talent in medical device industry at their disposal and with right type of direction the company still has potential to grow much further.
good,Empresa que oferece desafios e desenvolvimento.  Muito ética e com valores organizacionais fortes.  Uma ótima empresa para se trabalhar.  Ambiente de trabalho agradável e pessoas que gostam do que fazem e engajadas com a empresa.

good,Empresa con gran foco en el marketing y cuidado de las personas
good,"Lots to learn and do - but so little time.  Lots and lots of meetings."
good,My supervisors and managers were highly motivational and provided open lines of communication. Everyone was held accountable for the quality of their work and responsibility was fostered not only for one's self but also for co-workers. Most tasks can be done individually but team sessions were very helpful. The job i had was quite demanding of my time but also taught me to have pride in my work.
good,A great place to come into work everyday. Employees work very hard but it is a fun and exciting environment to be a part of.
good,"L’équipe est une équipe très agréable, que tout le monde la veut, ayant la diversité de cultures. Les collaborateurs sont très professionnel ayant aussi le coté humain ."
good,Very challenging environment and conditions change on a daily basis.I learned to respect people and engage in good teamwork. Value people in the workplace for what they produce. Hardest part of job is to work with casuals when production is suspended and they have to go home because of production requirements. I enjoy working with people and a challlenge is always welcome because when its solved one feels a sense of satisfaction in what you have achieved.
good,a company which follows the credo and code of ethics with great products
good,Nice people to work with and love selling best products ever

good,"Excellent workplace w/ positive and energetic team players.  I enjoyed all aspects of my job; however, up until the last 1 1/2 in the Company, it became very hard to work with my manager, whom no one seemed to like because of his negative attitude.  (Note: He was previously employed w/ J&J as the VP of Due Diligence, but eventually rehired as the Sen. Director, Toxicology Dept.)"
good,"Provided delivery of hazmat chemicals to the various laboratories on the Johnson and Johnson campus"

good,Working with company was at time difficult but the overall results were very rewarding.
good,"Não tinha muito a se reclamar, mas o único problema era o supervisor da época, uma pessoa muito problemática, estressante de se trabalhar e que mais me atrapalhava do que me ajudava, e que inventava reunião todas as semanas para estressar mais a sua equipe, e que foi demitido por reclamações da equipe, liderados por mim, mas que me demitiu quando descobriu."
good,Allowed to gain experience in multiple sectors. High level of ethical standards and integrity in promotion of products.
good,"Era muito bom, tinha um bom salario compativel com o mercado, refeição de primeira qualidade e boa estruturas para seus funcionários, mas não sabendo como aproveitar seus talentos dentro da empresa."
good,"Despite some changes, it is an exciting company to work for. There is a lot of room for creativity. However, some recent changes have made it a less forgiving environment."

good,"Too much change makes it difficult to align and execute on strategies, create a solid network and gain the needed support to move up in your career.  At this point the area that I'm in is very unstable."
good,"Nice place to work, when the weather was bad, we could work from home. Would still be there now, except the company was restructuring and temps were reduced."
good,Johnson and Johnson is a good company when it come to gaining experience and you get to find exposure in different fields. Sometimes we even get to work overtime when the company needs to meet the target.
good,The work environment is challenging. Departments are always expected to do more with less. Loyalty and experience are not always valued. Recent trend toward focus on cost over quality.
good,"Great places to get started in medical devices. J&J provided excellent benefits, car and phone packages, ability to grow within the company and much much more.  Plenty of opportunity to travel to conferences and learn more about the sales cycle and the long list of products that J&J has to offer in the medical device world."

good,"Great place to work and benefits. Although the position I applied for was more like a project coordinator than official PM, learning the different departments and global teams was challenging."
good,"I worked in the New Brunswick location first and I love it. Great position, great management, and flexible working conditions. Then I moved to the Raritan location and was unpleasantly surprised at the contrast of the environment. Terrible management, sufficient position but strict working schedule. It's a good company but I believe each location has their own culture. Depending on where you work you either fit in or you don't."
good,The golden age of the mega brand is coming to an end and new business models/strategies aren’t coming easy to management here. It’s going to be a painful evolution.
good,"Excelente empresa para trabajar, con buenos beneficios, con un ambiente siempre desafiador, competitivo, pero con reconocimiento de los lideres."

good,I interned with the Immunology Research and Development department's internal communications team. Everyone from the director to the scientists to the outsourced team were really supportive of each other and always made sure I was learning.
good,"J&J is a great place to work especially if you are full time employee. As a contractor, I felt the pay was somewhat low considering the great value of the company, its products, and the work involved.  For the most part, I felt included in decisions, socializing, etc., just like a regular employee.  "
good,Large company with unlimited internal growth potential. Can be bureaucratic and impenetrable at times . Requires good internal negotiation skills. Sometimes dominated by herd mentality. Original thinking not always praised.
good,"The pay and benefits are incredible here. You wont find another organization like this in the same field but it is very difficult to have your voice heard and actively make changes. Getting promoted takes years and the performance management isn't realistic, management has cookie cutter responses for everyone which is disappointing as an over achiever."
good,The most enjoyable part is the workplace culture are healthy and proactive. Cross functioning department are engaging daily on the assign task. I have learn a lot of new thing and Technic of problem solving and etc.
good,"Ótimo ambiente de trabalho, estrutura muito boa de segurança e desenvolvimento constante da cultura de segurança."

The guys that i work for are good people. I wouldn't mind working for them again. Its very cultured which i liked alot. I didnt find no part of that job hard. I enjoyed the guys that worked beside me the most.

good,I worked for Abbott but was acquired by JnJ Vision. The benefits and culture at Abbott was better than JnJ. Overall the company adheres to its Credo and is a strong ethical company
good,"Working at J&J is incredibly challenging but that is also what makes it  so rewarding.  The Consumer Healthcare Division has a broad portfolio of products and services which make for great variety in the advertising and other matters to handle which provides opportunities to grow and learn.  However, there is no real line of succession for a law clerk within this organization which is partly why I left."
good,"The culture and work environment at J&J has changed, since I worked at McNeil.  The McNeil Consumer & Specialty Pharmaceutical Sales Division no longer exists.  McNeil exists, merged with another Division of Johnson & Johnson.  I thoroughly enjoyed working for McNeil.  I had a GREAT District Manager, and was Blessed to be part of a 'Winning Team' with a Winning Attitude."

good,12 hour days are tough on family life. Work was interesting and you were quite busy all the time whether running a machine or inspecting the parts. There was always something to do and you were expected to keep busy.  Their was opportunity to go to different jobs by posting for them and getting interviewed. Its a good company to work for.

good,Poste très intéressant dans un contexte global et à très forte complexité.
good,"J&J is a company you must consider if it is an option for you.  It has enormous benefits and pays well.  Just as importantly, it has an internal culture of accountability to customers, patients, each other. and a credo that has served us well for many years.  If you speak to anyone with sizable holdings in stocks, they will tell you they always keep some J&J in their portfolio.  This shows that accountability can actually pay off in the business world."
good,I only work for JNJHCS so I am not sure if I can fairly comment on Johnson & Johnson as a work place.  I would love to back to Johnson & Johnson and work in a different division /group.
good,great place to work. love coming home and not being so tired. great people love the people that i work with clean environment  and love my managers. just a overall great place

good,"Basically everything you read about it is true.  Great work life balance, benefits are good.  Top line management is fantastic.  Stock is soaring.  Middle management not so great but that is very specific to the site where you work and job that you do."
good,"The company is one of the best to work for but recently has lost sight of following their credo."
good,The senior leadership gives the impression of being top notch but the middle and lower management leases something to be desired.  This is just speaking about one division of a large company so over all J&J should be a good company to work for.
good,it's a great company to work for; depending on the division and immediate upper management the job could be stressful and would need proactive career planning on the part of the employee
good,"its a great place to work, it was fun ,learning new things about the company ,management was ok ...the pay rate was ok and had to work overtime was a big plus"
good,"Management is reactive to issues rather than proactive, constantly putting fires out versus getting to the root cause. Behind in technology and system upgrades. Work/Life balance is not openly encouraged."
good,"I love and enjoy worked here."
good,Good job but no place for advancement it's just a contract of 2 years. There should be more chances for people to become permanent with benefits. You waste more time training new people all the time.
good,Gran empresa con un grato ambiente de trabajo en busca de objetivos reales con el fin de consolidarse en el mercado.

good,The office was very welcoming to the new interns and made the work day very enjoyable. Had a great time working in the state of the art corporate offices.

good,"Starting this job without a Chem/Bio Degree was a bit challenging, but with the help of my coworkers and manager, I was able to learn a lot over the course of 4 years. I have been able to move up in my position and gain more responsibilities and projects to manage. A typical day consists of talking to our global partners and maintaining our specifications up to code with standard operating procedures."
good,I really enjoyed working at J&J for my first 3.5 years. Lately management has made changes to target certain talented people to leave which I feel is very unfair.

good,"Very stressful environment. "

The management team is open to new ideas and willing to work with you.  Co-workers are great to work with.  I enjoyed working with them.  The hardest part of the job, is managing the time differences with the international team.  secondly knowing that the assignment would end soon.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being a part of a great team working on a great project, especially an international project."

good,JNJ provides growth opportunities.  The company's a wide portfolio and has given me the opportunity to gain cross sector quality systems experience.  Salary and benefits are competitive.
good,"Overall, there is a strong culture at J&J.  However, there is opportunity for upper management to take a look at the tactical members of the team who actually know what to do from an operations standpoint, and not just sound good in a meeting.  J&J is extremely top heavy and gives little regard to the low man on the corporate ladder who usually spends the most time and energy."
good,"The work environment is very professional given that it is a corporate setting, however the culture and employees make it feel very welcoming. This is so because everything is team based and oriented at ASP. Getting everyone involved at every level and working cohesively as a single unit in much the same way individual parts work together in a watch, is the focal point of ASP's successes."
good,"When first coming aboard with J&J I was a bit nervous and worried that I would like be linked with a good team. Much to my surprise, the people were great and there was always someone to count on. My communicating on a personal level, our day to day tasks were much simpler."

good,"Great company to work for, though your experience is heavily influenced by your relationship with your direct manager.  Some advancement possible dependent on affiliate and ability to develop relationships.  J&J is all about relationships.  Systems are very disjointed and current enterprise initiative will result in consolidation and centralization of finance function.  Job security is not guaranteed"
good,I enjoyed working for Vistakon because you had the oppurtunity for advancement and the pay was decent with lots of oppurtunities to work overtime as well.

good,"Gosto de trabalhar nesta empresa, tem que ter pasciencia e responsabilidade."
good,It is very quiet though around here.  Much of the building is quite empty.  Not sure if there is much of a culture as this division has been sold recently.  I think people are still trying to figure that out and are a little confused.  Overall I can not complain.
good,"I would come in work with customer service ,international cold products carousel product and use the rf gun. also work with the marc systems and excel. lots of computer work is done through out the day. My learning experience from there i learned how to drive PIV machines and resume lead responsibilities. Co-workers there are always happy and fun.

good,"Typical warehouse, but very clean. Management is not that bad, but I heard that they tend not to treat people equally. Sometimes people were complaining that it's like in concentration camp."

The most enjoyable experience was that I was able to work in different groups, interacting with different depts.and at the same time gained lot of skills and experience that I know will help me in my career moving forward."
good,closing is the typical day for me but in three yr of my carrier i have learned that a suitable plan and strategy help me to achieve it. I learned from my management to follow the integrity of company. Lastly transparency with co-workers and manager help me to do thing better.
good,Learned business model and applied experience.  The hardest part of the job was the fact that there was never enough resources to complete all of the tasks at hand.  I learned about the strategy for support to marketed product and compiled documentation to support changes.

good,Great place to work. Strong Credo Values. Flexible work Arrangement.
good,"Empresa excepcional. Apesar dos poucos benefícios que oferece, se comparada a outras multi nacionais, possui um dos melhores ambientes coorporativos. Possui o título de Empresa Livre do Tabaco, pois não se pode fumar mesmo em áreas abertas dentro da empresa, possui uma carta de princípios (Nosso Credo) que é base de conduta e avaliação de todos os funcionários, apesar de na prática não ser seguida a risca por quem avalia, abrindo margem para injustiças. Possui um sistema de promoção mais justo do que outras empresas pois abre concorrência entre os interessados através de processo seletivo, embora não elimine a possibilidade de promoção de pessoas ""protegidas"". Apesar de todos contratempos, ainda assim classifico como uma empresa agradável de se trabalhar."

good,I'm a contractor for the company through a company called HealthFitness. Johnson & Johnson collaborates fairly well with our group and treats us like partners although at times they dictate programs in our scope of work.
good,A very versatile position - supporting customers in the field while also working with the project team directly to further develop the project technology. Working directly on an innovation technology project. IT knowledge required.

good,"Times have changed at J&J Consumer, they are struggling to compete in the ever changing marketplace with little innovation on some businesses. This has led to multiple rounds of layoffs company wide."
good,"As a consultant, J&J was a great company to work.  A typical day at the office consists of checking emails, meetings, speaking with vendors.  Working with management on resolving issues. Providing feedback to the manager and colleagues as it relates to projects.  One has to be thicked skinned depending on the department.  Management focuses on self and their growth, and the environment tends to be on the cliquish side.  The hardest part of the job is communicating with certain managers.  The enjoyable part is work-life balance and the amazing people I met there."
good,"I worked a 7 month co-op with J&J on their SAP implementation.  It was not what I was expecting, but I am not knowledgeable in computer programing, so I mainly focused on administrative tasks.  I learned that appropriate corporate communication is paramount to success in an organization, large or small, and that being a good writer is an important skill too.  Some days I wish I had the opportunity to redo this co-op experience, because I think I would have been more inclined to work harder, smarter, and more effectively."

good,"I've had two stints as a contractor with JNJ.  Both experiences were good.  However, it is intensely competitive WRT transitioning from contract to permanent.  I've worked in manufacturing and R&D.  Both were good places to be.  Reputation is everything. In order to get the job you want you have to know someone, they have to like you, and so does the rest of the team.  Qualifications aren't enough.  Work culture is very good.  Work is rewarding."

good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo en equipo, hace falta cumplir mas con las opciones que planten para crecimiento laboral."
good,Overall J&J is a great company with a really well earned reputation for training marketers. The challenge is that it is very siloed by office and the management structure is very top and bottom heavy. What this means is that there is limited middle management or room for advancement early in your career.
good,"Good balance between work an private life! Company organizes many sport events, people i worked with were open minded and easy going! Not many opportunities for career growth."

At the start, there is a steep learning curve to grasp what the company is about and how things are done. Putting in extra effort (staying back late after work and learning from others), I managed to catch up quickly and contributed to the company as much as I was able to in the short period of my internship (8 months).

I had very good/great management  for the majority of the time, but for a significant number of years the management was lacking ... and I think it was due in part that there was little oversight of the managers by their bosses, the directors. It resulted in a wide range in capability.  There was very little consistency in the overall approach and  level of understanding of department needs and direction between one manager and the next. J&J is great at talking a good story, as they try to follow their excellent CREDO (which is s statement laid out by one of the founders - basically a statement on company ethical values , how they treat patients, doctors, suppliers, employees, community and the environment.

Most of my day is spent on the computer, either creating and editing marketing/programs, answering customer/member emails, reviewing data from previous programs, or entering data.  The remainder of the day is spent with the members themselves. I would sometimes teach group exercise classes, person exercise prescriptions, and just build a stronger rapport with the individuals who come in and out of the facility each day. I manage a group of personal trainers so I also deal with payroll, interaction between personal trainer and clientele and promotion and implementation of the personal training program. "
