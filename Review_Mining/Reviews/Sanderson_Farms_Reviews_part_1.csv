rating,review
bad,You have a lot of messy people that work here. It was fun at first but due to people and mess I really don't care for this place no more. It's not worth the headache.
bad,"This is a halfway job, mostly for released felons. The conditions are gross. The work is laborious and boring. You will be watched constantly and docked for any slip up. You will be fired instantly after a third tardiness, no matter the reason."
bad,Horrible place to work. Poor management. Treat people badly. Stupid rules. Just overall horrible  place. With backstabbed. Mangers don’t stand up for what’s right.
bad,I worked at Sanderson over two years. I love my job cutting breast but the management is poor they miss treat you for calling corporate office I was recently laid off for call harassment on a supervisor.And denied unemployment
bad,The bosses up there don't care if u have kids or a life outside of the work place and for get if one of ur kids get sick they believe in points no matter what and then ur replaceable
bad,The job is horrible the company  is horrible the managers an upper management are terrible  people to work for alot of them do not know how to do the job an non management workers half to show them then they turn around and try an tell you how to do your job an the company is ran terrible.
bad,As far as pay and benefits great but the management and company are horrible   They don’t care about the employees it’s the worst company I have ever worked for
bad,"The chicken have more rights than the employees. The HR department is the worst I have ever seen in the industry. Enjoys firing employees, that why they are having problems finding employees."
bad,Long hours and just a lot of people and it was just not for me because cause of my son so for me it wasn’t the best fit but good money if you want 12 for shifts
bad,Typical day starts out at. You get your white coat to put on with your clothes. Then you go to your supervisor who will then assigned you to which table you will be working on. The work environment is fast pace with chicken/chicken breast. Wet and slippery. It's very cold inside the building. Also they have a very high turnover rate since they hire a lot of young people.
bad,It was and okay place but that people was not together and that had a lot of mess going on and I just did not like all the messages over all I just did not like it
bad,"Cause great pain working in a cold repetitive environment  It is wet cold and your body gets stiff your ""15"" minute break is more like 8 because of all the stuff you have to put on"
bad,I will NEVER recommend this job to no one. Sanderson Farms is the only prison that actually pays you to work. Supervisors try to fire you if you make them mad. You get wrote up if you go to the bathroom more than three times in a week. The job is very unfair to the employees.
bad,"I don’t want to speak on this job , I’m moving on to something better it has poor management everyone wants to be in control if you work 1st shift in the freezer hours are always changing"
bad,"Do not work at Sanderson farms unless you expect to be yelled and cursed at by horrible supervisors. the go in the computers and fix your time, so that you're working for the least amount of money but you get the most amount of hours."
bad,"It's a very hazardous job, harmful to the body, pay isn't enough, the temperature, this is a job for the uneducated, convicts it's a SLAVE PLANTATION!"
bad,The company does not keep their word. They lie a lot not the place to work. To much drama. I don't like the company very unorganized and lacks communication
bad,Overall unprofessional people I work there a18 month it was terrible supervisor yellin an cussing you never appreciate your hard only miss 3 days in 18 months  just a company who don’t appreciate there worker
bad,I was employeed at Sanderson Farms for more than 1 year in that year I advanced once and received no more than the standard raise. I am a very hard worker and I know my work spoke for itself but was never compensated or rewarded for my hard work. There was not enough opportunity for advancement at Sanderson Farms.
bad,I hated working this job management was horrible the pay was lousy and it was a smelly cold and damp working environment. The place was in great need of repair everything was always broken
bad,"Working nights is Turing."
bad,"I've never disliked a work place before, but I really despised working for this place. The managers wish to talk to you any type of way, and when reported every single time and nothing is ever being done about it, You know your in the wrong place."
bad,"People would bring their personal problems to work, supervisors abused their power and treated employers with disrespect. When the supervisors were mad, they would make the machines go faster."
bad,Working conditions at this company are ridiculous. Management does not care if you are hurt on the job or not. They don't provide the real training you need to perform your job safely.
bad,I would never recommend anyone to this job because the staff and the supervisors are horrible slave drivers it was the most horrible working conditions allowed.
bad,It was a nice job but sometime things can get a little hard. They was very understanding when it come to things that is personal or anything that's not personal.
bad,"It is a very hard working job, cold, wet and management is very unprofessional, and people are very rude to others, supervisors are not respectable to employees"
bad,Hate it the managers are rude some of them be walking around on their phone talking to people the whole time amd they don't even be supervisors. They talk to you like you are a dog in the streets. I don't recommend anyone to work at Sanderson.
bad,"Cannot and will not work for a company that requires you to bring a doctors note, but then counts those days against you anyway. i was suspended for taking my child to the doctor. Had to miss three days of work to ensure my child's safety. When disciplined about it the division manager told me that no matter what goes on at home they don't care about anything personal. In his exact words."
bad,Not A Good Place To Work The People Up There Rude & Racist Towards You Supervisor Will Show Favoritism To The Folks Who Don't Even Work Hard As You If You Ain't Kissing They Butt They find a way to fire you and if you go to the front office about it people in the front office will not do anything about it so it's best to find a other job to work cause Sanderson Farm in Flowood is not the best choice
bad,fast past lines run very fast and you have to keep up. not much room to advance. short breaks and the temperatures inside are very cold. your hands can hurt after a shift.
bad,"•	Operate an industrial forklift used to transfer products and materials inside and outside of facility."
bad,"This place is ran by a group of inexperienced supervisors, who shows no regard to the employees needs or safety. You are to work work and work some more."
bad,"you make good money but get treated bad as a worker, chemicals will make you sick if your not use to them. will have health problems from working there because it will put a toll on your body."
bad,"hire a better class of workers bullying ,racism, and threats happen daily and management does nothing about them causing me to leave for another job very bad experience for a poor white hard working person"
bad,If you don't mind mundane work with decent pay then this is for you. I developed carpal tunnel in both hands from cutting the chicken over and over everyday and had to quit.
bad,Workers are treated poorly and there is no room for advancement at this job. They also are not very understanding when it comes to people that have kids and there point system is unreal.
bad,I didn't really like working there. the supervisors had nasty attitudes and could be very disrespectful to the workers. This is not a job that I would ever tell anyone to apply fpr.
bad,"A typical work day was showing up early and watching others clean before the shift started. What a learned about the company is that when your in management you have to fire people to keep your job. The management was horrible and always fired people week by week. The co-workers worked through injury,harassment,frustration,and long hours. The hardest part of the work was watching employees getting fired and written up daily. Also watching the women work through injuries. The most enjoyable job is getting to talk to the employees. They work hard and do the best that they can do."
bad,this job I didn't like so well because like my third month employed there the whole operating line was given permission to leave early and we did but the next day at work three employers was terminated for leaving early and our supervisor was the one who gave permission to leave.
bad,"Opened up Human Resources Office, answered 5 phone lines, made badges for employees, did filing, copying, and faxing filled out wage and employment verification forms, transferred incoming calls, kept a call in log, visitors log, and also a check log for terminated employees, I was in charge of all incoming mail, and all outgoing mail."
bad,Management talked to people like they were trash. They thought no one had a life outside of Sanderson Farms.The point system was meant to cause more harm than good.
bad,horrible conditions to work in and even horrible management
bad,"this was the hardest job i have ever had. it was cold and i was handling uncooked chicken legs. i had to pack 60 legs in 1 minute or i would be written up. the management did not care about the workers. if you got hurt, they would send you to the nurse and the nurse would tell you to go back to work and if you start feeling worse then come back and see me. i had to leave this job. i had a sinus infection every week."
bad,my overall review of the job is that it is not a good place to work
bad,A typical day a work would be standing in one spot for 8 hours on the evisceration line constantly using both of my hands at a steady pace. Cannot take my hands off the line to blow my nose or sneeze if I had to.  The hardest part of this job was I had to stand in one spot for 8 hours a day and had to raise my hand to go to the restroom and sometimes weight up to 30 minutes for someone to come relieve me so that I could go.  The most enjoyable part of every job; it is the way of survival.
bad,"Sanderson Farms supervisors get to involve in the employees personal life instead of doing there jobs!!They joke with u one day and the next day they take u the office.Plant manager will walk right by you and want even speak.Sanderson Farms in Flowood,Ms.If I had chance to work there again I would not go!!The management teams sucks"
bad,"They do not care for there employees all they care about is there bottom line. You are given a point no matter what the reason for not being at work. A employee had the flu and missed a day of work with a doctors note and was Suspended. For being sick, that’s not a place that anybody can make a career out of, they want robots not people"
bad,"They gave pay raise once or twice a year. The management sucks. There some great people out there but the job and poor management blew them out the door, oh and if your supervisor gets the pep talk  he or she will take it out on everyone. It’s great to have good people to talk to. The people that runs the place not calling names doesn’t know how to do anything but stand and make up poor strategy but know nothing because they are not the ones working."
bad,My supervisor was great! Overall management is terrible. The company should also consider expanding the shipping department. Also hours was getting cut during the time I was there.
bad,Sanderson required it's employee's to work many hours at poor pay.  As a Manager I was tasked to work 50 hour straight.  Management would not support employee's and were always condescending to employees
bad,If you  are not  the Product of meat on the table then you are not the priority of Sanderson Farms. They do not care about your lives outside of work or if you have children they just want to make sure that you show up to work and stay later if they ask you to by asking you to stay later I mean telling you you have to stay later then your shift no questions asked mandatory. People in the office people upstairs supervisors in the building are all rude and not understanding. The only good thing you get paid every week
bad,It is a terrible place to work. They do not care about their employees they talk to them any kind of way. I've been there almost 2 years come to work everyday working in the marination department that has no 2nd shift so you have to stay until the job is finished you might work 10 to 12 hours a day. Then my husband got sick while I was out from having surgery went to see if I could get FMLA for him told ms.white in he why I was their and she told me she didn't care what was going on with my husband I had to leave and couldn't wait on the lady who does the FMLA paper work. My husband was on life support and in the end he passed away. So no I wouldn't advise anyone to work for the company and I would never go back again.
bad,Management was one of the worst management that i have ever seen in my life. They expected you to know every position in the company even if you never worked in that position before the mangers had theirs favorite people that got away with not having to do there jobs but the then the people they didnt like you found yourself under a lot of pressure in order to get you to quit or they would write you up for no reason at all
bad,I wouldn’t  recommend anyone that felt like they was going to make a lot of money to work there employees are unpaid. Some people that’s making money take there employees for grant
bad,The supervisors are mean and hateful and selfish and only care about themselves it is really cold at this warehouse and company really doesn't care about you either personally it is a waste of time
bad,Management is pretty bad maintenance guys are over worked. The money is decent but overall the environment is a bad place to work. Wish it was a better person in charge of maintenance .
bad,A typical day at Sanderson Farm was Eviscerating the chicken which means i disembowel them. The supervisors are not that good at training you.. They'll just send you out there on the floor for you to learn on your own.
bad,"* Hard painful days"
bad,"Don't set your self up for faliure they only worry about production they don't care about human Rights or You. Don't Do It"
bad,"Management by threats. Reminded daily of getting fired if things didn’t go as planned. Never received positive feedback, always negative or “not enough “. Constantly called at home about situations that could have been handled when at work. Long hours and when it was time to leave, if your relief was not there, you were not able to leave. I wouldn’t recommend unless this was the only job on earth."
bad,"Ghetto place to work very drama filled workplace full of criminals and supervisors are all perverts that sexually harass you, will make your job harder if they can't get their way. Full of Violence in the parking lot over spaces, in the job over who's sleeping with who, cut throat place to be.Not to mention the chemical smell is ridiculously u strong burns your eyes and nose, chicken is full of dirt, tumors ,and green"
bad,Working hard but not advancing in your job and no security when your kids get sick you loose your job I think this isn't a job for someone with a family
bad,"None, no fairness. I hate it. My safety is what I'm worrying about. You get bullied you tell the people in the office they get everyone to write statements and still nothing gets done"
bad,It was ok working there fast paced it did have its downfall during the summer it smelt really bad outside with all the chickens in the area was not very fun
bad,We as hrly emp.are treated like minorities. Salary emp get so many addtn'l benefits like HUGE bonuses & us hrly gets 1 tshirt a year..Poor Managment..
bad,"They pride themselves as being a family oriented company and that is far from the truth. So many times I was forced to work when sick. Terrible hours. Terrible working conditions and they never praise you for doing good. They constantly tear you down as a person. The plant Manager and Division Manger are cut throat and only look out for themselves. The Division and Plant managers also had us hide multiple "
bad,Someone should definitely contact the labor board on the polices and procedures for this place when it comes to family issues that may occur when you're employed here. I think that they have no respect or care about the employees.
bad,"This had to be the worst job I’ve ever had. The job was easy whenever they let us do what they hired us to do (haul feed). They never tell you in your interview or orientation that you will be doing live haul when they need you. It’s always last minute like the day before when they switch when your clock in and what you will be doing. There’s no pto, only vacation time you get is after a year(1week). Stay away from this company they are to unorganized and they don’t care about the drivers. If you have a family and love spending time with the this is not the job for you. You will work long hours during the week and maybe Saturday , for 800-900wk that’s if you get 60plus hours."
bad,I was fire poor work for performance I have swelling thrumbi could it the thrumb under the scissors cause I has on thrumb some s Sunport  to wear the doctor gave me. They send the office and that when they  fire me.
bad,"It was good for a temporary source of employment but it's best described as a stepping stone, best fit for kids straight out of highschool. I'd only go back to work here, if I absolutely ""had"" to."
bad,"Very challenging and self-rewarding place to work.  Poor management in almost every area of the company.   Never recognized for over achievement and long hours.  Definitely no job security.   Every division was not negative, there were some good management in different areas of the company."
bad,Very stressful environment. Minimal growth opportunity. Management is cut throat. Breaks are too short. Management has no boundaries there at all. Just crazy
bad,"This has got to be the worst company i have ever worked for. Its clear on the first day they dont care about their employees at all. The turn over rate is ridiculous. They hire and fire every day. Its unnecessarily hard. There arent any ""easy"" positions. The management is a joke. You get wrote up for dumb reasons. They dont and wont work with you. Theres no way i will ever work for another sanderson farm plant. Yeah the pay is good but honestly i would work for 10 a hour or less for somewhere else oppoosed to working for sanderson for 12.20. Man just dont go its a waste of paperwork and time."
bad,I worked on the wing line in this factory and the amount of meat that we received was unbearable and unbelievable. We were constantly berated if we could not keep the meat down and cursed out. The supervisors would disappear all the time and when we had issues on the line we were always told that it was because we weren't working hard enough. We worked a lot of Saturdays to get the meat that had been sitting in the freezer for days and weeks packed and shipped out. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
bad,"Had problems from day one. They expect you to grasp and know everything the moment you arrive. Pay was great, but that was about it. Management was awful. Every one is for their self versus a team like a place should be. Sure I learned it is not nearly as gross as I first imagined, but again not worth it."
bad,"They preach family culture but you learn very fast family comes last. You can never plan anything with family or friends because may get called to work. They pay you 8 hours a day but you will almost never work less than 10 and weekends are free if u get called to work. Management is terrible they never communicate with each other and lower employees are left to suffer from it. They tell you in interview process anything you want to hear to to get you to take the job and will act like never said any of it after the fact. Training is terrible and basically nonexistent I've seen several people in last year come and go because weren't trained by management and thrown to wolves to ""sink or swim"" as they put it. Nothing is ever done right in their eyes  and you learn to keep your head low or else management will retaliate against you and entire department."
bad,Not a good place to work. Supervisors talk to you as if they had no sense at all.
bad,This is one of the worst jobs I’ve ever had . It makes the top 1 places for bad work place. The management lies and alienates you from day one. The personnel department is out to get rid of you from day one.
bad,"Horrible job I’ve ever worked for the staff is disrespectful HR is disrespectful they look at you like you’re stupid when you ask a question, the department i worked for i hated this is the type of place you work for if you want to be talked any type of way and make you do work nobody else wants to do. Supervisors will fuss at you and expect you to know what to do and work like a slave the first day you get there would not recommend this trash place for anyone."
bad,They pay you the money but they cut hours in order to cut production costs. poor management and management skills. belittle employees. supervisors get in good with management to save their job and get rid of employees.
bad,Good pay doesn't make up for bad leadership. Management is unprofessional. The benefits are great however. You have to take the good with the bad. Enter at own risk.
bad,"Your employees come in at 4:30. You need to be there by 2:30. Your employees leave from 12:30 to 01:00, maybe you go home at 03:00. I'm speaking from experience as a supervisor. You will work 14 to 15 hours a day. If there is a holiday that the company shuts down for like Christmas, New Years, MLK, you can expect to work the weekend before and the weekend after to make up for the lost production. "
bad,Sanderson treats you as just a number. They don’t care about you or your family. They expect your whole life to revolve around what they need. I was made to be there at 4 am and leave at 12. Then they expected me to be on call the rest of the time. So basically they only wanted you to get paid for minimum hours but you had to be at their disposal
bad,Its not a bad place to work and depending on your department. They try to work you every Saturday and second shift never comes in on Saturday. Sanderson Farms expects you to put your kids and family second.  The supervisors are very LAZY and never does anything to help the employees. If the see a problem they will walk away instead of fixing the problem. When you go too HR the never want to hear your side of the story. They have the most SORRIEST POINT SYSTEM. The supervisors get FREE MONEY BECAUSE THEY DO NO WORK!!!! Co-workers become your family
bad,It was very prejudiced and poorly managed.  They the bosses did not want anyone knowing more than  they did.  I had to outwork men half my age to prove myself.  It was not a fair place to work.
bad,The company itself is nice. The environment is fast paced. If you are able to multitask this is definitely the job for you. If you are motivated it is definitely the job for you. The hardest part on the job is keeping up with the repetitiveness. It is a repetitive job. Pay is good though
bad,"This job is always stressful, management have their picks, and the pay scale is so crazy even management can’t even explain it as they say. We are so underpaid and the supervisors on up and so overpaid. They don’t care about you as a person only the chickens!!"
bad,"Good location, bad managers. Very stressful at times and very over worked and under paid. Need lockers and need better managers all the way through the company aa well as supervisors. A lot of favortism & unprofessional supervisors. The company itself offer good benefits but it also need good team players thats willing to help the company grow."
bad,I didn't like working there at all. I was suppose to be working full time but I never seen a 40 hour pay check. And everybody there is cut throat always trying to find a reason to tell the supervisor about something. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there its a horrible place.
bad,"This place is basically ran by the USDA. But still, I worked on the line had at least five people standing over my shoulder while I cut the defects out of chickens. Some of the infection I seen on these birds has stopped me from ever buying chicken that was produced at sanderson farms. I was going to stay at this company until I found a positon I wanted and take advantage of their benefits. But just couldnt hack and am now looking for a job in my field."
bad,its a ok job. its a great stater job for someone who is just starting out
bad,"I went to the job site yesterday to get a job there. The process was ok just a long wait. I went there for 1:00 pm and did not leave until after 5:30 pm. The job pays well if you're willing to not have a life outside of work. The supervisor at mccomb,ms sanderson farm  was very rude and disrespectful towards me the whole time. Her attitude was very horrible and very unprofessional. Great place to work to get money, very unprofessional people that work there."
bad,Worked there for 5 years and could never move positions. Management team is not helpful when it comes to your concerns.  It pays well but if you want to make more of your life. This place is not for you.
bad,They care more about they’re meat then they’re employees I had the worst experience supervisors get mad when you don’t give them the time of the day they have there picks and choose on who they wanna rehire
bad,This was the absolute worst job I have ever had. The management is terrible. They show favoritism. They are very manipulative and lie a lot. The only good thing about this job is the pay(for the area I live in). They’re demeaning and believe they are better just because they are in management or have a degree. Plenty of people have degrees that work on the lines but don’t want the problems of being a supervisor .
bad,The supervisors will harass you and talk down to you while cussing at you. I ended up with lung problems. If you take off work for being sick you will be given 2 warnings then fired. They tell you that if you are contagious and running a fever you can wear a mask while working. If you go to your Dr or hospital instead of their nurse you will be fired. The only excusable absence is your own death.
bad,"If you are looking for a job where you can slack off and not have to put your best effort in and still be compensated this is the place for you. It seems management tends to appreciate those that don't work hard instead of the ones that actually work. Depending on who your supervisor is you will be wrote up for complaining about someone not puling their weight. Also if the higher ups have a personal issue with you they will try their best to get you out the door, however the lazy employees will still be employed."
bad,Overall the benefits is what keep you going to the stressful job. They ask for feedback to make the job a better environment but no one listen. Security sucks! Unsafe environment! Management are very disrespectful and unappreciative.
bad,"Management is the worst. Too many narcissistic people in upper management, I'm surprised the building has enough room for all their egos. They do not care about people, only how much money they can make off the little man. Someone can and did drop dead on the floor and all they worry about is their stupid production cost."
bad,Have worked in Evisceration for a few years now. Job not that bad when u get used to it. Pretty good pay for the fact u don't need experience. Working conditions are iffy.
bad,The job itself is okay but management sucks and these people do not care about you. Second shift is very stressful and its not a job for you or you have children
bad,I don’t advise this job to anyone. It’s poor management the front disk workers are very rude. They are not understanding the supervisors use favoritism
bad,"Sanderson Farms do not care about their employees at all, all they care about is how much you can do for them. My husband got fired because he had to go get his son from his mom's and he was out for 3 days to take care of him. He ask HR what he should do and they said bring back a police report nd he did. They fired him when he went bk to work. So proof they don't care."
bad,Very stressful work place very unorganized have to clock in and out on every break no minute before no minute after or you get a point . Have you running around like a chicken with it’s head cut off
bad,There is very poor upper management in place that don't know what they are doing or how to manage. They have No respected for the people. Poor communication from management to management and hourly employees.
bad,"Productive all the time. Fast enviroment. A lot of opportunity for multitask and help applicant that not speak english, also helping all the office and manager staff with translading."
bad,"Supervisors and associates are treated unfairly. There are several different managers and each of the will tell you different ways to complete a task.  Each manager will discipline you for the doing the task differently than how ""they"" told you to complete it."
bad,You are over word for compensated pay. Feels like modern-day slavery. They only care about the product not the worker. If you can't perform the work they will get rid of you and find a replacement. The turnover rate is very high.
bad,its an okay place to work pay is good and so are benefits but management could do better and treat employees with more respect and they need better understanding
bad,"the supervisors talk to you like your trash, when they mess up your time for your check they take there sweet time fixing it yet they wanna slave you all day just overall unprofessional"
bad,i was in my college years in mississippi when i worked for sandersonfarm..i prepared the chicken for delivery. i worked here for maybe 4 semesters great work experience
bad,A typical day at work is rough. I learned a lot about being a QC its a lot you have to do to keep the warehouse or the plant running rite for the USDA. Management is ok its not the best they don't try to help there staff its all about themselves. The co workers are not friendly at all they don't work together as a team. The hardest part of he job is the people you work with.  The most enjoyable part of the job I never had a enjoyable part of the job.
bad,Getting everyone on the same page is impossible. If you question an idea you have just painted a target on your back. Benefits and compensation are good but do not make the stress worth it.
bad,management is not good at all!!!!!!!! and the haed part of my job was dealing with the purchasing and her lies and treating me like a dog. and I try to tell management all they would not do any thing about it....POOR POOR MANAGEMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
bad,The supervisors look out for themselves and that's it. They don't have any employees on their mind. Everyone is expendable to them. The stress is not worth it. I got fired for clocking out. You can literally get fired for being a minute late to many times. They write you up for clocking in early and late. Nobody from inside the company has an opportunity to advance.
bad,"The backbone of any company (hourly employees) are viewed as replaceable cogs in the machine. Very high Constantly changing policies and guidelines. High turnover rate. One week volunteers needed to work weekends next week sending people with 39.99 hours home early. Great Benefits if u can find a decent health care provider outside of the state of Mississippi that accepts Blue Cross Blue shield. Thanksgiving Christmas and New year's unfortunately fall in the off season for the poultry business and only salary employees recieve any type of bonuses. Once took 40 hour paid vacation the Monday I was scheduled to return on a holiday didn't recieve Holiday pay. Holiday pay was ALWAYS less than my usual pay rate. Never once disciplined written up or suspended. Was Terminated due to attendance was given the option to quit in order to ""leave on good terms.""  Reapplied recently out of morbid curiosity during the interview i was informed all rehires go in front of the committee to be discussed every Friday, I  interviewed ON A TUESDAY, got a inexpected call back the very next day (WEDNESDAY) surely a mistake I assumed but returned the call within five minutes was asked my ssn 3 times all 3 produced no record of my employment. FOURTH time got it right and said the application had been denied. Didn't bother to ask why or how that was possible. I assume my file was a special exception on the top of the eligible for rehire pile under ""left on bad terms"" viewed by the committee a couple days before everyone else."
bad,It wasnt what i expected they had me doing three to four different jobs that i didnt apply for they also told me i would get a raise after a year didnt also to me my supervisor always was late to me it wasnt for me and i wouldnt recommend no one to work there
bad,Sanderson Farm is a good job if you want to make a decent amount of money.  The entry level pay is $12 which is well over the pay of other businesses.
bad,"Sanderson farms is the worst place to work. They write you up for every little thing, the point system is awful, they don't care I'd you are sick pass put they continue running the line. My clothes were soaking wet and they gave me a point for"
bad,The job is good if you want to settle. It is difficult to balance work with anything else. Management does not always follow the company values. The pay is competitive.
bad,"Typical day at Sanderson Farm consisted of a one hour commute at 9pm. Once arriving walk processing floor, speak with the management group concerning area availability and turnover  to sanitation. Under normal conditions, debone was turned over to me at 130am/ 2am, staff take floor at 2am to clean. We had 4 hours to clean and sanitize department for next shift processing. Under numerous constraints, hot water turned off at 5am, QA pre-op at 6am, USDA pre-op at 645am."
bad,"Needs to improve company employee relations, especially communication. Needed to have better way to resolve conflicts or unresolved issues between coworkers ."
bad,I'm an older worker so I was not into the super fast paced environment. I did what I could. Its probably a job best suited for a younger person without young children.
bad,"If you do not mind working long hours and some time short hours it's a nice place to work."
bad,My everyday job is prepare my shift for production. I supply the employees with their needed protection and equipment to perform the work duties of the day.
bad,"A typical day at work is long and hard but I manager to make it through. I learned how to operate various machinery, and work at a very fast rate. The coworkers are okay but the supervisors in the freeze and chill department are very crooked. They show favoritism to different coworkers. The hardest part of the job was the long hours. Working almost 12 hours for 5, sometimes 6 days with only 2 12 minute breaks and one 30 minute break in between. The most enjoyable part of the job was congregating with coworker I related to."
bad,"If you work over at processing, you will be surrounded by dead chickens. Be prepared to see a lot of them: on the ceiling, conveyor belt, on the table, on the floor. Everywhere!! Raw. Dead. Chickens. "
bad,Horrible place to work. Management was very poor. Nothing ethical about it. There was no room for advancement within the workplace unless you knew someone.
bad,They need to shut that  down point blank period all the nasty stuff that's going on xrays backing up until the chicken hits the floor want give you no help
bad,"Dealing with USDA Daily. Managing my employees, keeping track of all HACCP,SSOP,SPS, AND GMP'S. This is a hazardous work environment so you always have to be on feet."
bad,"When I was hurt on the job they did nothing to help. No one has called me to find out how my recovery is coming along or if I need anything."
bad,"They set you up for failure from the get go, write you up without proper training and tell you have to work on Saturday and Sunday after being there 12-plus M-F at 5pm Friday when you are leaving. This place is a joke no one knows in management what they are doing or what to do to run a plant ,just know how to point the finger or fired someone!"
bad,"I use to work there and they fight all the time about Petty stuff. The supervisor I had was veryyyyyy unprofessional. She would talk to SOME of her workers any kind of way. The lady in HR was very nasty for no reason. Overall, I met some okay people, but never got close to them. The pay was okay and they had good benefits."
bad,I really don't like to talk about the Chicken Poultry plants there are some that would agree that your only working there because they hire every week. But not to much to say
bad,The pay is good but to much flour in the air that sometimes it burns your eyes... they have their people that they love in the office....but other than that it's okay
bad,"I did not like working at this company.  Did not get any holidays off, never had to do such manual labor in all my years as a supervisor / manager worked harder than most hourly employees.  Employees was allowed to tell supervision what they will and will not do.  Allowed to cuss and threaten supervisor and had to go to superintendent / FERM to get employee written up but would just talk to them which did no good because action continued.  Was scared that I would physically injure myself due to a lot of heavy pulling and pushing."
bad,"its a job cold, wet and hard work"
bad,Stressful work. Pain on body hand and arms and legs were always swollen. Lack of sleep from pain. Tried to get ways at work to use so my body wouldn’t hurt so bad after work and on weekend.
bad,Sanderson farms is very in unprofessional    they hr staff is unprofessional a supervisor can disrespect and and harass you and than you take it up with hr and they won’t do anything but fire you so on a scale 1 to 5 I give them a 0
bad,"I did not like the work environment and my station's supervisors were MORE than laid back. I also see this form of production, working in a freezer to be a health risk."
bad,"Nothing to say but the stress and pain in my back was to much. Management was good, hours were good, post was good. Other than that I just couldn't take back pain"
bad,It was to cold and I couldn't deal the supervisors attitudes was horrible if you didn't catch on fast enough I want to be treated right in the workplace and if I don't know something teach me I'm willing to learn
bad,I learn to only go there to work not to make friends. Hardest part of the job was not having enough work to do and the most part I enjoyed was how good I was doing the things I loved
bad,"I would not recommend this job to anyone. The management was very rude and disrespectful. There was nothing productive about this job , very unsanitary. We didn't receive every break."
bad,"its cold and a very fast pace work place, you have to be a very fast person to work there."
bad,Overall it is not a job to really have any complaints about. The job itself is pretty straight forward and gratifying.  I learned quite a bit and moved up quickly.
bad,The supervisors think that they can talk to you any kind of way will reward you for a job well done then use that same energy to get you out of the door even if you are the best worker. The pay is GREAT but look at all the stuff you would have to put up with everyday they hire and fire everyday because they don’t have a union that’s why they don’t want one. Because they know they will be stopped
bad,Only intrested in bodies don't care about safety of people and the point system sucks that's why so many people come and go I don't care how long one been employed out here once they see you as a threat they will find a way to get one terminated they use psychology they know who is vulnerable they sit back and watch things on camera for their advantage not yours so beware of the woutwolves
bad,It is easy work once you get a hang of the job cause the only thing you do is stand there and do one job the whole time you are there but they want to work you like were machines
bad,Ilove it at sanderson farms everybody was very understanding and caring for one Nothet i was always there on time easy to get along with others. Was alwkays om time
bad,"Management is something else ,If you are black they will hate you.They talk to you like you're a animal and don't even bother trying to speak because they will look right past you."
bad,"It was a great experience working and developing friendships I worked hard on the line and responsible for weighing the meat,packing boxes,and stacking boxes for different companies"
bad,Upper management does not listen to employee opinions nor do they even care to hear the employee opinions. They dont care how many hours salaried employees work. They do not live by their mission statement.
bad,Just a very fast paced job. Its hard on your hands and back standing for long periods of time. Short breaks and all they care about is production. Not tbeir employee's.
bad,"A typical day is very cold and extremely fast paced, I have learned to be prepared for the cold inside the building. Manager encourage everyone to keep up the good work. Co-workers are very talkative. The hardest part of this job is when the machines are are broken down.The most enjoyable part is when we was able to go outside and enjoy the heat and conversate"
bad,Sanderson farm its an OK job. The company doesn't really care touch for you family's health.. Such as my daughter was born prematurely and I was denied FMLA. I'm a hard working man willing to work
bad,"Not a good work environment, company moral is not healthy.  As with any other company profit is King and comes before everything, employees, safety, regulations etc."
bad,I hate it and i will never work there again. I got sick the first week. I was cool at first but i got very sick so i missed a couple days not knowing that it would have an effect on my job.
bad,"Only go to do your job.... Your under paid for the amount of work. Once you take this job your personal life is only sleeping.  Your constantly reprimanded for mistakes, never rewarded for dedication and service."
bad,"the worst place I have ever worked at, was talked to to bad by upper management and downed and never was told anything positive"
bad,It's good pay but long hours and weekends also they don't care if you sick they will fire you or to fire you if your sick and when you live then everyone trys to check on you
bad,They do not care about the employees . They are inconsistent and will stick people with little to no line experience as a supervisor and they have a lot of scandals that make the work environment hostile.
bad,Hostile work unfair treatment of Supervisor if you don't fit in the clicks long work hours and no respect they attempt to overpay you then return feel like they owe you no family life only work life
bad,"It is a busy place to work with alot of people from all walks of life "
bad,"Management shows favoritism "
bad,"Sanderson Farm is a poorly ran company with lack of respect for personel. Their supervisor are poorly trained in communication, and misuse their authoritative position too belittle the employees. They also actively denies any association with a much needed union and have a poor human resource department."
bad,"The hours were hard, the pay was decent but taxes ate most of the profit up! the employees were mean and demanding! The supervisors were unfair and I honestly felt as though they were prejudice against whites! This job by far was the hardest, emotionally and socially, that I have ever had!"
bad,Upper plant management is rude and biased. Constant threats to fire people if departments don't meat goals but they expect the supervisor to run the department short staffed on hourly employees and supervisors. Very high turnover of management and hourly.
bad,"Upper management encourages falsifying documents to save their jobs. Dishonesty is pervasive throughout the organization, not just one location.  Most employees end up having to lie just to keep their jobs."
bad,"This company needs better management and an employee sweep through. Workers do not care about cleanliness of plant or chicken that is being processed. Employees will pick chicken up off of the floor and throw it back on the belt to go through for packaging. Supervisors are arrogant and not team leaders. Turn over is horrible. Instead of keeping good, hard workers that follow rules they critique every little thing and do poor write ups. They fire employees left and right and are constantly having to hire new people that have to be trained. Ridiculous write ups for clocking in from lunch  3 minutes to early. Plant needs to be evaluated and employees need to be treated respectfully"
bad,Management would push write ups on employees that didnt fall in line with how the managers ran their department even though they was in the wrong. Management would break rules andallowed certain
bad,Employees are numbers. Upper management doesnt' listen and doesn't care about people who might have more experience in a job than they do. They don't care about the people working for them.
bad,Not happy in my current position. I need more money to raise my family. You are expected to come in early and stay late without any notice. Relationships are not discouraged in the work place and this causes issues. To be off on holidays you are required to work on weekends.
bad,Sanderson farms overall has pore work ethic and lack of management. They don't have it all together yet and it's just not a good place to work not recommended.
bad,"Drivers are paid by the load.  The loads are priced by the further you go the less you get paid. Unless your friends, you do not get the ""pay"" loads.."
bad,"if you wanna work like a dog with absolutely no appreciation. It took me a year and a half for me to be promoted even after learning EVERY position in first processing and working really hard. Once in that position, the ideal of me being a female became an issue. They brought another guy from his job to ""help me,"" then found it completely necessary to put me back on the line after working so hard to get promoted off the line and being granted a position off the line. Literally no appreciation for hard work and commitment to your position. The only good thing was the pay but after trying to put the work of 3 on me, even that was not enough."
bad,"My days at work with Sanderson farms was almost like going to jail and having to protect myself against other co-workers, a lot of them were very mean and always was trying to find ways to start problems in the work place. While I was there I did learn the proper way to clean machines and different ones. The management was very poor they kind of let everyone fend for themselves in there and sometimes when there was a problem between two co-workers he ignored the situation until it became a bigger problem. The hardest part of the job was having to worry about who is going to turn on you next the most enjoyable part was when it was time to get off."
bad,"Salaried supervisors are vindictive and use favoritism and retaliation to enforce the rules according to corporate protocol. Salaried supervisors are required to attend frequent training classes sponsored by the corporate office in Mississippi in which they are instructed to use write-up sheets to punish hourly employees for even the most ridiculously minor infractions -- such as clocking-in one minute early or losing your clock-in badge -- in order to keep plant operations flowing smoothly and turning a profit. As a result, at least in my department, we have a management staff that is totally ineffective. If you actually go to your supervisor to report a problem or concern, nothing gets done and you are brushed-off as if you aren't important or are complaining needlessly. If your concern actually even gets past your supervisor to the HR department, HR will fill out a bunch of paperwork and then put a bunch of ""statements"" in your personnel file THAT YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEE, unless you have a pretty good attorney. That's right, there's no ""open-door"" policy at Sanderson Farms between management and employees. So if you're expecting to find a supervisor who acts as a mentor and encourages you, or a company that values your hard work, keep looking elsewhere. You won't find any respect or appreciation at Sanderson Farms."
bad,The people stink. Management stinks. Environment stinks. Only thing keeping me there is the pay.
bad,"Was not honest about internship, expectations were different than when originally offered. Placed people in unsafe environments in the Palestine training center."
bad,They don't care about you or your family the managers are disrespectful and don't care to hear what you have to say and the nurses don't care either they don't even carry simple medicine for headaches or a cough
bad,"Line staff, general workers and skilled positions know more and understand the totality of their respective positions far and beyond that of career management (excluding supervisors). Supervisors often choose no promotion to management."
bad,"Sanderson Farms is not the best place to work."
bad,"Sanderson Farms is not the ideal place you wanna work the place is cold and the chicken is always on the dirty floor what they do is wash it off and rework on it then box it up,  the place is disgusting from what I see that's why they don't want cellphones in the building because it will get reported to higher ups. I wouldn't recommend anyone poor management and they talk down on people."
bad,Working is the worst then except 2 much out of there new hire they don't train u good they always breathing down your neck so people can work like that look
bad,"Horrible training, hourly employees are talked down to by upper management. Employees are held accountable for duties they are not aware is their responsibility and are written up for it. Employees work numerous hours regardless if they are hourly or salary pay. Its difficult to have time for your family and work there. They expect you to put them first at all costs, and they easily terminate employees."
bad,If they don’t like you they won’t keep you will find a way to get you out the door and will pull your job from under your feet bad bad experience with this company if you don’t know somebody to keep you job security then your just sh** out of luck believe you me they have there picks if your not an a** kisser this job isn’t for you
bad,"I am a hard worker. Worked at Sanderson Farms for 2 years. I go to work on time and do my job. This job is on a 5 point system and you have to wait 90 days before a point comes off.My mother n law passed in 2017 and the man that is responsible for her death trial was in 2018. I never passed 3 points. If i was out of work , i had a good reason. Two of my points came from going to my mother n law trial to support my wife on the stand. I bought work notes. One point was because i needed a personal day, that was with no note. The job told us we will not be working anymore Saturdays back in oct 2018. At this time i only have 3 points. So I decided to better my life and go to school for 8 weeks. Since we didnt have to work on the weekends i put my classes on the weekends. In Dec.2018 they decided to put us back working on Saturdays. In order to keep my job every Saturday i had to go get a doctor note because I ended up with 5 points. HR told me I had to go get a doctor note every saturday.Thanking God a point comes off at the end of Dec and Beginning of Jan. My points went back down to 3 while being suspended for 3 days. Yes if u get 5 points, you get suspended. Since i was in truck school and i finish on Jan.30, 2019, I was told i can get a job their when i get finish. But again they worked us on Saturday. Every holiday they make up it by working employees on Saturdays. So now im back at 5 points again. I went and got one note for the 4th point but the 5th point i didnt. So, i go to HR and she told me they will terminate me without suspension on Thursday anyway. Now, they know I"
bad,"Sanderson Farms paid fairly, had a really good benefits package, and my particular department worked really well together to support one another. Outside of that it is really hard to find many positives. Management was really cut throat and also did not help at all with training but expected 100% perfection. Members of management would often times sit in the office and play games on their cell phones and were constantly bashing people from other plants and the general office using language that shouldn't be used in any work setting much less in front of employees. Different departments really struggled to help one another out and there was constant issues between different departments. It was an extremely unprofessional atmosphere. Upon my termination I had an unexpected text from a co-worker stating that ""I figure you have a lot of weight lifted off of your shoulders. Most people usually say the do when they leave this place."" I feel like this isn't the atmosphere of the company as much as it was the location that I was a part of but it is hard to say seeing this is the only location I ever worked with."
bad,"It's a very nice environment place to work. The pay is great, the benefits are great. It's cold in the debone area, only warm in evisceration area. The plant is very large in it's different areas of the plant that you can apply for. Safety first, PPE a must come in do your job everything will be great."
bad,Best part of the job was the work family I gained..they were the best. But it is a fast pace and demanding job..they have rates that you must be able to do and they will stand over you and time your work.
bad,I mean it's okay job it gets it done it gets the bills paid I mean nobody likes it but it's hard to find jobs with that pay every week but is it worth it no but when u got responsibilities then yeah
bad,could use better team member ship great management faced paced job very competetive learning techniques are challenging short breaks would recommend as a job
bad,"Cost accounting is the key to surviving this fast paced environment.  No paid overtime, but 401K matching is a great benefit.  Hard work life balance."
bad,For a production assembly line job in a poultry plant it is what it is.  Jobs were not hard.  However the climate and long standing hours made it hard.  Supervisors showed favoritism in most departments.
bad,high demanding job that management states family is important but actions say other wise. was constantly told at last minute that I would have to work on a Sunday.
bad,typical day was ok but when something goes wrong no matter how hard you work on it nor how fast you complete a task no one ever seemed to be satisfied and like to blame others for someone eles misstakes.
bad,The job was alright but I did my job. I learned how to cut chicken the right way.The hardest thing was not trying to be late. The management they really didn't care. The enjoyable was getting off and going home to my two girls!
bad,"Poorly managed, high turn over, unrealistic expectations. Fast paced, management doesn't show concern or consideration for the employees. One manager says one thing the other says other..Constant conflicting statements."
bad,Worked on a processing line to successfully make incisions on chicken to ensure good quality to consumers. I learned how to make certain cuts to selected poultry.
bad,Do not get locked down in the trainee program low pay. Good people that work there. good luck and have fun bud. LOt of chickens
bad,"Not the best place to work, you work your tail off and don't get much for it.  They are about making money and really don't care about you as an employee, even though the HR people and advertisements say they do.  I would not recommend working for this company."
bad,This job has its up and downs but given the chance I would go back and work for the company
bad,it was a good safe job productive enviroment and well trained supervisors
bad,Very poor supervision. Supervision is very bad at supporting employees. Employees and staff and supervisors have their own favorite person at work. Working is not fair
bad,"It all depends on who your supervisor is. If you get a good one, you can have a decent work experience but don’t plan on them being there very long. The good supervisors either get promoted or realize their under appreciated and leave.  It’s a revolving door for all employees. This place was running long before I started and is still going after I left so that means they really don’t care about their hourly employees. The sooner you realize that, the better."
bad,"You got paid well but the job itself is demanding and difficult and having poor management and rude coworkers does not help. If you need the money, do it for a little while, but otherwise, find something worth doing and don't waste your time. Most people come here for a little while, then leave then come back... for some ungodly reason. "
bad,"Sanderson today has really changed from the past. Back in the days it used to be a fun place to work where all the employees and supervisors got along when we all worked together as a whole and got the job done. Now it's just a job everyone job security is tested no one is safe. Ranging from hourly, management upper management nobody safe. We just come to work do our best and go home.They change the attendance policy regularly it's no need to bring a note you still get a point so what's the use... Too much favoritism!!"
bad,"None not acceptable no comment "
bad,Very poor would not send anyone to work for sanderson farms .  lots of rules there are very unfair. Like going home early if you don't feel good.  Mush bring a doctor's note or fried.  They make the rules as they go . And the points system  no good
bad,Training classes were good very cut throat (management) worked 50+ hours a week tell you last minute about working extended hours have put in a 18+ hr day
bad,"You need money this is the place for you, but if you can find somewhere else to work that would be awesome. Overall if you get in the right department and are able to handle the work load than you are set."
bad,"Job is ok but long as you by yourself. Supervisor barley know anything, and this the only plant i know that have cameras on the inside than outside. Omg and the plant is not organized."
bad,Sanderson Farms is a great company to work for.  The location in Kinston NC is the worse of them all from the HR down to the employees. The higher management is very racist!!! They talk to people any way that they feel.  They constantly terminating all the blacks but they will relocate their friends as well as all the whites!!
bad,Supervisor had bad attitude and didn’t know how to talk to people that’s why I quit  they didn’t do much training  and they just put you out there then get mad when you don’t learn as fast and kept moving me around and talking to me any kind of way with no respect
bad,I delivered chicken feed to farms. We worked 2 weeks days and 2 weeks nights. Overall they were a good company to work for . We had great insurance as far as benefits and all the drivers helped each other out
bad,Good place to work if u just starting a career but when they will fire u if u sick and call in that’s wat I didn’t lik dey have great pay and benefits Nd u r off every weekend
bad,"Sanderson Farms is ok if  you are looking to just get a job to try to survive by yourself, but not to raise a family. There is opportunity decent job"
bad,"A typical work day was being hounded by management.  Overall is a good job, but need better management. You don't have job security, you never know when they come harassing you."
bad,Work Life  Balance is horrible. Great benefits and you can move up in the company. Poor management. long hours. 12 to 15 hr days and only paid for 8. hardest thing about the job is you spend more time at work than u do for anything else.
bad,Worked as a Tender scorer on the Debone line two different times. Once in 2015 and currently. Place has only gotten worse. Fast paced repetitive work  with great benefits and pay but that's it. This company has the highest turnover rate I have ever seen. This is due to most management and supervisors not caring and overly strict rules. That and they will push to get you to quit or fired instead of help you keep your job. Especially if your a little different from other people. They flat out do not care.  Hard work and consistency won't get rewarded unless you are a brown noser. Not for people with weak immune systems or get queasy around blood guts because if you get sick even legitimately or have a good reason not to be at work more than 3 times in a year you will be terminated. No questions asked. However you do get paid holidays and birthdays after a year and full benefits after 90 days. They do rehire up to 4 times after a year but one time is enough for most.
bad,"Production line work that's really damaging on your body and management is all about who you know and their ""pets"".Its a seure job if you are really humble and quiet and do not stand up for yourself."
bad,Don't work here unless you know someone it's all about who you know
bad,I learned that working on a processing line you have to move at a steady pace and not slow you have to be on point when working and the hardest part of the job is working with some boss coworkers that think they know everything just because they been there longer then you think they the supervisor and the enjoyable part is the job itself and the hours and pay rate
bad,no supervisor have been there no longer than 2 years rules change on a daily basis and they will fire u for talking bout a union r anything there of
bad,My first week there I started on live hang and I would tell anybody it's good money but it's hard at the same time. You got to hold 27 birds a minute and you cant miss any shackles. It's hard to get both legs in the shackles but in time you get better. When they moved me to drip line it was easier but it was colder.
bad,What a hunk place to work didn’t pay good ethier. Would not recommend anyone working there. They will try to find any little reason to let you go. Sand
bad,"Pretty good place to work just very cold inside and very very fast pace, time goes by fast on second shift wich was where I was workin on.  Especially in the winter it’s twice as cold as the outside."
bad,"A typical day at work was busy fast paced with a little of no organization. Co-workers were always down, and mentally defeated. Management abused their power as well contradicted themselves on a daily. The most enjoyable part about the job was the income even though we would have to wait a full month to get compensated."
bad,Sanderson Farms gave me the opportunity to make extra overtime. They work many weekends and long shifts but gave everyone an opportunity to get overtime and make extra money
bad,"If you want to work for a company who does not care about you 1%, this is it! Yes, they have good benefits and good pay but they are tying to get rid of you for any little thing. You can never feel secure at this employment."
bad,"Their point system is not fair. the wash lady dosent always have clean dry gloves, so sometimes you have to work with cold and wet gloves. the type of work that goes on puts a tol on your body."
bad,The conditions of working there were poor and management was not very good at all. Temperatures were poor had roaches in break rooms overall poor work conditions
bad,Will probably leave you with a bad taste in your mouth about Sanderson as a whole. Please don't let it. If you get a chance to work at another Sanderson plant give it chance and let your past with Kinston Processing go. Employees get about 8 hours every day (depends on the kill). Workplace culture and managements is currently seeing changes for the better. The hardest part is sticking with it through those changes.
bad,The company  suckered  they do that respect you at all neither do they salute success they want all of u or none of you.... and they don't pay the live hangers no where enough
bad,"I enjoy running up and down the board on this job,it was something new to me,it was something to learn and it was good for people to teach me how to do new things as I did my god"
bad,"Very stressful job to have because of the extreme goals to maintain along with the constant pressure that is applied daily.. No matter how many goals you meet the bonus system is not guaranteed...but this job taught me a lot as far as sales, relationshhips with coworkers, employees, and customer satifaction. I enjoyed the salary pay but hated the once a month pay"
bad,"Would have been a great place to stay, had it not been for the companies policies. You could not have a family emergency without the company docking you hours.  The overall pay was below the survival rate for the area."
bad,"Sanderson Farms in Moultrie Ga. Does not care about the employees. Mistreat their employees. They have poor management. You don't get your full 15 minutes break, not 30 minutes lunch. They barely give you 40 hours a week. Cut hours Monday through Friday.  Then make it mandatory on Saturdays so you'll get straight pay instead of time in half."
bad,Sanderson farm is a place Ewere it is cold and you have to work hard. The supervisor really don’t being doing they job so we have to work very hard at the farm.
bad,"the job is what it is. its faced paced line work in extreme temps.  point system is rigged to get rid of people to keep turnover high. the company really doesn't expect many people to make it past the probationary period; and those who do make it still end up pointing out for minor things like being 1 minute late. they are understaffed due to so many people either quitting or getting fired. Too many supervisors walking around monitoring the employees and not enough employee help"
bad,Did not enjoy working here at all. It was continues hard work and the supervisors blamed you if the machines didn’t work or broke down. The work place isn’t a sight to see.
bad,"I would get up early and get ready for work. Then i would go to work, i would  put my apron and glove and go to my station and start taking the bones out of the chicken. After an hour we would have a brake and we get a 5 min brake and the have to go back to work but when we actually got out of the factory it was like a 2 min brake. Go back in and work till lunch then we would take a 30 min brake get feeling back in my hands (from the cold) i love lunch because i was warm and i could actually talk to my coworkers with out getting yelled at but we world eat the head back to work. We would for 2 hours and get one more 5 min brake. Finally go back to for for an hour and the we get off."
bad,working long hours led to no personal life. Management and training need to be improved. Only positive is its easy to save money when you never have time to spend it
bad,"The supervisors are very disrespectful & big headed , you run into good leads at times but most are just like the supervisors. They do no work at all. They have no respect for you ."
bad,"brakes are terrible, don't work with school schedule, and makes your body hurt really bad, but its a good paying job guaranteed 40 hours, great benefits."
bad,"It is a fast paced job. A lot of people employed there so you see a lot of drama. Mainly go to work, do your job, and go home. Pay should be increased for amount of work."
bad,"Supervisors doesn’t know how to speak or talk to you. They talk to you like you one of their children, very messy and childish. They not satisfied until you cuss them back out. The breaks should be longer than 12 mins. Machines always messing up, and they still expect you to get productions."
bad,"As long as you do not rock the boat, you will enjoy working here. BUT if you are a person who stands up when you see things that are inherently wrong, then you will be out on your nose quickly. Environmental no no? Say something and watch how fast you lose your once very safe position. It was a great place to work, great pay and benefits."
bad,it was a cutthroat business. people thinking that they can talk to you any kind of way. no concerns for your health if you got sick on the job. disregarded your safety.
bad,Job doesn't care about people care about product it wares people out breaks you down its not as easy as it seems its a hard job for a pregant women not being able to move or walk just still on a line moving fast paste
bad,The best thing about that place was the pay!Great pay!The supervisor pretends for a while than there true colors comes out! You coworkers are the worst people I ever worked with! Very childish!lying type people!
bad,"The only thing I can say is pain pain pain. My hands still hurt from working there and they was hurting the whole time I was there. I don’t know how the other plants are, just the one in Waco, Tx"
bad,Very stressful environment no time with family working 80+ hours and they have zero mistake policy did I mention 80+ hours never see your family all for chicken feed
bad,"You stand in one place on a metal lift and do the same thing over and over. It stinks, you get dirty. The supervisors see you as a number, not a person. There is drama all over the place even if you keep to yourself. Basically I am there because the pay is good."
bad,"Working at Sanderson Farm was a fast paced company. I did not like the management there, and the work environment was not clean at all. I did not like the smell of fresh blood from the chicken."
bad,"I had to be to work by 7:30, I packed boneless chicken breast 42 per minute. The money I made was a good satisfaction for my family . Sometimes it could get very competitive with the workers, the ones that was there longer felt like they didn't have to work as much."
bad,it was work you will do the work for your pay i learned that good money takes hard work the management was not good the culture was good i guess it was a on going pase not much rest time it was good worker a team
bad,assembly line workers are pushed to the limit at some times.Work load is very rough but me myself I could handle it.very wet floors at times.Knives need to be sharpened more often.Supervisors need more training on how to relate to employees needs.
bad,"This has to been  the most brutual, underpaying job I have ever worked. You have to be able to work not only physically but mentally as well to stay at this job"
bad,Very harsh environment to work in.  The smell is overwhelming at times and the turnover is very high. The pay is good for the work.
bad,Fast paced. Co - workers have complaints against staff. Some staff are very unprofessional. Needs various improvements
bad,"Hard and fast, the hardest part was learning to use a knive You had little time to get to know your co-workers, and the best part about the job was quitting time."
bad,"clock in go to work, go to break, back to work go to lunch and work till time to go home"
bad,A typical workday was very unorganized and frustrating. Management was horrible. Co-workers were great very patient and good teachers. The hardest part of this job was deboning the chicken breast for long periods of time when wrist are hurting. Enjoyable part was quitting time.
bad,Atypical work day consists of making sure the line is sat up and giving breaks. I learned how to hang chicken. My co-workers some were great some were not. The hardest part is when someone misses. The most enjoyable part of the job is when everyone comes to work.
bad,Came in processed Paperwork. Learned to always keep records of everything you do. Management was good. Culture is good. Hardest Part was the People. The people i worked with at the Shop.
bad,"Start off you have to be on time. Employers yell and curse at us, we have no rights unless Osha gets called. I learned you have to be a brown nose in order to have a great day. HR treat employees like inmates"
bad,if you don't mind seeing chicken guts and blood everywhere this is the place... if you have a weak stomach or get turned off quick this is not the place for you..... ive been to all sanderson farms
bad,This job is a very very fast paste experience u work 8 sometimes nine hour a week the pay is good only the distance and drive is the headache my first week was so awful hands hurt so bad you have to really give it why you got they are very strict on paste and job performance
bad,"pay is good "
bad,"Working here was a good factory experience. The point system is crazy they could at least just give you points when you call in or just dont show up. I mean their are a lot of single parents who have kids that have doctors apt. The management is terrible, ugh!. You work 5-6 days a week, no time to handle your business."
bad,Working at Sanderson Farms you have no time for anything else in life. They act like your robots instead of human beings.  It's hard to work at Sanderson Farms when you have small children.
bad,"Long hard days, learned to cut a chicken, management was poor, hardest part of job was the co workers attitudes. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting paid every week."
bad,Working with company made me accomplish more experience due to food processing nature and using machine equipment.
bad,"very interesting times here. you definitely have to have a very strong mind to work at a place like this. also MOST of the daily work you do there, you'll be told NOT to do or do it a completely different way than taught. when the CEO of the company came it was a way different environment just way better. to bad that's not actually how it works there day to day."
bad,"Love production work , laid back place to work.. good pay. Good hours and benefits.. unorganized and messy also put u anywhere and dont show you what to do and then get mad when you do it wrong. Management is messy and supervisors."
good,"came to work on time or you where docked pay, one minute was 30 minutes of time. "
good,Working at Sanderson Farm isn't a very good place to work its not how I expected it to be. I've learn to never put nothing pass nobody in life stay to myself and ask questions when I need to. The management isn't so good the be confused. Working on the inside a very damp bad smell. Cutting the breast from the bone wit a dull knife. Taking 30 min breaks.
good,"you don't learn much of anything unless you teach yourself, management doesn't care about anybody or anything but themselves."
good,No advancement/ no team work /work doesnt fit the pay /childish environment/the benefits are ok /some supervisors need more training /its a place for the youth
good,Hours were unstable.  Management was unorganized.  Training was insufficient.  There is no way of understanding between the employees and those in charge.
good,"Working at Sanderson I have learn it's not all about how strong you are. It's about can you get the job done by working as a team. I have as so learn everyone is not going to come into work ready to work, and that's when I had to step up to the plate to get the line full."
good,"A typical day at work was dread,"
good,I was the only female working the night shift so I stayed to myself.  I would speak but hold very little conversation with co-workers.  That Made my job much easier.  I got along well with my dispatcher.  But I was there to work and make money.  The most enjoyable part was clocking out....Really not the kind of environment for a Lady;due to the conversation of men
good,production all day...28-32 degrees at all times...I have never worked a job like this but needed something when I got a felony...the hardest part of the job for me is the temp...I use to really enjoy this work but have grown and now I want to try and get back to the field I know best...
good,"Very fast pace.  No organization or effective guidelines.  Nonregulated  equipment and conditions.  No team cohesiveness.  Poor maintenance reporting, thus  working the equipment all the time as to keep production moving."
good,Sanderson would be an ok place to work if management wasn’t petty. They wouldn’t allow people to use the restroom and worker people 7 hours without a break
good,"You receive good pay and benefits, but the location's management is bad.  The company says treat all persons with absolute respect and integrity.  While that sounds good, it isn't even partially carried out.  They claim to want to promote from within, but that is only if you are someone's friend.  The harder you work, the worse you're treated.  There's a lot of drama and spiteful behavior toward the employees.  High turnover.  Lots of good ol boy politics."
good,Not a great plae to work ou never know when your leaving and management is cruel
good,"Not a bad place to work as long as you don't mind not having any job security, poor management, and not a lot of room for advancement.  A typical day was rare because there are not a lot of typical days in my line of work as a quality control tech if you perform well at your job.  Its so much easier to look away and not do your part in the checks and balance system, but it takes a special kind of person to do the job right.  There are a lot of different dynamics, situations, and moving parts that you are faced with everyday.  I had a good working relationship with most of my coworkers, coworkers meaning hourly employees. The supervision here at times is very unprofessional and unsympathetic to their employees' needs or problems.  It at times reminds me of prisoners out on work release and the prison guards standing over them with a big shotgun hanging over their shoulder.  The hardest part to me was after about a year of working there just mustering up the strength to go work and perform.  Sanderson Farm with suck the life out of you and fire you in hot second.  There were some good times.  I did get the opportunity to meet a lot of good hard working people whom with I built some personal and professional ties."
good,This job gets the bills paid but it's alot of things you have to get accustomed to. Working in different temperatures and different people. The environment is load and bright.
good,I would reccommend for a first job if you are use yo the work force world. It is very cold depending on what department you are in but it will help condition your body to adjust to extreme weather condtions.
good,"Human Resource manager does not care what a employee is going thru (death of a love one), and is straight by the book for some people, yet will bend rules for others"
good,Depending on whats going on that day at work thats wht determine whether its going to be a go day or bad day. Something happened different and u no matter what u knew u always learned something different. A typical day is us running birds and trying to send out quality product to our customers. Management was one of the difficult areas. No team work as a whole. the enjoyable part was when everyone did come together in such drastic times we all got the job done together.
good,"My day consist of a lot of writing a lot of checking the product doing an hour and a repeat of a lot every hour.  I learned how to determaine if a chicken is ready to be shipped out to the customer what all needed to be checked before it leaves the plant.  I never knew how to cut a chicken until I stated working there,  now everytime I see a pack of chicken in the store I realize the hard work that the workers put into cutting and skinning those birds.  Over all I liked the job but the bosses just did not appreciate all the hard work the workers was doing."
good,"This place is out of control from top to bottom, there is alot of issues on management. people work hard but management dont care."
good,Love the high pace.  Hate the constant stress.  Constant stress makes people very unproductive.
good,It's not the best work environment but its not the worst very cold at times you feel like you getting disrespect very strict on attendance but the pay and benefits are decent
good,"During orientation they tell you there is advancement opportunities however, when you apply in house you never hear anything else about the position, not even an interview, nothing.  Office personnel is awful not all but the majority, sanderson isn't such a bad place to work as long as you do your job, stay to yourself and have no desire to move up in the company."
good,I moved from ga so I no longer could work there not really what I expected but as I have stated I had to move from there so I really don't know stop stop
good,"The job was not hard at all. The supervisors did not care that you are standing on your feet for almost 12 hrs a night. All they care about is production. The job will hurt your hands, arms, legs, neck, and shoulders. You receive a point for every little thing. They do not care about the staff who have been there a long time or short time. You are replaceable."
good,"Sanderson farms is a good job, its the management that doesn't work well wit the employees. I work hard everyday on time. I feel as if somethings would change"
good,.The hardest part of the job is dealing with management and the upbeat work performance that need to be produced in order to ship out orders to customers.
good,"Sanderson Farms is not very efficient. Machines break all the time, and there is little or no training for new employees. Supervisors threaten to write you up if you are having trouble with your job and the nurses are no good at assisting with medical issues. You are sent home if you return to work with restrictions not aporoved by their doctors."
good,Management was very disorganized and was very long hours. Safety policies were absolutely insane. Company does have amazing benefits and if you work hard you can make good money.
good,"Sanderson Farms Inc. in Collins, MS typical day at work is exhausting I learned very quickly not to come to work expecting to get slack because you are new. Most likely you are working harder because people take advantage . Management is not very good all supervisor are very nonchalant with attitudes .They will tell you they will be right back and never show. The hardest part of the job will be being the end person, these are the people who pick up the slack of the other workers which is a lot of .The most enjoyable will be the breaks every two and a half hours because you will be so relieve to rest your feet and hands."
good,It was very stressful there. They write people up alot. They fire people alot. They cant keep no employees. Ive seen lots of people get hurt. You better be ready.
good,"All the days were the same, the work was ok but I feel as though the overall culture needs to improve and the management needs to learn how to respect employes"
good,My manager there was a great person he work with you any way that he could to make his employees feel comfortable with where they were working but the conditions there were entirely too rough to deal with.
good,Sandersons Farms bosses show favoritism in their evisceration departments. You also do not get your full lunch breaks. Also promotion or going into the qa department is not based on experience or first come first serve bases.
good,The management was not helpful in the overall production of the shop. Poor preparation and execution of plans to better the shop. Also no overtime was available
good,Fast pace all day stay focus cause it’s dangerous u can hurt yourself if you not paying attention to what you are doing be on time and ready to work hard
good,Working at Sanderson Farms you must be ready and willing to work hard in sometimes below zero temperatures. Some jobs are required to be done by a man and other jobs are giving to those who are physically able to preform the task at hand.
good,"Managers were very ill-mannered. Very Dangerous environment to work in, Working in a freezer is not at all fun. No advancement opportunities. Never a dull moment with your impolite coworkers. Stay to yourself and Do your job."
good,Management was more of the problem than the job or job description itself. Not an professional environment. Went to management to resolve a problem with other works and the supervisor was showing favorism and using profanity and causing problems with other employees
good,The company needs to be more attentive to employees injuries. You would have to have a strong mind to work their and pay close attention to your wrist and fingers because it's very easy to get corpul tunnel syndrome in both hands!
good,"This job is for hard working and who can withstand pain because. Sanderson has a very high turnover rate because of the work involved. If you are not serious about working, do not apply."
good,"Treats you like animals,yelling in your face and 12 min breaks. Real slave labor type job. If hands swell from 120 exposure to cold for 8 hours a day the in-house doctor would not have anything to help you maybe give you a Tylenol and they all say the same thing soak in epsom salt even tho that doesn't help."
good,"A typical day: running, repairing, old, unmaintained production equipment non-stop in a chicken foods processing plant."
good,A typical day at sanderson farm is gossip people who trying to beat you out of your position. what i learned from being at there is you control the outcome on what you do there.
good,"a work day is about 14 hours "
good,Job was fun loved the kids management was not helpful sat and watched cameras instead of assisting workers. Co workers were like family helped each other out.
good,I've learned to work a computerized scale and key in orders for shipment. I was trained on their box machine and trained to troubleshoot any mechanical or computer problems with the box machine . This was a fast paced job that came with very long hours.
good,"Working here, people have no respect whatsoever for you. it's a very high turn over rate. People on the line make your job twice as hard to do when they dont do their job. It's a lot of favoritism out here. When you start working there they just throw you on the line and expect you to know what you're doing the first time you do it. They really dont train you. And if you dont do the job fast enough they threaten you about terminating you."
good,Just know to be careful out there and not to get on anybody bad side. Because it's easy to get caught up with a bad name go there to work and understand that it will not be easy at first
good,Unable to go see my mother in Panama for more than one week. Not enough time in the company to go for more of 3 weeks . Management doesn’t allowed me to go that much of length
good,"It was a place nice to work at only thing was that mostly managers were rude or didt pay attention to their employees at all, place was messy always chicken on the floor"
good,"too many hours a week, and too many weekend,salary employee will had to work, too many weekend ,and over 50 houers a week. also i was not getting quality or experience worker to run the dept."
good,"Very fun place to work at , problem is the managment"
good,My experience at Sanderson farm was a great place to work they just have some nasty floor men it’s a place where you have to stay in your own lane and remain humble to yourself and don’t make friends out there
good,I had a terrible manager. the money was good. i worked long 10+ hours daily. I help start up a new plant where everyone was new.  benefits are OK health could be better.
good,A wonderful company that offers plenty of job opportunities but is not run under direct management to the best of its abilities. No room for error there.
good,Its not bad if you are a single male fresh out of high school still living with your mom. I worked there for one month during the summer before leaving for college and the only thing that kept me from quitting was me leaving.
good,The job was challenging in many ways but to much buddy system in company.  Hard to get promotions if not in buddy group.  The hourly employees were easy to work with. The pay was great and so were the benefits.  Most of the time the work was very enjoyable.  The work could be very challenging and rewarding if you kept a positive attitude and was willing to work hard. I love being given projects to work on the help the company put out a better product.   I love solving problems and guiding new employees. A lot of weekends off.
good,Long hours of hard work. Did this 24 years and sold farm. Poultry is best industry in MS. It was 7 days  a week but there are not many good jobs in this area.
good,Long hours sometime but a good place to work if you decide to. Make a future there.they demands every Saturday now.no extra pay for the annual raise..only one day for all holiday of the year.
good,"Point system sucks!! Supervisors very disrespectful! Doesn't matter if you have to go to the doctor,court etc. Even with a doctor's note you still get a write up!!"
good,This is a face-paced job with little time for errors. I loved working here as where I was a lead on my machine. I learned the process of poultry and had fun doing so.
good,"Its a good place to work, but the mangerment should be better. They should care more about there employees life. I really dont think the money we get paid is enough for a 12 hour shift"
good,"Only worked partime while in school and fulltime all the hours I wanted during the summer.  "
good,"Poor management,no good leader ships.Employers talked to you in disrespectful manners.The money was ok but employees wasn't treated equally.Had to drive 35 miles from home"
good,The only thing I liked was you meet new costumers and how different people ran there farms other than that most of the time I was going to work filling my truck up with empty egg racks and getting out of there the job was easy but sometimes you had to find work because you get paid every week so finding 40 hours was hard when it was cut backs every other month
good,"Live haul manager and supervisor are understanding. There's  no advancements for some of you with a colorful past. Pay could be a little better, demand for poultry keeps job security."
good,I was employed here for fourteen months.From day one I noticed a culture of poor work ethics. Management was know for placing responsibility back in workers if questions were raised as to their willingness or ability the create improvements for workforce.
good,I was able to take care of my home. And have a good stable life for my family. Loved the pay it's better than minimum wage. And u get a raise every year
good,"nothing to say about Sanderson Farms, they like for employees to work long hours, I worked in the HR office and worked long hours and sometimes I had to work 7 days a week."
good,Would work in feed mill or Hatchery .High turnover inside the Plant. And poor ethics and management in the live haul. Some laws you are expected to fallow and others you are not. They say they want your input but look at you like you are stupid when you do. The supervisor wanted everyone to do his job as well as there own while he couldn't even show up to work on time
good,"A typical day at work consists of different tasks assigned by the supervisor, There's not a specific job assigned daily. The job differs everyday. I learned patience, temperance, and how to handle hardships. The management doesn't know to much about the jobs that they inherited.. they are more like slave drivers and they blame the employee for everything. Such as: Making policies up and make employees sign them without having the policy properly written up and approved by the corporate office. My co-workers are good people who are caught up in the cross fires and are afraid to speak up in fear of the jobs being taken. The hardest part of the job was just keeping your temper in check, take all of the verbal abuse, and Pray that the supervisors don't get in your face and begin swearing at you. The most enjoyable thing about the job was that my co-workers had a sense of humor and everybody got along and made the day easier to bear."
good,Work long days but will pay well if you work hard and reach goals
good,Overall Sanderson Farms was an okay place to work but the night shift management could have used a little work
good,The pay was excellent but I would not consider going back. I am changing careers.
good,"Very high hourly/salary turn over rate, every peice of equipment breaks, and maintenance never fixes it right. I was responsible for the day to day operations of the production line. Manage 36 employees work schedule and training. Make sure employees are making proper cuts while deboning thighs, and are cutting their rates of 12 pieces per minute. Maintain employee’s time sheets. Responsible for ensuring employees perform proper meat cutting techniques and maintain a constant flow of the product line."
good,Every job is not for everybody and this job is no exception. The benefits and the pay are above average. The hours are long and unpredictable.  The turnover rate is very high.
good,"It was cold had to dress suitable . The work was easy but the supervision was poor . I feel like the work schedule was unorganized. If the job was more understanding, the work place would have been better ."
good,Good company good benefits  great people! It’s a great company to work for!! Management takes the time to help & assist with all you questions or concerns
good,Tray packets are time you have to pack 32 piece a min.breast meat trenders 60 and the have the cone line most people go to the cone line you will hurt for a couple of weeks because you are  use mussels you never use sometimes you make have swollen hands they stared you on shoulder you will be train but you have to be able to do your do job the first week you work 4 hours the second week you work 6 hours third week you on 8 hours
good,The job was stressful and cold. The supervisor would talk and treat you any kind of way. Management to my point of veiw was every where its like they didnt know what they wanted to do.
good,"It's a good place to work for, to much drama and favoritism. The supervisor has the pick and choose. And the will work you like a slave. Don't have enough people to work on all lines"
good,It's ok not everyone is bad people to work soth. The pay is good and the benefits. I would only have to say if you go there do your job you want have a problem working there
good,"Immediate supervisors yell and curse you even though you are doing your job and lets lazy no working people be lazy. I enjoyed working hard, however the yelling and cursing for no reason took it's toll."
good,"You have to learn your job and keep up the pace. No lacking have to keep your line full at all times. Can’t be 1 minute late always on time, and easy to get wrote up"
good,Very High Stress low reward job.  Schedule is always up in the air in regards to working weekends. Tough to schedule things.  What have you done for me lately management mentality.
good,"The job is very fast paced in has very high retention rate due to work schedule, but has a lot of opportunity for advancement if you are willing to work hard for long hours including weekends and some holidays."
good,"The job was actually not very fast but it was a place where you can achieve very little if you don't keep moving. Holding Room is very cold temperature and you ware a lot of clothing, so it helps your body to stay cold if you are not moving very fast as your line performs."
good,This job is fairly easy and I learned a lot. The hardest part of the job is dealing with things that are out of your control such as the machines or work left over from others. The management is horrible. The most enjoyable part is some of the coworkers that you get along with and they become family.
good,Work hard and focus on reason that you have a job.The work in Specialty is very physical straining due to man vs machine.  You are working at speed of machine that constantly on.
good,"Supervisor aren’t respectful, This place is like failure. They don’t want employers to succeed & try different departments. Lack of respect at this factory. Honestly"
good,"Cool paying job, Very cold, Can be laid back depending on the job you are doing, People out there can be very messy and dramatic, supervisors will talk to you any kind of way if you let them"
good,"Decent company, had great benefits. At times, very demanding. I worked 20 hours in one day as an example. Management can be difficult. They are not willing to own up to mistakes and will pawn off on low level employees. High turnover rate due to these issues. Attendance point system is very strict. I was told my doctor appointments would be grouped together, but 2 weeks later was told corporate office decided not to group together and it pushed me over my limit."
good,"Very stressful. We were told we had the usual holidays and, up until this year, we had them. This year we worked Memorial Day and July 4, including the days preceding and following while the holidays counted as absences."
good,"Sanderson Farm has an alright work environment. They have a nice set up, as far as, getting your supplies and returning to your work area. its a good job nevertheless."
good,The over-all company is a great place to work for and have great benefits but if you're a single mother Sanderson farm is not the ideal place to work. The management shows favortism when it comes down to who gets fired or who stays.
good,"This job is very productive and not really hard to do. The environment is very cold, slippery and wet. Supervisors are very respectful and friendly. The pay is also great."
good,"The company has its perks, but over all management and staff have poor work ethic. Only the big bosses handled business and the floor supervisors only did their jobs when their bosses were around."
good,"very unorganized improper training just a place where I wouldn't wanna work, the hardest part of the job is keeping up with the tray packer while tryna keep the lines up very tough task."
good,"Good Job. very challenging, long hours, no time off if you are a salary person. I like the opportunity to change the culture and expectations of the maintenance dept."
good,"the supervisors want you to work at a pace that is impossable."
good,"Good beginning job, has poor management, not respectful to employees or sympathetic.  Does not promote motivation."
good,laid back job but very cold coworkers was ok didnt bother anyone
good,"Hard, you have to be prepared to never be late. Like ever. Breaks are shorter than they say(or at least that's what it felt like). But great pay overall, if you can make it."
good,When you miss work you are required to get a doctors note but you're guaranteed to get sick within the 3 months it takes for the insurance to kick in.
good,I don’t really know what to say about Sanderson they fired me for something I didn’t do I want to come back but I might need to just keep my job we’re im at
good,Hard work as a team . Dependability. The ability to lift things and move at fast paced and to also adapt to temperature changes and work under extreme pressure.
good,I never had a bad day at Sanderson farms it's a lot of great people to work around everybody fair is good to work a borrow a lot of positive what can I say you wouldn't want more
good,Just be prepared to move at fast Pace with hands and the hours were descent and workers were friendly but it takes awhile to get use to it . But as far as the work it's not hard it just hurts and every day depending on what crew your on they will switch u up and you will do something new each day benefits are great if you can make it past 90 day mark.
good,A great place to work fast past and good hours mangers are really understandable pay is also good if you like working i he cold this a great place to work
good,It's an alright company. I've been working there for 6 months now. I've been offered different positions but it's hard to get transfered to the Department that u really want.
good,"A typical day at work for me consisted of being a team leader in my department. I began working there, as a regular employee, then was promoted to team leader."
good,To increase the culture to be more respectful to each other the live-haul department would do well to set stricter guidelines. There could be more emphasis on safety before placing anyone in any (no matter how seemingly simple) job. Safety and culture needs improvement.
good,sanderson farms is a very fast paced employer with very little down time. the company has a good benefit package and will allow you to make a pretty decent living
good,Here’s the thing. At first I liked it but then things started going down hill. In the department I worked in we had a lot of people who have been working there before I even got the job. They were really good and our numbers were up but for some odd reason those 5 people that were excellent at their job left or got fired. Meaning we were always short. There was drama in my department too. Everything was unorganized and the work days drained. Our supervisor would tell us one thing and then the superintendent would tell us another thing it was confusing. Once they hired new people they would have us train the new people but take them away and place them in the upstairs area. The hours I worked were crazy. I got overtime every day and I like overtime but it was starting to drain me.
good,Very hars work place disturbing and alot of times unprofessional. The rules are always changed accordingly some people get away with certain things and some dont.
good,"some of the people there were a joy to work with and some weren't, the often beat around the bush when it came to your well being, I would never consider going back if I could"
good,It’s a good pace to start up quickly to make good money but they don’t only care about meeting quotas in that facility and that can become a bit over welling at times especially with rude supervisor who don’t know how to run there area!
good,I would like to go back there and work it was a good paying job.The  pay was good the first shift hours was very acceptable.The work environment was good
good,The job is a fun environment if you just starting out in the work field but if you want to advance your career very best to go somewhere else but if you're looking to settle and find with contingency then is the job for you.
good,"Getting paid weekly, getting all your hours was the best thing about the job , you have to learn how to do things yourself  which can be confusing but eventually you’ll get it down"
good,This company was great as far as pay and the work was pretty easy.  Now the wad looking work hours but that came with nice pay checks.  So I guess you can't complain. It's cold but you are issued a freezer suit that does alt I'd justice.
good,Fun place to work every one got alone the work was fast pace but easy hanging live birds on a hanger yea it was a job but I will say it was worth the experience
good,It was a ok environment to work in but I never felt like my job was secure no matter how hard I worked. I never really felt like we were team friendly
good,"On a assembly line cutting I cut the right shoulder of a chicken, also trimming breast, and rounding wings. It was very important that you know how to move in a very fast pace. The work place was very cold and wet. The hardest part of the job was cutting shoulder and rounding wings because it always had my hand hurting. What I love most about the job was the pay and the benefits."
good,Stay to yourself if you want to make it as a worker there. Easy work and great pay. Supervisors is ok and you get good vacation time. Easy to get on at the job.
good,"Working conditions were poor, breaks were extremely short, and there was often a great deal of drama, but over all if you could stand the working conditions then the job was ok."
good,"I will choose not to say anything negative about this company. I will simply say, I sought other form of employment based on my character and desire to earn more."
good,Can't move up. Worked at Sanderson Farms for three years and I am stuck. I applied for a supervisor position since the start of 2018 just to be turned down because of a driving record or because I don't kiss up.
good,"Not too much to say, the pay was ok but you better be ready to stand in one spot for long periods of time. It was a ok overall for the time being but I need something better"
good,"You are cutting raw chicken standing up in a 10 degrees warehouse."
good,I really hated dis job the managers are just very bad the job itself is not bad it's just the people and the managers that make the job a whole lot worse than it really is.
good,Sanderson Farms is poultry business which requires hard-work and dedication. The job itself requires being able to multitask and stand for long periods of time but overall it has great pay.
good,"I love my Job dearly,but l love team work with is hard to find @Sanderson..Men will not lift anything for women..Women Struggle with heavy equipment all the time..Must do better..Leaders are not on Ine accord when it come down to helping with personal issues..So Supervisor need more traing and know how to treat people general.."
good,"Making sure that the equipment is ready to start the day of production. the rest of the day is waiting on something to brake unless theres a call to help another tech do a job that requires more than one person. and if its slow even if it doesn't require two people just to make the day go by faster and help my fellow employee and help production out as well. We all have to live in this world together why not make it a much better an enjoyable place to live and work."
good,It was alright pay just not enough and not for a person with more potential.  The men there look at all the women as a piece of meat and make uncalled for remarks. Not a family oriented job.
good,"This is the best place to work. It a good place even if it stinky at time but you will get use to the smell. Depends on what part you work in it cold be cold or hot, other wise it a great place."
good,Typical work day at Sanderson very hands on fast - pace working environment lovely staff and management. Typically work 10 - 12 hours a night with overtime available.
good,The Hardest Part Of My Job at Sanderson Farm was when we had to do the morning shift chicken and it was so much chicken .then if the shoulder cutters couldn`t cut there chicken right we had to pull then apart jush to cut the breast
good,hard work up until breaks which only lasted 7 mins that seem like two it was very cold and long hours it seem because of repetitious packing and stacking chicken
good,Very fast-paced and at times very stressful. Mandatory weekend work for maintenance. You could possibly go 20 days in a row without getting a day off.
good,"Fast paced job, loved the employees but management wasn't where it needed to be. a great company to work for. The company has high expectations for supervisors and employees but some front office help is uneducated when it comes down to rules and regulations."
good,Hard work and cold all the time. Alot of the same job daily. People were friendly and fun to work with though.They work the salaried employees to death. So  you actually give back your check.
good,"Management doesn't take personal lives into consideration. Family felt I was more dedicated to my job than them.  Quick to move up in the workplace, even quicker too get fired"
good,I was in evis2 I learn everything I could in the department.I was a back up Qc .. I learn how too get along with everyone also too do my job safely. ..it was hard work
good,"Although I did not remain with Sanderson Farm very long due to relocating, I really enjoyed that it was a fast paced job.  I stayed busy my entire shift so my day would go by pretty quick."
good,its a very cut throat stressful job that will make u wonder is it really worth it the pay is good but the management sucks big time. so if you don't like the cold its not for you
good,"I learned many different skills, and many different methods of doing the work in the departments. Always fast paced but needed to be thorough, and accurate for inspection purposes, and also for sanitation."
good,"sanderson farms is very well paying company with much good understanding supervisors even super superintendents. i must admit it is fast paced at times depending on  your department that you work in , etc."
good,I worked hard everyday. Helping others if needed. was able to learn and work in more than one area in the plant. I learned a lot of things being able to work here and there.
good,"Sanderson& farms was a very hard place to work allot workers was in/out so fast I was like what is going on in this place , but I soon realize it was how the work was being done a bad method for production"
good,I wouldn't advise someone to work there. They do not care about your health. the only thing they are certain about is the product. someone of the managers have a lot of favoritism.
good,I enjoyed working at this company and I would like to work there again. I can get to work because It's in Kinston. The day went fast because you were busy most of the time. Everyone was willing to show you new things and give you time to learn. Great company to work for.
good,Working there was fun but management could use Improvement.The staff is cool but not to understanding. My job was good and easy for me but my supervisor and I didn't see eye to eye.
good,"I enjoyed coming to work everyday and enjoyed having every weekend off!! Sanderson Farms has great benefits for you and your family and can make work a fun place. Unfourtantly I had to leave due to absents that was family related and the management would not see me out! I have had no prior problems with the company or other employers, so I would say Sanderson Farms needs to work on showing more care for their employees."
good,"Sanderson Farms, Inc. is a productive workplace with a competitive  environment and pay.  Still needs improvement on management and personnel areas. The work environment is strict and intense. Also it is very fast paced and stressful. In my opinion, I would not recommend a friend to work there."
good,I liked working there but they had such long hours and they was very strict. Had to work some Saturdays when it was a holiday which i didnt like that either but I did like seeing the paycheck when it came in.
good,i worked night from 1 pm to 7:30 pm cleaning the plant after productions six days week. I learn how to clean machine and using chemicals.  Management  was not good at all
good,"Steady pace at times"
good,Working at Sanderson farms was very fast paced I worked hanging live chickens... The working conditions were very nasty because you have chicken urinating and fieces flying on you while your picking them up to hang up on shackles they also bite and fight their way out your grasp
good,"It could have went better but who am i to complain, it was work and that is all that matters. I was able to make money and provide for my family and that is all that matters."
good,"standing long hours of the day , bending , stretching, working with other people in a cold environments, lifting 40lbs-70lbs with help, with excellent pay."
good,hard work only the strong can survive the work is hard the people are terrible so are the supervisors they have a policy that is crazy but its works at the most part
good,I like it when I work there it has good benfits you get paid every week you off on weekends you can get in 401k you get holiday pay you get paid for your birthday
good,Very cold workplace you have to get use to it and that could take months it was good pay and it went up over time I just couldn't get used to it. I am a very hard worker and I will prove that.
good,"I did all the shipping and receiving of the chicken to go out for sale at the local stores, I also packaged was to go out and really what was need to do to get the sales out"
good,A good environment with nice people around you conpetive pay. I got good benefits and I will be there at night and I was wondering if you could give me a call.
good,"Clocked in and went straight to our stations to get started. Job was simple, I manned the station I was at filling and preparing for production and so did the other guy. But once the other guy got fired I was held responsible for holding down the upstairs operation and production of red and green jumbo boxes. So some nights the production would be easy and some other nights it would be crazy how fast they expected these boxes to be made. I would have both machines running at full speed and still empty. Even throwing the extras I would be behind. I think the management needed to balance out the orders better or create another line to reach the expected production. Hardest part was meeting the goals which were met one better days. Most enjoyable was it was an hard days work for a honest day's pay."
good,First of all would not recommend this job unless you can work really hard. Pain is a constant thing. The old are  worked very hard. Hate working with a bunch of kids and grown people who act like kids. Stopping lines all night long. Throwing meat on the floor. Picking meat off flour putting it with clean meat. Supervisors pretend they don't see it. we get two 12 min. breaks Most go to bathroom stay 10 min. Don't forget spitting on the floors gross. wearing nail polish. Ok for management to wear it but not the worker same with wearing false nails. It's seem like it also ok for managers to touch meat with bare hands.
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. My co-workers were considered as family. My supervisor was very easy to get alone with. I would recommend this job.
good,"All and all it is a place that separates the strong from the weak.  I should say the immoral from the moral.  Very demanding with too many variables out of ones control.  And im speaking of the production side not any other department.  Best way to put it is each person looks out for themselves and not for one another.  Management is fearful and one minded no matter the proof. communication wise, theres issues that need working on especially responsibility.  typical corporate America mentality."
good,Pay was ok.people was real friendly. It was always something to do there. In all good place to work. But breaks wasnt all that long so a 30min break be like 15min
good,It was a fast paced and productive job. I worked on the assembly line and I enjoyed it. They uped their pay for starting off so the paychecks were pretty good and we got paid weekly.
good,Came in early left late. Supervised two other knife sharpeners. Learned to work fast but also safe. Had to be highly dependable.
good,every one was great the company the co workers managers etc. Great experience in learning the produce lines of assembly my job was to cut chicken breast three ways to trimming fats .the hardest part of the job was when the lines speed up and the workers cant keep up it makes you strive harder to get the job done.
good,"Working with live chickens was fun.  Having to pick them up properly and place in shackles.  Sometimes it is difficult to keep clothes clean because of the dirt or mud on chickens, but I liked the job."
good,"It's a good fast paced work environment. But if you work in evisceration except for it to be HOT. The nursing staff and office staff are nice. The management trys their best to take care of their employees given how many people they have to watch out for. But if you are not careful though you will loose your job due to the ""point system"". Which is ridiculous because if you have any kids and have to take one to the hospital then it goes against you. Even if you get a doctor's note for that day it still gets counted against you. And if you get 6 absentees against you then you get suspended for like 3-5 days. And if you get back up to 6 absentees you get terminated. But the upside of working there is that you get to your year pay fast. And every December you get a small raise due to the cost of living going up each year."
good,Unfortunately it was impossible for me to do my job to th ebest of my ability due to the extreme cold. I was unable to grasp and bend fingers quickly enough for the 8 hrs due to extreme cold. even when home pain and numbness continued for hours at times.
good,Everyday we performed the duties as assigned in a accurate and efficient manner.  Always worked in a team environment to perform the duties in an accurate and safe manner.
good,"This was a better place to work. It was more organized than some other places, but the reason I lost this job was. The fact that I was on third shift and left to fend for myself with only one supervisor in the building. The sanitation workers took advantage of me."
good,"A typical day at work would involve the belts on the line being broken and a wait on the belt being fixed by maintenance. The hard part is still trying to continue your job while everything else in breaking down around you. The co-workers how ever make it a enjoyable environment to be in and makes the day go by faster. Management seem to not have that much respect for employees however, the compensation and benefits make the time there bearable. I have picked up a couple skills tips and tricks to leading a group of individuals"
good,"Large competitive company.  Very stressful place to work for, must produce the numbers wanted on a daily basis.  Normal drama and politics, just like every company.  If you can look past that and just do your job consistently and stay focused you will succeed.  Co workers are the key that keep you going to work each day.  You forget the corporate stuff and just go for them so that you don't leave them alone daily to deal with the stressful task the day brings.  Every day is an eventful day in the life of animals."
good,i hate working at sanderson because of the management. it was poor management favoritism was shown. I would never work there agasin if its still under the same mangement i use to dread waking up at 5am to go to work there.
good,Sanderson Farms Inc is a poultry plant located in Moultrie Ga that distributes chicken to many of the local vendors in Moultrie and other surrounding cities.
good,"This business has an high turnover rate of its employees because the management team.  They simply don't know how to talk to or treat their employees.  The pay is good with excellent benefits but you cant treat other adults any kind of way and then still expect to be successful.  They will continue to pay to retrain new employees until they change how management talks to and treats the supervisors and employees,"
good,"Normal days were relatively manageable, sometimes stressful due to unexpected things happening within our workspace. Management within our area used to be unpleasant at first but eventually changed over the year. The people that I worked with were easy to get along with since everyone pitched in to work together to get through our work-shifts. And the most enjoyable part of the job was knowing I did my work properly."
good,"This job was cool and nasty at the same time.I was in charge of the kill room.My duties included blood removal,clean up and the proper life removal of the chickens."
good,"A good place to work with advancement potential.  Need to find better ways to reduce employee injuries.  Could do a better job in how it handles absences.  With the number of women employees, the company needs to offer at least one weekday off along with one day on the weekend for those who have children and need a weekday off to handle business that can't be otherwise handled on the weekend."
good,Its hard work always on the move to get the machines back up and running. Management takes care of you if you are doing everything right.
good,"great help came in time when I least expected"
good,This job I only worked weekends so I did not spend as much time there. I was contracted to Sanderson Farms to do some welding. I liked the Farm just fine.
good,A typical day at Sanderson Farm was pretty easy. The work was not hard. Sanderson Farm allow every employee advancement opportunities.
good,The work environment was extremely dangerous. The plant was extremely hot and dusty. I liked the job but the union did do there part to protect the worker when it came to labor disputes.
good,It was a good place to work. I really enjoyed the people that i worked with. The hardest part of the day was the rework. The most enjoyable part of the job was the hours.
good,It was a good job to have. I had great co-workers and great stability.The job was really simple and easy.
good,fast paced and keeps you busy. most employees were polite. the hardest part is dealing with the cold temperatures.
good,Its just like going to school I always said. Clock in at 7:30 work until 4:15. You're doing the same exact thing repeatdley so once you leanr there is no hard part. Co workers are the coolest thing about the job. No comment on managment. Most enjoyable part of the job was friday/payday.
good,"Day at work/ Picking up boxes"
good,"Sanderson Farms is fast-paced, but once you get used to what your doing, its really nothing to it."
good,It was okay. It was a dirty wet job. I enjoyed when it was quitting time.
good,N/A Rather not talk about working with this company. The money is good and insurance is good is all I will say about Sanderson Farm.
good,the job was ok but had some miss understanding with some of the managers.
good,Very personable for the most part. My crew was fantastic. My organizational skills improved here.
good,Day to day is very fast paced and constant attention. Very time sensitive and very labor intensive.
good,It was just long and hard work. Short breaks not much to really say.
good,"Working at the Farms was good for the pay and benefits, but I personally didn't like the work environment or the labor. They are very tight on attendance so make sure you are on time, all the time."
good,Sanderson Farms is a productive plant that's all about work & safety. I learned a lot of techniques on how to hang live birds. My live hang crew was very productive & worked as a team
good,"Good place to work, good pay, great benefits, but no flexible schedules so it's hard being a working mother. They do have paid holidays and vacations."
good,The job is ok. The management no so good! I think some of the supervisor out there show lots of favoritism. The management is real low down. When I say management I mean the supervisor in the production area. I actually liked my job most of the time I was there. I met some nice and kind supervisor and Co workers over the time I was there.
good,"This job was demanding, fast paced, and you learned all the departments. The workers were collaborative and management was tough. I stayed with this company cause you were guaranteed hours."
good,I love my job & ain’t going anywhere. Iv been working there for going on 6 years . Longest iv been there I love to work all woke no play it’s time to get it ..
good,Great work place just needs improvement in management and medical crew. Supervisors there actually do help with training and making it easier. Overall it’s a nice place to work long term
good,It was good till things dont go how it should. I like working there I just went there for the money it was good overtime was ask if you wanted to stay.. I was there for almost 5 years it went by fast
good,Great company to work for just need the right leaders in place. I work there for 9years a lot of people don't make it 9days it wasn't easy but I made the best of it. plus I like a challenge.
good,Having the opportunity to be apart of an environment such as this gives you an opportunity to reevaluate your personal health and well being. It is a cut throat environment and expectations are mostly set above normal.
good,"Typical work day was approximately 10 hours"
good,You have to be careful you do not get hurt. Fast pace because orders need to be meet and can not let it get backed up. Need to be on alert in order to avoid getting g hurt
good,"A typical day day at work starts with team work. I've learned that hard work and patience pays off.  The management team works hard to get the orders out weekly. The workplace culture is friendly and they work hard to keep us safe and protected. The hardest part of the job is geeting more paid time off, sick leave, personal days. The most enjoyable part of this job are the friendships that are made with co-works."
good,Sometimes it can be ok depending on your co workers and supervisor long as you work it can be ok other than that it's hard at times being focused is the key
good,"work was work i go in and so my job. drama free learning how to stack boxes on the line onto the pallet. manger u have some that appreciate your hard work, and some that didnt care if they saw you or not. we work in the freezer it can get difficult when when the line is not pull and you can get back up, because the line doesnt stop. me on the power jack or forklift helping for our department run smoothe no manger on our back because we dont give them a reason. Just work and go home"
good,"Isn’t the best job nor the worst, the attendance policy is alittle harsh, should be a 5 minute grace time in my opinion, the lunches are very short as well."
good,Typical work day was cold because of the temperature that the plant had to be. I learned that working in a plant is diffidently a team effort if you want to meet your production. Management was strict but it was good. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the cold weather in the plant. Most enjoyable was learning the different things that you could do and how fast you could move up in the company.
good,Pretty good company more of a retirement place than a career unless you can get moved up pretty fast but the work is fairly easy and simple but if your looking for a place to retire with benefits that’s it
good,"A typical day involved restocking material, boxing up product, using hand jack to move pallets, and keeping the floor clean at all times. The hardest part of the job was doing a three man job with only two people."
good,Nice work environment especially with the team work of others in the company. Great communication skills and good work ethic. I love to work as a team with my coworkers as long as they are team players. I enjoy knowing that im doing my job correctly and complete its the best satisfaction.
good,At one point I loved coming to work at Sanderson Farms. I first started out hanging live chickens. I was motivated by my coworkers everyday. Once I got my job down packed I was motivating others. Then I started training as a forklift operator in 2008 and I been operating every since then.
good,"The pay was a little low for QA and they worked you to death. Unlike most companies the QA here has to do the HACCP work also, along with lab tests and anything else... all for 13.50"
good,Its a easy job just be there on time clock in and out treat them how you wanted to be treated but its really a job not for the week its gone make you want to quit
good,"I had the hardest job at the plant: Live Hang, and it was the hardest  job I ever had, making $14.50 an hour. The benefits were great, but working at a production plant, the work is always fast paced. The turnover rate is extremely high. Not everyone can do it because it is extremely physical in live hang, especially just starting out. That said, if I had not moved, I would still be working there because when I went to work, I went to work, so my body eventually adapted to the fast-paced work. If you are not highly motivated, don't bother. You'll save yourself and the company the time and effort."
good,"The job is fast-paced, not for the faint of heart. Guaranteed forty hours a week with weekly pay. It's better to stay to yourself since some coworkers are very messy."
good,"Good paying job, but the environment is unsanitary. Constant standing , short breaks , unfollowed procedures, management sometimes don't know what they want to do. Constant moving from one department to another."
good,Ok place to work if management likes you. Management can make it hard on you just because you're different. Co workers are great and willing to help tho
good,"Sanderson Farm did not pay a good amount of money per hour, and its not a job i can see myself doing for 15 plus years. A typical work day at Sanderson farm begins with me picking up the slack of co-workers and ends the same way. The managers and supervisors yell completely too much. The most enjoyable part is knowing that I'm going to get a check at the end of the week."
good,This company loves to give promotional opportunity to their employees. Their health care benefits are amazing. They also gives employee bonuses.
good,"Sanderson Farms was the first factory I ever worked for. They teach you everything you need to know, unlike some. "
good,Task are demanding and sometime difficult to perform. management  is always riding your backs about task and not seeing what kind of problem you are encountering.
good,It was fast paced work place. Although it was often cold the and some of the employees where required to handle raw products it wasn't too bad. I on the other hand also I experience in packing the products and getting them ready for shipment during my time with company.
good,"An average day is tiring doing the same thing over &over ,supervisors who do not care about you,messy co-worker,and back to the same the next day...."
good,A company that processes poultry for customers in large quantities. The product reaches the customer in good quality. It's then dispersed to various locations for consumers to purchase.
good,most of the employees there don’t like to be told how to do a job a certain way and get mad then wants to fight. you have to learn a job properly doesn’t  matter if its from someone younger or older than the learner
good,I'll work there again if given the opportunity my friends and family all work there its ben a big part of my life as far as taking care of my family expenses and benefits they insurance and 401k and ESOP are great to help u save for the future and take care of unexpected occurrences
good,Sanderson Farm is a great company but it is a lot of favoritism that goes on. The company needs to do unannounced pop- ups to really see what's going on with their employees.
good,good paying company hard label got to be willing to work hard over all good benefits some a lot of jobs do not have pretty much a good job very bad smell
good,"Average work week has been 60-80 hours, 50 hours average was advertised. very early mornings and very late nights, some weekends expected. A lot of physically demanding work that takes a very long time to complete. Work is expected to get done once its assigned no matter how long it takes to complete."
good,cutting chicken open and making sure the line with running geat great benefits and off days. Supervisors help you if you have any problems with coming in and if you need days off for important things.
good,"working in all weather conditions in certain departments. They have different shifts all year round, get major holidays off. Good benefits, decent price for insurance. Only place in McComb, MS to make good money really quick"
good,"typical day its just not good on your body. Its a lot of repetitive movement and its bad for your hands and body, I was diagnosed with carpal tunnel when i was working there."
good,Really dont have much to say bout the company we work we get paid thats how life go I just like working in getting paid thats about it Sanderson farms
good,I learned a lot when I work at Sanderson Farmm I knew how to inspect chicken's plus know what to look for in the grocery store. It was very important to know what to looking for when I went to buy chicken for my family.
good,"Its a nice work place. It also have great benefits for you and your family. The company pays weekly every friday, once your shift is over. The work is kind of hard, but after two weeks, you get use to the work and environment."
good,Manger was rude and disrespectful the work isn't that hard just cold long hours good pay friendly work environment benefits room for advancement and raises
good,"It was a good jod to have. I worked on the outside. Cutting grass. Picking up paper. Working on sprinkler head if they blow of. Replacing them with new ones,Etc."
good,When you need a job and you aren’t afraid of a little hard work then come on to Sanderson! Great pay and great benefits! But don’t let them know you NEED your job or they will treat you as such! The managers talk to you like they’re prison guards! It’s not easy for anybody with PRIDE! If you have a bad attitude and temper then don’t apply!!! Come in prepared to work and don’t tell anybody your business! Do your job and go home!
good,"sanderson farms is a great place to work. Decent hours and benefits. Great management, great people to work with in a friendly environment. Easy to advance in career."
good,"You need a tough skin and a guarded heart to be a front-line supervisor at these types of places. The company vision, mission, and philosophy and ground rules are all good, but trying to apply it to day-to-day you may lose your way at times. It's challenging and can be rewarding. It can also be heartbreaking and not worth all the money in the world. It's the poultry business. I've been told you need to be one of the ""good ole boys"" to have it easier in this business. I'm coming up on 2 years and I (literally) can't stomach it any more."
good,"My typecially day is to get pallets to put the trays on. Then go upstairs to get some trays at least 2 bundles at a time.. My supervisor was the sorrirest supervisor i ever had... Also, she wasn't fairly towards me and didn""t know who to talk to me in a respectful way. The most enjoyable thing i like bout the job is that i learn different things to do and paid days, when its time to go home."
good,"Not really sure what they want me to review. If it's my prior job with Sanderson then I'll say it was quite the experience. I really enjoyed the job I did, and I knew what I did was important. To make sure our chicken was safe for consumers. They just don't appreciate their emplyees"
good,not much of a positive place to work.  only thing good about that place is a paycheck to look forward to every Friday and weekends off. you have to have bachelor's to even be considered a high position if not you are stuck with eight hours of strenuous labor
good,"To the line by 7:30 each morning with all required equipment and ready to work. The work was very repetitive, and I was required to keep up with the flow of work and have so much meat cut in a certain amount of time. Sometimes I had the time and opportunity to help others once my work was done."
good,"This is great company with great advancement opportunity and benefits. They need a little work within the operational management team, at least at the facility I work at, but overall it was great. You can sometimes lose great employees when there's a lack of the necessary conflict resolution skills to man such a fast paced and large company. Just need a little work on their culture within their operational facilities. Overall great place to be vested and grow."
good,"The job paid good, but in any company there are problems. Management was very cruel and workers were very upset all the time. Most days they really did not want to come to work."
good,A typical day at work is even-paced and pretty organized. Very diverse group of people to work with. Work task difficulty varies by your ability to adapt. The hardest part to adjust to is the temperature which isn't to extreme unless you're in the freezer department. The most enjoyable part of the job was the consistent pay raises.
good,Sanderson has a great benefit package (especially the insurance) and they give yearly raises. This is a very cold and busy place to work with long hours.
good,check attendace then go to the start up meeting then walk the production floor making sure the area is usda approved make sure everyone has on there safety gear  on  now ready for start up
good,"12 hours 3-4 days a week"
good,"Sanderson Farms is a company that has come a long way, but it still has a long way to go. The benefits at Sanderson are excellent. The opportunity for advancement is there. Morale in the company is that great. Long hours and it pays decent."
good,I really just went to work and got on the line and did my job. I learned how to cut chicken a proper way. I met new hard working friends. The most enjoyable part was when friday came and we finished up the week.
good,Some days may be more relaxed than others depending on orders made. The hardest part of the job is when one department falls behind which causes the process of the job to speed up
good,"staying focused,hard work,well organized,different personalities,there is no hard part as long as u doing what u r suppose to do,getting thru the day"
good,"Large stable company with excellent opportunities for advancement up the corporate ladder.  Expect to work long hours, endure lots of stress, work with difficult personalities and bite your tongue."
good,"Great benefits, great pay. You never gonna necessarily like or love a job correct? But when the money is good & plentiful on a weekly basis your gonna maintain!"
good,Checked all labels took pictures of pallets making sure it was the correct pallet going on to the truck and loaded the truck after we loaded all trucks we sanitized our work area and cleaned up
good,"I worked for sanderson farms for almos 10 yrs, i had a good expierence working for this company. "
good,"Sanderson farm is a great company just has to be some improvements in certain area. Employee trainings and management improvements, will help maximize production out of each employee and each supervisor. Which makes for a great team and improves employee production"
good,Not a very good training program for me. No one seems to know what to do with me and I have been doing more non skilled labor than skilled labor. Management is very young and inexperienced.
good,I have learned a lot throughout this company. I have advance every task I was given. We work a fast paced. Eight hours day five days a week. The management is okay but need improvement.
good,"Work day was 8 hours, was a pretty good work place only problem was short breaks. Very diverse work culture had a very understanding supervisor, only priblen was standing in one place all day"
good,"Hard Work But Pays Awesome, Learned Alot Working Here & Would Love To Come Back. Supervisors Are Pretty Cool So It Made The That Much Easier, Bottle Line It's Worth It!"
good,"Inspect meat all day in the cold "
good,"Very fast paced work environment, poultry production, ability to operate machinery, etc"
good,It's a great job for people that doesn't get a chance in the real world because of background checks. It's a productive job.
good,"They expect a lot out of you in the beginning. They do train you gradually, which is helpful, but they don’t tell you how you mess up your hands dealing with certain aspects of the job. Don’t go into it with a sense of knowledge, try to learn everything you can, and just do your job and you’ll do fine"
good,Overall good place to work. Loved it while I was there. If given the opportunity I would go back and work there in a heartbeat. I definitely would recommend someone to go there and work.
good,Loved the job wasn’t hard work just cold the people at the job made u feel welcome and they showed me step by step how to do the work and was very patient
good,you will have to experience it yourself. To get the outcome of a difference in a work environment. You will receive what endure.If you enjoy working. You can't walk into the doors of Sanderson Farm thinking what you were told.
good,it is a fast pace company to work for with good benefits off Saturday and Sundays they have first and second shift good coworkers u can move up with the company if u want to there is co-workers that move up with the company fast
good,Nice mworkmanship  fast pace most be on time job but it can worn you down I have retired from Sanderson farm but I would recommend it was the best job I ever had. Cc
good,I think you should be paid more with the amount of work that has to be done in 8 hours. The lunches and breaks are not nearly long enough to rest. It became really stressful!
good,Very good checks and barely work on weekends. Also nice people out there. Wished I could stayed longer but had to get surgery and didn't go back. Everyone had there different opinions.
good,this job had a lot going on in the inside of that company. they hired supervisors that was not doing they job correctly and not hearing there employers when they needed to be heard.
good,their double standards most supervisors don't have people skills  worked independent worst part working 12 and 16 hour days when they find you know your job they drive until you're broke down
good,able to work in different areas of the warehouse never a dull moment
good,"This job was good, I had a set work schedule with overtime sometimes"
good,Sanderson farms is a good place to work for awhile until about 3 months and there is no chickens and not that much work. Also you have to wait 3 months to get paid .

good,"sandersons farm is a hard working job. u have to come ready to work everyday. you will work what u are getting paid for . the people that i worked with made my job fun and worth waking up and going to. this job was not for everyone, you have to want to work to make it at Sanderson farm."
good,"Have to be on time. Very clean enironment, have to have a speed. And very absoruing. Management is very strict.The hardest is when you are getting  timed for how many chickens you can put on the tray.I learned to be a quit learner, and to push myself in all situation"
good,It teaches you how to work well with others. Very cold environment. But some of the supervisors do show a lot of favoritism. And you must be able to work at a steady pace.
good,Well my job was quite easy. I worked with 12 other people and we made boxes all as well as run machines that's what I did for the eight hours that I was at work.
good,I had a the worst time of my life at that job. it was working at a fast past all night long . it was very cold in the production areas.
good,for me a typical work day was to be the line on time with your apron knife and cutting glub. i learn how to cut a perfect wing. the hardest part of the job was to get use to the long ride there and back. i enjoy been on the lines. and meeting new people.
good,Working as a team enable employees to pull together to get things out in a timely manner
good,"My workplace is alright.  A person can grow within the company, and they will help you with finances for school.  While on the job, you get an opportunity to get cross trained.  Management is o.k. and my co-workers are just like any other co-workers.  The hardest part about my job is dealing with the pain.  The most enjoyable part of the job is getting paid."
good,this was a awesome job the pay was really good and we were off weekends the only think ii dont like is how they do the new people like try too over work them because they dont know any better .
good,"Sanderson farm a good job . It’s just the point system . In your supervisor can be hard at times . Just do your job, help other & watch your surroundings."
good,"Never be late"
good,"Sandersons Farm was a pretty good job, it was just a very Taskful & Hands on job. The managers are kinda tough on you but it's problems every where you are."
good,"They are a great come up job, but eventually you'll feel robbed b/c of all the hard work you have to do!! They don't pay enough! Great benefits though!"
good,"Great day at work, learned to work at a fst pace, mqnagement was great, co-workers were great, the hardest part of the job was the cold weather, and the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work as an independent woman."
good,Well honestly I know it was a very cold environment. supervisors and the company were very out going and know how to treat employees.
good,Great place to work but no room for advancement and management is unpredictable and will not work with you when needing time off weather for personal or family emergencies
good,Fast pace work have to know how to keep time. Spent more time here trying to prove myself and making a name for myselftrying to move up in the company  It's hard work.
good,It is a very fast paced environment with much stress on safety. USDA is present for every step of the process with their standards in addition to the expectations of Sanderson Farms make for a very efficient operation.  I am working there presently. Thank you for the opportunity.
good,I love working at Sanderson farm it just have me tired and taking away from me being around my kids but mostly it paid all my bills its a good job to work at i only been at sanderson for 4 month and its been okay
good,I have the education and has been trained in departments but they are hiring supervisors outside the plant that has no experience.  They are very few blacks supervise on first ship. The plant manager is black but married to white man
good,"Clock in at 830, make sure my department has tools need for work. If my line was backed up with boxes I would help out on a side scale. By the end of the day orders were mainly filled."
good,Sanderson Farms was a nice place to work. Working in the cold year round was the hardest part about the job. The co-workers were okay but I just preferred to stay to myself to stay out of trouble. The most enjoyable part about the job was being free to learn everything that the job had to offer.
good,"Overall, a company you can grow with, and advance quickly. But management doesn't always play by their own rules. A Union would benefit both employees, and management tremendously. I learned a lot about the inner workings of a poultry processing plant, as well as metting and working with some great people. There's not anything too hard, or complicated, if you are willing to learn."
good,"In this environment it was different had to where slip resistance shoes, caps, gloves, and face mask. Safety was the main key. We cut raw chicken, as in breaking it down. From cutting the shoulders, wings, breast, and also chicken tenders."
good,nothing special about working for this company just gave me a job periods for four month. There nothing special about sanderson farms
good,It had the best benefits ever. Plus 401k and stock benefits. The most messiest place ever. You are on your feet for long hours at a time. Plus it’s very cold in their.
good,Go to work even if your arm falling off if you wanna keep your job Seriously just go to work the point system they have is crazy but it’s a lot of great opportunities if you want to build a career at Sanderson Farms.
good,"It a good place to work to get some experience, but not a place you want to stay. You get wet all over, every part of your body hurts and the breaks are not long enough."
good,One of the most enjoyable jobs I have had besides the military. Had a good team working with me. Some areas do need better organization but it is still a fairly new company.
good,My experience at Sanderson farm was great the first two weeks then you start to get tired body start getting sore it's a great place to make a living starting off pay is 12.35 but you will work hard for it.

good,Reliable dependable And punctual worker. I will Always be there on time. Most likely will be Early. And I will execute the job descriptions. And I Have Reliable Transportation to work at all times.
good,They are a great company to work for. You have to compromise between a personal life and working for them. Other than that I would recommend sanderson farms to anyone. Great pay and underatanding supervisors very helpful.
good,"Its best to work at Sanderson Farms in the daytime. Working there you barely have time for your personal life or your family. Working there you only have time for them, the pay is great but I have a family I have to attend to also."
good,"provided great benefits for my family"
good,The job that I am required to do is very intense. You have to work at a fast pace regardless of your of workers on your line. it is a repetitive job so you will be doing the same job all day with rotation. It requires focus and lots of movement.
good,"14-15 hour days, hard work, good people to work with. Learned and followed safety rules, and guidelines. Very productive place to work, because there was a lot of responsibility that was upon us on getting the job done."
good,"it is a chicken plant, it is ok. Job was not the greatest, but pays bills."
good,"An typical day at the farms would be doing your best,making it fun to be there and make sure the product was perfect. Some co-workers made it hard but I use to pray and press my way thru. The thing which would get to you is when your fuel is getting low you had to press harder and harder to get thru that day."
good,company is an equal opportunity for all and give great stock options 
good,"My job experience in Sanderson farms was good...had flexible working hours, had a good working environment and had a lot of educational work experiences"
good,Anything besides sanitation is good in the plant but other that theyvpay wonderful and work with you  sanitation is not no where I would lead someone too
good,great local job position with a great benefits package. insurance and 401k plans are awesome. Experienced a management change throughout the entire operation that lead to some turmoil.thinking about returning.
good,It's a place you have to work hard and make sure you doing the right things and follow all the rules and be careful as you clean up you must make sure all the equipment and Machine is cut off at all times
good,It’s hard to balance work and personal life! They go on a point system so if your kids are sick or anything you get a point for missing the day. After 4 points within 3 months you get fired
good,"Sanderson farms pay rate is acceptable, their hours are good, but management needs a little training they favoritism to people they know but that's any job I personally would work here again"
good,"It was a steady job. Fast paced work. No holidays. Worked everyday while the farm had chickens. I had to keep my work spaces very clean. I had to make sure all the eggs were gathered and cleans 4 times a day and count the amount each time. Then, i had to puy them in the cooler room to be picked up."
good,Work was typical heavy on the front end and tapered off towards the end of the day. The department I work in is small so it is very close knit. There is a lot of flexibility as long as you are productive.
good,"As a member of management, Sanderson Farms can be very time consuming and demanding. But, the benefits are great. Great for long term employment and stability."
good,Work and life is very unbalanced...This is a great company where you can build career and make a lot of money. The downfall of it is that you spend a lot of time at from loved ones.
good,"Working at Sanderson Farms was the hardest job  I have ever had. It was was highly competitive and somewhat cut throat. I did feel like in succeeding there, I accomplished something. However, the company does not through its actions mirror what their mission statement states."
good,the position was an overnight shift which employees had to be responsible for their area to clean up had to be a self motivated worker to have jobs complete and meet QC requirements
good,Fast-paced line work but you are able to make friends and have conversations with your co-workers. Management is tough but they allow you to work in your own area. Hardest part of the job is getting used to the temperatures in the summer and winter.
good,"it was a good job, payed good too i wish i would have not miss too many days but i didnt have a stable ride so that caused me to mis too many days and i got fired"
good,it was an alright job. I was looking for something closer to home that paid more money. Advancement was slow but I was always willing and ready to learn new thingsl
good,Sanderson Farm overall is a great place my issue was with misleading management and issue within job getting my insurance information. Head management is very good its just some managers that doesn't follow the guidelines set that make employees uncomfortable.
good,Never had a problem with the job I was just on the third shift working Sanitation my shift was only six and a half hours that was the only problem I really had other than that I was blessed to be there..
good,I enjoy working at this company and I would like to work there again. I can get to work because this it’s Kinston. The  day went fast because you were busy most of the time. Everyone was willing to show you new things and give time to learn. Great company to work for .
good,A typical day at work was being in a very cold environment and standing in one  spot for 8 hours or more. What I learned was how to fix machines and a lil bit on the forklift also.
good,"So far, once you start a shift, it is pretty difficult to move to another, so be very sure that you choose one you will be able to stick with for a while!"
good,The hardest part of the job was working in a cold enviorment and making sure the chicken was process shipped and  labled probaly the orther hard about the job was keep the line clear after a shut down
good,"Good job in relation to benefits and salary, extremely fast paced, high employee turnover and attendance issues, long work days."

good,I enjoyed my work at Sanderson Farms I like the work in Q.C . and working with the peoples at the plant. I don't like the point semesters that they have.
good,Typical work day consisted of being nothing is a typical work day.  As an intern you are there to learn every job task of hourly employees as well as learn management styles.

good,Sanderson Farm was a great opportunity for me to work interact with different culture and was able to increase my people skills.
good,While working at this job it gave me the opportunity to no the value of making a living. The management was good and also the co-workers. It really was not a hard job. You just had to do the job right and do you best and come to work.
good,The area i worked was really efficient with there work . They really taught us how to really go in and get the job done right .
good,Work is what you make of it. If you want to be bitter your job will be horrible. If you apply yourself and adhere to standards it is a great place to work with an amazing management and supervision team.
good,I was working in shipping/packing it was a great experience working for the company.I use to love stacking the boxes for exercise because I love to work out and stay in shape!!
good,hardest part was when others would not work as a team the most enjoyable part of the job was when i would show new people how to work smart not hard.
good,i would get to work about 3:30pm to work a 9hr shift . i would get to my work area and get my forklift and wait til the product run off the line and den i would hand wrap the pallet den take into the freezer.
good,"I start out with a USDA. I mark the poultry the way that they want me to mark it. I may have to cut off a bad wing or the head or foot of the chicken. Then after break I do draw hand, which I take the insides out of the bird for the USDA to inspect it."
good,Debone poultry. I was a fun place to work in a production environment.
good,"A typical day at work would be a go,go, go. Early morning arrival just to get bills worked up and trying to meet deadlines. The minimum amount of bills consists of 100 or more now so it can become overwhelming a bit."
good,"A typical work day is usually 10 hours, Starting around 9am & getting off around 7pm. We package the meat in different boxes according to the order and depending on the meat is the quantity per box changes. I learned how to operate a high speed label machine that places labels properly. My Co-workers are very friendly and help you with anything that you don't know and don't understand. The hardest part of the job is standing up for almost 10 hours in 35 degree weather."
good,"coworkers are good to work with,mill management is good to work with physically easly job"
good,Ability to think outside the box. Look out for new approachs and ideas. Always available to lend an ear and support to team members. Has the potential to learn new skills.
good,Lots  of  issues  with  professionalism  and subordinates. There was always a sense of insecurity nothing  permanent lots of being involuntary  repositioning.
good,Work will always be stressful but it will always be more stressful if the wrong people are in charge. A team can only follow the coaches play. Your teams attitude reflects off of the leadership.
good,"As broiler supervisor you work long hours. You're on call 24/7/365. Management always focus on the negative and hardly ever give positive feed back. Even when you do your job exactly how you're asked to, its still not good enough. When trying to hold contract growers accountable for their actions or lack of performance, management won't exactly stand behind you even though you are holding the grower accountable for their lack of following their contract and programs they agreed to follow by signing their contract."
good,A lot of great worker who help you when u get off track it is a little unorganized like a lot going on every body there just if they was organized that would b the perfect job
good,I have had a good and bad experience at Sanderson farm. They have amazing benefits at Sanderson and incredible workers. The only issues that I hated about it was they never paid over time once u went over 40 hours  a week. other than that it’s a pretty good place to make a nice living at
good,Working for Sanderson farm made  me stronger and tougher if I it wasn't for Sanderson farm I would probably be on the streets. It have great benefits and spot of great opportunitys

good,Great place to work. Great supervisors and friendly faces. I learned to work with a team on a daily basis. The hard part of the job is being able to work in the cold.
good,"Sanderson is a great company but the culture in my personal division was horrible. It was very stressful and cutthroat, everyday you worked you felt like it could be your last. Great work, good job, and we appreciate you were seldom heard by management."

And I learned how to ship and receive by putting chicken meat into a container and shipping it off to another department that needed it"
good,"i really miss the employees, but I don't miss the job,,way to petty on some of their rules and regulations, need some attention. I had some good managers and some bad managers, they are really quick to write someone up and pass the buck down the line, very stressful job, always wondering if it was gonna be your last day or not"
good,"While working at Sanderson's Farm I worked as a drawhand. A draw hands responsibility is to draw everything inside the chicken out. In order to do that you, would have to use both hands to grab everything out of the chicken, separating the fat from the gizzard."
good,This job has great benifits and has many position to offer. It can be stressful at timed but thats part of the job. There are two available shifts for balancing lifestyle.
good,"good place to work, fast pace enviormentent lots of standing  ,  very little down time ideal job for someone looking for their first job working there would be a great start"
good,Sanderson Farms is an okay company to work for. Sometimes it can be very stressful. Advancement is not fair. The company caters to certain people at times
good,"My typical day of work was cold and consisted of dealing with raw products. Ive learned how to fabricate raw products to an accurate size, pack and seal frozen raw products. The hardest part was working in the cold and not knowing if its an early or late night off."
good,"this job is for hard working people. The salary is really good."
good,The pay was excellent but I wouldn't consider going back to work for the company. 
good,spent time in the office at the beginning of the day to get prepaid to go out to the field and inspect property and fill out reports
good,Supported company hiring procedures
good,Would never speak badly about any place that allowed me to put food in the table. I would show up to work and do work. Every situation isn't ideal and that's about where I stand.
good,The job was easy I caught on very quickly I love working and improving the business I work for it is a great feeling to have a job I was sertified to do any job or task they set for me
good,Had amazing co-workers. Very productive company but had horrible management. Was not worth the hour and half drive to work everyday to work and back home.
good,"The job itself is simple, regardless of what work area you are placed to work in. You get paid weekly, you get a lot of OT, and you have paid vacation"
good,Sanderson has proven to be a leader in the poultry industry.  They believe keeping their equipment up to date which enables them to be very efficient.

good,If you don't mind following rules and there are a lot of them and new ones every week then you'll like it. The pay is good and the benifits are great.
good,As an intern there was much to see and learn and I was exposed to much of the company. Enjoyed my time working as an intern although work at times was stressful.
good,"Okay place to work if you are in need of a job right away, you will work 40hrs. weekly, you are only given 4 opportunities to miss work once you receive the 4 pt. you are terminated, even if you provide a doctors note. Room for advancement is on a who-knows-who basis, but they will lead you to believe you will be looked at or considered, but in reality they have already chosen the person."
good,I wish I could've stayed but I was on days and my son was suspended from school and then  they said when he come back to school he was off the bus so I had to let my job go I wish I could go back now that was a good job
good,Sanderson farms is good for hiring people but they should pay more. It's not enough when you have bills and children to feed. They also could use better ways to help people out with injuries.
good,It was very interesting to learn how to raise the chickens. It was a laid back environment and nothing really hard. I also drove the tractor to cut the grass and I was able to leave when necessary.
good,I've come in everyday at the same time just like everyone else will and start working you receive only 3 breaks which would go by in the blink of an eye.
good,"Not the type of work I expected,machines stay broken down,faulty time clocks,overall its ok just not for me.But if someone wants to have a steady pay its a ok job"
good,"Sanderson is a good place to work but they definitely do not care about you’re health and well being. The pay and benefits are very great, but some of the supervisors are very rude"
good,Working at Sanderson Farms was a challenge for me at first because I did not receive the proper training to perform my duties effectively as a Supervisor.
good,"Fast paced environment  that keeps you on your toes. This place offers great benefits and excellent pay, but you will indeed work for them. Very fast paced.."
good,"Besides the climate i wouldn't mind returning to Sandersons Farm's, everyone was friendly it was a very positive environment and the pay was excellent."
good,People oriented giving excessive amount of training.  Good benefits and salary.  Demanded a lot of hours on the job and will to advance quickly.  Work force was not good.
good,The hardest part of the job is trying to stay dry. You will be expected to weld in less than favorable conditions but the work has to get done. The benefits and pay compensate for the conditions.
good,"The job is very stressful, employees are ok, supervisors are ok, benefits are really good. Breaks are 10 min lunch is 30 min. the money is good if you stick with it."
good,Handle all maintenance of buildings and production equipment. Help with production when needed. order parts through Hatchery manager. Rebuild electrical motors as needed. Schedule pm's on weekly basis.
good,"Sanderson Farms is the third biggest chicken producer in the United States. So it a big company, and you can start off real small or big depending on credentials. I worked in the Debone section of the processing plant. It was none stopping tidiest work. You are working off a conveyor belt that send chicken that you must debone. This must be done to satisfaction quality set by administrators in a timely fashion ( which is 5 seconds)."
good,"Sanderson farms is a chicken processing company. It is a fast paced work environment,but provides alot of oppurtunitys for advancement within the company."
good,"No incentive, but great people to work with and a very simple task to do to get the job done. Great place to work if you love the country."
good,Employees didn't seem to be the main focus of the company. Started out working 40+ hours and went all the way down to 28 hours per week.
good,A typical day consisted of walking through chicken houses for a thorough check in operation of houses. Feed mill visits to check feed rations.
good,"Working with the machines, packing the chickens and working with others."
good,On a average day the plant ran smoothly. U see chicken all day long.
good,"A great team of co-workers, enjoyable family type atmosphere."
good,"Most days were hot, some days we might get a chance of rain.  I learn the more you do for people they will help you out.  Management and co-workers always help me out when I need it specially when, I been working hard all day."
good,"This company brings job stability to every community it is in, and gives back to the community. HR here is for those who are strong and will not back down from legal policy. HR here must stand alone at times and expect to be the last department to be taken seriously, despite it's necessity to the organization overall."
good,Overall good company to work for but does not utilize my skills and experience.
good,The company itself was ok but there was a lot messy people in the work environment.
good,hours were good and good pay.management not so professional.but a pleasant working expeiience
good,We worked a lot of hours and it kept my mind working at all time.
good,Amazing company to be a part of. I absolutely love my job and those in management ahead of me. It has room for growth and development. Provides a stable source of income and offers me the opportunity to provide a safe working environment for those places under my leadership.
good,It is a good company. Can be stressful at times. Great benefits. Family oriented with strong focus on quality and share holder return. Is publicly traded but has its start in family owned business model.
good,"Constant work. Preventative maintenance "
good,It’s was a good had to work hard for your money got paid every Friday and them checks was pretty too and you can get overtime but on Friday you’ll be trapped there
good,"Responsible for timely placing meat on a mechanize production line,Packaged and then placed he meats onto a conveyor to be shipped. Maintained a clean and safe work environment."
good,"It could be consider strenuous if you thought of how a conver belt does just that convey and if you just let that belt roll catching it paste or designating your own will be a literal god sent, the rest will just be you mami  sure you eat at lunch.  Keep your strength up is required for health and production."
good,"With a parts department who never ordered parts and was not familiar with what parts were, there was always something to be fixed.  The parts department also lead to some innovation on our part as maintenance to keep the plant moving. I was able to expand on my knowledge by attending extra classes through sandersons, learning electrical, pump systems, and OSSID training."
good,I recommend this company good benefits good management  I worked for a year but wanted to advance in my career after a while overall good place to start at if your looking for somewhere to work
good,"Sanderson Farms was a great place to work with. The only complaint I have is that if you hire on night shift they won't move you to days. In the orientation they said after a year, but that never happened. I ended up having to go back to recruiting due to work schedule conflicting with my children."
good,every fast and long hard working place you got to stay on top 23 birds a minute at all time and will stress out but its a very good job give you $160 for being on time everyday at the weekend of the week pay
good,Sanderson farms is a good job. Sometimes I feel as if favoritism is shown. But overall it’s a good job. Good benefits. It’s a good job to have unless you could find something better!
good,Working at Sanderson requires work in frigid temperatures and packing a designated rate to keep up with production. There is a lot of walking involved so keep a good pair of boots ad a jacket.
good,I like working there and working with new people they can think of the employees more time off for medical leave no point when ur out with your children or family death
good,"Sanderson Farms is a good place to work. Being that it's a poultry plant,one is advised to wear warm clothing. It was a great experience learning the different size trays, how many pieces per tray, as well as what plastic wrap goes to what tray. Management was good. The hardest part of the job was not knowing what time the shift would end.Great benefits and pay."

good,"welding, wiring motors, painting, fixing pvc pipe, conducting preventive maintenance, maintaining machines upkeep, testing water"
good,"The company as a whole is a wonderful company to work for. If I didn't have personal issues I would most-likely still be out there as we speak.There were just a few bad weeds spread among the field so to speak. But once those were weeded out and exposed for who they really were, the company would have ran much smoother."
good,"Working at Sanderson Farms, I wouldn't say it was the best but it was ok. I learned how to work as a team and not just by myself all the time. The hardest part about working at Sanderson Farms was trying hard to work in such dramatic workplace where you had to continuously look over your shoulders because of the poor management. There were more fights than there were fun, therefore; I would mind my own business so I wouldn't get into any trouble. The most enjoyable parts of my job were going to work, getting my work done and making the money to support myself."
good,Management was shaky at first but after a year it got better.
good,"learned to be fast and accurate, worked hard to reach daily goals.. coworkers was nice and willing to help. hardest part of the job is the temperature "
good,"My typical day started around 3 in the morning and could last til 6 that evening. I learned that chickens do not believe in holiday, birthday,sickness or any type of problems you have.With this job i was able to view the company from all ends; from cutting chicken wing to working with the human resource manager. The managers and supervisor were great instructors."
good,the job was very simple but the hours were not set. i also had awesome co workers who didnt mind to help you out.
good,"Some supervisors don't know how to interact with employees. Other than that, it's a great place to work."
good,Some nights we worked pass midnight. Might get off around 2:00 am. The pay was good. Lately they have been laying off and cutting hours. I am looking for something else so I can be home more.
good,I’ve learn fast at Sanderson. I work an 8 hours shift then I go home & repeat everyday. They will help you get through anything you need help processing with.
good,Sanderson was a great company great pay showed a sense of care to there employees understood that things come up in life and try to help do what they can for there employees to cope with that cituation

good,"Well for the most part, it's a good job  it's a lot of favoritism shown by supervisors and that makes the job more stressful. But if you do your job right you won't have any problems. If your not use to working around a variety of people and dealing with different attitudes, this not for you. I work on the cone line. Its consist of hanging chicken and cutting all parts off the chicken properly."

good,Great place for family oriented people to make a honest  living. Friendly work environment.  Will give second chances. 7 days of days to be sick or late
good,Honest it is fair pay considering other jobs availability in this area; pay could be more; the work is taxing. There should be some pay incentives for earnest people; after all you get what you pay for!
good,"Could use better training on how to actually manage your assigned department.  Company focused a lot of its training on culture and work policies but not day to day operations. Upper management and corporate and extremely friendly.  It was the middle management that ended up being the factor that made me leave.  However, before I was placed in that department I enjoyed my time there.  Second shift has longer and unpredictable hours compared to first shift.  As salary be prepared to put in an extra two to three hours compared to the hourly employees."
good,"I worked on an assembly line, fast pace, productive.  Also worked in box room as needed, when regular staff was not available. (Vacation/Sick)"
good,It’s a fun and interesting job. It’s it’s more of a laid back job and it’s nothing to hard for you in any position of work there. I think anyone would love the job on hand.
good,I worked in the cooler where it was 38 degrees catching chicken frames and shuveling ice on the top it was very laid back but cold and wet but I liked the supervisors

good,"It isn’t as bad as people make it out to be. You have to be willing to work, but the work isn’t hard (my job isn’t). The pay is amazing for you not to have any education, weekends off, paid weekly, great benefits . They have room for advancement with education."
good,Very cold place stand on your feet for hours suggest your wear plenty warm clothes supervisor was ok pay was ok just hate that it stayed very cold my feet and hands froze a lot
good,"Really enjoyed the work and the people I hate I had to leave. There is also something to learn about cutting and the handling of food. The management changes from line to line as you advance the hardest part of my job was being wet, the most enjoyable part was learning that I could handle almost all of the task at hand, and the job is not boring and very fast paced."
good,Great place to work and further ones work experience for future jobs. I would recommant this job to anyone who is a hard worker and enjoys a great pay.

good,"I come in to work and boxes of chicken would just fly at you. and if the line get backed up the boss would come out and say hurry, or if I have to come here one more time."
good,I think management isn't the best cause they treat some employees better and give them more hours.. I like the job that I do and willing to do it for years to come.. Also I would hopefully like to move up in the company one day..
good,"This is a great company to work for.  I definitely would work for them again.  It is refrigferated so sweaters, workpants and workboots are essential."
good,"Everything is powered by machines so you have to be quick and steady cause you don't really want to drop meat its OK if you do but they insist that you don't ,other than that its a good pay ."
good,Sanderson farms is the most paid job in this area. They have very good benefits and are hiring every day. I like the fact that they give a everyone a chance for a job and a chance for advancement .
good,"It's alright job hands hurt if you cutting all day , d-bone the hardest department out there I've learned different parts of the chicken inside and out"
good,It wasn't a job for me. I didn't like the thought of all the chickens being killed around me. I would definitely go back. You have to have the right mind set to work here.
good,"I love working at Sanderson farm, started off great. Than was bouncing all over the places running different machines. Did have a chance to get my license to drive forklift that was great to have in have a chance to get paid more. Supervisors was hard to get along with out there (BLUE COATS) new blue coats ."
good,Sanderson farms is a great opportunity for people who have it hard finding a job they r willing to give just about anyone a chance...its a fast paced job so if your not willing to work hard don't apply
good,It was an good experience working with Sanderson farms but the supervisors sometimes showed favoritism and because of that overtime was bad for the department I was in d-bone
good,"You will learn a lot about how Sanderson farm started and where there are striving to get. Friendly but strict environment, and offer time and dedication to make sure you know what your suppose to do"
good,I Learned a lot at Sanderson farms. Management was alright . The workplace was abetter then the other factory jobs I worked at . Once I got use the work I started teaching the new employees that came in after. Hardest part was teaching the new incoming employees . Most enjoyable part was once u learned everything it come easy you get to rotate different section in the department your in.
good,Overall it is a good place to work. Usually have weekends off. Pay is weekly which is very good. Paperwork goes missing alot. They have to have the original  copies of anything they give you for a medical office but don't tell you until you that.
good,Great opportunity for advancement but the hours and constant change can really burn you out quickly. Also some of the jobs required to do in the trainee program are not very enjoyable at all.
good,"A hard working place, and a learning experience. Sanderfarm is good with the employees and you can grow with the company."
good,"This was a new work experience for me, I was dealing with chicken that was live, I enjoyed my worked area because it was a very fast pace environment but it was a packing position that I would love to do again"
good,"its a good place to work however, there is plenty of space for improvement. As in the workers breaks, the workload (all at once) & the hourly pay."
good,"Handling raw meat. "
good,"To work for Sanderson, you must have patients and determination! Your supervisors take there jobs very seriously as you should too. They are very strict about being properly dressed and be at work on time. There no exceptions or excuses. They have great benefits and the pay is outstanding but before you get paid the big bucks. You must show them you can handle this job for one month while they have you on probation. Then they will start paying you more and giving you more hours. Think you can handle it?"
good,I would start my day at work by talking with my fellow supervisors and learn from the previous shift of any issues that they may have had.  The upper management were very supportive.  Mechanical failures were the hardest thing to deal  with at this facility.  I enjoyed working with my fellow supervisors.
good,"I was working here to be able to extend my knowledge of how chickens where able to grow and be purchased in the grocery store."

good,The job was easy but strenuous. the management seemed to only be interested in production numbers. my wrist bothered me from the repetitive motions of cutting chicken. It would have been better if they would have rotated me as they said they would.
good,I've enjoyed my time at the company. I feel that its not the field for me and i'm trying to get in the correct field. Sanderson Farms isn't a job that i want to make a career out of.

good,A typical day at work depending on where you working at is ok. I was a deboner my job was simple. I had a great supervisor he always worked with his employees. the hardest part of my job was being in the cold all day; the enjoyable part was going home to some heat.

good,well on a typaical day we hang anywhere from 200 to 300 thousand birds a day the manage me was wonderful i love the drive the give you they push you to keep going the hardest party of the job is clean out the vats after there empty you have to fish the remaining birds out and it can be very hard at times
good,Sanderson Farms was a great job it was a very cold environment which made me uncomfortable. I enjoyed the weekly paychecks and the pay was very good. The hours were way too long and we’d get off sometimes at 3am
good,very quick paced workplace with very highly achieved management to help you best succeed in your daily work life. it was very intense but also very rewarding and the compensation was incredible.
good,"a typical day at work was good "
good,"I have learned a lot working here, gained experience.. and have met great people. the pay is great, and well worth the job. i would recommend anybody to a fair job as Sanderson Farm Inc."
good,This company is a great company to work for.  It works with its employees to make sure they have all they need to be successful. The management was great there also.
good,A typical day at work was hanging chickens. Some of the things that I have learned was how to properly and inproperly hang live chickens. The most enjoyable part of the job was geting to learn a new trade and gain strong work ethics.
good,Great work place with good supervisors and co-workers good benefits open door policy if you had a problem.The room for advancement is great.
good,When I was working at Sanderson farm I was alot younger and wasn't as mature as I am now an also I like working for y'all company and I see myself working there for a very long time and maybe even retiring from your company.
good,work 9 or 10 hours a day at lease six days a week  management is hard to get a long with the hardest part is working six to seven nights a week with little time off.
good,"A typical day at work is upbeat and very complex. I learn everyday that teamwork is a important part of the job. My co- workers are different in many ways but everyone comes together when it's time to get a certain task done and at the end of the shift, the job gets done. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep everyone at the same paste because some work faster than others, while some are not successful when it comes to speed."
good,Check that product has good quality and is reliable. The steps to a good quality chicken. I step up in management when the supervisor is out and help people when needs. My co-workers rely on me for help if they need.
good,My work day started at 7:00 and ended at 5:00. I learned that all plastic bags are not made at the same specifications. It takes a lot more that just the plastic to make a plastic bags for different companies. Management was to the point but the were good people to work for along with my co-workers they made it easy to accomplish my job. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning new things and meeting new people.
good,"Sanderson farm is a great place to work but not for me. The reason I say it’s a good place because you get paid every week ,your guaranteed 40 hours,your off on weekends,and you get all of your benefits. The reason I say it’s not for me is because it a lot of favoritism, it’s a lot of he says he say mess,and they are very strick"
good,"I enjoyed working for Sanderson Farms.  A typical day at work for me includes helping others in various departments , doing my job with no mistakes and honoring the safety procedures."
good,I enjoyed working there if I could do it again I would. The only thing I hated about it is how their absences work. People do get sick and they have a family to take care of just as well as they do so I think they should expand their absences policies to at least 10 days out of a year with doctors excuses and I was okay with the suspension policy twice a year. I think that they should inform you that it's only with a doctor excuses only.
good,Being a floor hand was the best job I had I was good at it and I like cleaning and picking up meat and helping out others and I get to meet different people every day
good,"I love working in sanitation and I love my coworkers. They are very helpful, and understandable. They each other so everybody can get finished at the same time. And they are concerned about the of each other.andSanderson farm provide you withh all of your safety equipment."
good,Sanderson Farm has great benefits with a cultural background but it’s difficult for work/life balance..  Overall I would work there again and I would request for others to work there also..
good,"Sanderson Farms is a great company to work for. They have an amazing benefits package. The work isn't hard, its just constant and repetitive. If you can't keep up, they can't use you."
good,"I always did my job to the best of my ability, but sometimes having to oversee others can be stressful when their causing the remaining product to fall on you.. Longer hours"
good,"Allowed overtime, professional/people friendly work environment, 4 point system even with doctors note, shifts available 1st/2nd/Sanitation, good benefits."
good,Sanderson farm was fast paced breaks were frequent the benefits were good they paid good overtime and plus you're off every weekend paid vacations as well as paid holidays
good,"this company was an ok place to work at. It has great benefits. I gives stability and live long retirement, The managers just doesnt treat their employees fair,"
good,"My overall experience with Sanderson was good besides management issues. If I didn't have issues with my babysitter, I probably would have stayed longer than I did."
good,It was great until we got no interns in than wanted to tell me how to do my job and I was the one training you then sending you to another location across town to make your hours up
good,It's very hard work here. You will be sore. It's very fast pace. You will need to keep up. The pay is good. It has very good benefits working here. Most people stay because of the benefits and pay.
good,This is the place I would like to retire from. Great supervisor Great co-worker. Beautiful pay!! Benefits are wonderful!! Work schedule is consistent. Overall this is one great job which can be easily turned into a career!!
good,Starting off at sanderson was very changing because there worker there are really like one big family. Even though there really there to make there money. They take there time to keep the work flow going strong and if one person slows down the flow. That person comes to truth with in there self to amit he or she was in the wrong. In order to keep the love and spite of Sanderson Farms Life Flying.
good,the most enjoyable part of the job was linking up with people there and on breaks.... supervisors are very thirsty!! they wishy-washy and some of the employees there are messy!
good,when I started I was young an had a child on the way loving work place liked the people that I was working with. But I could never work there again too much to do with low pay
good,"I Reviewed the work order from 1st Shift production, and I would set my production complete all orders that remain for the day. As second shift supervisor."
good,It was a job didn't really like working there but it was a job .I didn't agree with the way the company is ran and the way the staff talk to the employees.They add points on you when you take FMLA leave even when you call in.They sometimes get your hours wrong on your paycheck so when payroll come around you have to wait until the next pay period come around to get what they shorten you of
good,"They have good benefits, and pay very well; it's just a dangerous workplace, the temperature is very cold inside and it smells really bad!"
good,"Functional mobility and physical strength consistent with the essential functions but not limited to the ability to stand, walk, lift, carry, push, pull, twist, bend, and climb."
good,I absolutely loved Sanderson Farms Inc. The job wasn't too hard. The location was great for me. The supervisors wasn't to hard on you. They actually treated you like an actual employee.
good,"it has updated but when I was there, It was a very fast-pace job. The managers was awesome and very helpful"
good,"I worked in product intake, product packaging, prooduct sale, and in the human resource office."
good,Typical work day/week changes from day to day. I learned how to ship products out in a safe manner. Most enjoyable part of the job is to see the employees advance within or outside of the company.
good,I loved working there but they need more communication and better line leads. I worked for a week and even before that they lost my application and when i started monday they didnt put in my time.
good,Work in a very fast past. Very wet an cool place to work. Lot's of overtime to be made.You can move up in this company very easy just have to be on time an work hard
good,"The job was easy. Management team, supervisor and leads were all on the floor to oversee things. Co-workers were toxic. I had a hard time dealing with female bullies. Men were disrespectful, rude and they sexually harass you when managment weren't looking. I was yelled at, pinched, smacked and grabbed at. I let women who bully me go but with the guys I fought back. But it gets tiring"
good,"Personally I feel it had a good environment overall. I knew what I was doing everyday, and i loved my set work schedule from Monday to Friday.  Very diverse inside hardly ever any confrontation, majority of everyone were friendly. Best part was getting paid every Friday with the option of paper check or direct deposit. Can't wait to get back, unfortunately I had to leave for personal reasons."
good,I really enjoyed the insurance and the 401k plans. They also offer life insurance. All the benefits were real good but you will have to work hard for it
good,Kinda skipped through my 3 times. Now that i have a child i wish i can take that back many of days. I wish i can get one more chance i would never quit.
good,"Working at Sanderson was an opportunity to make money for school . The job comes with  excellence benefits and great pay . Managers of Sanderson Farms are well respectful people that believe that there employees can get the job done on time and come out successful. The work place of Sanderson Farms is majorly good , but sometimes bad. "
good,My time at Sanderson was very rewarding! It was like having a second family!  It is an amazing place to work! Will most definitely not regret it if ever hired there!
good,It runs very smoothly there. I learned how properly cut meat and etc. Management there is ok. The hardest part about the job is working with a lazy person. The most enjoy enjoyable part of the job is the benefits.
good,I really enjoyed working for this company would still be there if I wouldn't have lost my transportation looking forward to going back when ever they will allow me to do so
good,"I work live hang first week was hard, and I'm a college football player. Sore hands, but once you start to get it down it's not much effort or a hard task. The pay is what makes it really worth it my first week inwas hanging 25 birds a min the company kind of goal is to hang 29 but my manager looks out and see that if we are trying working hard then everything is all good. Most the time you aren't hanging too fast, even if you are in the front of the line. Sanderson Farms took me from living in a homeless college student to benefits new car new apartment in 3 months. It's a mindset and it isnt for everyone that's why they turnover so fast. Come to work, work hard and you'll see the benefits! Love it here dont plan on quitting anytime soon!"
good,"This is a very good company. Well managed with great leadership. Believes in performing duties correctly, not by taking short cuts. If you have high expectations of your employer and yourself, this is the place for you. They value hard work and good character."
good,"Ran smoothly as any other production job, great people and management works with you. While working for them I enjoyed my time and meeting new people , supervisors made my job more fun even though the task could get difficult at times but overall it was a great work experience."
good,When I work there it's really fun and we get to know each others. Help other people with their jobs. Some people show the broken stuff or chicken didn't cut good they reported to supervisor. But some people don't care that's why they not even know how to deal with it.
good,Sanderson farms is a great place to work wish I could relocate. The opportunity for advancement is great.  Some of the employees do not honor it's christian policy.
good,Good hours with kids that go to school. Average pay per week is ok. Temperature inside is ridiculous crazy! Could not continue working there due to being pregnant at that time and could not go to doctors appointments. I always had to reschedule!
good,The job is very easy but it has its pros and cons . The department i worked in was debone it’s very cold and slippery so you have to come fully dressed / cozy and watch your step as you walk through the plant
good,Good place to work good pay and hours just not a lot of home time with the children and not much flexibility when emergencies arise and need the time off.
good,It was a good paying job they had benefits paid vacation and FMLA for when you need time off for any medical problems or death that you may have in the family. I learned a lot of different things about processing and production.
good,would rather not do a review on any of the companies that I have worked for in the past. I am only filling in this box because it is required in order to move on.
good,"a typical day work determined on order of the customers, I've learned a lot working in the processing field for seventeen-year been I many positions. The management was great, the culture the chicken business was outstanding, there really wasn't any hard part to the job, what I like most about the great people I work with at the job."
good,I miss being there. I loved that job but the drive and the hours I was getting off took a tole on me but other than that I would really love to go back whenever my year is up

good,Great place to work cool management paycheck was always on time anyone else there who need a job the process doesn't take long at all the staff is friendly
good,"I loved the people. but the comapny and policy was not great at all..Its a job for machines, and the outlook of the company needs adjustments , too many people getting sick and brokedown from arthiritis and bones, apneumonia"
good,You can make good money there but you have to be ready to work. If you get in make it all about work and do not get in with the wrong crowd. Your number 1 goal should be go to work everyday and make that money.
good,labor type job good pay good benefits. i extracted the inside of the product. making sure the product was clean enough to go to the next department.Great hours weekends off.

good,"Five star would recommend management is fair good benefit environment with different walks of life high pace environment chances of moving up in the company...........,...."
good,Excellent company to work for good benefits and always a chance to advance. They also offer you the opportunity to further your education paying for at least two classes each semester
good,It was fast paced n cold it was alot of work but once u get in a swing of things it goes pretty smooth. Its also very culture and a new experience the staff is nice
good,I enjoyed that pay but curtain mix stakes happen frequently with dropping the equipment needed for work and then that object had to be sent to be sterilized before being placed back into production.
good,"same as before, Its an oaky job, like I said not enough of opportunity, and I like to work long hours and make money benefitting stability, its okay though."
good,It's ok but some changes need to be made. To many supervisor shows favortisism. And also the breaks are to short and some team leads and supervisors dont appreciate the hard work.
good,I love this job.  I just had to leave a little bit hands hurt daily and the nurse station was no help to me having to wrap my hands everyday it did not help.

good,usually in the freezer moving and packaging chicken. Removing treys off the line and stacking in a neat and timely manner .Very fast pace environment.
good,Great place to work if you dont mind  working in extreme cold conditions and the smell of poultry. Shift work was available and the pay was good. Excellent place to advance.

good,"Loved every moment, it's not an hard job."
good,"Sanderson farm is easy work, but also dangerous in the wrong hands. We work with knives and scissors that are very sharp. We trim breast,wishbone, and cut shoulders"
good,"The place was warm and welcoming and the people were even better. Working with the children, there was never a dull moment."
good,"In a typical day at work, we would help d-bone the assembly line. Majority of the time the job was fast pace and then it would slow down. The hardest part of my job was pushing the carts back and forth"
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. The most enjoyable part of a the job was working alongside my colleage and learning from them. The office started to get crowed as the company grew"
good,I love everything about working at Sanderson Farms. I would leave for work at 3pm and start work at 3:45. i had to cut 40 birds per minute. Every job in Sanderson i could do so my manger loved me and my co-worker wanted to be just like me. I was fun loud outgoing and love doing anything.
good,"I go in and depending on where they need help that day that's generally where they send me, I've learned how to get along with various people some of who do not deserve the respect you'd give a rat, management is great, they pay some of the best wages to management in the entire chicken industry so you'd expect a higher class of management which is what you get though they do have their off days but don't we all, Most co workers are decent hard working people but you do get those that like to curse everyone out and threaten people, some coworkers do drugs and drink during their break or during trips to the bathroom, and then some people just want to collect a paycheck and let everyone else do their jobs for them, hardest part of the job is the physical aspect of having to hang birds if they're alive those suckers fight you for their lives pecking and scratching at you, even using the bathroom on you, if they're dead well you have to hang 27 birds a minute plus depending on your location and how lazy the guy is standing next to you, you do not want to be at the front of the line, Most enjoyable part of the job is of course the paycheck 13/hr isn't bad for my area."
good,Good work environment . Good Co-workers. Management is fair
good,I learned how to hang chicken. Inspected chick tell the good and the bad
good,"Well the job is great, I learn how to cut wings, hang wings, and debone a breast. Now some on my co-workers are easy to deal with but some can be hell to deal with. I say the hardest part of the job is dealing with those some timing Managers, and Supervisor's. They have their pick's of who they like and don't like, and they give the one's they don't like a hard time and that's not fair. The most enjoyable part is, getting dress  ready to come to work, cause I loved my job there and I loved what I did."
good,Sanderson farms was one of my most longest worked jobs I really like my work /people I worked around it had great benefits and great insurance  for employees
good,"Make good money, and you'll work hard for it. You'll find out who you're supposed to be in life working there, you reflect on alot of things. I would recommend this job to anyone."
good,Its fast paced and great pay. They have great benefits as well. I loved the people i worked with. Off every weekend works saturdays sometime. Have major holidays off with pay. Can have your birthday off paid or work and get time and a half. They do alot for the communities around them.
good,They are fast paced but pay VERY WELL. They had decent benefits. I cant honestly find too many things to complain about. They pay and benefits makes up for how sore you are.
good,I have no complaints about Sanderson.  They really made me feel at home.  There was some tough days.  But that comes with any job.  But they liked the way I capatalized handling problems. Without bothering  supervisor.
good,Sanderson Farms is a great company to work for they have great benefits and the pay is great especially if you have no education. But with some education your always able to advance. They have many different programs you can get in. But I would recommend anyone to work for this company.
good,the only thing that doesnt make since to me is the point system that they have in place we are humans and ll humans have issues so you never know when something might happen and you have to lose your job based on a point system
good,"Work was hard and fast passed. Most of the day was spent cutting chicken in to parts and then grading, counting, and weighing, the placing the cut chicken parts into correct trays to be wrapped and packaged to be shipped to customers while making sure to adhere to the strict standards of Sanderson Farms and the USDA. Management was very understanding and easy to get along with as long you did your job and showed up to work on time as I did every day. I was never late or out unless under Doctor's orders. The hardest part of the job was the very Physical part of the the job. But after a while your body got use to it and it became easier. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with friends I had worked with for years at another company that had shut down."
good,"Typical work day is about 12 hours, 8 hours in production. and 4 hours of prep and post paperwork.  Off most Saturdays and all Sundays.  From start to finish during production, the work is fast paced and in your face.  There is no time for delays or errors, you must be on top of your game and be aware of your surroundings..  The chicken keeps coming weather your ready or not.  If you are an experienced manager, believe the heart and soul of the company is it's hourly employees and treat your employees with dignity and respect, be willing to work hard and accept constructive criticism, you will succeed.  Turn over for hourly employees and entry level management is high in many areas but not all.   Advancement potential is amazing, and benefits are better than most.  I just wish I would have joined the Sanderson team sooner."

good,The was challenging at first but with good co workers and supervisor made it better and easy to adjust.if my line get backed up that would be the hardest part but my supervisor knows that im the one that would get things caught back up.
