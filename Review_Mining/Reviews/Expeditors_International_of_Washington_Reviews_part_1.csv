rating,review
bad,Their is no respect at all. They dont appreciate ur work.in other words their is to many chiefs and not enough indians . they dont show you notheing and expect alot done
bad,"Expeditors does not have an HR, just an open door policy with managers. "
bad,"Brexit led to uncertainty and training given did not meet expectations, team leaders handled worker assignments poorly as too many people doing work in one department."
bad,"Management is horrible and not having knowledge about software development/QA.Supervisors are creating rules and different people have different rules. Lots of politics and favourisim.Micromanaging,No flexibility and poor environment.If Management dont like you they will terminate you immediately ."
bad,"Management is horrible  and not having knowledge about software development/QA .   Supervisors are creating rules and different people have different rules. lots of politics and favourisim. micromanaging , no flexibility and poor environment . Run away from here ."
bad,Horrible horrible horrible  horrible horrible horrible horrible  no life management did not care about you it was alot of favoritism and more going on and alot of racism in the building
bad,"they treat the employees like trash, only the undocumented Latinos can work in that filthy and dirty place, full of diseases and mediocre people. Nasty, dirty"
bad,"The company is not worth it, treats u like a number. You come in as temp and the actual company employees will treat you like your temp. Its like a hazing atmosphere here."
bad,I worked hard everday I got in and checked the trucks and then off loaded all trucks. then put them on the floor to be ready to be sent back out. I used A RF to check everthing in.
bad,"Management is horrible, the training is horrible, the environment is very unprofessional and unhealthy. I was working overtime to help with the backlog 3 weeks into my training."
bad,I had the most horrible experience working for this company. People quit and they would not replace them. Their work were distributed to the remaining people plus their own work. Makes me over worked and stressful. I worked as soon as I sit on my desk until I get off. They did not allowed overtime so off course my work was behind and not completed on time due to a stressful environment.
bad,They will find a way to make you look bad just because you don't do overtime. Even if you are doing everything else correctly. They only care about money and will treat you as a piece of meat. Toxic environment.
bad,The managers keep drama going and like to start and spread rumors. The trainers are just as confused as the new hires and they dont like for you to ask questions as a new hire.
bad,"This has been the worst work experience I ever had in my life!!!! In PR offices have the NO team work whatsoever. And a very unhealthy place to work in where doesn't let you prove your skills on the position instead of thousands of written tests and exams. Was a real waste of of my time and a stop in my professional life/career. There's no open, constant or professional supervision in the office."
bad,there is no way to advance at expeditors. your a temp until you either get fired or quit. there is no room for advancement. seen people be a temp for over six years.
bad,This is a horrible place to work at !!! They put you to do so much stuff for little money .. they think we are their slaves and treated us really bad ..
bad,"Because I was a temp, they kept on telling me that once my contract was up after it was up but never did, after my year was up and after i took my weeks vacation, I came back to work and I was laid off"
bad,"I worked a very short time for this company and let me tell you that they are one of the most fraudulent companies I have ever seen.  They ""cook the books,"" almost daily to meet inventory requirements by there distributor.  It was a complete joke, no computerized measurements taken to ensure proper inventory, everything done by prehistoric measurements.  This company should and will be reported for inventory fraud, as well as billing fraud."
bad,over works their employees for no pay and I would not advise anyone to work for this company. I am happy that I am no longer with them and not stressed out daily.
bad,it was a very stressful placel cause the supervisors only gave people they liked easy cans and most days they wouldnt give us the full 9 or 8 hour shifts the said they would
bad,"société très spéciale. la paye est minimale par rapport à l'engagement demandé. Cela ressemble à une secte. Tout le monte doit se fondre dans ""leur moule""."
bad,The hours for this position were not a good fit.  Swing shift that started at 3:00pm and didn't end until everything was done.  Sometimes that was 4:00 am.
bad,"The culture is very stiff, offering a very strict dress code with little flexibility in work schedule.  However, the environment is predictable and there are many opportunities to move around within the company."
bad,"over dit bedrijf ....  een heel apart bedrijf."
bad,Typical day at work would be getting into word logging in and starting data entry until the end of the shift which is 8 hours. I learned the data entry systems and export and import aspect of the company. Management was horrible and only favoritism works at the work place. Some of my co-workers were just stuck on the computer no communication skills.
bad,"Management doesn’t take ownership of their roles leaving workers on their own. Not in a good way. There is no support, they talk about supporting employees but fail to actually do so"
bad,"No respect, everybody has a name, Leads, Supervisors, and you can see who are good with the managers and who not. If you are not good with them, you are not good enough and you will not easy become a lead or supervisor or get a salary raise."
bad,"This job gave me so much stress it caused gastritis (peptic ulcer). Managment is a joke. If you're not their favorite, you might as well quit because if you do something wrong, not only will they send you a passive aggressive email, they will also hold it over your head forever. They lied to my face during the interview saying I'd have to work some weekends. LOL I worked every weekend. They also made me work every holiday and didnt even ask me if I could."
bad,"If you are considering this company DONT!!! It is full of nepotism. They micro-manage so much that no matter what you do, they will find a way to criticize you. They reward only their inner circle or direct family members. Management expects you to sail a ship with no sails, and you never get a ""good job"" or any recognition for the hard, slave driving work they make you do. I believe the company itself has great values but I have to say the Peabody branch is absolutely horrific. They do NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR EMPLOYEES AND THERE IS NO ROOM FOR GROWTH. AGAIN, DONT APPLY OR ACCEPT A JOB, YOULL BE ABSOLUTELY MISERABLE."
bad,This company will stress you out and pay you half of what you should be paid. They refuse to hire the needed amount of employees and instead dump more and more work on your desk and still expect everything to get done in the same amount of time.
bad,"It looks OK on the surface but when you get in you notice the irregularities and mentality  (ie. creative accounting, favouritism ) basically you can break your back here and when it comes to the crunch your just a number, better off elsewhere!"
bad,"Applied for customer service  representative through a college job board. First day was taken out into warehouse to down stack boxes. For one year of being told one lie after another, watched others get brought in at higher pay but also being lied to ,I quit."
bad,"More concern with charts and metrics, once the business concerned its all down hill. They treat employee like robot, forget it if you have an idea or suggestion. Good place if you want to loss yourself and you have little direction, No run for promotion, only if you are in the right click."
bad,Management was very poor & substance abuse was rampant among staff. Being hungover was the norm for management and was overall a very unprofessional setting. They keep you in the temp limbo with no chance of hire.
bad,"The management and training is horrid. I started a week after a new girl who received no training, and then she was  the one who had to train me! Neither of us was given any resources or knew what was going on despite constant requests for assistance. The girl who trained me was yelled at in front of the whole office several times, taken off accounts and blamed for the problems. They then tried to put me in charge of their biggest account. Worried I would go through the same level of stress due to the lack of training and care, I left. Only stayed for 2 months. It was a very short commute, maybe 5 minutes. And the pay was low but decent for entry-level. Yet I still chose to leave due to the terrible management and stress."
bad,"would not recommend this place, there is so much favouritism it isn't funny.  The management has her favourites and says she has an open door policy, ya sure then nothing gets done, there are so many people leaving the company and still nothing is getting done, there were a few people with many years that left because of the management saying the will take care of stuff and then not doing nothing"
bad,Worse management team ever.   Managment promotes a bullying work environment.  process are old and needs to be updated.  The office environment is the most stressful part of the job.
bad,"no flexibility for the employees , management in full control over the employees, very stressfull and pressured manager hierarchies. no compensation for non exempt employees"
bad,"This is a tie and cubicle Nirvana without much room for innovation. Don't get me wrong, you can solve problems..but inside their box. If you are seeking simply a steady ""job"" then this may fit into your plans. It is stable and you can fade away here...literally. On my clock, I witnessed 2 people from other departments passing away on the job. You scan in, and you scan out. We were once told by a team of CEOs that they should not encounter us walking slower than them in the hallway. Yup! Great benefits, best insurance ever, awesome profit sharing and 401k but...the best part of my experience here was when I left the company."
bad,"I worked  CSR and logistic coordinator, the installations are the worse I see the restrooms smell so nasty and they  just have one bathroom for men  and one for women, the offices it’s horrible and smell like the restrooms they are the most unorganized  the bosses are so overpowering, every day they change the leads and confuse the workers which doesn’t a law them to focus on the every day operations of the company and customer need ls"
bad,Any issue that occurred in the workplace was scrutinized when I was employed at Expeditors. Did not enjoy seeing people under so much stress.  A person could be doing an excellent job and make an error to then find themselves in a conference call answering to any manager that decided to involve themselves.
bad,"Review process non-existent, yet Expeditors has performance expectations that may exceed what your initial understanding of that is. No clear communication between supervisor to employee of expectations. Often, any communication in that regard is false or misleading."
bad,"The initial job listing was discovered through a local university employment board. After applying I had a lengthy phone interview and was invited to come to the local branch to have a formal interview. During this interview I spoke with three different department managers and finally the branch manager. Roughly a week later I was issued an offer to work for Expeditors-Memphis, on the condition that I started through a temp agency for six months. This was the first mention of the job requirement of being hired through a temp agency, which I felt was deceptive. The job listing on the university board never mentioned the fact that this was a requirement for employment at this company. I accepted, begrudgingly."
bad,Save your time for a better workplace. Wasted 6+ years with very little experience.
bad,"They provide no training and if you don't fit in with their morale, they won't help you. Everyone always acts too busy to help you and gets annoyed when you ask for help."
bad,Horrible company to work for. They work you like a slave and expect you to do three different  jobs because they are too cheap to hire anyone. It could be because no one wants to work there. The management is terrible. It's definitely a click environment with management and they micro manage very well. It's about who your family is or who you are sleeping with there. Do yourself a favor and don't apply.
bad,"Expeditors is a very old school company. It is way behind the times in culture, technology, dress, and managers really do not understand software development at all. The culture is very backstabbing and includes a lot of favoritism."
bad,"Salaire bas, management des équipes inexistant malgré ce qu'ils vendent à l'embauche, pas de bureau fixe dèmenagement à répétition et évidement votre avis n'est pas pris en compte si toutefois on pense à vous prévenir. C'est une société qui se vend comme humaine et appliquant la politique de la porte ouverte et c'est pourtant tout le contraire."
bad,I would not recommend any operations position to people because the level of stress does not match the compensation. The sales positions I heard pay well and they do throw a great Christmas party but it is not worth it.
bad,"Expeditors has great benefits, but the pay is very low because of that. The management does not have visibility on thier employees which makes the culture very hard to thrive in. The turn over is very high do to the lack of trust between everyone."
bad,Incredibly high turnover made it difficult to perform. Stifling archaic corporate culture. Pay is bonus structured but not based on performance. Branch manager openly displayed favoritism.
bad,"They expect you to work nonstop, and not go home. There is no pleasing anyone. You are set up for failure every single day. There is 100% no way to win here."
bad,"Biased on age , caste ; lack of transparency on appraisals , impulsive personalities , reactive approach , favouritism. Bonus and VARIABLE pay distribution based on favouritism,  caste approach."
bad,"i learned a lot because they force you to do 3-4 jobs at once, while others only delegate their jobs to you because of seniority."
bad,"The company itself has sincere values, but the management staff does not execute it well.  Unless you are part of the circle of friends or the family tree you are not growing within the company."
bad,"The management is terrible, and you can work as hard as you want they still wouldn't appreciate it. They really don't teach you everything that you would have to know ,figure it out on your own"
bad,"Poor Management, inconsistent schedule, new people with same qualifications hired on at a higher rate.  Most days was 12 hours becuase of others not working & talking."
bad,"the company is very clicky and poorly managed. the managers are promoted based off of who they know instead of what they know and what they're capable of. employees are just a number and not an invest or asset. there is no support from management and instead of improving the moral, work ethics, and processing of the department they are too focused on getting employees to punch in numbers and work like robots but never approve over time and try to sit down and understand the day to day tasks."
bad,"Each day is different. There are many problems that occur every day. They are always able to point out the problem, but never a solution."
bad,"A temp agency called prologistix offered me this job which I took over a permanent hire due to this place being closer in proximity to where I live. When I started it wasn't too bad, fairly simple work, auditing boxes, putting labels on them, etc. Everyone I worked with who was a temp except one supervisor repeatedly said ""easy money. This is easy money."" Then one day the supervisor seems to be in a mood ""do this right or I'm ending your assignment."" My task was to slap stickers on boxes at that point. I very carefully put every sticker on, even double checking with my coworkers and they reassured me it was the right away. Break time. I come back from break and the same supervisor cusses at me ""my manager says you're still effing up all those stickers."" I pleaded my case, I knew I was doing it right, I even double checked with the people that were working there longer than me. So the supervisor has me fold boxes for the rest of the day and says it's so that I don't get into trouble and the next thing I know Prologistix tells me my job has been ended there. "
bad,"bad industry, bad culture, hard to move up very cut throat, most people were stuck in temp statuss, long hours, impersonal management, little to no future for employees"
bad,"I organized files, walked trucker’s to designated areas of pick up or delivery, scanned paperwork for transition, coordinate the flow of information both internally and externally, allow entrance into and out  "
bad,"Interview process was a sales pitch. Very little upward mobility. Repetitive work that ranged from very boring to excruciatingly stressful. Required training has little to do with the job at hand and the training provided is subpar at best. To make matters worse, the colleagues in charge of training are already too overwhelmed with the workload at hand, making the learning process a crash course leading to many mistakes and significant losses to the department, which led to many awkward conversations with management, which is inept at best."
bad,"The place is a disaster!!!! Way too much socializing. You get blamed for things you didn't do, called out in front of all your co workers, they work you like a dog!!! In the interview they tell you that you will get an annual review. Yea right worked there 8 years and had 2 reviews plus no raise for 6 years. My manager played favorites and allowed employees to get away with everything also acted like your best friend. Head guy is a sexiest so he favors males over females and if your a female your always wrong."
bad,You will get a lot thrown at you at expeditors. You will work really hard and supervisors and managers do too...sometimes. The key difference is that they are salary and you'd be hourly and they make A LOT more than you do. This company pays well below the market average. They talk a lot about company culture--it's just a list of values that managers want you to have. Don't drink the kool-aid.
bad,"It is a popularity contest at best.   Promotions only for those who are well liked.  They preach ""unlimited opportunity"" but that only applies to some."
bad,Not a place where your effort and dedication will immediately be met with just compensation. Very weak instruction during training followed by high expectations.
bad,Expect monthly meetings informing you of how much profit the branch makes all the while no one except management is getting bonuses. Expect to work practically overnight to ensure that your work gets done if you work swing/night.
bad,"A typical work day is fast pace and expect to juggle multiple projects simultaneously. Middle managers tries to come off as 'fair' and use their subordinate supervisors to be stress enforcers and play 'bad cops'. Workplace culture tries to come up with team building activities, games and gimmicks to maintain morale and camaraderie. The hardest part of the job is to deal with constant pressure to keep up with metrics and quotas under constant changes in personnel and operational paradigm shifts. Dealing with constant adjustments to ever-revolving supervisors and coworkers. Annual reviews tends to focus on negative feedback or negativity towards employee as a form of deterrent towards salary increase requests or trying making a case for promotion opportunity. Coworker cliques, nepotistic favoritism and navigating political minefield  are unwritten survival necessities. The most enjoyable part of the job is there's an array of new tools, concepts and innovation that this organization is willing to try out or adopt, training materials are really professional, logistics or supply chain business skills & learning opportunities are readily available."
bad,"ti indottrinavano con un sacco di regole da seguire, poi ti dicevano che dovevi essere ""visionary"" e ""pensare fuori dalla scatola"". Non venivano rispettate le gerarchie e i tuoi superiori ti facevano sceneggiate di gelosia perché avevi risolto un problema parlando con uno anziché con l'altro. non veniva rispettata la tanto decantata meritocrazia: chi si comportava in modo sgradevole con i colleghi non veniva richiamato, cosa che invece capitava alle vittime. Ferie: te le confermavano all'ultimo secondo dopo aver chiesto sempre di spostarle/accorciarle/rimandarle e fatto un sacco di storie. 52 ore di corso obbligatorie annue, di cui la maggior parte inutile. un dress code troppo rigido che nemmeno più in banca"
bad,"Overall, an old school company, focusing only on clients' satisfaction and not caring for their employees; lots of micromanagement as well. "
bad,The company does not hire forklift/order pickers. You start a temp. and end a temp. There are no benefits to the job. They have no permanent positions for the forklift drivers. You cant grow with the company. You get paid fairly well with the amount of hours you work overtime but there is no up-side to your hard work.
bad,They provided housing but however you couldn't leave your stuff like personal belongings in your room when you wasn't there without the foreman who was already on a power trip going through your things and stealing your food or clothes. Very tense housing and if he didn't like you or had the slightest hint you were on to his shady ways he would fire you.
bad,"Good training program,  culture is good, free lunches, parties,"
bad,"This company hired me on with the promise that I would get the training and help I needed to be successful. what actually happened was, I got trained by 3 people who were halfway out the door so they didn't care what happened and then as soon as they left I was forced into a role I was not prepared for and then fired because of performance issues. I spent 10 plus hours working everyday because they were so understaffed and got nothing for it except the boot. finally during those 10 hour days I would be lucky to get a lunch at all and then got in trouble for not taking a lunch."
bad,"What should be a fairly cut and dry work experience is made complicated by lack communication and poor preparation. Often I was left to ""figure it out"". This is something I appreciate and don't at the same time."
bad,"Expeditors is a great company on paper. Full medical (although medical benefits are currently being reduced during reviews). Excellent 401K. And unbeatable job security - few people get fired / laid off, even during the housing crisis."
bad,"They'll use you up and spit you out. This company DOES NOT value it's employees and is strutted like a feudal kingdom where the salaries are ALL low, BUT, the more you are ""liked"" the more in discretionary bonus the DM will hand out. The average desk worked may see a few hundred a month in ""bonus"" while the DM can be putting a $100,000 0r $ 200,000 A MONTH into their own pockets. The talk is always of ""hiring / advancing people from within"" but unless you sell your soul, and are THE favorite of your DM or RVP, you don't stand a chance. The CHQ / Upper Management all has ""their friends"" in the positions of power and hard work, good ideas and effort are not valued in comparison to being Irish, Italian ( or better - both ) and of course Catholic ( HUGE Catholic bias ). If you're African American or have ANY kind of a disability...keep looking, nothing to see at Expeditors."
bad,"After years, working for Expeditors. I didn't see much room for growth. The corporate culture is nice. However, the management doesn't follow the culture at all. Everything that is done needs five levels of approvals. Ordering aspirin also needs five different approvals."
bad,"CHQ (corporate head quarters) is a great place for people just beginning their career and is perfect for people who need rigid, controlling, micromanagement."
bad,"If you get your work done on time between 9-5 they believe you do not have enough work and they will dump more work on you so that you must stay later. No appreciation for going above and beyond, no raises even when you are promoted or take on more key accounts/work. Overall bad place to work wouldn't recommend it. "
bad,This is a sales based environment.  You are doing the same thing every day and looking at the same people every day.  Everyone seems nice.  The culture is dull and stuffy.  If you are into Logistics I say give it a shot.  They start at $14 per hour through a staffing agency and no guarantees for permanent hire.
bad,"Like the title says, the culture is terrible, people are very quiet and the one guy who I socialized with expressed the same concern, he had no work friends, like me.  Management is very authoritarian, unlike most places where the content of work you provide is number one, at Expeditors you will get in trouble if you go to the wrong website and get caught doing so.  Everyday I felt suspicious of gossip and secretive conversations about me or others and I never felt invested in the company because they didn't invest in me."
bad,"Working for Expeditors gave me an opportunity to understand logistics as it is a Global logistics company. "
bad,"Rotina intensa de trabalho."
bad,The people there are the best.  Management does not communicate with each other or their employees.  I heard several times throughout the years it is a man's company so woman have a very difficult time moving up.
bad,"Very unhappy with company. Advancement is not given, they hire from the outside without experience and give better positions than hiring from the inside first to those with experience. Open positions comes from word of mouth instead of inside web site."
bad,You will learn how to work quickly. Good place to start but not stay. I really don't care to review this company. It has some great people and some very frustrating people. The culture is outdated.
bad,Need I say more?  I couldn't leave fast enough.  Accountability is such a finger pointing game instead of an actual fact finding professional atmosphere.
bad,"The atmosphere is good. However, within this large company you get the feeling of being just a number. You are easily replaceable and they make sure you know it. Low pay. Good experience though."
bad,Its okay place but most of the employees there are temps and will not hire you on until years of begin temps. You work a lot there 10 to 12 hours no matter if you a office or warehouse employee.
bad,A typical day at work include coordinating a group of 12 employees to attack the work load for the day. Management loves to micro- manage their employees no matter what the task. Co-workers at expeditors seem stressed and overworked due to the lack of people power. The hardest part of the job is trying to meet the high expectations set forth for the quarter and not having a large enough work force to accomplish said expectations. The most enjoyable part of my day is interacting with my team and helping them get the work done.
bad,the company didnt seem to catre about out saftey they were more worried about speed and time instead of making sure the job was being done safely
bad,"clean place"
bad,A 3rd party logistics provider. Management varies depending on a location. An ok start for a career but best to move on.
bad,"Staff is expected to work very long hours for salaried compensation below the market standards. Half of the local office was comprised of management, creating too much oversight and not enough support on the desk level. All hourly employees were looking for other employment when I left the company. The small office size meant you got to know all your co-workers closely, which was nice."
bad,"Expeditors has a lot going for it: stability, decent work-life balance, and a generally positive atmosphere. This tempting trifecta lured me in, but for most programmers the place is a trap. Here's why:"
bad,"The company looks like a great place to work at where with hard work anybody can advance. However, the company is over-regulated in each aspect, poor cargo management service is used, management is incompetent and operationally the company is unprofessional."
bad,As an air export agent your day to day is a lot of data-entry. Work a lot of hours. Upper management is very nice but the lower down you get the more miserable people are.
bad,Senior Management style was not very professional in my opinion. I was extremely surprised to see the level of professionalism at QBRs. No KPIs were presented to the customers allowing for emotions to make the decisions.
bad,Company drives employees to their limit and still isn't satisfied.  I missed a couple of quality years of family life until I was able to get out of this place.
bad,Overall it is a good company. The ratio of work/life balance needs to be better. The foundation that the company is built on is outstanding.
bad,Working with Expeditors has been memorable and fascinating. The company culture is great and provides employee's with a supportive environment.
bad,Foi onde tive desenvolvimento do trabalho feito por despachantes
bad,"I was a temp here for over a year and was unable to get hired on, as management cited ""difficult economic times"", this despite the company itself thriving.  They were more than happy to milk their temps for all their time (in one case a friend of mine temped for almost two years before finally being hired full time)."
bad,"I started off in disorganization as an intern. No structured training, just a lot of shadowing and learning as you go. It was a dram filled place among the employees. Clique-ish environment. Stressful job. No raises guaranteed, I was told you have to ask for one! Worked there 2 years and never got a raise then when I transferred locations and went into a new position, I asked the new boss about a raise and he said I’d have to learn everything first! Like dude I just started this new position from one I’ve worked in for a year and 1/2."
bad,"Great company structure, core values and the benefits are great as well. I honestly do not believe the culture they try to instill in their employees is followed by management. I disagree with their training methods and work-life balance for the salary offered. There are many employees working there that want out because they are unhappy, that says a lot to me. I have worked for numerous companies in the past but feel it is not a good fit for me.  Although thankful for a first-hand look into logistics, I am glad for the opportunities that were afforded during my time there and the effort from my peers that seemed to really care; yet I feel with my skill and background, I would be happier elsewhere."
bad,die work-life balance ist ganz und gar nicht ausgeglichen.
bad,It has been a very overwhelming experience working at sag or.  I was given opportunity to climb and equipped myself. It was a great pleasure spending my few years with them.
bad,"A typically day at work required ongoing data entry. This involved printing in customs clearance contracts, to running data entry scripts, as well as reviewing test reports. "
bad,Good learning experience. It was a stressful environment for low pay. Management seems more concern in growing their bonuses than growing the branch.
bad,"Everyday is a typical day: Must wear business professional and show up at the same time every day, attend meetings regularly, and leave at the same every day. It is a strong company culture which is not conducive to change. At the same time, direction changes often. The result is a lot of demoralizing throw-away work. No HR, so pay raises, promotions and bonuses are determined by feelings - who is liked - and not by facts. As a result, leadership ranks are stacked with MWM. Nothing blatantly misogynist, no one will call you toots and pat your butt, but if you are not one of the favored, expect to take notes, schedule meetings, and take unimportant project assignments."
bad,"Atmosphere is really relaxed and good to work at unless you become supervisor like I did, then it becomes very stressful. Pay was very average and usually I worked a lot of overtime."
bad,"They require suit and tie to work each day, even though we never left the data center. Also was spread out over two buildings so you had to spend time commuting between two locations."
bad,"•	Data entry; recorded cargo as it entered the warehouse in Excel type programs"
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"fast paced environment, gained a lot of skills and knowledge in the time that I have been here , unfortunately, there isn't very much room for growth."
bad,"naive young employees, with a bad sense of humour, great senior employees, well spoken and highly professional"
bad,There is opportunity for advancement but it's very cut throat and political.
bad,"Non stop OT, management team focus on how many working hours per days per team. If no of OT relatively less than other team, need to share more workload to balance OT hrs per colleague."
bad,"Expeditors is a company that will over-work you and make you work long hours with low pay. The job itself is tough and very high pressured in a very past environment and at the end of the day, you are not rewarded for your hard work."
bad,there are opportunities such as learnerships and internships there is experience on distribution and too much pressure with long working hours but pays less than the job we do
good,"High stress job where hardworking personnel is constantly working long hours in order to get the job done.  Often the hardest working will be completing jobs for less capable at work.  Due to the high number of well paid managers, high pressure is placed on day to day employees to get more done in order to stay profitable."
good,"Management was always an issue, managers treated employees poorly and always talked down to people below them. Employees were asked to do a lot and not being compensated fairly."
good,"It was an ok place to work but had problems with micromanaging. Managers were promoted with little experience and didn't stay in a department very long, which made it hard for them to understand how the department functioned."
good,"I learned alot"
good,Just a a typical day at work nothing too exciting.  No room for growth. Technology has been a challenge for some teams and staying up to date in the IS industry.
good,No Comments. Good place to learn. Don't expect high rewards. Helpful partners. On the floor behavior isn't the best. But good to start your career in this field.
good,Great place to start. After a couple years It is a much better option to go where you are paid for the skills you have when the job market in the area is so competitive.
good,"You are not paid what your worth. They spend more money on trying to fake being good to the employees when all anyone wants is better pay."
good,"I have been working for the same company at Egypt for 6 years and i have really enjoyed working for Expeditors in Egypt and i have learned a lot , howevere working for Expeditors in Canada Brampton location is totally diferent as it is very stresful due to workload and staff shortage."
good,"Get to work and start working. Supervisor very Professional. Registered drivers, assigned docks, filed paperwork, Scanned and Captured. Use EDMS and Firefox. Data entry."
good,"This place at one time was the best place to plant oneself to provide for their families and to shine in a growing company. Now this place has become slowly overridden with issues regarding numbers and scores, and the value of the employees well being has taken a back seat. As a result a lot of hard working, decent employees have left the company for avenues that are far less stressful with much higher earnings per year. Do yourself a favor and research which department you plan to be in, the training of your managers, and the satisfaction of the employees therein, before you decide to call this home."
good,"Oportunidade de aprendizado, muitos treinamentos, muitas responsabilidades e autonomia."
good,"In this current position I key, allocate and assign orders to the warehouse for picking. Once the orders are picked and process via UPS/Federal Express. I verify the tracking information and close the orders for the billing. I also worked with various freight carriers for deliveries and pickups. Scan freight bills and proof of delivery receipts into the ECO imaging system."
good,"The work is what you'd expect for a warehouse job. The management and supervisors are what ruin the place. You'll never get more then 40 hours, ever. No overtime whatsoever. There are no incentives so you find yourself working harder then everyone else around you. There are no benefits to speak of either. Advancement is unheard of there for anyone who hasn't been there at least 5 years. It's truly sad they don't invest more in their employees."
good,"Even if you are a hardworker, sometimes managers do not see that and since you enter to the company as a temp you could be a temp for years before you become part of the company. "
good,"The office is very cold and unwelcoming.  The company advocates promotion from within; however, there is bias in the recruits to enter management trainee positions.  The employees are wonderful, but we were stifled in our creativity and energy.  Slowly, more and more regulations were put into place, limiting things such as breaks and socializing."
good,Expeditors has provided me with more of a work ethic and it a very busy place to work Every day is a busy day and goes by very quickly.
good,"Although I would recommend to anyone to pursue their careers with this company, I cannot, in good conscience recommend for anyone to work in Expeditors Miami Branch. Upper Management has been clear in the past years that its main objective is to make money, at the detriment of its employees."
good,"not very professional but not the temp agency fault... the company is ""picky on what they want and who they want"" not caring who it effects overall, very contradictive not really giving me tools to do my job and then doing the the total opposite of what they asked.."
good,"Business driven establishment with goals laid out."
good,"A good entry to logistics, the managers only care about themselves.long time employees beware the management will replace you with a college educated tool."
good,"I have been at Expeditors for the past 10 years and have not advanced in the work place. although I have learned so many things for logistics/distribution, it is time for me to grow in my carrier path. Really enjoyed the working experience however, Management wise, I do feel that Expeditors can do better in their hiring process as not only me, but several Distribution/Warehouse employees are not given the opportunity to advance."
good,"If you're looking for a conservative company (you'll be required to wear a dress shirt and tie every day) that prioritizes customer satisfaction above all else, then Expeditors is the company for you. They're a global company, so you'll need to be available 24/7 in case something goes wrong. And they're a logistics company so something will likely wrong. This leaves the work/life balance for most positions at the company in a ""Work is your life, right?"" territory."
good,"Came in fully open for learning and learning lots. wanting to grow and expand my knowledge in order to advance"
good,Expeditors is een amerikaanse logisitieke organisatie welke een zeer professionele cultuur hebben. Hierbij moet je denken aan een strikte dress code waarbij mannen in pak en stropdas moeten en vrouwen ook netjes gekleed moeten zijn. je word bij expeditors redelijk behandeld en ze organiseren ook vaak leuke activiteiten voor de medewerkers. Echter doorgroeien is er vaak lastig.
good,"Expeditors could be a great workplace as long as you belong to the ""click"". The salary paid to non management/supervisory positions is not competitive with the current market since they took away the free healthcare that they previously offered."
good,"Pros"
good,"Its a great company but if you want career advancement  you will need to:"
good,"Expeditors is not a bad company to work for; I've learned a lot.  I don't like the highly structured, professional work environment. It's also very stressful and fast-paced. Pay is not great."
good,"Communication is key at the company, although the execution of things is dependent on the individual whom which you communicate with. "
good,Very micro and time managed work environment. Management requires close to 100% accuracy at all times which can sometimes be very stressful.
good,"Fast paced, high stressed days are the norm.  Monetary compensation is sparse and does not match industry standards. Management is very knowledgeable.  Co-workers are the only reason some continue to put up with the long hours, low pay and limited advancement opportunities.  Most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers, vendors, and co-workers to manage and resolve freight movement issues."
good,"Expeditors is the best in the industry. They work hard to serve the customers and to outperform the competition. Compared to other industries or career paths, the pay is dismal and the hours are long. If you can get promoted, the higher positions pay well. If you are not having serious conversations about promotion within five years, get out."
good,Expeditors computer system is very awkward. You have to add data in the fields more than once. It gets very repetitive. And there is no graphic user interface. The company is the same way.
good,over worked and underpaid it was a good experience but they have a lot of turnaround so it was hard to have a steady pace and have consistent work. the people were cool but management was overwhelmed.
good,"Wonderful place to grow, learn and development your skills, meet wonderful, supportive individuals from all walks of life. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people."
good,Best part of the job is tyin down plane parts I have never seen before very fast paced work but its a diffrent experience. Hardest part of the job is being on time wen u have multiple things have to makesure that load makes it to the plane
good,"Good job to start out. If you don't want to go into a management role you will ""cap"" out.  No chance of a raise which does not help with inflation.  People are nice"
good,Ok if you need a job fast but you might work long hours shifts like 8-12 a day if its very busy. They have different departments there and you won't be able to choose which one you want.
good,"If you don't mind a fast paced, highly stressed manual process, plus a very strict dress code, which is professional suit and tie than this is the place for you."
good,"Not a bad place too work, the job is okay, but some of the other employees are not team players. Regular office work. Nothing exciting happens. I liked the scanning part of the job"
good,"Vorgesetztenverhalten"
good,"During my employment here as a new employee, I did not receive the same level of respect as other ""long-term"" employees. Being ostracized was to common and the ""new"" employees seemed to never have the same opportunities as the other employees."
good,"Work was not difficult. Promotion tied to management. Most of the company is well managed, however I had a very difficult district manager, which is why my boss quit. After she said she would quit, I felt it was best for me to quit also. Upper management finally realized this district manager was a problem and replaced her after I left the company. If that had happened while I was there, then I would still be there."
good,job is great but once its busy be prepared for long hours and no heat in the warehouse so it gets cold and very strict bosses who expect way to much from you.
good,"Culture is very nice. Everyone is super friendly."
good,"Huge workloads, long hours (sometimes including weekends). Employees are severely underpaid. However, the best part of the job is working with great people."
good,supervisors and management are not qualified for this position  it is managed poorly and  with no people skills;  no benefits
good,"Culture and environment is very boring and un-motivating. Horrible pay, you're better off working at a fast-food place. Benefits are ok. takes about 10 years to move up."
good,"It was an OK company when i worked there. Fun, but the layoffs came. And made it a stressful workplace. I made lifelong friends there. Its just the constant and random layoffs that soured this Job experience. Other than that, there are good people working there. Would have still been working there, just the oil business affected Expeditor so much."
good,I lasted 8 months at this company and wasn't happy so i changed career choices. I love freight forwarding just not at this company.
good,Good learning experience. It was a stressful environment for low pay. Management seems more concern in growing their bonuses than growing the branch.
good,Opportunites for personal development and personal growth. The structure of the company is very sound and developed.
good,Good stable company to work for.  Extremely high expectations for the amount of compensation you will receive.  Few opportunities for growth and upward mobility is extremely political.
good,"Expeditors is overall a good company. As of late, with the economic downturn, the company has turned a bit away from their culture and customer service focus. The overall expectation for an individuals perfomance is very high and sometimes not realistic."
good,"employee  training, respectful treatment, opportunity to advance within the corporation, take the employee effort into account, do not encourage creativity."
good,"I have been working for Expeditors for over 3 years. They have a good culture in a company and they hire nice people but the issue is that they don’t want to pay good money so they hire really poor with no experience management. No people skills, no knowledge, simple don’t know how to use basic software. They only promote based on personal preference, not even looking on your professional experience or skills. If you have no experience I would recommend this company as something to begin with in logistics but if you have 3years and more experience you can find way better opportunities on market"
good,"Hard work and long hours made this a gruesome time working here. There were some instances of brief levity that raised the spirits such as coworkers joking around and such, but most days were spent toiling away endlessly. Managers would often ask me to work extra shifts despite me being worked to the bone already. Can't endorse this position."
good,work was light but management and other employees cause o much drama. every person is to invested in other people. management seems confused at times.
good,"Poor management culture. No advancement plan. If you want to stuck at your job, and just get a stable salary, it's a good company. But if you want to move up, it's hard."
good,"Expeditors are trying to get to the level of DHL, TNT and are trying to be innovative with a host of technical advancements. The culture is not the best as you have a lot of people wanting career advancement and are not willing to work as a team to get there."
good,"Good place to start your career but not a good place to stay for too long."
good,My position had room for advancement but was not flexible towards family needs. This high stress job should come with more vacation time. This position is more suited for individuals that have already raised their family.
good,Pushed behind the times by business needs. It would help to use It needs in your budgets. People you work with directly seem to care. A better work life balance would be helpful
good,"I have worked for this company for a total of 5-6 years, and they gave me a chance to be able to grow and gave me a chance to advance. Strong foot print in the logistics industry."
good,"professional enviroment operation department had a big load because of less number of employees my job was to process shipments, making documents and arranging carrage  I learn very much from this internship"
good,"Coworker are great management sucks, because of there titles they feel the only great ideas are the one they come up with and not from the people who are getting the job done daily."
good,"Working in ocean export shipping is a very fast paced with little room for error. All documents that are sent to the customer must be 100% accurate because of the chance of heavy fines from Customs either on the U.S side, or the foreign country. There are many deadlines that have to be met as well. Someone who is not personally motivated or cannot work well under pressure would find this job challenging. You must be very detail oriented and not easily distracted."
good,"It's a good company to start off your career.  You'll be trained and be put to the test on the job immediately.  Lots of company/ branch politics, if you are able to navigate through that then, you'll do well.  "
good,"I loved my position there and learned a lot about the import and customs brokerage industry. Unfortunately, when I brought it to the attention of management that I had some concerns with my supervisor, I was let go within two weeks. My co-workers were very nice, but many of them seemed to have low morale. The hardest part of the job was the fast pace and my supervisor's ""sink or swim"" management style.  The most enjoyable part was dealing with customers and helping them get the information they needed. A red flag should have popped up when I was the 11th person in a row hired for that particular position. Best of luck to those who come in behind me."
good,"giornata tipica: 3 giorni su 5 in giro a trovare clienti con appuntamenti precedentemente presi. proporre i miei servizi e consigliare i clienti soprattutto su come risolvere i propri problemi in materia logistica. in fondo l'esperto sono io. In ufficio: stendere un sacco di report e relazioni molto spesso inutili, prendere appuntamenti e fare riunioni con i colleghi."
good,Great security and benefits but not the best work/life balance.
good,"The company implements a wide variety of KPI's to ensure quality of customer service.  All employees are required to undergo continuous monthly training that exceeds the industry average in order to remain current with industry information."
good,I learned drafting emails and interacting with foreign people. Achieved knowledge of freight forwarding companies and how to coordinate with the airlines.
good,While working at Expeditors I had great difficulty learning the accounting field. There was only one person handling all of the accounting when I started and he wasn't an easy person to get along with. He got promoted when he wasn't even a great teacher yet blamed me and my co-worker (that was hired a few months after I started) for issues that weren't taught properly to us.
good,"The work is extremely fast-paced, the demand is high from clients, and the senior management team can be intense. Compensation is good but, you have to speak up and fight for what you deserve- nothing is handed out. The hardest part about the job is the work/life balance. It's pretty bad, especially if you don't have a family or other serious obligations. "
good,"Expeditors International of Washington, Inc. engages in the provision of global logistics services. It offers airfreight services, ocean freight and ocean services, and customs brokerage and other services."
good,"There is room to grow here, and you will learn a lot. But it is necessary to have a sink-or-swim mentality. You will have to reach out and get motivated on your own. Opportunities are there, but you have to initiate them. Upper management seems unorganized."
good,"The position of Distribution Agent is an entry level position where basic Office suite skills will get you by. Management needs a serious look, major short coming of the company"
good,A very intense work environment and management expectations are very intense as well.  They are very generous with benefits and perks of the job.  Training was insufficient and selective for the expectations presented by management.
good,"the office was in transition at the time I was there, The amount of business has grown faster than they could hire and train employees"
good,"The Benefits are spectacular. Immediate 15 days vacation upon hire, paid sick time etc etc. However management is so horrible it's hardly worth it. In my year there I saw 5 (two supervisors, three employees) people leave over the span of 6 months. High turnover rate for an industry that is going to be and has been around for a long time. The constant stress and under staffing is a huge weight on everyone's shoulders."
good,Dejar de lado la amistad laboral y enfocarce en quienes dan más beneficios a la cía
good,"A typical day at work was going through your emails and then doing quotes for customers.  You would then have to go on a sales call to acquire more accounts.  Finally, going through your AP to make sure you general ledger accounts are in order."
good,bad management/ poor work environment/ not manageable/ housekeeping not good/stress full/ very bad communication/ unhealthy workspace/ unnecessary  double work
good,"Work was good but I am a single mother and need a permanent, full time job. Because of childcare, I must work during the day time when my children can attend the YMCA and school"
good,Professional individuals with main goal objective to provide quality customer service.  Weekly training on the many aspects of the company operations makes for a well informed and  better employees.
good,Expediters training program is the best in the industry. A good place to start your career in logistics and learn. People are friendly and knowledgeable.
good,"Expeditors is a great company to start out of college, It will pay the bills and get you on your own feet. There is always work to be done, and you will stay busy."
good,"Upper management not concern with lower employees. Great benefits. Career advancement not common, managers get to positions and stay there for ten plus years."
good,"I had the privelage of working with many people whom I enjoyed, but unfortunately, if you are not a relative or close connection of Senior Level Management, your career will not advance and you will watch your peers who may fall into this category receive preferential treatment and career advancement.  This creates a culture of resentment and therefore a toxic workplace."
good,if your young and need experience this is the place for you. for the people out there looking to take things to the next level professionally and monetarily avoid this place they will try to get you as cheep as they can and stick you where your needed and never let you do or try other things. if your good at something they keep you there and wont let you advance.
good,I come into the job and unload/load trucks with a team of 2 or 3 until the end of the work shift I work with mostly Hispanic that speaks Spanish all day
good,"Es una gran empresa a nivel global, pero es como todo, cada oficina tiene sus propias maneras de trabajar."
good,"Certain management can be a little hard, but over all a good company to work for. The pay is the lowest in the industry but they believe to make it up with the benefits offered."
good,"Work is unloading wagons with different merchandise whether school, electronic equipment. You work in a healthy environment with a little pressure but you work. A well traveled job."
good,"Expeditors was a great place to learn and develop skills in the global logistics/business world. Day to day was very challenging with heavy workloads and minute to minute customer service both verbal and via email. Customers expectations are tight but after learning their specific needs came very easy and enjoyable when you met deadlines and kept the customer happy. Developing relationships with customs and border protection, forwarders, airlines, trucking companies and of course our clients was the best part of it all as communication was key in getting the job done correctly and effectively.  Advancement came very easy for some if you had the right people backing you. Nepotism runs rampant and you will find family members of upper management getting priority of titled positions without jobs even being posted to the branch. After 12 years of dedication I feel its time for me to explore elsewhere, somewhere my skills and hard work will carry me to a higher position without my relationships or relations for that matter being a factor. Pay is hourly but with bonus at percentages that aren't always promised month to month. PNL is very sketchy and unexplainable. My time here as been very up and down as my customer service skills have always surpassed the norm. I have attained numerous awards for exceeding expectations, but feel as if my continuous level of customer service has hindered my ability to be moved up and almost forced where the company wants me. Direct management hasn't changed over the last 7 to 8 years and do not see many opportunities to grow. Overall I cherish the"
good,No opportunity to move up. Can an up been a temp for years and not see if you become company. Management is just looking out for them self and don't worry about your hours.
good,"The typical workday is monotonous. You will be doing the same thing everyday with nothing new. Getting ahead in this company depends solely on who you know or who's circle you are part of. There are friends and family members of people in upper level positions that will be promoted or allowed to keep their jobs based on their relationships. The managers are hit and miss. Most of them got to where they are by being friends with the right people. You'll be given a heavy workload and tons of pressure to get it done. It can be very overwhelming. If you have a good team or manager, they'll help make things easier by looking for better ways to do things."
good,Expeditors Logistics is a great company to work for. They collaborated with my school schedule all the way to my degree. Working as a customs broker we would  service clients through variety of communication to provide customer services with information about trailer product and other additional information. Learning customs and transportation was not new to me as my history of employment was in the field. I personally worked on my own passion of computers and want to start a career in a this field. Where i work now does not offer any positions and would have no hope of growing within the company into a field that would be more suitable.
good,"I have been worked in Expeditors for more than 10 years. I have built up my interests on Human Resources and Administration field. "
good,"a very stressful job environment"
good,Not a very techy company. They underpay a lot of employees and aren't very transparent with workers on their intentions.
good,Expeditors is an International logistics company with great cultural elements and values. They have a Robust training system in place.
good,This team had unique reporting requirements that benefited from a creative report developer.  Management was generally supportive but upper management was often late with requests requiring a mad scramble to deliver reports on time.  The hardest part of the job was waiting for the requirements.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling of accomplishment when creative solutions were found and implemented.
good,Everyday is a busy day even though its a slow day for others. Time goes by really fast and i love being busy the whole day. The hardest part of my job is finding what the drivers are picking up when they don't reference the right pick up numbers.
good,"Typical day is taking garment stock orders, set them up by sizes and load them into garment truck. I've learned inventory control and how to log them in the stores system. Management was great and fun, along with my co-workers. The hardest part about the job was dealing with the low pay and no benefits. And the most enjoyable part was free lunches and gifts from the managers."
good,"Please be ready to learn quickly and be able to think sharp and respond fast using problems solving skills. They way to move up is to show your self willing to learn new things. They have a type of person they are looking for ,they do not have to have the experience just the over all look and they will train you ."
good,My position at this job was very important to this company and I made goal every week. I came in this job as a temporary employee and my job assignment was only suppose to last for 30 days but I was there for 3 months. I enjoyed this position and caught on really fast but the management skills were rated as a zero and really in need of some help because the communication skills are horrible.
good,"I've had better jobs, and I've had worse. The paychecks were deposited regularly. Indeed won't let me proceed without filling out this box, though I haven't got much to say. It's a job."
good,This company has great benefits the employees are friendly there is always room for opportunity and growth pays competitive salaries . management cares about their staff
good,"The pros are good vacation, good local management, and good benefits. The cons are no flexible scheduling, no remote working, no casual attire days, everyone must wear professional dress everyday even Friday. No diversity in executive management. "
good,friendly work enviorment and good managers. great people
good,"tres jolie cadre, bonne équipe"
good,"order picker is to pull select items from storage and ready them for shipment. As a warehouse order picker, your duties include reading the digital or printed request, pulling the items, and placing them in the correct box or load container for the order packers."
good,Working for expeditors was a good place. I made a few mistakes that I learn  that cause my job to be lost. I think I could to better if they hired me again
good,"- do dispatch list for other company"
good,We shipped rockport shoes to multiple vendors. We would contact all freights to schedule pick ups. The customer service postion would require a lot of fast pace and making sure we respond to all email in a timely matter.
good,"Good place to work in order to get your feet in the door and get some experience under your belt. However, the pay isn't great but the benefits are good."
good,"low salary, perfect benefit. Good life&work balance except for night shift. Only Windsor office has the night shift. Headquarter in Toronto is far more good than others."
good,i didnt like working here. the employer was not good at all. there are way better jobs out ther. i would not recommend working here to anyone. thats all i have to say.
good,"You can easily get very comfortable in your position especially if you have no desire to move anywhere. There's really good benefits though such as 3 weeks vacation, 401k, discounted stocks for employees."
good,"It was clique like, high school mentality.  I did learn a lot and worked evenings so I could be home with my babies while my husband was at work.  I liked the position."
good,"Must balance between corporate, local and customer requirements. Hours can be long depending on the time of the year. "
good,"If you want to be in Custom sBrokerage...do yourself a favor and apply at a different branch."
good,I would recommend this job to somebody who has a family and wants stability.  I would not recommend this job who wants something different everyday or for somebody who wants the experience to get started their career.
good,Expeditors was a good company to get my foot in the door for warehouse jobs. They were able to train people in forklift operating and also gave me a good amount of hours.
good,"Some days was stressful some days was really fun place to be. I have learned how to be organized, learned about other people and their culture. The hardest thing about the job, is when a lot deliverys come in. We had to work fast so they can be delivered on time. But the job is fun a lot of laughter and good people"
good,"This was a temporary position. The job place was clean and organized. Everyday we came into work, we got a layout for the day and did what was needed to complete the job."
good,"The pay is terrible. You can earn more at McDonalds flipping burgers. However, the job is extremely interesting since you can work with clients all over the world bringing goods into the US."
good,I really enjoy getting to speak with fellow colleagues and learning new techniques.  My days are quite long and demanding and not always possible to take necessary breaks.
good,"good for skill enhancement "
good,"A high pace working environment. The work place culture at times was a very high stressed environment, due to company integrations. The hardest part of my job was having to work every holiday and not have time for my family."
good,Goede leerschool goede basis in de ontwikkeling van de moderne eisen
good,This question has already been asked and is a repeat. I am answering it in order to move on. I will delete it if possible in the future. Minimum requirement
good,"Everyone was very nice and hardworking, but it was so harsh and soul sucking.  They made you change into a worker drone even just to input data.  As if you're productivity would suffer if you wore the wrong outfit.  Very professional and efficient, but leave workers turning into worker drones.  If you're into that already, then Expeditors is the place for you!"
good,"stable secure company to work for."
good,"It was my replacement so each day I worked in different department."
good,"Good benefits, good work environment. Long hours, low pay. Company as a whole is great, but the management can be lazy sometimes."
good,"Easy days with a lot to do. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with the bosses on a day to day basis. Some of the bosses are alright, but others are extremely stressful."
good,"you manage your desk it is not a team atmosphere even though they put you on a team. Co works are friendly but cannot get to close as everybody must watch there own but."
good,Supportive Management but didn't always check into complaintsI learned a lot about rigging sometimes co-workers were rude and trying to act like they were my boss then when reported they would lie.
good,"24/7 hour operation, many tasks to be done at once, very strong team in place. 5-10 trucks to unload per shift. Responsible for night ops."
good,"As an intern at Expeditors, I learned about the freight forwarding business and had the chance to interact with upper level management."
good,"This was a good introduction to professional life after graduating college. The offices are small, so they allow the employees a good level of responsibility right off the bat. If you have the drive to create opportunities for yourself then Expeditors in a great company to work for."
good,"I arrive to work 15 mins early to start my work day sign in to prepare to key entries for shipments crossing from Canada into the US.  I have learned OGA (other government agencies) FDA, FCC, DOT, APHIS, TSCA, etc.  I am a hard work that work well with others."
good,"Learning, good platform to understand the supply chain requirements of the clients and formulate better process with the cost optimization in mind"
good,"If management likes you, you'll go far. Depending on your department, lots of overtime is available. You have an opportunity to learn a lot throughout the year, as you are required to complete 120 hours of on the job training."
good,expeditors was a pretty decent company to work for. they will keep u busy and the management is very friendly
good,Over het algemeen een goed bedrijf om voor te werken.
good,"Average company, average dockworker warehouse experience, supervisor asked me to break company policies(unknown to me) by having me handle restricted cargo which ended up in my termination. I did not damage anything."
good,"Very busy and stressful place. So many people left the company because of this reason. Too much negativity between colleagues including managers."
good,"Offers great benefit package with 401K company match. Work/life balance does not exist in this company. Depending on the department you work here, you might not see the day light until you leave for lunch or home."
good,"I worked at expeditors briefly. I learned a lot in my time there and my superiors were great, but for the amount of pressure and work involved the compensation is unacceptably low."
good,Expeditors has the potential to be a great company. They have some stand up leaders but their employment practices are lacking. Buddy clubs do not achieve greatness.
good,"Entreprise américaine dynamique a forte culture, parfois un peu trop pesante "
good,"The office people and warehouse people have a harsh relationship based on the lack of understanding of what each other can do in a reasonable time, and what is too much work. The benefits and PTO are very good but the management and the upper staff are pretty lackluster."
good,"Expeditors is a great company with great benefits, globally. You might be very happy depending on the branch management you work for, or be very disappointed."
good,Management was lack-luster along with co-workers seeming to not care about the work. I would a team environment where people take pride in their work. There really is no motivation at the facility.
good,Your busy from the time you clock in until your off labeling boxes and preparing pallets with shipment orders for forklift drivers to carry and load into the truck trailers.
good,"I am a DSE. "
good,"Good policy of training incentive, but full workload without financial return. No concrete expectation of growing due to not reveal real superior opportunities to apply. Jobs are posted for intern employees apply."
good,"I work as import customs broker. I usually log, trace, index and validate commercial documents. During my 4 yeras at Expeditors, I had learned most of the suply & chain pictures. I have worked with no issues with a management and also with my team. The hardest part of the job is that there is not enough room to learn different things. Yhe most enjoyable part is that you are indepedent while doing your daily assignment."
good,Enhanced efficiency and developed more cost-effective processes for issue shipment alerts. Networked within the industry processional and potential clients to find and attract new business.
good,"I worked in two locations, Seattle WA. and Austin TX.  In Seattle the upper management was great.  They took the time to get to know all the employees and their families.  The direct management was only worried about themselves and the money in their pocket.  The team I was on was very unhappy and the direct management did not care because money was being made.  In Austin it was the exact opposite.  The upper management was horrible and thought that we were just lucky to have jobs.  The direct management at least for my team cared very much.  The people I worked with on a team level were great and we had a lot of fun."
good,"My Journey through Expeditors is full of learning. "
good,My role at Expeditors is extremely varied. I manage all functions of the Ocean Import and Ocean Export departments which includes management of nine members of staff.
good,"EI is like an Elite University, no matter how great you feel there or how good the people are. Eventually you have to leave to get proper compensation for what you learned. If they would have paid more I would have loved to spend my whole career with them."
good,"Its a good organization to work with , they have good culture , work life balance is there , good monthly bonus but as per career growth company does not have much options"
good,on the job training courses are utilized to encourage the employees to learn more.  Large volume and diversity of files enables the team to learn and grow more.
good,Very good learning experience. Very high volumes and can be very stressful at times. Long hours with the opportunity to work over time. May be asked to work late every night and can feel overwhelming at times.
good,A good company to work in if you have the desire to be on call 24/7. Vacations are not respected as you are required to work whilst on vacation. You are not compensated well enough for compared to what you give back.
good,Can't complain too much but we were pretty understaffed so most of us were probably doing 1.5 to 2 times the work that would be required to properly execute the job. But great people work there and we have great resources and technology that makes the job a lot more satisfying.
good,"Unlimited Learning experience and good motivational staff and Management.The hardest part of the job is you got to be super punctual in the mornings, failing to do so will be adjusted with your leave balances.Collegues are fun to work with and very supportive."
good,"This was my first job in the private sector after college, I have to say you learn a lot of information regarding the world of logistics in a short amount of time.

good,"not big pay, not great management. not a lot of young people, you have to play a lot of games for advancement but if you play those well, you'll grow fast."
good,"Good people, but awful compensation package for Seattle area. The benefits are ok. Expeditors is a lean/frugal organization. It is a good place if you're starting on a new career or just came out of college."
good,"Old-school values but, they are open to new suggestions (doesn't mean they'll implement them, though).  The IT department is extremely chaotic, led by Directors and Sr. Managers (mid-level management, not the top), are also chaotic in their methods of management.  The term ""biting off more than one can chew"" is a gross understatement - yes, I DID say ""understatement""."
good,No layoffs and great work life balance
good,"Pros: Great medical benefits and paid orca card.  There's not a lot of over time or over working which is a plus.  And they are pretty flexible when it comes to family engagements.  "

good,"like the summary says, not much to say... if you need a job this is where you should go for a ""job"" .................................................."
good,"A typical day starts from handling customer complaints, to signing on new accounts. Handling a new customer. I have learned a lot over the many years, knowledge that I am willing to share with others. Management is very supportive of issues, concerns and very open to new ideas. The hardest part of the job is being very diligent when following company policies and procedures, dropping the ball can result in serious trouble for yourself. I love interacting with my customers chit chatting with them through out the day. Co workers are easy to work with, each one gets one with the job, each person has a task to complete and completes, if you need assistance they are willing to assist."
good,"excellent place to work excellent co workers"
good,"clock-in walk to my desk and login my computer. look at the floor to see what came in the day before after we left for the day, soon as caught up we would start receiving the floor for the day until completed...."

good,Put in your time and you will be rewarded.  Question is whether you can put up with the political game forever.  Great coworkers.  Poor network support.
good,No me agrado trabajar ahí por mi horario de trabajo
good,"Great company to learn if you put in the effort, but management suppresses wages and is likely to cut benefits and wages. I worked in the European offices, never in the US, please keep this in mind."
good,"The job was fair in benefits/ time off. Overall a great company, but the industry didn't fit my interests. Supervisors conducted employee reviews every half a year. Entry level jobs are usually keying entries, but open to advancement."
good,It was a good workplace a good team effort the whole team work together everybody got along and there was room for advancement. The managers were quick to help resolve a internal matter quickly.
good,"At Expeditors I was in charge of the whole accounting department which included: Accounts Payable, Receivables, Payroll, Collections, Reconciliation, Bucket reconciliations, Billing, Overseas billing/reconciliation, P&L.

good,"Hardest part of the job is trying o complete a job with no technological resources but still being pressured to finish it. Management does not cares bout their employees, won't take care of their own if it means that their bonuses will get hit."

good,"After 8 + years, though I enjoyed work here as I learnt a lot but opportunities here are lesser than a dot.."

good,Expeditors was a great place to learn a lot about Freight Forwarding and Customs Brokerage.
good,Good team work ethic. Strong drive in customer/client satisfaction.
good,"Expeditors is interesting. They understaff and have a lot of work going on at once. It's tough to get the assistance you need from other teams since they have all been booked solid with project work. The culture can be good depending on the team you join. Some people are so busy they drop parts of the culture to make up time. As a software development supervisor, i saw several managers who had a strong disdain for other teams and weren't concerned with communication. Lots of ""cover youself"" type actions. That being said, there are some amazing people here who do the best they can with what they have."
good,"A typical day at expeditors will be checking your emails, follow up with clients, set files process them."
good,"As the youngest member of the CSR team and being hired soon after I had graduated from UCSB and moved back to the Bay Area, I had a very positive experience with expeditors. Though the daily processes get repetetive, the company tries to do right by its employees"

good,"The company conducts extensive trainings of new and existing employees, that was the most appealing feature. This includes desk top training, inter-departmental sessions and training in other part of the world"
good,Culture of customer service is very important and the people who work there take that seriously.  Hires from within and trains for the job they need.The company has a no layoff policy which is good and bad.  Good that job security is a priority but bad in that there are many layers of bureaucracy and management that inhibits decision making and progress.
good,Expeditors is one of the good place to work. You can find very professional & caring people around you. The organization chart for Expeditors is excellent.
good,Expeditors offers an excellent training program that allows employee's to gain new knowledge of the business and ensure up to date knowledge of continued changing subject. Fantastic in communication with monthly branch meetings and ensures that their people are their number 1 asset.
good,Liked that it was a place where you could learn various things and the hours were not bad they where also understanding to situations that would occur or happen
good,"Lot of nepotism and favoritism and I had a great gig so it didn't affect me."

good,This company gives you the ability to move around within the company if you are not sure what the right path is for you. They are a more traditional company.
good,"As a brokerage customer service rep, there was always a lot to do.  The workflow tools were helpful in managing a workstation, but often left employees overworked as their clients required additional attention.  The distribution of work was not evenly shared and management often micro-managed."
good,The culture is great and the payment is fair. People are friendly and I would recommend this job for anyone who wants to begin a career in logistics!!
good,"Good place to work. Good company culture, need to improve in salary. Managment need to care more about their employees and their needs. Would recommend."
good,"Heavy focus on keeping employees that want to resign, big focus on training, market research for competitive salaries, experienced employees.  Management at times was not disciplined properly."
good,"The management when hired was the best."
good,A company that only cares if the work is done. Not many perks at this company. No space for growth. You have to have a college background to move further ahead.
good,Expeditors has been a great company for my first full-time job. They have a lot of benefits to offer and provide a manageable income. It feels a bit on the lower side but maybe its because I'm in a higher cost of living area. Great career if you have a family and need the benefits to support everyone in your household. Very traditional company though and not a lot of autonomy in what you are able to do.
good,"É uma empresa Americana conservadora, a politica de dress code é muito rígida. O salário não é o melhor do mercado, então você tem que negociar bem no inicio, a demanda de trabalho é grande mas o ambiente de trabalho é bacana."
good,"I loved the company. Good Benefits, wish they paid more though salary.  I would work there again, but I want to relocate.  It's on top of its game. Technology can't compare to any other company in it's level.  I like that they promote from internally. ."
good,A typical worked day would consents of me sending over one hundred emails a day and  making calls to move freight. I learned a lot about computers and companies.
good,"Expeditors is a great place to work if you just want a steady paycheck. It pays below the industry average but people rarely get fired and the work isnt that difficult. The executive team is great, but their message gets lost in middle management and rarely makes it into every day leadership from managers and supervisors."
good,"A Expeditors é uma empresa que valoriza o funcionário, oferecendo boas oportunidades e possibilidade de crescimento. Possui diversas filiais pelo mundo e uma boa valorização da cultura da empresa de excelência."
good,Good place to work. Room to grow if you have the drive. Great Co-workers. Family oriented organization. Worst thing....the commute to work.
good,"-Las coordinaciones diarias con la agencia de aduanas y el cliente."
good,"I liked Expeditors, too bad that they had to down size. good hours, nice lunch break and good people. Over all a good place to work"
good,Expeditors has been a great company to work for.  I am an on site at one of our major accounts so I do not really benefit from being at an Expeditors office every day. I have been doing the same job for 10 years and have never had an issue with management.
good,"The pay can be a lot better, other than that it was great. Love driving over the road meeting new people, stay goneon the road for 4 or 5 weeks new 2015 truck agood place to work"
good,Expeditors allows for a great work life balance. My team leaders are very understanding when it comes to leaving the office early for important appointments. Their understanding allows employees to keep their professional and personal lives in balance.
good,"Empresa maravilhosa para trabalhar, com uma cultura bem elaborada e fluxo de trabalho coerente e desafiador."
good,"I really good place to learn about logistics. They train you since the first day about their business, culture, goals, expectations, etc."
good,"A typical day at work is pretty fast pace.  The most enjoying part of work is learning something new every day.  You can learn a lot with hands on experience versus reading about them.  Management overall is good but has changed over the years.  The company promotes career development but depending on the department and needs of the office and management, you can end up at a dead end.  The hardest part has been working long hours because of the workload, and still expected to do more without enough resources."
good,Good place to work and grow with the company.They offer in house training as well as a chance to train at local colleges & universities that count towards growing with the company.
good,"Expeditors is a great logistics company.  They believe their employees are their greatest assests.  If you are willing to work hard, often more work than pleasure, you can go far with this company."
good,Any role outside of sales and account management will result in sitting in front of a computer processing documents and tracking shipments every day. Some offices are adding stand up desks which is nice.
good,"I learned a lot working almost a decade at expeditors, I would urge anyone there to take advantage of their many development opportunities they offer."
good,Je hebt gezellige collega's met wie je samen kan werken.
good,"Expeditors invests extensive training in their staff, with many enjoying a long tenure due to the varied promotion possibilities."
good,Expeditors is a fair place to work. I felt I was treated well and never really had any concerns about layoffs or job security. I think that if the company culture was slightly different (men have to wear ties even as a developer) I would have stayed longer.
good,C'est une entreprise qui forme bien lorsqu'on n'a aucune expérience en Transport avec les formations mais je trouve que l'organisation de travail peut paraître assez particulière car tout est divisé
good,Unload cargo from airline pallet and repack freight Input freight into x ray machine. Unload and repack Strap and secure cargo on the airline cargo pallet
good,Upper management vision and reality not aligned with mid level managers. At times structure of how the company and onsite structure is confusing.

Friendly co-workers and superior which can support and share experiences with fresh graduates in their learning process as well as a lot of training provide for all employee to sharpen their skills.
good,Non-stop working since beginning of shift till the end of the shift. Learned about shipping and receiving. Hardest part of the job was having to hurry in order to load the trailers in time of shipping. The most enjoyable part of the job was having great and fun managers.
good,"This is a great place to join straight out of college. The people do care about your success and growth. The people are great and the work life balance is good for a growing family. In the end, there comes a point where you only have so many tools to do your job. There is an expectation that the development department can code it everything, while this mentality is changing, it's changing very slowly. Lastly, we always wear a tie, which highlights the ""traditional"" 90's mentality that our business has for development."
good,"Durante os meus primeiros 7 anos como chefe,era um armazém habitualmente com muito serviço de cargas e descargas de importação e exportação de contentores.Em termos de aprendizagem,nada de relevante,pois quando cheguei à firma já levava comigo 11,5 anos de experiência no sector marítimo.Na parte da gestão,tentei sempre compreender o lado humano,pois como havia muito serviço também implicava muitas horas fora do horário de trabalho.A parte mais difícil era organizar o pessoal depois de 24 horas de trabalho seguidas,a parte mais agradável era quando finalizava o serviço com o sentido do dever cumprido.Depois e durante 10 anos passei para a carga aérea para tratar sozinho de toda a importação e exportação da mesma.Num dia normal de trabalho tratava das cargas e descargas de importação e exportação,aprendi com o tempo a tratar de todos os documentos aduaneiros.Colegas de trabalho fantásticos(as).Não havia partes difíceis.O mais agradável era o relacionamento com os Clientes."
good,"Managers were always impressively optimistic, encouraging, and supportive.  They gave us excellent opportunities for growth and personal development and had our backs when resistance was met."
good,"Every day I would go in and on hand freight, then I would take freight off trucks and put them away on the shelves. The management was very good I really liked my managers. I also really liked my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was on handing all the freight. The most enjoyable part about the job was driving the forklifts."

good,"Professional workplace and highly productive."
good,"Aprendi a trabajar en equipo, la Gerencia en ese momento me dejo libre para actuar en cuanto a negociaciones con clientes potenciales. La parte más difícil del trabajo fué cuando se dió el cambio del primer  Director de Estación GDL por un sustituto que venía de USA y no conocia bien el mercado ... Lo que más me gustó fué la relación con los clientes y la posibilidad de servirlos a través de buenas negociaciones también con proveedores de servicios"
good,"Day's Work Schedule"

My co-workers were my favorite team we stuck together on every assignment. My managers were very strick on procedures and policies that made the work space safe.
good,"Im glad i had been part of Expeditors work team. I learned and had new experiences working as a team leader and at a big warehouse. The environment was pretty cool, a lot of coworkers and three different shifts hours."
good,"Expeditors is a stickler for punctuality and professionalism and I like this about them. Every body behaves respectfully and maturely. The team is driven to get the job done, but in my experience as an on-site analyst, there was no upward mobility or cross-team mobility for me with the company. I stayed in the same position for all ten years with EI."
good,"Good Benefits. Good Culture. Job Stability. Competitive Salaries. Employee recognition and appreciation. Open Door Policy. Structure. Average employee tenure 15 years,"

good,"Expeditors has a great culture and is overall a nice place to be. My typical day is cramming through emails and processing shipments. There is a lot of coordination with our customers and our offices overseas for any given shipment. Since I was new to the field when I accepted my position here, i learned a great deal about the Logistics and Transportation industry. I learned the export compliance laws and regulations that must be followed and what information is necessary for export customs clearance. One of the most useful skills i learned is how to manage my time effectively. I am able to prioritize my information and be the most efficient employee i can be. I am always looking for ways to improve my everyday work. The most difficult part of my job is knowing the laws and regulations of other countries we may be shipping to. It is very important to do research and reach out to key contacts overseas to get all the information ahead of time."
good,"Expeditors was a great company to work for, the working environment was vibrant and the workload was distributed evenly."

good,"Work was extremely rapid. As soon as one issue is resolved, two more pop up to take its place. It was interesting for a short time but eventually became wearing. The lopsided work-life balance was not worth the compensation."
good,"The EDI Department at Expeditors was great about not expecting me to work a lot of extra hours, however I wasn't paid as well as other programmers in Seattle. I never worried about being let go, as they really needed programmers and probably always will, as their on-boarding process takes so long they can never get enough talent into the department. "
good,Expeditors is a strong company and on paper it is a great place to work. I have worked in a few different offices and I felt it was hard to penetrate the boys' club that is the entire office.
good,We were a co driver operation. We would pick up freight and deliver them anywhere in the U.S. It was a good job but you need two people to do the job.
good,"Môi trường làm việc tốt, đồng nghiệp thân thiện, năng động."

good,"I learned a lot from working here, it was very organized and with good work it was very possible to grow within the company.  "
good,"Answered phones, filed documents, made copies, created log in sheets, data entry, issued visitors a badge to enter the facility. I learned to be more professional, organized, and how multitask."

good,"I learned a lot at Expeditors- one of the first times experiencing true corporate America. I learned business processes, global logistics, systems, accounting processes, and special projects. It was very hands on and opportunities of growth were available. I felt that this company shaped me to become the professional that I am today."
good,"Great Environment , success , have strong vision .... ...."
good,Expeditors is a good company that promotes great work life balance. Workplace culture is great. Team is fun to work with. Good learning opportunity. Various domains to explore and work.
good,"The benefits here are great, but what makes the place for me are the people I get the chance to work with. Everyone works incredibly hard and really gets things done. It's almost like a family here."
good,"Expediters was a top tier professional environment with a diversity of people and occupations. The education and support there was outstanding and people really cared about their jobs. There was a constant push for better communication that seemed to get lost in some of the day to day, but over all it was what one would imagine as working for one of those companies that is like family."
good,"upward progress is staggered with a lack of upward mobility in selected hired position .  location is awkward for such a prestige company.  the management personal are very polite and rewarding.  i liked working here, but the money was NOT worth it.

good,"Good company"
good,"Great history of never laying anyone off since the founding of the company.  Great place to feel secure while doing a good job.  No crazy expectations of overtime or competition with fellow co-workers.  My experience has been one of a people-first culture with a collaborative environment.  However it's on the low end for vacation, 401K matching contributions, and very few perks to speak of."
good,"It is a lot of repetitive computer data entry. It isn't very hard and doesn't really require much thinking, but because of that, the job doesn't challenge you to reach your potential."

good,Each day I log new deliveries arriving to DFW.  I then assess the location and requested delivery date for each file.  I create delivery orders and dispatch to local carriers for delivery the same day or following day. The hardest part of this job is to ensure a customer receives timely and undamaged freight.  I've learned about moving freight from other counties to the final destination.  Expeditors employees are some of the hardest working people I've ever worked with.  The best part comes at 4:00pm when my day is done and knowing all the deliveries will be moving to final destination.
good,when working with the labours and get job from them like loading and unloading and cross checking stock
good,Helped management the expediter carriers that Chrysler uses.  The workplace was very enjoyable and accepting.  The only downside to this workplace is that I currently work on 3rd shift and this includes weekends.
good,"Working for Expeditors, you'll know exactly what you're getting. The job expectations are made clear from Day 1, including dress code, work culture, and office appearance.

They really care about their employees and want to take care of them so they take care of the customers (and they will say that, too). This is definitely a corporate environment and you will most likely have a desk job which, I must say, is terrible for your health and well-being. The work is generally monotonous although the ultimate product, which is shipping containers all around the world, is at least a little interesting."
good,"A typical day at work was easy, but sometimes stressful depending on your line of work. Only time it was stressful was when there were more than 50 e-mails, or if your team was behind in a duty. I learned alot about logistics and steamship lines and howto create a professional e-mail. Also teaches how to answer the phone and organize your time. The coworkers were very nice and easy to get along with, but also very passionate about the job.

The company sets development goals to reach in a short term and long term period of time. The company values the effort the employee invests for the company and eventually, all the sacrifices you once did... in the long run are rewarded."
good,"A typical work day for me was full of multiple phone calls which include data entry. Taking the words and information from the customer and typing them into the system for their needs. Booking trucks for them to send and receive materials. I got people calling with very bad attitudes because sometimes a lot of money is at stake. Of course that wasn't all though, I also filed and scanned materials for the distribution center. Used Microsoft to help keep track of the companies and their money. The hardest part of the job was keeping all of the freight on time (giving the information to the third parties about the shipment). My co-workers were always helpful, when I needed help with something they were right there to help me."
