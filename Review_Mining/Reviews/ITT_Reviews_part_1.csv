rating,review
bad,One of the most unsafe and under payed places to work for.I have never been so unsatisfyed for working for a company that doesn't care about the employees just the customer and the stock market...
bad,"Union shop, it’s 2020 and they act like it’s 1960. Upper management is against hourly and vice versa. Supervisors have no idea how a machine shop works and therefore the shops are run bad. Machines are in poor condition and they are not able to be maintained or replaced. Operators get hurt, company tries to cover it up. Personally listened to management tell an operator to “figure it out”. This resulted in a crashed machine"
bad,"Underqualified supervisors and leads. Selfish people that wont teach others how to improve. People are extremely rude and when brought up to the supervisor, nothing is done. Very toxic environment."
bad,ITT was a contract mill for people who did not have any experience. I was there as a certified  engineer to teach people to become network administrators as well as outside and inside plant engineers.
bad,"They were the worst company I ever worked for, from lying and cheating employees to students paying 20,000 for an associate degree, this place was the biggest rip off in educational history."
bad,El convenio del trabajador se lo pasa por el forro...
bad,When I first started working there it was great. Over the years you learn that management is never a constant always changes and have to adapt to a new manager and what they want. The company changed the levels of job positions to make it same for everyone. Whatever you hire in as is what you will be at for the foreseeable future no matter how much you learn or advance in the field.Take a job at ITT if its your last resort.
bad,"This shouldn't be needed since the company has not been shut down, but, just in case - don't work here.  They push you to give good grades regardless of the student's performance and will threaten your job if you insist on making the grades be merit based."
bad,"ITT Tech was a terrible school that lacked leadership, curriculum, and competence from it's faculty. There were teachers removed from programs because they outright refused to stay current with technology."
bad,"Handled shipping and receiving and any excess of cargo shipments on a weekly basis. Trained, directed, and supervised teams to accomplish goals. Practiced careful, defensive driving techniques to attain and maintain a perfect safety record. Issued return authorizations and process to resolve shipping discrepancies and invoicing errors. Reported daily revenues. Scheduled, ordered, and maintained quality customer service. I performed routine maintenance on forklifts and vehicle to ensure proper working condition."
bad,Overall bad work Environment. No work life balance and is managed by fear along with intimidation. Former Syracuse Magna management. Need I say more.
bad,I am not a union person. I was high in the seniority but hated most of my experience there. People get away with thing and treat each other poorly.
bad,employees.Company is stable with good working environment. Good work-life balance: you come in on time and leave on time. Professional office setting - with large open space (nice sized offices and cubicles). Good benefits and have room for personal growth.
bad,"It was a call center environment doing financial aid over the phone. I learned more about customer service from management. my co-workers were friendly, hardest part is when the computers went down. the most enjoyable part is closing a deal"
bad,I learned alot from that school and I accomplished my goals.
bad,"I worked in admissions and was harrassed, ridiculed, berated, lied to, and mistreated on a daily basis...And that's just by management... Teachers were nice..Students nice....Dor and doc..Dof..Registrar..And dean..Even career sevcs director awful...Mean..Horrible evil people...I have never worked for such a terrible company...Forget calling hr...They did nothing!!!!!!!!!!!!! Disgusting"
bad,"Unethical"
bad,Worst school ever! I feel like I would have gotten a better education out of a community college.
bad,I was sent at least 5 job apps and by failing me they ruined my career.
bad,A work environment that has no regard for loyalty or hard work.  Workplace is at the bottom of the barrel.  The leadership is consumed with making the numbers at the expense of quality and customer expectations.
bad,"ITT Aerospace Control  has poor leadership.  Operation directors do not understand product and process.  However, very good in continual improvement tools but due to lack of understanding of the process many wrong decision made and over commit.   The top level do not hold directors and managers accountable.  Too much politics and inexperience leaders.  Basically the current management team is running the company to the ground and many good employees have been leaving the company out of frustration."
bad,"Have you read the news.  As a former employee, I doubted the reviews I read.  They were all true.  A poorly managed company with no solution to the problem and using out dated tactics and methods to recruit new students.  From Leadership down to the receptionist, a poorly ran and sad company."
bad,Nice place if you like to work 45+ hours and get paid for 40 at sub market rate.
bad,"Loved my co-workers but stayed less than a year in a management position. No training: always told to just call another campus to get answers... even after repeated requests. Even other campuses admitted there is no real training. Rude & condescending campus director who pitted managers against each other while acting completely unprofessional. Company professes that they consistently promote a positive and harassment-free workplace but it's the farthest from the truth. No follow through from upper management concerning unacceptable behavior... even after confirmation from 3 other managers. Do yourself a favor, do not walk, run from this company."
bad,A typical day of work consisted of waking up at 3:30 a.m. driving 25 people to work with my company provided bus. Arrive at work at 6:45 am to start the daily work assignments. I worked as a shop lead and was responsible for getting all maintenance jobs completed. The management of this company is the worst I have ever worked for and often times gives the appearance that they are uninformed and unorganized. The unprofessional manner in which they conduct themselves gets passed to their employees from the first day they are hired. The hardest part of my job was trying to work efficiently even tho the company made it so difficult to preform my duties in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to give the war fighter a vehicle in better condition than they gave it to us in.
bad,"Good people generally. Management will fire you for no reason (well, the bottom line is always the reason) without a moment's notice. I was a good employee, always did my job well and got excellent reviews. They replaced me with a temp (no benefits, lower salary)."
bad,Worst placeever to work. People gossip aniut each other every day and the bullying is terribke even from management. They don't mediate and make matters worse. Their goals are unrealistic and the people are inhumane.
bad,ITT’s top leadership is focused on company performance and external reputation at all costs. Willing to cut good people to meet financial targets in the short-term with no plan to replace the value they contribute in the long-term.
bad,the school went out of business cause the for profit is only about money.  we were always slammed with hittig numbers.  Thepoint is the era is not good for this type of school
bad,bueno yo tuve mala experiencia por que al entrar al la empresa como casi en todos mis trabajo aprendo rapido para poder subir de nivel o puesto pero en esta empresa estaba embarazada y la oportunidades bajaron pero no por mi desempeño si no por que tenia problemas de aborto y me incapacitaban mucho pero aun asi le heche ganas pero por el hecho de las incapacidaes cuando volvi despues del parto me liquidaron
bad,"I have worked as a program chair at an ITT for a little over 2 years, There was one student in my program that the Dean took a liking to. Anytime this student went to complain about anything I or anyone else did she swallowed it up like is was Manna from heaven. This student has had repeated documented cases of insubordination and outright threats to faculty members reported in IRIS (IRIS is the database where student advising is maintained)."
bad,They were shutdown due to over charging students and military or ex-military and having the pale grant or military money paid to them. They paid only have the amount and kept the money and charged the students the rest and put it on their credit. I'm still fighting that to get it off my credit due to them and filed with the government about it so I could get it off my credit.
bad,"Horrible place to work, especially in the payroll department. The managers in this department were just clearly bad. Came in late everyday, looked like she never slept."
bad,"Great co-workers.  Best part of job was helping soldiers. Learned how to woek with Microsoft Word and Office, also Excel."
bad,Been there for over four years. Every project that I worked on had a deadline that was not achievable. They would underbid to get projects and then expect the employees to work overtime to get things done. The upper management is incompetent and would not understand the difference between a developer who can do gui work and one who can do embedded development. 
bad,"1.I would work around puddles of flammable liquids spilled on the floor and left there in direct proximity to where I had to do several of my duties. This was after there had already been a fire in the same building! 2.I did learn many things involving staters and rotors, winding electrical motors for fuel pumps and then building the pumps as well. 3.Management would promise you a lead job one day and fire you the next. 4.Most co-workers and leads would not even talk to you in english. 5. You had to constantly watch your back, working as fast as possible for 12 hours with people who did not care if the product they were building worked or not! 6.Learning something new and providing for my family."
bad,This is a degree mill. You must pass students in order for them to meet their requirements to get acredited. Pay is not good. They pay about $1200 for eleven weeks of work. Go work somewhere else where you will be treated fair and where your masters would be appreciated. This place is scum.
bad,"The finance team was mired in ""how it was done when we were Kodak"" and couldn't recognize a new idea or someone without Kodak experience. A majority of the finance people had a high school education and had worked themselves into a finance position. Each person did small portions of jobs with great skill without knowing anything about what other portions were about. They did it that way for years so that's all they were good at, all they wanted to do. Trying to innovate there (which is what I was told I was hired to do) was a little like trying to teach elephants to tie shoelaces."
bad,"Pros: Pay is decent for Union employees"
bad,"Students unprepared for paralegal studies and/or were not interested in learning.  Taught four hours a day, one day a week. ITT has gone out of business."
bad,"This job isn't available anymore because the school isn't currently open."
bad,"I worked on the shop floor for six years and never got one merit pay-raise.The management is terrible and have the workers under intimidation. Every year they cut down the employee benefits and raise the cost of your health insurance about 1.5% of your annual income. The moral is very low, workers are never rewarded for their efforts, they are overloaded with duties and are given un-realistic goals. They pay more than similar companies,but have you doing a two mans job, at the end it is not worth it. Unless you have no choice look elsewhere, this place is already gaining a very bad rep and people are seeing it, it is becoming a revolving door. ITT Aerospace Controls Valencia,CA."
bad,"Nothing is carved in stone here. Positions, money, schedules, holidays, overtime, security, rules, policies, regulations, etc... everything changes randomly from quarter to quarter... They need to design a worker drone to do this job... they would probably be happier."
bad,ambiente lavorativo complicato e stressante non adatto a persone fragili di carattere
bad,"another example of a large company with ill equipped management and everyone scurrying to change jobs."
bad,"From headquarters to the trenches, there is poor leadership and management. Individuals are not held accountable, not qualified for their jobs and, the primary focus is rarely on students."
bad,"L'Itt mi offriva un buon stipendio. L'ambiente lavorativo era molto a vecchio stampo. Bisognava seguire delle precise linee guida dettate da ""colleghe più anziane""; non era possibile gestire il proprio lavoro in maniera personalizzata ed autonoma e quindi non in maniera ottimale. L'obbligo a seguire tali linee guida rallenta molto l'andamento dell'azienda. Dopo non aver rinnovato per la terza volta il mio contratto sono state licenziate anche delle eprsone."
bad,Good position and it served it purposing during its time. This was a temporary volunteer position for a well ran event. The event went smoothly and all communication duties I had to perform more then met requirements.
bad,it been so long that I really cant remember what it was like to work there. relocated to the northwest so not much I can say about ITT besides being there for 2 years
bad,The company went under pretty quickly. I was only there 5 months before they shut the doors. I would not have recommended them as a good place to work.
bad,"ITT no longer exists. However, while working there I was paid minimum wage to tutor students who basically did not want to learn. Most wanted an easy fix."
bad,"To call their students intellectuals is like trying to teach a hamster to operate a space vehicle. Management actually makes you conduct a  "
bad,The turn over rate is VERY high. That was a red flag for me. No training.
bad,"Smart, educated employees.  However, most have been there for 10+ years so very hard to develop your own career."
bad,The nursing program is a sham. Lack of appropriate clinical sites is a major problem. It is a disrespectful work environment where the administrators blame good nursing instructors for student failures. Nursing student admission standards are low and instructors are expected to pass students who make grades in the 60-70 range.
bad,This was a very serious tense place  not a place to laugh at times I felt awkward. Every day was the same work and review work for any errors
bad,"ITT is a decent company to work for, if you enjoy being in a union(local 3298) who does nothing to help you when you need them the most. Middle Management(immediate supervisor) will work with you directly as much as they can if you have issues come up, but even they are limited in what they can do because of upper management."
bad,Management was terrible. Overworked and underpaid. Kept having layoffs and expected people to do more work for no more money. Awful benefits. Miserable work environment
bad,"Machinist - Welder - Mechanic"
bad,daily mail sorting & indexing invoices
bad,"Management at ITT is poor, very hostile work environments, little to no job training, nepotism, very understaffed. The most enjoyable part of the job is the optional unlimited overtime."
bad,"No potential growth within this company;  upper Managements offer no motivations nor supports for to do your job.  In addition, no matter how hard you work or how you want to achieve your goal, you will never get there due to business corruption that trickled down from the top to the campus managment.  Every day they want you to call 100 cold leads to recruit prospective students from the jobs search data. The hardest part is the company only targeting the minorities group and made us sell a dream to them in such that they will have a great job with good money. However, they hide the facts is that 90% of their graduates are not employable due to the lack of knowledge and skills in this job market. The most enjoyable part of the job is to be able to talk to understanding customers although they know you are not telling them the truth about this for profit colleges system. It can be extremely frustrated when you get cursed at or got hang up on by the prospectives because they know you are not selling them the truth. The worse part is that when you are dealing with a Manager  who do not have a college degree yet tried to manage you and the team."
bad,They loved keeping people around that shouldnt have jobs (corporate welfare) and would let the good people go. 
bad,"Supervision of maintenance staff personnel, instruction and delegation of work"
bad,For profit school only out for one thing: profits. Is it a big surprise that they are not in business anymore? Very similar to other for profit schools.
bad,"Need improvements in work/life"
bad,"Managers don’t care, they lack on recognition on hard workers. HR was a joke, you think it’s suppose to be ‘confidential’ as soon as you leave the office everyone finds out what happened."
bad,Productive and learning about workplace culture and  diversity; a good place to work; I enjoyed having my on office; The hardest part of my job was the initial creation of the spreadsheet that had over 10000 blue prints hyperlinks
bad,.                                                                                                                               No longer in operation
bad,"I checked the lab computers to see if they were all functioning properly for scheduled classes.  Checked the lab printers for ink, toner and paper supplies.  Set up lab computers for teachers when they needed isolated labs from the regular school network.  Provided software and books to the classes when needed.  Repaired, imaged and upgraded damaged computers. I learned the proper methods for maintaining a school computer network and teaching needs. The management was helpful and experienced in maintaining the school."
bad,I gained a lot of work experience but working conditions were unsatisfactorily.
bad,"My first job out of school. Taught me much how to keep focused, keep out of office politics, how to sell high end price services, and helped me understand that work is not as easy as media portray it on television and movies. It helped me grow up. :)"
bad,"Advancement in the machine shop is impossible . The level your hired on is where you will stay . The biggest concern seems to be , how much work can be sent to Mexico getting under FAA regulations. There is a constant change in upper managment. The valencia plant in southern California is slowly deteriorating. 3 yr max life of a manager .they line their pockets asap"
bad,"Confidential Aerospace work"
bad,"They have many policies that are window dressing, 4 major management change in 5 years 3 in the last 2. Safety is job one unless money is involved. Keep your mouth shut and your head down"
bad,Retired from itt Goulds pump in Seneca Falls. They agree per union contract to pay in full my healthcare it’s on my exit paperwork. This is the only reason I  stayed at itt Goulds pumps. I still don’t understand how they got to renege  on their promise to me and all retires that worked at itt Goulds pumps
bad,"I would not recommend ITT as a place to work at nor go to school. The classes were under size and it had a cookie cuter approach."
bad,"the company needs new management in order to get the ITT UK back on its feet.  There are number of issues that need to be addressed such as staffing, culture, lack of life-work balance, etc...."
bad,Great pay and benefits just don't have any personal problems. Good luck if you go to work here if you do have fun. I cant think of anymore to say but it wont let me save.lol
bad,"Work day lacked energy, you're required to call call call call and thats it .  Everyone felt the lack of support from the managment team."
bad,"Good working culture .healthy work environment .MNC cluture ."
bad,"A typical day would be to ensure, schedule and assist the DOD."
bad,"Typical day at work involved the HSE oversight of employees and related contractors at various sites."
bad,"A typical day involves contacting your leads to set appointments, work conducts and get applications. Persistence is definitely the key to obtaining good results. Immediate management is consultative while upper management is directive autocratic style. Co-workers seem to be nice sometimes  but because of the environment cut throat. The hardest part of the job is the frequent changes with compliance within recruitment. When you think that you a good niche on how to be successful they change the game and give you less or bad components to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping change someones life and giving them new hope."
bad,It's about who you may know. Also very laid back place to work.
bad,"Company continuously disregards its own policies and procedures, and getting resolution to the smallest matters is next to impossible."
bad,"ITT-Tech only knows money and when it comes to students, butts in classes is all they know."
bad,"1. a typical day at work - 8 hour of phones calls, unless you have an appointment."
bad,"The work environment was not collaborative team environment. Most decision were made at the top management level, based largely on cost reductions or increasing profits. Little investment was made in equipment, technology or people, required to grow the business over the long term."
bad,Working at ITT was a great experience. Working with other students to assist them with getting a better understanding on material was great.
bad,ITT  is a great and safe place to work. coworkers are very friendly. Management very professional and with open door policy. HR was great very helpful with any question you had.
bad,"Cut-throat environment, corrupted management. Regardless of your proficiency level, if they don't like you they get rid of you.  For a lack of better words, if you know the right people you can do what you want."
bad,"This is a relatively new site and it was very poorly planned.  There is no local liaison and English is rarely spoken.  Once hired, you spend 2 or more months sitting in the company apartment waiting for your work permit to be processed, something a local liaison could accomplish in a coupe weeks. Salary is paid in Euros and then converted to USD for deposit into your account, this typically means a $150.00 to $250.00 conversion fee being subtracted from each paycheck.  On the plus side, local management and the people you work with are great, but they can not make up for the shortcomings of the upper management located in Germany."
bad,Completed a retrofit of a ship-based radar system into a land-based tracking radar in Saipan. Range of engineering functions include redesign of the Rf component chain to minimize VSWR and maximize output power. Wrote software for a real-time data handling application.
bad,"Where to start... Be warned first that if you are ambicious or have any sort of desire to make any real changes, this is not the place or culture for you. If you are driven like a car and want to drive for the best, you will burn out and then likely get demotivated and possibly end up leaving - by choice or other. The culture has a lot of long tenured folks hanging around and riding out until retirement, and they pretty much run the place both directly and indirectly. These folks have neither the desire to change anything, and if they don't get their way, will resort to a variety of ways to get their way. A couple of these folks are so in grained, upper management doesn't know how to deal with them, so they pretend there is no issue or cater to them. Take note if you are one of those super duper types - you will not be able to do anything. Folks have seen many of them types come and go."
bad,"Very hypocritical in stated values VS reality. ""do the right thing, always"" should have the following added"" ""unless it will make my numbers look bad, or I might have to confront/stand-up for something"". Many wishy-washy, spineless middle-mgmt....sell out subordinates to protect their own kind."
bad,Not a honest group of people were driving the company. Companies President did not know how to deploy strategies to his team creating a confusion and lack commitment in some areas at some levels.
bad,"Poor management need to learn how to treat employees, need to train upper management how to run a business and treat employees as humans, go elsewhere if your thinking of join an organization stay away unless you need a job"
bad,Easy day to day work tasks there are no difficult jobs there. The company tends to pidgeon hole their employees for fear of failure to replace their previous job position. This makes it very difficult to move and learn more or reach your potential. They have a tendency to be deceptive of their intentions and outlook of the business. The new VP will call all employees together on the shop floor to inform them of who he just terminated to instil fear and compliance. Instead of promoting long standing union employees to higher job titles they breach contracts and have outside non union employees to do the tasks.
bad,The management was fair to all. Union shop. After you get to the highest job there is no room for advancement. Company sold out and moved to another state.
bad,"The position itself was not bad besides 60 hours a week, the employees were adequately compensated for their time.  This was not an average position though and did require many months in a row in a hostile and possible war time environment."
bad,"Verkoop en onderhoud van meetapparatuur, waar ik technische ondersteuning gaf."
bad,"A great job, admirable mission but a bad organization that presented little opportunity to grow and excel. Long term employee growth and strong leadership and mentoring support was not important to ITT"
bad,Start work on one job break off to work on other jobs return to first job. Very dificult to get any formal training. Management out of touch with shop floor. Good co-workers best part of the job. Hardest part of job was dealing with the micro management.
bad,"Member and Team Leader of the Management Information System Information Technology Department supporting the Fort Benning’s DOL and DPW.  Providing network/server/desktop and workstation support for approximately 16 Domain servers, 1050+ computer systems, and 1250+ users across Ft. Benning."
bad,"gestione ""vecchia"", dominata da consociate estere che hanno interesse a devalorizzare il sito italiano e da manager che nn contrastano questi eventi"
bad,"ITT is focused on growth and increasing profits for stock holders. They closed our facility where people have worked for almost 40 years and moved it to Mexico to lower production costs. Employees are under-paid, over-worked, and end up leaving out frustration and higher pay. "
bad,"liked my job but it was a temp job"
bad,I had the best technical team is the SAP environment. The pay wasn't at market rate. My skill sets increased due to SAP implementation.
bad,"Usually i'm at work around 5:00-6:00 am. From there, I review any problems that had accured from my second shift crew. Try and duplicate any failure the was discovered.Troubleshoot units. Meet with heads of other parts of departments. (engineering/manufacturing) To make sure, our daily quota and delivery obligations, are met."
bad,"Working for ITT Systems was great at first. Once management was changed, the IT department totally changed. Experienced manager would technical/leadership school would make this a great place to work."
bad,I enjoyed working at ITT mostly and met great people there. I learned a lot but had to work hard for it. Nothing came easy and i was definitely held to a higher standard that the vast majority of my peers. It's a great place to learn but not necessarily a great place to stay.
bad,Got my first opportunity outside of an agricultural environment.
bad,Very rigid military contractor - going down
bad,"Productive and fun workplace to work. Company is growing rapidly and expanding to other places in the world. I have learned aviation communications, my co-workers are excelent, the most enjoyable part is to work with very smart engineers."
bad,"Productive company , always willing to promote. Great working with soilders being a retired army"
good,Average working culture. Management is not good. Not a great products. Full politics. HR policies are not good. Very bad systems. Not career growth. Average.
good,.
good,"There are too many managers, each with their own agenda. "
good,Typical day at work would be asking the question have you turned it off and on again? I also learned that most computer problems are between the desk and the chair.
good,azienda molto bella e bellissimo lavoro mi ritovavo spesso a controllare tutta una linea da solo
good,"Corporate dictates everything, guidelines do not offer flexibility depending on demographics, great to work with for a short period of time."
good,"I worked for this company for 6 months. When I came in I wasn't allowed to speak to any of the current Admission Reps bc the Director of Admissions didnt want their opionions to rub off on me (RED FLAG). You are on a dialer 89% of your daily; calling the same people MULTIPLE times in 1 day. You are basically begging for them to come in & enroll for an associates degree for $48k in fields that aren't huge in the job market or available to them. It's a total RIP off. If you don't enroll a student that comes in to tour the campus you are belittled, yelled at, & disrespected in front of the entire admissions staff. Once I really got in and started to speak with the other reps... They were ALL trying to find a new job. STAY AWAY unless DESPERATE"
good,"I loved my job with itt, but disliked management. There was to much drama, and people were treated badly. Management was very poor, and they only seemed to care about themselves. There was also a lots of harrassment and threats for your job."
good,"Schichtdienst Wechselschicht, sehr dreckige Arbeitsumgebung"
good,"ITT's culture has changed.  They used to care about their employees but now care more about their stock holders, and it very clearly shows.  Employees are expected to sacrifice for the company, but get little recognition or award for doing so."
good,Competent instructors with mismanaged corporate HQ. Job entailed a challenging student population due to misguided for-profit focus. Instructors were good but not allowed to customize learning environment.
good,"This company's focus is in healthcare.  I was hired during the time the OCD was planning to split from Johnson & Johnson.  I was responsible for collecting employee information for OCD & J&J employees to decipher what assets would be kept or not kept.  As J&J did not have a central repository for their human capital.  I worked with HR Manager's around the globe to collect that information and put it in a format that could be analyzed efficiently.  There was a lot of work done using Excel, Pivot Tables, Filters, V-Lookups, etc.  I was allowed to work a few days from home since my role was very much stand-alone.  I increased my knowledge of data analyzing and learned another side of the healthcare industry.  The people I worked with were very knowledgeable and easy to work with."
good,I was very productive daily meeting new students and helping them achieve their educational goals.
good,"I enjoyed working at Flowtronex, but once the market had a downturn, they abandon thier sales force. The golf and construction markets run in cycles and it is very difficult to meet the quarterly profit and loss statement everytime. This a business that will move up and down from summer to winter."
good,Day is focused on putting out fires. Very little emphasis on long term problem solving. Priority is to get product out the door. Management focuses on perception and rarely utilizes data. There's a lot of opportunity to make improvement and a lot of highly skilled individuals. Leadership is very weak and rarely listens to the workforce.
good,"Being a Veteran, I like working for the Service members regardless of the company I worked for. Fast-paced and upbeat were more than a great trade-off to help Service members relax."
good,"Enjoyed work at first, but the company has been going through economic difficulties and has been restructuring frequently in response. There are limited advancement opportunities and the culture is stuck in a 'we've always done it this way' mentality which is hard to break through."
good,Typical day for me would be setting daily goals. Reviewing previous days goals and overcoming objectives. My co-workers were great to work with. We were one big family. The most enjoyable thing about the job is knowing that at the end of the day I helped students find their path to reaching their goals.
good,"buying parts for night vision goggles"
good,"Not a over all bad job, but could use improvement. Company preaches safety, but overlooks it when the job needs to be done now, and it costs them more money. they preach safety as long as the employees are the ones that have to do it and, they don't have to be concerned with it and it is not costing them a lot of money. example, they require all employees to wear safety glasses all the time, but will not pay for subscription safety glasses for people who need them, so either they have to pay out there pocket on their own time for subscription safety glasses or walk around with the cheap over safety glasses the company provides on top of their regular safety glasses having their glasses mess with their sight.when you complain to safety they say complain to hr."
good,"A typical day at work was extremely long and hard one person doing a two or three person job. Physically demanding, but the team work is amazing with the right people. Different cultures and ideals meeting in one place to create brake and fuel lines for vehicles. The opportunity to advance or learn a new trade was extremely limited. I found the people the best part of the job, I have friends from there that I will have for life and experiences that have helped mold me into who I am today, appreciating the degree of dedication required to adapt and change to meet goals thats seem impossible."
good,Enjoyed ITT and the people there however after two years they laid off 17 people without attention to production of each person
good,"Frankly, till I work there was no Top Management Vision, Good to have on Paper but reality is different. Top Management should be practicle not just dreaming and there is no result."
good,"Engineering talent was very impressive.  Many challenges - especially within operations who is extremely dependent upon engineering support and cannot function on it's own merits. "
good,While ITT remained a strong defense contractor they resisted keeping up with competitive working conditions and salaries frequently loosing talented engineers during the 90's. As such they struggled to win contracts and eventually were not able to remain competitive and forced to sell out.
good,"...other than that, I'd pass!"
good,"The company is fine -- culture is one of their number one goals, however, if you are ""lucky"" to get a boss that doesn't share the same goal, you're not going to have a good time."
good,"ITT ofrece buenas oportunidades para aplicar nuestra experiencia, junto con un buen ambiente de trabajo."
good,Not a great location to work.  Best part was a 20 minute bus ride to NYC.  The work was boring.  My co-workers was great.  We have kept in contact.
good,Learned new systems quickly. Big global company with many offices globally.  Worked well with users and enjoyed the feeling of accomplishment in a support role.
good,very negative environment and is very taxing on your mental state. Sales environment as oppose to education.
good,"scanning equipment and packages, driving, unloading of trucks, trains, and vehicles."
good,My job was to redo the standards to reflect the move to Mexico. I also was given the task of reviewing the method used to establish raw materials standards.
good,"Job was simple long hours though for as much work as we were doing (12hour shifts 6 days a week) management favoured certain people, as always. Easy none the less."
good,"Difficult working conditions at times, VERY hot temp's."
good,I enjoyed working here and left on a good working professional relationship.
good,Very simple requirements but not worth the time if you are a full time student and live far away. i would travel 30 miles a day for 4+ days a week with a max of 20 hours per week of work time
good,A typical day at work is very intense. Students in general have very limited ability in mathematics. I have learned a lot as far as adjusting myself to teaching student with a very different background an level. The co-workers are in general nice. The hardest part of the job is rlated to the adjustment and preparation of the lesson plan that can be used to teach a variety of student in the same group with very different skills in mathematics.
good,Not really a good place to work. Management does not want to get involved in helping one to advance or help research what the criteria is to improve oneself. There is no one that seems to know how to do this.
good,"The pay and benefits were great. Management just out to protect themselves from losing a good paying job...coworkers will brown nose and rat u out for anything like having ur cell phone on u or takin a 5 mins longer break just to get favoritism when layoffs come around and they do come around because it's a contract job. I am being real about this, u got 60 years old men snitching on u like it's middle school....I came in as an inspector because I am a veteran and have a bachelor's degree and little did I know, everybody in all depts applied for my job and I was hired from the outside which made me a target for a lot of jealous people who didn't have the credentials I did to get my job. This is fort bragg now...the peoplewill stab u in the back and are so fake putting on a show for management so they remain relevant when layoffs come and hope they kissed butt  enough that they aren't put on the laid off list..There are some genuine people there but watch ur back because snitches everywhere because somebody got promoted or came from outside the company and they want ur job or layoffs are comin because they lost the contract and will do anything for management to keep their job..believe what I say..this is the cold hard raw truth."
good,Itt was not the best company to work for management does not explain themselves very well. they let your security clearance expire without getting you a new one.
good,"Company has been bought and sold so many times that it is hard to really rate it. Upper management appears to be ok, but they could improve on their middle and lower management."
good,Focus on the preparing students to function and be competitive in this new economic environment that's knowledge-based and technology driven.
good,OK place to work but employees are numbers on a spreadsheet unlike how it was before ITT purchased it.mbnmcgmhfgdgFhghgjghjghjhm

good,Unforntunatly my contract was cut short because of upper management and the U.S. Army not seeing Eye to eye on things.
good,I enjoy working in the security field. I love being an Information systems security officer and would like to continue to grow in this field.
good,Average Company to work for at best. They are however above average allowing you to work around family issues.
good,ITT does have good systems in place to be successful. We have a very lean process and flexible manufacturing system. The business model is driven by customer demand and ITT can make certain changes to adapt to meet their needs.
good,ITT could be a great place to work if Management actually followed what they preach.  They give classes on work life balance but expect you to answer emails all hours of the day or night.  They just don't care about their employees.
good,"Collega's zijn top. "
good,ITT is a reputable well established organisation that has seen numerous changes over recent years. Whilst aiming to be a significant player within the Pump market they are hindered by lack of understanding of the global market by the senior leadership team and unfortunately revert to a North American strategy.
good,"I love working here at goulds pumps,I get to work 12 hours a day doing nothing but standing around waiting to finish building pumps,I have worked in manfucaturing atmospheres for my whole life and have never had such an easy job where I can steal from the company so much free money-Life is great here!"
good,"and excellent job, to work for good opportunities on learning and self motivation with other  employees."
good,"The company had good intentions, in trying to meet the needs of non-traditional students; however, it lacked cooperation from headquarters."
good,Work indecently building the device form the drawing to shipping it to the customer. Working with co-workers to complete the task. Talking with manager on the success of the job.
good,Enjoyed supporting different areas and the work was rewarding.  Many products were developed at the site.  The work could be demanding but it was well worth the experience.
good,Long hrs but great co workers. The students are also great to work with as well. The only complaint I have is the hrs . +++++++
good,"Clear vision, focused on results and growing the business.  Collaborative and free thinking culture; challenge the status quo.  Difficult to separate yourself from the pack due to the scale and shear number of employees."
good,"Since my employ the company has been purchased, so my previous experiences are out of date."
good,"work day 12.45 hrs"
good,"Again, it seems management is not a position that gets much research. Still the same mentality that corrupts most contracts. With work in that area, this company would be a 5 star place to work."
good,"ITT does not support their faculty or make things easy to do your job!"
good,The company just have some people in management that shouldn't be there.
good,"ITT Power Solutions had many dedicated employees who truly enjoyed their work. It was a pleasure to work with many individuals on a technical level, as most were knowledgeable in their respective fields. However, there was little communication from upper management through corporate. When they decided to close our West Springfield facility, we were given the impression that corporate cared little, if any. They seemed more concerned with saving and making money than the great employees they were losing. In the grand scheme of things, it seems as though upper management made poor business decisions; they are trying to operate as a defense company in a commercial market and the decisions made reflect this."
good,"a lot of busy work, the captains did not delegate work, and there was a lot of miscommunication between chiefs and firefighters"
good,Management and training employees. Excellant programs that are in demand for todays companies.
good,HR not active in placement. Good work schedule. Great co-workers.
good,Was a good opportunity to work in England. Was able to advance from Technician to Reginal Manager in a year.

good,"Interpersonal skills led  to  a  variety of  problem  solving opportunities however , the news fell on  deaf  ears  at  times.  Great people at mid level"
good,"Good people and culture, and there is a consistent opportunity for advancement. Work pace is hectic, and work groups are not always aligned or have the same agendas."
good,The hours there or OK if you like or love a lot of overtime the benefits are pretty good you have most your weekends off but during the week the hours can be pretty grueling and hard on the body.Management is good and the benefits are pretty good also
good,"the organization continues to go thru a shift - and has resource challenges - the company focuses heavy on the bottom line and not on impact to employees, remote and flexible work hours is discouraged."
good,ITT has great employees but some employees need learn to work as a team. Some of the management need to be replace. ITT ECS is product of heaters and other interesting products.
good,at ITT I worked as a vehicle mechanic  maintaining military equipment on a daily basis . making sure when equipment came back from downrange that all the maintenance was completed on the vehicle so it will be 100% combat ready again.
good,"Working overseas makes you a lot of money. Managed correctly, you can make your future comfortable. Working in the Middle East was very hot but worthwhile by being able to serve our troops."
good,I worked there for a 1 winter season and 2 summer seasons as an intern. I really enjoyed ITT my mom worked there for about 6 years plus. They changed to Xylem and cleaned house on everyone.

good,I was hired as a janitor to get my foot in the door to hopefully become a maintenance technician there but didn’t stay . It was a slow boring job that I didn’t really like but it paid the bills so I stuck with it for some odd months
good,Average company that paid poorly & had no concern for their employees.  Took them over three for them to pay bonus due after contract renewal thou they were only able to win contract if they keep same employees as said by the contracting office.
good,I could of learned more if there wasn’t so much job security issues. Most workers were easy to get along with good overall work environment. Management needs to be improved.
good,learned a lot from the role.  The building and mentality was of a previous generation.  Unions prevented people from thinking practically.  Not an innovative place
good,"Support and manage CAD/CAM information technology infrastructure, develop new processes and programs for automation and increase efficiency on day to day operations. Help and supervise CAD drafting department people and processes."
good,"I worked at ITT full-time on two occasion overseas at Kuwait/Iraq & Afghanistan"
good,This is a great place to work. I enjoyed it very much and would recommend it to anyone who is searching for a rewarding and satisfying place of employment.
good,Not enough trained people to use machines at the shop. Need to provide more company news and meeting for employees and Improve communication and employee email access. Provide more training and tooling.
good,I was on a contract in Iraq putting on armor. they paid great money but they left me doing a job I wasn't hired for and putting my health in danger making me work at burnpits
good,I do not have anything good to say about this company besides the people I worked with they were awesome. I would never apply for this company in the future.
good,"They are flexible to work with."
good,"I spent about 8 months working here as a cost analyst as a Contractor, interfacing with the employee workforce. Upon completion of the assignment I changed jobs."
good,"ITT is working diligently to shape their culture, there has been many transitions with the business changing management and decrease in gas and oil seems to have changed how we need do business to succeed in this trying time."
good,"ITT has lots of potential and a great business, however, they are old fashioned on their management practices and resiste change, limiting their potential."
good,"Very good culture, new initiative are accepted, company tansformation.. You can learn a lot however nothing will stay the same. The hardest part to keep working there within the changes in the economic and the crisis the world faces"
good,"Inspecting parts, preparing for  CustomerSource Inspector, review customer specifications per part, review travelers, management was supportive in work environment, teamwork displayed as co-workers requested help, friendly, informative, always ready to help, hardest part of the job being challenged by the Customer Source Inspector it was like being audited every week, the enjoyable part of the job was seeing product being accepted by Customer Source Inspector and "
good,I liked all the different experience I got from learning how to excel at this position. I learned how to multi task at a high level. I learned how to deal with different types of customers wanting different things out of there education.
good,The working environment is outstanding and exceeds expectations.  The Company drives a positive working environment.
good,"I can only speak of the value center in which I work.  It is the Industrial Process Value Center.  The company for too long and with little foresight failed to see the down turn in the oil and gas industry and how being tied to mostly a single market can be detrimental.  They failed to diversify and still believe its fortunes lie with a resurgence of the oil and gas market.  They have also failed to keep the IT current.  The ERP system is from the 1990's and fails on every account to be useful, timely and adequate."
good,This company provide a lot of opportunity for advancement. I went from production to Team Leader to the Jig & Fixture Department. There I was put though a company structured apprenticeship program.
good,we loaded trucks packed radios I learned how to be patient. and to work with others. management never seamed to know what was going on. my co-workers were very good workers so we all got along. dealing with people that did not work. the job I did was great always had fun at work.
good,"ITT Grinnell was a good summer job. I started at the end of school year and worked thru the summer until school started. I worked nights, where I was treated good."
good,I worked for ITT in a few locations and found their Company pleasant to work for while repairing Military Vehicles for the War Fighters!
good,"A typical day of work, nights in my case, involves clocking in on a computer and finding out what I will be working on that day. After 3 years of being with this company I have learned all about pumps. Vertical turbine pumps, double suction pumps, back pullout pumps, and split case pumps are our typical jobs. I have learned how to take apart and assemble all of these pumps and more. Management in this company is regulated and slow processing. ITT is a worldwide company and all internal processes take a long time to develop. The shop management is superb. My co-workers are normal people who I get along with. The hardest part of my job is clarifying what the customer wants without having a crew in the office on nights to talk to the customer. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to work with many different things."
good,"Management and Low level workers seem greatly disconnected, growth opportunities are hard especially for remote employees but it is a great company, with a great CEO looking to change corporate culture. ITT is constantly innovating and coming up with very cool products and services for their clients."
good,"Daily work was structured based on published guidelines, was intensely managed, and time was accounted for everyday down to the minute."

good,"Fair company to work for.  However the company's main focus is on the numbers, not the people who make it what it is today.  Benefits are average."
good,"A fun place to work at, people are fun but there is dress down only on Fridays and employees have to be in business casuals for the rest of the week."

good,"Contracted with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and NASA, everyday is a chance to be a part of history."
good,"Working for ITT Gould's was an experience that allowed me to further my shipping and receiving expertise, by allowing me to work closely with the supervisor. Seeing the process from beginning to the end was very important and it allowed me to see how critical shipping and receiving is to a company. Management was very respectful and helpful. My co-workers were amazing people they helped when help was needed. The hardest part of my job was building crates. What I enjoyed most of my job was the challenge there was always something different."
good,"Got lot of scope to enhance my profile & manage people "
good,"Good place to work, friendly people, manufacturing environment."
good,"It was a great place to work for ten years.  Change occurred, frequently for the sake of change until the company was spun off.  Today, the company has a similar mission, but is about cutting service availability and quality."
good,Strong belief in research and development. Well positioned for BD and new opportunities.
good,"I was a temp for this job for over a year and they still would not hire anyone permanent, because they did not want to provide benefits. The job was boring with boring products. Management was not the easiest to approach and the processes were not clearly stated, making it difficult for consistency."
good,"A typical day started at 6:00am and ended at 5:00pm.  I learned a lot about acceptable business practices in almost every department.  The most difficult aspect of my job was coping with the tension; seemed everything was always an emergency.

good,"With 31 years of working for ITT Exelis, in positions ranging from Manfacturing Engineer to Principal Liason Engineer, there was really not a typical day.

good,Interesting technology. Competitive compensation package.
good,Productive in the support of missions to the US Military Soldiers during combat
good,The job that I performed was enjoyable. I truly learned a lot about how the real Army worked. I did not enjoy the ITT maintenance management team or their leadership techniques. Situations were altered to show blame at the lowest level and there was no support for the worker bee. The hardest part of the job was trying to protect my mechanics from undue harassment from an unappreciative management team. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing a satisfied Army unit after fixing their equipment and them putting it to use in real world situations.
good,"Been working as AOA (Add on Armor Mechanic), Housing Specialist, and GFE Mechanic. Working a lot with Indians and Egyptians which help me understand and adjust some cultures. Working 12 hours a day, 6 days a week unless there is a mission going had to work 7 days in a week."

good,it has been YEARS since I have worked for ITT systems Division so hopefully everything has changed but when i was with them from 2003-2008 management had to much power and allow individuals to hold careers back.
good,"Money is not bad, but management is way to top heavy.(too many bosses)Forced to be in a union that is not concerned enough about its paying members, just about having meetings."
good,"After 15 years of employment, there has been little or no change in daily activities or job openings.  A new computer system was implemented and customer service managers come and go like a revolving door."
good,"people are nice here, but the company is not flexible with your hours."

good,"good until layoff worked on left behind trucks good people good job great benefits .sent us for job training.always at work with great people,"

good,"Decent company to work for with the traditional issues you find at any established location. The management tries to develop their employees but they sometimes lack the support structure for themselves."
good,"Exelis is one of the legacy companies that stemmed from ITT - a major conglomerate from the 1900s - and this still holds over in the company culture. While the work was satisfying, there was a bit of an older feel in the company, and while I was not the only young worker in the company, it certainly felt like the average age of workers in the company was quite a bit higher than my own. Exelis might want to step up on recruiting some more new graduates to help bring in ""fresh blood"" into the organization."
good,"The normal working days are usually the same. Typically the time arrangement and the general atmosphere is conducive and good to work in."
good,"ITT @ Global  is very good company to work with. I am working for ITT corporation under Asia Pacific mgmt, for last 4 years.

good,"Work Days varies from day to day. I have learn what it is like to work for a Union Company, Also how to deal with people whether they be consumers, co-workers, or management and the different personalities and ways of thinking.

good,"Worked in a warehouse; 12 hour days, 6 days a week"
good,Overseas jobs require certain mindsets in the employees but management also needs to be responsive to the employee's overall moral.  Better company management vetting would go a long way to improving the moral and thus improve the employee longevity.
good,A typical day at work  this is funny to say at the least come in on time and sit there and do nothing and absolutely won't learn anything.
good,"Work site is located on and island on the edge of the water, scenery is great. Each morning we get orders from the manager and told to do job as safely as possible. From there we go out and complete tasks given."
good,working with this company was as good a job and people you will ever work with
good,I had the opportunity to learn and share my knowledge with other the atmosphere was relax I enjoy doing my work every day the only part I  was not happy was not receiving quarterly increases.
good,Each day was spent doing the same work with little to no change or training in other areas unless someone quit or was fired. this left people in a rut when it came to day to day work life
good,"Les premières années étaient très agréables, dommage qu'à la fin ce n'était plus le cas vu que la société a été vendue/reprise par une société française. L'ambiance n'y était plus vivable avec le grand nombre de préavis qui sont tombés."
good,Thrive in an environment where my performance is directly reflected in my compensation
good,Working in HR was very rewarding. Enjoyed helping people with their insurance problems.
good,"Being a Facility Security Officer, I normally worked alone with my supervisor being in another location."

good,I was a contract worker in Afghanistan working with all types of IT systems.
good,Personnel manager is shallow and trigger happy many people laid off because of this. Makes decisions with no backround in engineering and unfair evaluations..Not qualified for the job but manages to elude detection.
good,Job is not difficult just the process not in control and no quality .
good,Management focused on Program execution. Business development was not on their radar and in fact it was too early. Hardest part of the job was the workplace culture...engineering driven caused rigid thinking.
good,"ITT is a good company and a fair company.  You are rewarded when you are an over-achiever and go above and beyond.  Additionally, you are fired when you do wrong.  There's 0 tolerance."
good,Outstanding opportunities to work in a face paced - high technology environment. Several outstanding colleagues. Culture and employee relations are not supportive.
good,"Se interactua mucho con los diferentes departamentos, así que todo gira en torno a la comunicación para tomar acuerdos y brindarles el mejor servicio, quizá la parte más difícil y retadora del trabajo es conciliar con la pantilla de trabajadores, pero me agrada. Me agradó formar parte de esta institución, hay gente muy humana."

good,Nothing much to say about the company it was not the greatest but made a few friends during my employment at ITT it was not very stable company bad management.

good,I spent each day entering data entry from progress notes into computer database. Distributed faxes to other departments. Checked copier and fax machines for paper. The people are a nice group of workers. There was no hard part of the job to deal with. The most enjoyable part was the different people that I interacted with.

good,While it is rewarding to work in this area of education it is ultimately difficult due to the ability to earn commisions

good,"it is great fun and experience to work with professionals across the functions in India, Asia pacific and the Americas, good avenue to understand the cultures and the better way to execute projects, by living our values. Great learning opportunities"
good,"The folks here are among the best.  The management works hard to keep things stable, but your customer is the Govt so its a struggle.  The pay is mid-rung, and don't expect a raise or bonus, they don't happen.  It's not uncommon to go days without talking to your manager because they expect you to do your job, and that's a good thing.  Some PMs are in their position for no real reason, but the company is not keen on paying for their training, so you get what you pay for.  All in all, this has been the best govt contract I have been on and I would not trade my experience."
good,"Performed services on wide variety of heavy mechanical equipment. M1 series, M2, M3 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, M113 Series, Blue Bird Buses and M88 Recovery vehicles.
