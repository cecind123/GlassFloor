rating,review
bad,"Worked here for 4 years. Underpaid, company culture is horrible. They say all the right things but when comes down to it everyone is negative and bullies. They really are angry people doing a job they don't like. I liked my job not the people or culture. Everyone had a chip on their shoulders and their communication was non existent on resolving issues. They tend to cover up mistakes and point fingers. Felt like i was working with a bunch of toddlers all day."
bad,I was hired to be an assistant manager but after hiring I was forced to work as resident engineer. Manager was influenced by another colleague and  hence I got fired in the end.
bad,Fire me from a project at Yes prep school after week and a half for having some issues of pain in my hands after asking for a day because my wife that day had surgery
bad,"There's no humanity. I worked here for 8 months. They sent me out telling that I didn't achieve my target, just like that removing my ID card, when I was 2 months pregnant. Worst."
bad,Was very stressful. Metrics were contradictory so they were not fair.  Pay was ridiculously low at 12.5 an hour.  While I was there it was changed to 15.00 hour.   Training was very unrelated to actual job.  Did not learn anything job related.   Good training sessions started in my last months there so those were great.    Beautiful office.   Good starter job for I.T.
bad,Do not work here unless you want to continuously get underpaid to make someone else rich. There is nothing more to say................................
bad,"Not a company worth spending time."
bad,Dell is a very dysfunctional company that has really poor low energy management.  They feel like they own you and there is very little if any work life balance.
bad,Management is horrid and there is no room for growth. Mandatory overtime is a constant thing because they dont hire enough people to manage the workload. During that time lunch is also cut to 30 min without warning. Even after several other agents have had their hour lunch.
bad,"They got sued for underpaying overtime and management was mean when you called them on not being paid."
bad,Mi problema fue que nunca se precuparpn en ayudar cuando les pedí ayuda pero cuando se trata de hacerle daño al trabajador
bad,Please dont join Ax project if u r a contract employee.Specially working mothers.You cant even go to for a tea break.you will immediately get a call!!
bad,Job duties were not specific to job requirements.  Clients were not informed of support that was provided.  Clients were not aware of the degree of support that was provided.
bad,"Dell gave Winston-Salem a lot of great talk and excellent goals.  But what was most prevalent were the promises of having a great career. However, a lot of people who left their jobs; was terminated or layed off on after 3 years of empty promises with Dell."
bad,I only worked there for a few months and they do not have the contract with the government anymore so to require a review is senseless.  It adds no value.
bad,"too many layoffs . Politics in every team. Not a good management  at all. Very little benefits. Every quarter there are layoffs and no promotions .                                                                                                                   "
bad,"I did learn how to build and to teardown computers. The lean practices were just to much for example your needed tools such as a writing pen, box cutter and blades etc... when you go the replenish these you were hassle as to why, most people would just bring there own from home to avoid this."
bad,I was at EMC2 during thr merger with dell as a part time employee working on my degree as well. There was no room for advancement from the position I was in.
bad,"Inconsistent leadership.  "
bad,"At Dell, everyone works well together and we try to make it a fun and productive place so everyone looks forward to coming to work."
bad,"In my tenure at Dell, I was moved to a position I didn't want and tried to make the most of it until I was ultimately laid off two months shy of my five-year anniversary."
bad,"This was one of the worst jobs I have ever had. Even though I was virtual they have terrible management and they don’t trust people to do the job.  "
bad,"Outdated work culture and lack of job advancement. Most tech companies in Austin have adapted open seating whereas Dell maintains its cubicles. In addition, you have to pay for your meals at the cafeteria as opposed to most companies such as Apple, Facebook and etc who have free food and free vending machines."
bad,Dell is very numbers driven and you have to hit the goal this drives a anything goes mentality so they cut a lot of corners to get to the goal. Also very low sending on IT so tools and IT operation is substandard for a larger corporation.
bad,"If you don't want a life outside of work or to be treated fairly at work, this is the job for you!  Overtime?  All you want, but you only get paid $4 an hour.   NOT $4 extra, ... just $4 dollars per hour. As my manager told me, it is not illegal because you make up for it in commissions.   LOL what a joke. It is salary so they can make you stay an extra 4 hours after your 8 hour shift is up every day of the week but never pay you the over time... but you miss a day, they doc every minute from your pay that you are gone. You log in and start up your computer, read your emails and listen to voicemails 15 minutes before your shift starts... unpaid.. The end of the day is the same way, 15 minutes clearing up odds and ends... emails and VMs unpaid. I found out on my day off that DELL had pulled out of Roseburg and shut down with no warning.  It took me a month to get only some of my things back sent to me since once closed we were not allowed inside the buildling."
bad,EMC was a much better place to work. Dell has no idea how to sell. We sold on value and quality of the storage. Dell is all about selling quantity and the quality is second best. In the end they will work you until you leave. The managers don't really care anymore. They are getting paid BANK! so they don't do anything to help you succeed there.
bad,"This is not a good environment for minority females in Information Technology. It was very hard to obtain work/life balance, most team members were single males without kids and family. Even though you are given PTO/PBO you are scrutinized for taking time off for family and personal business. Promotions for women are hard to achieve, it is mostly a good ole boy network.Middle management and team leadership is reserved for white males. Career  Advancement were given to males and most women are excluded from training and career advancement."
bad,I was a contractor at Dell for over 6 years.As a contractor you are not given recognition of your performance. All recognition was given to the Dell employee having the same job responsibilities as myself.
bad,"I would answer phone calls 8 hours a day.  They didn't provide any real rest periods it was non stop till you had your break. you couldn't really catch up on stuff that you needed to get done through the day and then your numbers would be low, you were consistently on hold waiting for someone to help if you had any questions sometimes the client would be on hold for 30 min or more and they would not be happy and do not blame them but we were unable to call them back with the answer had to keep them on hold.  When you had a call for the supervisor they were never available and never made the calls back to the clients."
bad,"Computer sales from a kiosk in the middle of a mall can be very challenging. With that said, the product I was selling was great at the time and many people were interested."
bad,"The training is lacking and the professionalism is lacking as well.I was not trained correctly, the management was not helpful at all and what they told us would happen didn't happen."
bad,Empresa con buen ambiente de trabajo con oportunidad de desarrollo económico
bad,"I would struggle to think of any serious downsides to working at WaterAid other than some probably pretty unavoidable silos between the departments as whole, a natural situation for an organisation of its size and scope."
bad,Provide clinical support to customers. Learned different aspects of the different areas we support such as lab radiology and pharmacy. The workplace is very culture oriented. The hardest part is not always having the time for hands-on training.  The most enjoyable part is there are always opportunities to learn something new.
bad,Dell had some issues when it came to the direct stores and have since shuttered them. Poor management and lack of pay were biggest contributors to their problems.
bad,This was a great place to work we were one of the best rated service departments in the company and unfortunately a new VP was hired and moved all the jobs overseas.
bad,"Very unfortunate work environment and poor choices for people in leadership roles with poor communication."
bad,"The culture has changed dramatically.  Doing what is right is not stressed rather doing what suits the company is."
bad,"dell acquisition caused brain drain, talent loss - despite upper management euphoria, emc-ers morale tanked."
bad,They were big on stretching before going out to work on the production floor but the lack of benefits for a temporary truly expressed more about how little they care about you as a person regardless of hard you worked. Particularly when you realize that the vast majority of the employees they have on the production floor is temporary so that they did not have to provide benefits to any except the few they had that were permanent.
bad,This is a Fun place. It is not a company. similar to this is a cinema theatre. waste company. no salary hike and no promotion. waste interviews. managers talk very bad.
bad,Horrible place to work if your looking for any type of advancement or raise. I've worked there two years and never got a raise. Sups are all friends and that's how they choose you if there is a position that comes available. The call in/attendance policy is ridiculous and the job changes management every few months so the rules are constantly changing. Wouldn't reccommend this job to anyone unless your just looking for a check or two.
bad,while I was there this was a clean drama free environment where each employee was well treated and given every opportunity to advance. Great people to work for.
bad,"If you are willing to put in the 12 hour work days 5 days a week for at least a year you can be successful. Pay is very low,  most holidays are worked, when busy you are expected to work through lunch, a week of your ""vacation"" is considered unpaid days off. If you can do this for a year maybe you can get promoted and go to another segment that pays more and allows for a balance between work and home."
bad,"This is not to be concluded with the Dell but this is considered as Dell Services.. "
bad,will work you for 7 12s until they meet their quarterly quota then let you go without any warning. they let go entire departments on a regular. do not plan on staying long are buy anything with monthly payments
bad,Management will lie and HR will back them up with whatever they say. No job security and very little room for advancement. They tolerate poor off shore skills while pushing older US workers out the door.
bad,No hike every year.target not fixed by time study.whatever target fixed by TL by mouth need to achieve.every week pip received.they allotted one job.after few hours they allotted another job again same thing happened.we cannot do our work.Salary system bad.from night shift allowance to everything we need approval TL.if he miss very complicated system to receive next month.
bad,"I was hired after they underbid a contract from SAIC. I was hired because the contract company didn't want to let me go. After about 1 year Dell sold their Technical Service Division to a foreign company called NTT Global. Since then we have been micro-managed, haven't seen a raise in 3+ years, customer service is after-thought. and general moral has went down the tubes. This is typical of what happens when the bottom-line out-weighs employee satisfaction."
bad,"Dell was a great opportunity for the Winston Salem area but it didn't last 5-7 years."
bad,Company made bad choices went a lower cost route and lost good hardworking techs now the company sub contracts  and the prior customers still stay in contact with me and tell me how horrible and long it takes to get there systems repaired
bad,No work life balance what-so-ever even though it was talked about all the time. Moved most production out of the United States to foreign companies. The Round Rock campus is just a shell of what it used to be.
bad,"I was hired as a programmer but put into support , 3 years later and still working at the same role ,they would not let me move to a better team , you get promoted and IJP are filled only through connections, talent is not rewarded."
bad,"Productive and Can keep learning."
bad,"Being Dell was good for an image as it's a big brand name but inside there are no such things."
bad,Compensation is low for the work load you are expected to handle. There is very high turn over. Management does not do a great job of delegating tasks. Good starter job but would not recommend for the long term.
bad,Poor managers who had little care for anything other than meeting their own quotas. Employees treated like numbers not human beings. Benefits and leave were bare minimum allowable.
bad,"Not so Great place to work, not a good place, no growth, no benefits, no proper structure, management does not value the hard work,sudden changes on the job profile without any intimation...."
bad,I have seen about 20 people fired since September 2016 with no less than 7 years of tenure. I guess they have to pay for EMC somehow. I heard they are hiring people off the street for 3/4ths of what they are paying tenured people.
bad,"I was not there long enough to form a just opinion of them."
bad,"Dell is having so many re-org and Executive management is not bother about employee career,"
bad,to many changes.  lay offs all over the place.  nobody knows when the layoffs will stop.  the support is always getting nocked and that is what they sell is the support for there products.
bad,"They have an awful infrastructure that doesn't support the number of employees in a building. All of it is outdated."
bad,A lot of people will end up of suing this company for the incompetence of their employees in ensuring all information being processes is being processed accurately..
bad,"Work life for some, ethics for some, bonus structure constantly changing, they do not pay for performance. Told of workforce reduction when contractors are doing my job."
bad,"They outsourced most of their work to India. You are left to deal with all the mistakes offshore makes and the work they can not do. Offshore can't even figure out what they did wrong or even know it's  right. Dell in Providence works on the Blue Cross Blue Shield account. Blue Cross keeps this a secret so their groups accounts or members think the work is all done onshore. We got more calls from accounts / members due to errors offshore makes and we're left to explain why something is wrong...over and over again on a daily basis. We're told not to tell anyone that Blue Cross contracted to get the work done in India. "
bad,"Excesivo favoritismo, ""es mejor promover candidatos que no queremos en la cuenta que hacer algo para mejorarlos"""
bad,"I have been working for Dell for the last 3 years and 6 months and I have had a wonderful working relation with my peers and seniors. I am only looking for a job change as we are re-locating back to Chennai, India."
bad,"Established compatibility with third party software products by developing logistics for modification and integration."
bad,I was hired for just over a year and was laid off due to the economic collapse of America. I answered incoming phone calls and sold solutions to customers.
bad,"No hay cultura ni desarrollo organizacional, es un caos, no hay comunicación y el ambiente es muy hostil"
bad,"Horrible management, horrible job security, no chance for advancement atleast within the first 2 years of employment. This place is a joke, and being a business professional in the healthcare field for over 10 years I would NEVER recommend anyone work for Dell."
bad,"possibility of lots of overtime, too many supervisors, not enough employees, lots of training opportunities, lots of vending machines, a  cafeteria, yoga classes and fitness studio on site"
bad,"Not the best place to work for.  EMC is a hard place to get into, and one you're there, they require you to work extra hours, and do extra things, that never get rewarded."
bad,You take calls and resolve issues in a call center environment. Co-workers either come to work or they don.t Hardest part of the job is dealing with arrogance over the phone.
bad,Some of the Management are very incompetent. Hence talented folks leave the org quickly while those who do not have much experience stay longer.
bad,"good working environment"
bad,"great place to work"
bad,A normal work day. I bill claims to Medicaid and Medicaid HMO's
bad,This company bought Perot Systems which made us train people in India to do our jobs.  The laid off 100's of people in the United States.
bad,"Make sure all product are packed correctly get the damage item out and Keep track to give to the manager of all damage item & label and keep records on the inventory."
bad,"could not get questions answer from supervisor, could not take lunch, or breaks. company did not set real goals, production for 1 month was 4040 claims per month with 4 error per month"
bad,"very poor management"
bad,there is nothing to be said in a positive manner about this place of business
bad,NCO is a very typical - head down plow through your work ask no questions type of work place... this is  a good place for younger adults go to work... if only to learn that every employer will be different and that they have to lear to adjust to higher mamagment
bad,Doing charge entry process in medical billing. Work experience is good.
bad,"	Repaired desktops, laptops, printers and servers for Dell customers, both residential and commercial"
bad,Its a wonderful place where people are very friendly and management is approachable.
bad,"Learned a lot from the company and about the process."
bad,Very uncaring company.  Not totally upfront and honest with prospective employees
bad,"9 to 6"
bad,Meeting new & existing customers . And Happy to promote the product .
bad,Was a fun place to work at until they closed it down and left hundreds without a job
bad,still there i din't experienced any typical part in my job career. the most important part i have learned is how to make our job scared of us. till day i am enjoying everyday and every movement in my work. awesome team and awesome fun. in my current organisation i have experienced one more thing that is this company has a title along with it name and it is fun at work. i really enjoyed fun at my workplace.
bad,Always I am a team oriented person. Job security is more in my current company. Rotational shift is hardest part for me.
bad,Dell Services is ran just like Initech from the movie Office Space. We have a small staff of 8 workers and 5 managers.
bad,I was independent and  no day was the same. I was my own boss own work orders and then they stoped commin in and never told me what was going on.. Poor company to work for.
bad,Worked for them for 6 months after training was complete and then our work center was shutdown and outsourced.
bad,Worked there as a Temp and you definitely know it. You are separated from the rest of the workers.
bad,Site Manager and Regional Manager cover & kiss each other behind
bad,"Dell used to be a great company to work for but since they announced their intent to go private, something changed."
bad,Never hear from superiors when an issue arises. Never compensated
bad,"Leading a crew consisting of 4-10 technicians in the deployment of Dell computer equipment. Traveling to different State of Georgia facilities such as DFACS, Department of Revenue, OIG, Driver Services, Department of Justice, etc. Conducting pre-site visits with the point of contact to establish staging areas, delivery areas, logistics, and LAN and network system arenas. Accept deliveries on deployment start and unpack and organize equipment to coordinate inventory association according to the customer spreadsheet request. Updating and coordinating with the project manager for on site activity. Having a morning meeting with the technicians to distribute work orders and go over current location details. Troubleshooting issues that the technician finds takes more than 10 minutes to resolve. Using CDM a national inventory monitoring system developed by Dell to monitor work order flow.

Responsible for drive wipe sanitation removed from legacy equipment. I am HIPPA certified and well aware of the protection of medical records. Assuring the accuracy of closing paperwork and setting up pickup of legacy equipment. I also supported"
bad,No loyalty to employees whatsoever and no foresight in business direction by company.
bad,"I would not refer anyone I know to work for this organization. This particular site that Dell is hiring for is very unorganized. No communication from management. there are a total of 4-5 deparments managed by Dell within this location and no collabortive efforts at all. Pay is horid!!!!! just a sign of the times. Lot of lies.....lots of lies. Be sure to ask specific questions about the ability to move from 1 position to another. Training and retraining, flexability ect. There are people who have been at this particular site for over 15 and have not received additional training or pay, And new hires com in making more money them those that have been committed to Dell for years. pay increse and training is few and far between. be careful."
bad,worked during lunches and breaks and wasnt supposed to. hardest part meeting quota when their are many other avenues to buy products.
bad,Very Simple DELL lies. you work and work and work and they lie and take your pay. If you do not have a degree then you are their slave. And never try to fight it they have sneaky back stabbers there to hit you.
bad,I worked at Dell for 5yrs. and was very disappointed. Their management was the worst. They were not consistent with rules and guidelines. They were not concerned with their employees at all. I'm actually glad that I was laid off when they moved out of the country. We all finally got control of our lives again.
bad,Management has little or no training program and allows an obscenity rich hostile work enviorment. No encouragement of teamwork at all.
bad,"Horrible place to work very unprofessional and poor management"
bad,"Michael Dell is one of the worst business owners. You were not allowed to sit even if the job could be done easier in that position, he claimed sitting down made people lazy. I say working 12 hrs. a day 7 days a week standing the entire time made his employees lazy. The break times were ridiculous, by the time you walked from one end of the other to get to cafeteria going through security and all you were lucky to have 5 minutes to set down. 5 miles of line in the building and they were smart, if something happened that caused the line to be shut down it shut the entire thing down. I can see why he jumped from state to state getting incentives before finally moving out of the country, the concept they had on building the products wasted a lot of money."
bad,"Dell was a sweat shop.  Unless the managers liked you, you didn't get paid squat. I worked there between 1997 and 2001.  They laid off thousands of people after promising that jobs would not be moving overseas.  They lied to us and I think that the company is evil."
bad,"While your experience may be much better, different than mine was. I have heard similar horror stories from others. The odds are high that you will have a bad time there."
bad,"This timeframe spans EMC and Dell's subsequent acquisition and absorption of EMC."
bad,"This company advertises itself as a ""meritocracy"".  I can't imagine that being any farther from the truth.  The entire system is based upon the buddy system.  Multiple over achievers are overlooked and burdened with a success tax in order to elevate those unable to meet the standard in order to promote them."
bad,"Management has since been replaced..which was a good thing because... they couldn't keep good employees with the clowns that were in charge...rude ,obnoxious and unprofessional"
bad,Too many managers that do not come from the inside so not only do they not understand the job they are managing they are turning the culture to Jr high back stabbing.
bad,"Dell services, was a fast paced call center where the work you put in was never appreciated. you never get raises and there is no career advancement opportunities."
bad,Indian Management thinks they are kings sub ordinates are slaves. Worst management in India. They are very rude to team then they suggest for lay off if we oppose them.
bad,"Hi,"
bad,Schedule and dispatch is a paycheck type of job. We are understaffed and under-compensated. There is a freeze currently and possible automation of the department. I would not recommend anyone to apply at dell-EMC2.
bad,"Totally miserable experience working as a Support Analyst with Dell Federal Services in Nashville. Was told it was a contract-to-hire position; one week into training, we were told Dell had lost that contract and we would all be laid off. We were supposed to have 5 weeks of training, which then became 3, and consisted entirely of filling out HR forms. We were all sent out to the floor totally unprepared, and the Floor Supervisors were the worst people I have ever worked with. No one bothered to ask them questions after the first week because if they bothered to respond at all, it was only to insult you for not knowing something. If you were 1 second late coming back from a break or took 1 second too long to wrap up a call, they would be at your desk in an instant to demand an explanation, but when you needed them for a legitimate reason, they were nowhere to be found. Everything was micromanaged to an insane degree, and nothing that management told us relating to our employment turned out to be true. Extremely toxic environment."
bad,Dell was exciting and challenging.  You had to be open to change every day and every week.  Kept me young.  You needed to be adaptable and learn new ways.
bad,"Dell is nothing like the website says.   NEVER get raises at this company,   lacking tracking, not personable supervisors, throw to the wolves after 1 week of training.     1/2 of department calls in every day, stressful job, not friendly co workers"
bad,Dell is one of the fastest growing organisations that reqards merits and encourages new talents. I had a wonderful learning experience at Dell. I have worked with a very supportive team. I have learned various tools that make me confident to take up technical writing projects and finish them efficiently.
bad,"If you like a call center atmosphere, this is a beginner job that will help you get your foot in the door. The hardest part of the job is the management team. They have a tendency to discriminate against certain employees which makes it hard on everyone. If it wasn't for that it could be a great place to work. The company needs a management change."
bad,"I have worked for 5 years."
bad,"Dell salary was marginal with no raise in 3 years. No opportunity for promotion. Training and personnel development was talked about but it was just ""talk"". As a certified project manager, with 15 years experience, I was not allowed to take any courses toward my PMP CEUs - I was told to take the ""free online courses""."
bad,"Graveyard of careers, politics, politics and more politics, management are incompetent and unprofessional to say the least. One have to be a sleezball and manager's lapdog to get any chance of promotion. Run if you have brain and dignity. Overtime is not paid and very much expected. All the credit for whatever you do and manage to achieve will be stolen by your manager. Work/life balance - there is no life, just work"
bad,"I am not familiar with all of the departments within Dell, but I am very familiar with the BPO department within Dell. I've worked for Dell approximately three years in the BPO department. "
bad,"EMC only works with contractors when it comes to customer service. They offer no benefits whatsoever, and they force you to work on ALL holidays (regular pay, no holiday pay). It's not clear what one must to do to get hired full-time. Management is amateurish and incompetent, offering no support other than lip service. Working at EMC was by far the WORST work experience I ever had. Not recommended at all."
bad,"This is not a company where you can grow or expect any kind of job security.  Top management completely focused on growth, self enrichment and not much else.  Middle management really inept(either told not to or just don't care) at managing and developing employees throughout much of the company.  Line managers and supervisors really incompetent, many untrained unqualified people in supervisory positions who should not be in those positions.  Intimidation and harassment is used under the guise of performance improvement plans to pressure people.  Have heard that EMC in its early days was a great place to work and develop a career but that certainly is not the case now.  For  some this place is little more than an electronic sweatshop. "
bad,"I worked at a Philly office as a SME and the other Dell employees were just awful. Everyone looked out for themselves and were at times verbally abusive and undermined each other. The catch phrase was ""You figure it out."""
bad,"EMC (GBS) not good place to work, Manegment is not good they do open politics and partiality. and they harass mentally to their employees."
bad,"Huge company run by managers purely protecting their jobs. Employees aren't valued at all. Work hard, get more work, but don't expect a raise. EMC values a culture of fear, where employees are made to feel inferior and incapable of finding a better job."
bad,"i have learned alot in my position all levels of medical claims processing, customer service skills and to work in fast pace."
bad,dell is not fun place to work .very stressful job. they treat you as a 2ND class citizen.
bad,I have nothing to add.
bad,Dog eats dog culture.. had a very bitter experience.. management is pathetic to the core. No work life balance. And they instigate your team against you.
bad,"Such a bad management and don't really value their employees, and  they stop making their best effort to employees. Employees feel threaten and constantly worry about getting let go from job. They make sure and remind employees weekly. Manager / supervisor make you feel disrespected and distrusted. Doesn't show appreciation or give recognition to employees. Never want to working for them again."
bad,I don’t recommend Dell to anyone wanting a work/life balance.  Most senior managers have no control of their staff so team managers and other less experienced team leads are running the company to the ground.  Morale is low and the better employees are finding ways to leave.
bad,"I'll keep this short and sweet: TOXIC WORK CULTURE.  Your work metrics do not help you advance. Only brown nosing and playing office politics yield any results.  Add to that the laughably stereotypical practices of a mega corporation (outsourcing, management practices that make employees jobs harder and less efficient to perform, unresponsive HR and management, understaffing, etc.) and the environment then proves to be one in which only the worst succeed.  I quit the job because after five years, I myself had become a worse person."
bad,"Dell doesn't have a solid plan for legacy EMC. 2 years into the acquisition with EMC and there is still a lot of ambiguity, separate working environments/cultures and alot of stress."
bad,Dell has no clue how to manage large scale storage or what it takes to fix the circuit boards. All they care about is how much you cost. If too much - fired. They rather get someone to work for peanuts who has no idea what they are doing rather than keep competent long time experts. Don't work there. Horrible management.
bad,"Contradictions in policy, the push for ""corporate ethics"", and, seeing tech support being pushed to move towards sales vs service."
bad,I would NEVER work at Dell again.  I do not recommend it to anyone.  You are just a badge number at Dell.  I have personally known people who worked there 15 years or more who were given their pink slip without any warning.
bad,"The merge with Dell (formely EMC) ruined the company. They care more about the money than the people like how it used to be. They do lay offs often, and all the decent reasons to work for them, they’re slowly weeding away. Company is falling apart. They allow people who have ins with the company to get away with anything, by turning their heads. However, others will walk on egg shells. Certain managers are more lenient than others. Some buildings are worst to work in than others."
bad,If you are looking for somewhere to work with 40 hours and strict guidlines and stress then this is a great place to work. Your hours can be changed at the drop of a hat and they dont care about you as a person.
bad,"After Dell acquired EMC, the Legacy EMC people were constantly being laid off and passed over for opportunities. Dell moves as many jobs as possible overseas and discourages management from hiring or advancing in high cost areas. Dell does not provide cost of living increases each year. Unless you are a top performer at the company, you will make less money year over year. Even being a top performer only gives you a cost of living bump. Management statements do not match the actions that are executed."
bad,Dell merger is one of the worst and Dell himself has bunch of jokers around him with no strategy and growth. They cook books by laying off talented people to show numbers.
bad,Competitive unfair working environment with lack of growth for legacy female leaders out of Hopkinton in the new company dell. Female leaders were not promoted or considered for roles when building out the new company. Leaders were promoted from Austin and demoted and bullied  out in Hopkinton. Several female leaders were not treated fairly by DELL leaders across the company.
bad,Company was bad before the merger but only got worse afterwards.  My experience was a nightmare from the hiring process through my departure.  I would highly recommend seeking employment elsewhere especially in a strong economy!
bad,Difficult culture to work in. Incompetent managers. Too many management layers. People afraid to make decisions. Everybody is expendable. Very poor work/life balance.
bad,This company hires primarily Indian men to work here. There are entire department and floors consisting of only Indian people. I constantly saw groups of new employees in the lobby waiting to start their first day at Dell and they were ALL Indian men. Some Indian women but primarily men. This is racial imbalance beyond comprehension.
bad,I left a perfectly good and secure job for a job at Dell because of future job opportunities promised that never happened. Ended up on a month long project with horrible training only to be laid off unexpectedly.
bad,"Never have I worked for a company that purposefully put team members at each other's throats, threatened employees on a daily basis, and changed an employee's schedule in the middle of a shift.  Awful work environment, awful management, awful company."
bad,"I started with this company a year and a half ago, and no one knew what was going on. Since it was new, it made sense that there would be a ""learning curve"", and the expectation was that it would all get figured out. I have now been working there for a year and a half, and nothing - NOTHING - has improved."
bad,Company needs time to complete merger and define itself for the future.  There is no job security for employees and no clear roadmap for the future from management.
bad,"Great group of people.  "
bad,"Not a good decision to join this organization. You don't get what I promised during interview. Anytime you can be fired. "
bad,"horrible management, work life balance is bad, partial mgmt and not cooperative, never choose to work on the dell technology ."
bad,organizar estande e demonstrar os produtos a clientes em feiras de eventos e shoppings
bad,"I take calls and speak with the staff at hospitals and doctors offices regarding claims and benefit questions all day.  I have worked in the same building for 18 years, in a Call Center, it started out as Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, then a new Company took over the Call Center (Perot Systems), and then (Dell Services).  It's a wonderful and exciting place to work for with our leaders, they are always trying to work on different ways to keep the up the moral.  My co-workers are super to work with. The hardest part of the job can be when the systems are slow or down, when we can not help the caller.   It can be a fast paced or somewhat slow on certain days, over the years I have learned to communicate better and be even more helpful with Providers, Patients, Co-workers and our Leaders.  The most enjoyable part of my job is to really resolve the issue in one call."
bad,While my time at Secureworks I was part of the Dell acquisition. It resulted in a small company becoming to big to fast and created a difficult work environment. The computer systems were updated with Dell equipment that had so much bloatware and locked down that as developers we could not do our jobs. The management was disconnected and only looked out for themselves. In the end my entire development team left the organization.
bad,"Laid me off after two weeks because they couldn't provide me with a proper work load.  Was getting done with my work at 12 p.m.  The position they hired me for was simply an experiment.  As for the training, there was none.  I basically had to learn quickbooks on my own."
bad,"In Dell's IT Security organization, no positions are actually awarded based on a competitive application process.  Directors and above are hand picked based upon their loyalty to their seniors.  Most managers could not do the work they are tasked with managing...therefore they have no depth of understanding and their demands are merely bullets from a PowerPoint slide they presented to their own management.  They're get 'er done mentality without a fundamental understanding of the technology or process results in stress and ultimately job dissatisfaction for those reporting to a management structure that's primarily about politics and perception management/manipulation rather than technical and process execution.  It is sad, but Dell suffers from a management culture that is as dysfunctional as they come.  This might be a good place add to your resume...but don't make the mistake that you can come into the org now and have a successful career.  The management hierarchy is well entrenched and they lay people off frequently...and they take issue with anyone that suggests there is a better way.  Innovation is unquestionably NOT part of their culture."
bad,"Complete dysfunctional, no leadership. A place that sponsor friends not professionals."
bad,"They lie, fire and lie again when you try to get a reference.  I jsut wish i had never gone there."
bad,"Awful training, awful managers, lack of concern for employee health. Unable to learn any valuable computer/troubleshooting skills because of ""ownership"" process. Managers lying in interviews saying there is no goal time to finish a call, yet after the fact I am told otherwise."
bad,The management is all screwd up. Pay is good but thats it..Sorry
bad,"Pros are that some of the products are really good and the technical sales team can give great presentations. "
bad,I would never work for a company that works you to the bone and doesn't care for you at all.
bad,Released before even had the opportunity to make a difference. Dell lacking proper forecast for recruiters/sourcers
bad,"As a previous project manager, I found the company environment drove members to work for whats best for them and not the overall team.  Management did not have flexibility to allow teams to be creative.  It is an environment that strives on saying yes, yes, yes."
bad,To be honest when i went to work for Dell Computers it was when they first came to Nashville in 2000 to this date not that it matters i still didnt know who my supervisor was nor did i know if i was in the right department. In 2001 word was getting out that many people had the same problem I Hope people who had good jobs didnt leave there job to go work for dell then find themselves out of a job in 6 to 8 months. I am sure there are others who are weary about dell. The last time i heard all the work is done in Lebanon Tn i dont even know what they do at the airport if they are still there
bad,"I learned from DELL need to give 100% accuracy."
bad,"Dell is without a doubt the worst company to work for I have ever heard of. Dell buys out companies with no plan, upsetting those that were there, and destroying them one after another. The lawsuits they will soon endure will be immense. There is no organization whatsoever. Avoid Dell at all costs."
bad,"Dell is just another call center with horrible management and metrics that cannot be reached unless you resort to outright lies to your customers. If your manager does not like you, he/she will be on your case all of the time. Rates just better than the most horrid call centers you can think of (but not by much)."
bad,Treat front line technicians like they are uneducated. You cannot make obvious decisions without permission. If you take a call and it goes wrong it is your  fault.
bad,"if you raise your concerns about discrimination or management, don't expect that you have a job for much longer. you get promoted if you are friends with the boss and management regardless of your work ethics. if you complain to the Ethics people, these people are there to defuse the situation and get you to shut up quickly so that you are not making the management team or company look bad."
bad,"Dell is run in a different manner that I was used to.  The upper management at corporate didn't seem to know how to best market the service area I worked in.  Therefore, layoffs began to be a normal occurrence.  They tried to run the service organization as they did their manufacturing division and it was not successful."
bad,"For the whole year that I worked there, I never got a weekend off. Plus the hierarchy is so bad that you can’t even complain about the bad manager you’re struck under. No HR connect."
bad,Not even my manager agree that my team has any visibility in lager organization. There is no future working for this team. Managers are working more like PMs but not people managers. Who ever puts out fire gets promoted but not the guys who never let issue happen and prevent them from happening.
bad,"Constant Layoffs all year round"
bad,"Outsourcing, poor management foresight, poor management planning, management refuses to listen to line managers. Disregard for customer feedback. Overall poor."
bad,"Extremely fast paced with unclear objectives and lack of management. Very little work/life balance, worked very long hours and often 7 days a week. Strangest work culture I have ever worked in, everyone is very concerned about watching their back and never making a mistake. Time is spent making sure if a mistake is made that it can be traced back to someone else. The only plus is that there was decent compensation."
bad,At first I loved this place till we moved all employees to Nashville ecfc then it all went down hill. I do. Not recommend this place as a very work life balance place
bad,"Large OEM out of its element in pro services.  Should stick to selling hardware.  Management is ineffective and not supportive.  Stay away from this company until there is a major shake up if your are in delivery."
bad,"The Dell EMC organization is not an organization at all.  It is a dis-organization.  As usual during an acquisition, the people at the top fight for their domain and to heck with everyone else.  They have no clue of how to service the customers."
bad,"My advise better check any good people management company."
bad,"Beware of any job that DSFG posts for the Naval Shipyard. The contract is for technical and admin support. Contractors are treated like 2nd class citizens. DSFG management only cares about preserving the contract. Government workers are permitted to sabotage, harass, and slander Dell contractors with impunity. No one is held accountable for hostile work environment. Strongly discourage working for this organization."
bad,"Was told in November we would be laid off and the jobs be sent overseas, then was expected to train via teleconference our replacements. Had to stay on job until finally let go in April of following year because the replacements couldn't understand the jobs."
bad,No senior leadership located in the Utah office. Management disconnected from staff. Belligerent environment with no repercussions. A very negative environment to work in.
bad,"First, Dell will tell you the calls are not routed in the call center. They definitely are. Based on technical knowledge, you will receive the ""undesired"" calls. Calls ranging from mis-routed Customer Care to calls from outside of the United States."
bad,"There is no job security.  We will be told one day that we are performing well, then told a few days later that some positions were eliminated, but that there won't be more cuts, then a few weeks later, more cuts.  "
bad,Dell is just a bunch of corporate BS and corner cutting - if you want innovation and to enjoy your job look somewhere else.
bad,"Worst job experience I ever had. Nothing is provided. I am not talking about coffee or water, forget that! I mean ""bring your own pens and pencils to work"". Provided with a hopelessly hobbled laptop a working surface and a chair, five team members -- seemingly forgotten as rented equipment by their parent company -- toil away all day without speaking to each other in a corner of a large federal building. They are surrounded by hundreds of other workers form other related contractors (maybe not, could never tell) who also don't communicate with each other. Don't get me wrong though, there is some interaction occasionally, but you soon realize that those that would want to interact with you are the ones you would rather avoid. Constant multi-contractor meetings where untold amounts of bureaucratic busywork and multi-week projects are generated for insufferably small minutiae such as the position of a period in a sentence. "
bad,"n/a, company moving in another direction that I don't want to follow in"
bad,"When you acquire other companies, you must have an integration plan that is well thought out and achievable.  This was not the case at Dell."
bad,Tis company is great to work for but the managment and structure is of the company represents the employees not so good.
bad,"Folks are very set on doing things the way they've always done them. They are not opened to new ideas. Lot of internal fighting and political struggling. Culture of intimidation highly supported by the HR department. Hardest part of the job is trying to convince people to try a new way. In a typical day, you're on 6-8 conference calls. Most times people talk over each other. When execs get on calls, people tell them what they want to hear not what is accurate."
bad,"There is no work/life balance in this company. Our shifts changed every month, just when your body starts to get used to the old shift. Login hours were of 9.5 hours, minimum. I only used to stay at home for 10 hours, rest of the time was spent in travelling. There is a cut throat environment and the management is horrible. They do not want to train you on something you are not good at, they will just shove it down your throat and if you don't perform, you will be probation. No matter when you go to cafeteria, you will always find HR staff there holding their coffee mugs and sitting in groups which makes me believe that is the most chill job in the company! I never wanted to go to work because of my horrible manager. I finally quit after 6 months."
bad,"The job started as a great role. They always said ""build your brand"" and ""close your way."" Towards the end we had so much scripted lines to read and ever changing policies to follow. "
bad,"The management is based on politics and rationalization. No one commits to anything and hence is not accountable for results. "
bad,"You are treated like dirt if you work in the manufacturing area for Dell, at least in Franklin, MA. There is no advancement opportunities and management fills you with empty promises year after year. You can make more money as a bus boy at a busy restaurant. It's pretty pathetic really."
bad,"I hated it here. I was left to rot, and was never given an actual objective no matter who or how often I asked. I was expected to guess what they wanted, and penalized when I guessed incorrectly. "
bad,Long long hours.  Dedication is not rewarded.  Very high pressure and negative.  Unrealistic requirements.  Much time wasted filling out  multiple required redundant reports which were ignored.
bad,"Not a bad place to work at but with the flattened title hierarchy it is almost impossible to get promoted.  if you were a manager previously you most likely got your title removed and are still expected to perform those same duties without the title or opportunity for further advancement.  Not many opportunities in engineering for women even if you are really good at what you do.  Still very male dominated unless you are in marketing/hr, etc... They tend to have women in highly visible positions but not in middle management and no site lines to get there."
bad,"on 14 months, 4 different account assignments.  Impossible to get traction with clients for data center transformation projects in just a few months.  My experience was less than pleasant."
bad,"- Attention span of top managers is short. They are like little children: all information needs to be pre-chewed, condensed and simplified. Don't expect any analysis from these highly-paid executives."
bad,I would not go back to Dell.  It is an extremely stressful place to work.  It is very cutthroat and management micromanages everything you do.  People are OK
bad,"Management doesn't have a good understanding of firewalls or threat analysis The employees are friendly and welcoming, but the firewall the management team doesn't  care about the employees, once you have been assigned to a customer site."
bad,"Many jobs have been outsourced to India. Dell has over leveraged themselves to make the EMC purchase. Now everything is about cutting costs. Our benefits have been cut. Many jobs have been cut or moved, and a lot of us have had to train our direct replacements hired in a 'low economic impact areas'. Overall Dell has been a worst case scenario for the legacy EMC folks. With all the outsourcing that has happened there is now no room for pay increases or career advancement. I couldn't recommend them as an employer for anyone in the United States."
bad,Management has no clue about the enterprise market they've been trying to penetrate by a series of haphazard acquisitions.  They sill have a box-pusher mentality and put no value in deep technical knowledge especially other than in Microsoft based servers and consumer products
bad,"Dell will pay you for what you know they are not career builders"
bad,"I'm done being emotionally invested in a company that does not care who I am or why I'm there. I went through two buyouts, but this last buyout by Dell was by far the worst one."
bad,"I actually worked for EMC prior to Dell's purchase of them."
bad,"Awful place to work.  Nice building, nice amenities, mostly good people, but the work itself was truly awful, especially in the Dell Services work.  Would not recommend, most people leave fast for better things."
bad,"Dell was not the worst place to work, but it came pretty close. Mngmnt was awful, the culture was pathetic. Never knew when my last day was going to be since they would fire people as needed. it was a boiler room."
bad,"They lied from the beginning with promise to go permanent then had us sign sheets so we can't sue them Not stable, turnover rate extremely high, uncertain about future, every one in my group was fired at the end of the project. Company was not what I expected I didn't earn my college degree to be nervous about employment. This company's good days are behind them. I passed up good jobs to hold on to this one"
bad,"Dell has great employee benefits, but a very unstable work environment.  You might be hired for one position and 2 months later be asked to change."
bad,"Management is very young and inexperienced.  Environment is a very high turnover and cut throat."
bad,"Focus on production, numbers and high output"
bad,Hated every minute of the year I worked there. Only room for advancement if you have a friendly attitude.
bad,"I was let go because I wasn't ""a good cultural fit"". What that ACTUALLY meant was that I wouldn't go out drinking with the rest of the team after work. I also wouldn't go out to lunch with them...because I never got the invitations - and was then told I wasn't a team player (ya - kinda hard to go to lunch when you don't get the invite!) I'll take responsibility for not going to the drunk-fests after work - but I'm sober and don't drink. At my very first meeting with the team, it was a post work drink/dinner and my manager kept pushing wine at me saying ""C'mon, just a splash""  - it was UNBELIEVEABLE! She was obviously intoxicated and wanted the rest of us to join in on the fun. But since I don't drink, I guess that means I'm not Dell material. Fine by me."
bad,"Once the contract was cancelled by the Coast Guard, not only did Dell not provide us with other opportunities within Dell, they also did not offer severance packages to any of the employees. I worked for them for just under 11 years and there was absolutely no loyalty on their part."
bad,"Very Good Concern."
bad,"Immature management. This is what happens when they make kids as managers."
bad,Hire and fire mentality. Only 3 of my 35 member hiring class were still employed after the third year. Manger would come up behind me and try to find something to ride me about. Management style is by intimidation and defy every management I learned in college. Half of the people in Nashville have been fired by Dell. Overall it is a terrible place to work.
bad,Dell managers need to improve. There is a lack of confidence between managers and employees. Authoritarian communication style.
bad,Who acquires companies and applications with no support and then fabricates the job descriptions in order to trick people into their company and then try to work them until they pop out a vein?
bad,it is not good for immigrant workers
bad,Outsourcing jobs - so many that a high percentage of the jobs are all overseas due to lower salaries. Upper mgmt does not care about the employees and will push for modifying each quarter by cutting job force in order to make quarters. Yet none of the upper managers are taking responsiblity. They still get their bounces while the first line reps that work hard daily are getting told you have x amount of weeks before your job is transfered overseas. Its not the Dell it use to be ever since the CEO retired yet forced back by the board of directors due to all the bad decisions made yet upper mgmt not being held accountable. Sad because Dell was the best place to work for at one time now that its all about the mighty dollar with no concern to the employees.
bad,Not allowed to speak to coworkers. Managents looks at employees as numbers on their stack ranks rather then employees.
bad,Dell was one of the worst companies I worked for. They are slave drivers and they have no respect for your life outside of work. They want you to do overtime at a moments notice and they do not pay you very well at all.
bad,Run away. Don’t take this job. It’s a dead in. You are a slave. There are so many metrics and they conflict with each other. You will be punished for taking care of the customer if you go over the allotted time. Then if you don’t take care of the customer you will be punished too.  This is like a terrible psychological experiment. The stress is not worth it and when you find that out it’s too late and now you need a new job fast. This is not worth it
bad,"Less work and more life balance for employees "
bad,"Dell EMC is a great big lumbering machine, and from what I have seen it is in a state of confusing disorder. Incorrect/late compensation is an example of the kinds of problems I have seen."
bad,If you didn't participate in after hours parting and dating there was no path to advance beyond sales or retention specialist. I was there for almost 4 years and the only one there to attain senior specialist status. I was never able to advance to a coaching or management position and eventually felt burned out.
bad,Complacent long term workers. New direction is limiting the role of former EMC employees. Pay is decent for management. Factory and warehouse workers receive low pay.
bad,Every thing you do is measured and stack ranked against everyone in the organization which  creates undo stress.  They are obsessed with forecasting and filling up pipeline regardless if a deal is real or not.
bad,"Company does not care about employee"
bad,"Very unreliable in Job Security, they will layoff all of a sudden!!"
bad,"This was a government contractor located in McLean, Va.  Staff was very nice to work for and great environment.  Pay was good with good benefits."
bad,Dell (Inside Sale)offers a great training program to all new hires yet it is communicated upon hire that it is possible that you may be let go if you do not meet the required quotas with in short of hire date. And Dell has frequent layoffs. If you are not meeting your quota it is encouraged to work over time for 8am to 8pm if necessary to meet the required quota of 26K a day.
bad,"EMC is cheap & refuse to compensate their talent appropriately.  Hiring & retention are both serious issues.  Some nice people & innovative technology, but management is largely clueless."
bad,I loved the building we worked in. The manager was unfair and biased based on personal relationships. I was scolded everytime my son was ill. I am happy I moved on.
bad,Not a good place to work.  Worst management I ever seen. Many good employees left for a better place.
bad,This is one of the familiar MNC Company (DELL). I had worked in coimbatore. It is so beautiful place. I don't have satisfied of this company management. That same time i love my designation. I was learned more.. from this job.
bad,"Never have I felt so useless. No one treats you with respect. Every member of the team is replaceable from the agents to the supervisor, to the manager. No one fixes issues. I literally left to join the Army because I'd rather get shot at then fix one more computer for an ungrateful customer."
bad,Way too stressful. And I did not like it. I don't like being stuck at a desk tied to a phone and being yelled at all day long. I will never work in this kind of job again.
bad,"I worked for a temp that was contracted to dell, idk how dell is so i will not bash them because i did not all the way work for them."
bad,"to much indecision....merger with EMC, DSH being shopped to VC's. zero job security at this point. peers are excellent management not sure where they are going. 8 legged sales call just to meet sales call requirements"
bad,Several jobs that i held i was very observative about i saw both good and bad for progression for leadership and value of the workplace. i learned to be persistent with overall opinions and co worker character traits. Ive enjoyed learning good and positive energy at the workplace. And i have an interest for leading an overall company or just to simply gather all employee concerns on how to make the job better.
bad,Dell is an IT juggernaut slowly beaching itself.  Great people are fleeing and management continues to silo the business at the expense of getting anything done.  A legacy of continuous reorganization has diminished inter-organization trust and lead to complete confusion.
bad,Experienced racial discrimination; the workers in the company seemed very stressed and worried about being laid off
bad,"This place I was only a temp but I was the last temp to leave after my contract was up because they wanted to hire me in as a permanent worker, but they lead me to believe that I was going to be hired but they never did."
bad,Worked in teams with manager and  everyone had the same schedule on the team. Many opportunities for overtime. Paid salary plus commission. Everyone could earn commission if they sold enough. Some places only pay commission to the top sales people but not Dell.
bad,"I was told openly by leadership that there was no growth and they do not give raises. Leadership in office was high strung and over worked, my manager wasn't even in the same state as me which was a problem when trying resolve issues at work."
bad,We start our working since 8AM till 8PM. But as our management is not equip ed- us  with  proper infrastructure & on time supply materials thus it's quite hard for project execution on time .
bad,The people I worked with at Dell made this place fun and entertaining.    A normal work day would consist of training personnel and handling call escalations.  The hardest part of the job was the uncertainty of retaining a job.
bad,"It happened to me, and to others (at a few locations in the US).  Senior management, at Dell, will get an idea for a 2 to 3 year project, hire on people for the big project, get them access to the servers, and train them.  6 - 9 months later, senior management will get bored of this big project, cancel it, and lay off all the people they hired."
bad,Management is worst. No humanity. HR is worst. Should not throw out a pregnant woman in working hours out of the job without any information. Should give importance to a pregnant woman's feelings.
bad,Uma empresa boa para se trabalhar porém com poucas chances de crecimento
bad,"Poor management who has their favorites around the office. The only thing I looked forward to when working at Dell was my paycheck. I came to work, did my job, and went home. That clearly wasn't enough as the manager in the Creve Coeur office tried to make my life a living nightmare and though I'd quit. Very racist office here in St. Louis."
bad,"I my position employees are treated more as resources than people. We're told we're the department with the best profit margins and most consecutive growth, but they (upper management/department heads) refuse to invest anything into improving the quality of the work environment or preventing the call queue from falling apart. Many policies and procedures counter each other in a way that guarantees that if something goes wrong, it's likely your fault because you didn't follow X policy. To the point where I don't feel comfortable going to the restroom when I need to because either I'm taking a break outside of my scheduled time, going over my allotted break time for the day, or staying in a phone status I'm not supposed to be in. Multiple times I've received an unhappy email from a manager because I went 2 minutes over my break time because I needed the restroom. The frustration is amplified because I'm have very good standing in my position, but management continuously reminds us there's no trust."
bad,I joined this firm as a fresher and I had no clue how the corporate world worked. I learnt a lot about how to be with your team and how to be in the corporate world.
bad,Dell is not a company I would recommend any body try and work for.  They seemed to care more about getting people of the phone in the call centers than they were with patient experience.
bad,"The organization is trash and they will use you, make a mistake with the client and have you take the downfall for it.  There's some terribly crooked and racist people within this organization."
bad,taking inbound calls regarding life insurance.helping older people go over their policy. Received calls back to back on a regular day. A lot of math included in the job
bad,"- Education and work ethic have very little to do with how far you go in dell. "
bad,The company moved it's call centre to another country due to the cost of hiring local workers.  As such it placed a great deal of people out of work with very limited notice.
bad,Managment was lazy and never actually did anything to make a difference  a typical day sucked cuz theres always one customer that thinks they own the place
bad,"	Plan the work flow on a daily basis. "
bad,"Their ""work from home"" policy breeds a culture of laziness. Politics trumps innovation and creativity. Not allowed to speak up and ask questions. High turnover. No room for growth, to learn something new, or move up. PC is dead."
bad,I would work for this employer b/c it is really flexible & fits in w my work/home life
bad,"a typical day at work."
bad,"Management was non existent, and does not seem to have the well being of it's employees as a priority."
bad,I parcipated in all the fun activies and that was most enjoyble part of work.
bad,"My experience at Dell was far less than I had expected from such a large computer/ IT service provider, especially since a great deal of their reputation and revenue lies greatly therein. On the other hand, my experience with Dell was indeed a fast track educational crash course in understanding the fundamentals of computer technology. Though the teammates with whom I interacted were nothing short of friendly, easy going and helpful, the supervisors and team leads were not always interested or willing to interact and help their co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job - the feeling of accomplishment when personally resolving a customer's problem. Not only does the Customer walk away feeling satisfied in these instances, but also the employee himself for having done his job effectively."
bad,"Great job for someone that doesn't want to be challenged. Driving over an hour to get to location just to sit in a cubicle doesn't appeal to me when I've worked as a Project Engineer and System Admin in the past, making 3 times the amount of money."
bad,Poor corporate culture w/o much human interaction; permeated culture and employee morale to the point that most people I interacted with were actively seeking employment elsewhere and it affected their performance.
bad,"Dell is a good to place to work, but not in there Global Services and Deployment (GSD) teams. There is no respect for employees. They treat employees as if they are stupid, ignorant, and cannot make decisions on there own. If you are able to do something that is recognized the mgmt team will take full credit for the success and never mention the actual people who do the work."
bad,Dell was very fast paced and stressful. It was in the front of the pack for online sales. My job was the small business online marketing and content manager. Great if you're single. Not great if you have a family you want to see before dark.
bad,"Comfortable work place"
bad,Working with the team is great but the location is debatable. depends on the site you are assigned to and the people there could be a difficulty to get used to.
bad,"Receive inbound calls from Harvard pilgrim policy holders in regards to their coverage, discussing medical bills. Correspond with other health insurance companies, providers, clients in regards to health insurance claims and billing."
bad,"Seems like everyone who works there was that really smart, but really annoying ""know-it-all"" kid in school. EMC should stand for the ""Egotistical Men's Club"" (squared). Seems like everyone spends most of their time trying to show you how smart they are, to the point where sometimes it interferes with getting work done."
bad,"Before Documentum sold itself to EMC they were a thriving company with a unique work culture with exceptional and talented staff. EMC due its size decided their way was the best way and because they lacked any software products just did not appreciated  the selling cycle, investment into product development. Because of their impatience and lack of investment they off shored all the development , they saved a lot of money for short term gains but ended up losing sight what made Documentum the premier product of its kind in the industry. Not sure why they thought Documentum would be good fit, only to sell it some years later. "
bad,"Dell, being the  leaders in Servers and PCs, is a great place to work."
bad,"typical day -Greeting all co-workers and management team 'good morning'"
bad,"Just cannot believe how high school the manager of my team was. He had too much favoritism going on. I was great at this position mastered it quickly and they had the Gaul to lay me off the monday after my highest priced laptop design build on a business side model. $4,000 model laptop and they lay me off."
bad,The company has a big setup & infrastructure & great past history. Good place if you work if you may survive as there are frequent changes in staff...
bad,"This place is complete chaos. There are no safety standards being followed, the equipment is outdated junk, and the management treat the employees like poorly trained dogs. The inventory/stock is a mess, nothing is where it should be, you will waste hours each day trying to find the items you need to fill your orders."
bad,"Be smart and avoid Dell's Bowling Green, Kentucky location. The employee turnover ratio is extremely high due to terrible management and low pay."
bad,"Leadership was lacking, which made working for Dell difficult."
bad,The company was ok it was the way the company was being ran and how they treated their workers.
bad,"muito pessimo,nao aprende quase nada"
bad,I was so excited to go to work for Dell I thought it would be a great job with lots of oppotunities. I am looking for work because Dell is the most unorganized place I have ever worked. The management has no idea what they are doing.
bad,It’s a total mess. It’s not worth working there unless you just want to break into the IT industry. They work you to death and you are treated like a number.
bad,"Too many meetings and due to the global workforce, often at unusual hours to accommodate other locales. Different departments or even teams were often competitive, rather than cooperative."
bad,"BUT the environment was too complicated."
bad,"Client made us feel welcome and included us in all communications and meetings. Unlike those in the past, the workplace culture of the client for this assignment was communal."
bad,"It was a typical boys club kind of job. My managers were extremely disorganized; every time we had a meeting, each manager would tell us to do something completely different from what a previous manager did. I was lied to about what the role I would be taking on actually was."
bad,"Dell is a medical billing call center. The work is dependent on contracts, and it does not provide job security. The management is untrained and there is no room for advancement."
bad,"Dell has recently made some major changes to its work place in Lincoln NE. They have decided to stop providing bonuses that were promised at time of hire. They are also halting all raises and are holding the staff at base pay only. I gave Dell a 2 star due to it having a decent pay for the work done. But overall the culture and terrible account management has caused the entire experience to be ruined. Not only for me but for the staff we are losing weekly.(quitting)"
bad,"Unfortunately, it's not altogether clear what a third party administrator for Life Insurance has to do with Dell Computers new direction and it shows working for them.  Benefits are middle of the road.  Merit increases, promotions, or career advancement is a muddled mess that favors seniority and location over talent.  The company as a whole is fractured and disjointed with little direction or leadership to what this side of a multi-faceted company is doing."
bad,The healthcare division was not signing new business for quite a long time.  Therefore these employees were subject to being laid off no matter how long they had worked for the company.  There didn't seem to be a focused plan to sign new business for our division.
bad,Teveel minpunten om allen te benoemen. Het beste om daar niet te gaan werken.
bad,In my short time after the merger with Dell (about 4 months) they cared more about their way of doing things and not merging both cultures into one better culture.
bad,"I worked as a computer operator contracted through dell. I was the only female working on the IT department and it was pretty terrible. I made friends with a few of my co-workers but the department as a whole is all guys. There was constant inappropriate jokes, language, and not to mention I was harassed by another employee and decided to take it up with upper management. Unfortunately nothing was done and eventually dell terminated many contractors positions including mine and my co-workers a few months later."
bad,"It's impressive and great working environment."
bad,"Based on where I assigned (their BPO side)"
bad,"In services, there is a lot of hard work and long hours."
bad,"Very poor top level management and always keep on changing organization structure and no security for employees."
bad,"I really didnt enjoyed a single day in Dell. Bad mangement. Too much of office politics. Too much of work pressure. No social time. No job security, "
bad,"The sales environment is cut-throat, lack of training and collaborative management. The territories are not specifically assigned to one team, so customers receive over 10 calls per day about the same product, from the same company. No job security, about 10 people would get fired every Friday."
bad,"not a good place to work as a contract employee"
bad,EMC has little regard for the separation between work and life.  The culture is to spend as much of your life working.  I left for a 20% raise and a more normal work schedule.
bad,"Benefits working from home.  Cannot afford health benefits offered on the salary being paid. Has some flexibility with time off but DAILY changes in processing of claims.  Team Lead has no knowledge of how to process a claim, therefore, we have long waiting periods on responses to any questions concerning processing."
bad,Not enough pay to warrant the workload or treatment from management. Hardest part of the job was walking in to work each morning. The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving each afternoon. Workplace culture consisted of management by threat.
bad,"Have worked there for some time. Not  a very  good  experience. Overall an ok company to work, not employee friendly. Nothing more to review as did not work there for a long time."
bad,The work duties are manageable.  The management is a disaster.  They give managerial positions to people who have no experience or training as a manager.  The compensation is not based on the work you do.
bad,"Great company, that has office position, travel or remote. Offer great benefits. Will try to keep you working without a lapse in employment. Some projects offer great bonuses."
bad,Management does not care about the employees here. They throw all blame at our L1 team here even though the mistake for example was made with a totally different department. The new people hired on were hired on for 10k+ more while they only gave us a 25 cent raise for the year because of raise freezes.
bad,"Senior Manager on my account didn't submit paperwork for bonuses.  Threatened everyone's jobs.  Lied constantly.  He was a horrible leader.  They finally let him go but, they have not repaired the damage that was done to the employees."
bad,"Channel development and management including partner enablement with tools, programs, products and educating how to identify opportunities .  Created and executed sales and marketing plans.  Partner certifications, deal registration, pipeline review, marketing campaigns and events to grow revenue and market share. Partnering with other Dell solution areas and groups. Territories were too large to be effective. Management was weak and not helpful and coworkers were beat down from the workload expectation and lack of support. So much of the job was dealing with unhappy partners and problems from Dell internal right hand not knowing what the left hand was doing.  The mess of acquisition absorption will take a miracle to smooth out or strong, smart ,collaborative management and a culture change."
bad,I love EMC as a company but the how they treat contractors is replete of ambivalence
bad,I was crazy to think the I could get on as a employee that didn't have to worry about losing there job .
bad,"Dell is a big name but the management is no so good,l"
bad,Was the customers.  They were the only thing I looked forward to when I went in
bad,gestores sem experiencia em lidar com pessoas e situação de pressão.
bad,"Dell does attract talent but doesn't do anything with it. It's 8 to 5 and you don't want to be a second longer. Improved my phone skills. Management is old school like the military. Good people to work with but no moral. Management micro-managing. Good pay, that's it."
bad,"Having close to 11 Years of extensive experience in the field of Information Technology and working as an Advisor (Equivalent to Manager). Being the founding member of SOC in DELL (Perotsystems – since 2007), responsible for Security Operation Transitioning to NOIDA India SOC in 2007."
bad,"A re-organization every year. A new initiative every year (""Be the Reason, Voice of the Customer, Quality First""), but in the end, the culture never changes. it's all about ""cheaper, faster"". Jobs are outsourced and cost cutting trumps innovation and customer experience."
bad,The Compensation Plan changes every Quarter but only benefits the higher ups. The Reps are set back to Year 1 Pay even though you could have been in role for 3 years or more.
bad,Do not recommend.  High stress and ridiculous quotas. Did not like culture at all.  Customers have been trained to haggle..big pain negotiating a $300 computer.
bad,Globale Arbeitgeber. Im großen und ganzen ganz gut. Wechselnde Anforderungen für Belegschaft. Zum einen ist das gut und Business bleibt in Bewegung. Es ist ein junges und dynamisches Unternehmen.
bad,Ego driven management that unfortunately doesn't respect diversity of people or opinions without being worked out of the business. HR is pathetic. They only guide you away never seeking to correct managements lack of respect for their direct reports. Dell needs to decide if it is a low-margin commodity sales organization or take a lesson from the EMC side of the house who actually know how to sell transformative technology. IT seems to be the tail (Dell) wagging the big dog(EMC) but the two cultures are FAR apart.
bad,"I was an EMC'er, I was let go about a year after the merger being made redundant. It was a takeover and in the new business paradigm regardless of what I was doing for the company it cam e down to what I was costing the company. This is part and parcel of large Mergers. Dell's culture is rather cut throat, but to be fair they are good at what they do."
bad,My experience stemmed from the Dell Services portion of the company during the time they tried to turn customer facing operations into assembly line sweat shops... The mentality to build a mold and try and fit every relationship into that mold was a terrible idea.
bad,Focus placed on lowering resource cost to improve margin on existing book of business and improve view of company business unit for sale.  Work was migrated to off shore resources or resource brought on shore under work visa that would work at lower rates.
bad,"I've been with them from their small Documentum beginnings, so the growing pains were always hard but the people were really great in the 2000's. Cultures change, time moves on and creates more changes. Not a horrible company. Less of the old, good people still work there."
bad,You will be paid poorly and given stock options that will fail to meet your expectations.  You will never be given a serious opportunity for advancement.
bad,"Note that different organizations are managed differently."
bad,"How can you keep someone as a contractor for over 3 years, i have NEVER endured that kind of treatment in my life."
bad,"all facilities were paid food, tea, parking,  no cabs"
bad,"Unrealistic targets, unhealthy competition, inefficient leadership that doesnt care about employee stress , Incentive pattern completely unrealistic, integrity at work place is not rewarded"
bad,There was not a lot of communication with the employee and agency. Once you was place on a job you really didn't know how long you was going to be place there once the contract end.
bad,"Since I faced a layoff at an early stage of my career I do not approve of working with this company, I was hired in campus and laid off after six months because of a financial crunch"
bad,"I was shocked that such a large corporation had so little care in how their managers and employees handled themselves. The company is run like a factory and very little time is given to you in spite of being set-up for failure. They have great products and solutions but the atmosphere is such that help will only come to those who have sizeable accounts. If you are unfortunate to not have those types of accounts.....your on your own and as a result, soon to be out the door."
bad,"The only thing good i can say about this place is that they gave me a job when i was laid off. that's about it. "
bad,Unhappy employees. Weird smell throughout buildings. Less-than-transparent management. Culturally in decline. Blood pressure monitors every 100 yards throughout buildings (not a good sign).
bad,"Associate Inside Sales Representative"
bad,"There is no fun working at Dell anymore. More work, less pay and no advancement unless you have a manager advocate you. Career advancement is not based on qualifications and skillsets. Only quotas for diversity and favortism. Alot of the current managers have no business being in management or managing people."
bad,"After I was laid off, after volunteering to work in high stress areas where good managers were sorely needed, I then received inquires from recruiters trying to get me to go back to Dell, this time with no benefits and less salary."
bad,"You spend your day answering phones and helping customers and agent's offices with their issues.  You are screamed at, cussed at and deal with angry people all day.  You have help from leads who are very good and helpful.  Management is more concerned with how long you are in the restroom than how good of a job you are doing helping the customer.  The other staff you work with are nice people and make it bearable.  The hardest part of the job is the feeling of being unappreciated.  As an example, they had a fish game and we were told to participate and we would earn something for all of the fish bucks we got, so I did.  No one ever did anything with them, I still have all of them in my desk.  There is no reward for a job well done.  The most enjoyable part of the job is just the satisfaction you get from really being able to help someone."
bad,"Co-workers were very friendly and worked as a team, but managment were not organized.  More work then what workers could handle therefore lost contracts."
bad,"EMC2 would be a great starter technician job but that is about it. About 80% of the workers at the plant in apex are contract which means the chances are slim to none of getting anywhere with the company. There are several associates that are 10 and 15 year contract wokers. this means no benefits, vacation time or chances of raises regardless of your quality of work."
bad,"There was a time that the company was customer AND employee-focused. But those days are long gone. There is constant pressure to get products out the door - ready or not - and usually not. Frequent unnecessary layoffs, added work to fewer resources, and chintzy or no raises (although this doesn't apply to the golden few at the top). Lots of cheerleading about what a great company it is to work for, but no sharing in the success. Want a company that values its employees? Look elsewhere."
bad,Many work from home 4-5 days per week but work last all day and into the night and on weekends.
bad,"The job is fine, the management mindset is still stuck in the past and hasn't evolved. Very old school mentality type management. No flexibility. Not sure if it's company wide or this particular manager. The manager here likes playing ""gotcha games"" and goes out their way to seek out negativity. No praise, no flexibility."
bad,i enjoyed working for this company for the first year. Pay went the wrong way year after year and hours went up.
bad,"Stressful and flexible work timing will be based on your management."
bad,"They pay very well, but the work/life balance doesn't exists. Too many internal metrics that interfere with the employee's ability to perform their job duties. The worst part was Management."
bad,It's a good company to work for overall but I was in the least favorable department and the most competitive between fellow coworkers.  The benefits are good though and I gained a lot of sales training and experience.
bad,"This only applies to the ADT/Tyco helpdesk. It was a fast paced environment plagued by poor management, inadequate employee numbers and too much volume, as of 2014. This could of changed since then."
bad,The company I was with was acquired by Dell and I was affected soon thereafter.  The company I was with that was acquired by Dell did not seem to be overly concerned with developing the relationship with the team members located outside of the headquarters location (Massachusetts).
bad,"Incoming Customer Service calls "
bad,"Dell was a good place to learn customer service. Management needed improvement. Environment was fast-paced with good training. However, benefits were not very competitive."
bad,"This is the lowest paying IT job I've ever seen, with erratic work schedule ranging from 4-12 hours per day.  Schedules are unknown until the morning of the day in question.  Most days totaled around 6-7 hours, with at least half the time being behind the wheel of your own vehicle, and some long drives for minor work, and poor scheduling leaving multiple technicians going to one location in the same day."
bad,"No career advancement in US, Management BS a lot, No clear communication and overall Morale is way down.  Though they offer a great benefit package including everything."
bad,"They're actively moving jobs offshore. Management is short-sighted (even after going private), and doesn't care about customers or consistency/quality of service."
bad,I was ok at this job until I had a car accident not of my own fault and they ended my contract then and there. Not cool guys to kick someone when they are down. I don't forget things like that.
bad,"I do not have any information re gardening Dell.  It was still EMC Before I was restructure.   EMC typical day was busy and always had something new.   never the same day always different, and I enjoyed all 20 some odd years  that I was there"
bad,Service is NOT the place to be at Dell/EMC. 
bad,"Requested to come in at least 15-30 mins prior to scheduled time unpaid, at times manager watching your every move or listening to your conversations on the phone of your troubleshooting practices with particular emphasis on shortcomings at one on one's (monthly reviews) Not to mention the difficulty of having an equipment failure, because at Dell we NEVER have equipment failures."
bad,"you work hard and get under paid.... the management isn't encouraging to their team members and they don't know what they are doing overall. The salary is not enough to live off of, I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone"
bad,"Unfortunately Dell took over EMC and continued the lack of vision on the training environment, putting the same managers in place that couldn't drive the business for EMC."
bad,"Contractors are treated like second class workers while employees watch YouTube/Netflix all day.  Major division of labor, management plays favorites.  Very over the top ridiculous with safety, too cautious impedes work.  Hardest part of the job was sitting through nonsense meetings about statistics and numbers that did not apply to me when I knew I had actual work to be done in my own area.  Most enjoyable part of the job was going home."
bad,This does not have the culture of Dell the parent company.  It is run by a bunch of egotistical crazies that are constantly in a power struggle with each other and looks at Engineers as fodder.
bad,"no salary hike for consecutive 3 years. work life balance is good but no career opportunity. regular workforce reduction, change is constant and employee suffer."
bad,very conflicted company at the present time. A company that wants respect in the enterprise( to be the trusted advisor ) but is still a transaction based company
bad,The company was bought out 4 times while I worked here.  Rules were ever inforced due to management changes every year. The culture was negative and could not keep a staff because of all the changes that were going on.
bad,"Fast pace you upload  system information  for tablet you learn  a lot at Dell if u are willing. Management  is OK you work in manufacturing,  you have a quota that u have meet,"
bad,"I spent 20 years at Dell but NEVER felt any type of job security feeling of contentment. If you're in sales at Dell it's not a matter of if but when you will be downsized out the door. I enjoyed my job and was good at it but no matter. Over the years I've watched this sad occurrence happen to hundreds of my friends and co-workers. Doesn't matter if you're hitting quota or not. Dell is a company that manages it's employees by spreadsheet, not quality or tenure. The more money you make and the longer you've been there the bigger the target on your back. Everything is about saving money and this is done in every way possible. If your job can be sent to Panama or India to save money, you're gone. And there is NO effort to find another job for you internally. There are no longer stock options or an employee stock purchase plan. The benefits plans are not very good compared to other companies but continue to go up in price. One good thing is that management is a revolving door so if you don't like your manager then you should have a different one soon. The problem is that the new one is likely to be much worse since training is non existent."
bad,Not able to move up in the company easily. Have not received steady raises in years if any. The compensation only rewards those who exponentially exceed the expectations. Just doing a little better than what is expected will not get you anything.
bad,"I worked at Dell for two periods of three years with a ten year break in between.  The first time was around 2000 and the atmosphere was positive if a little staid."
bad,"Rather not say, I have nothing good to say in relation to this organization. Hopefully things get better over time as the company grows."
bad,"Been here almost 2 years as a temp to perm contractor. Still waiting to become a permanent dell badged employee(as promised) so I can get a real salary with benefits. Same corporate atmosphere as before, it's all about who you know. If you don't have a buddy who's a manager or director it's gonna be hard moving up the ladder."
bad,"Call center environment of the worst sort. "
bad,This is not a work environment I want suggest for anyone and this comment comes from a seasoned commissioned sales person.
bad,"A Typical day at work"
bad,"The expectations at Dell are very high and the compensation is low compared to other larger companies. Management has a tendency to  keep favorites in mind for promotions and bonuses. Your work performance has little to nothing to do with advancement. At Dell, the old axiom of ""it's not what you know but who you know"" holds true. I witnessed poor performers receive bonus awards simply because they attended the same university as their manager. That sort of corruption runs rampant at Dell. Steer clear of this place if you're looking for a just working environment."
bad,"I was into hardware support."
bad,All days are the same with little to no support from management. Layoffs and random closings leave employees never sure if they will have a job the next day and communication is limited at best
bad,I could not handle the dress up like days balloons or construction paper pictures on the wall.  If you like long hours and middle school bulletin board art this place is for you
bad,"Culture is out of date."
bad,I have worked at EMC since I graduated college.  It is an excellent place to work with great people and amazing benefits! 
bad,"This company has great products. Unfortunately, the management is horrible. EMC is not a place to think long term regarding your career. There is very little to no career growth. My overall opinion is negative. I should have taken a position with NetApp or Cisco."
bad,Process Group Medical Claims
bad,"I won`t say very good. I worked here for quite long because options in the city are stipulated and Dell pays quite a good salary. But at one point, an individual is no longer attracted towards the same and rather looks for better options in overall aspects. Dell is good company and holds a high brand name but the management woes makes it a worst place to survive leading to criticism. There is no learning, career growth is vague and biased behavior of the senior management and of course lack of job security makes one to give up easily. There is nothing to boost one`s morale except extra pay days and salary days. Typical work goes upto 12 hours. Co workers are good. No longer enjoyable part exists. To be precise, its good to join in as a fresher out of a college or uni or while pursuing the studies. typically 2-3 years and then move on for better prospects else one feels like living in a sweet prison that will never let you leave just because of the good pay. To add on working in shifts makes one`s life balance extremely disastrous and in return no extra benefits for the same."
bad,I choose not to comment on this company because I do not have anything nice to say at all.
bad,Subcontracting management was horrible. The contract structure was a recipe for failure. I'm not sure how they will get into option years.
bad,can be made better. Very conservative company. Dont seem to take risks in the market.
bad,The more educated you are regarding the industry including its technological ecosystem AND experience in b2b sales and/or account handling the better.
bad,"No Comment, Your Hard-Working Will Be Worthless and A lot things need to improve even though doing great jobs. Become victims if any issues and take responsible"
bad,"Context shifting is a major problem in the development groups.  Sprint planning gets upended by emergency stakeholder requests.  Management has little dialogue with development staff, especially contractors.  Contractors are specifically hamstrung by the lack of conversions, raises, performance reviews, and access to supervisory feedback.  Dev teams are extremely silo'ed -- often finding themselves at cross purposes."
bad,"I was responsible for walking data center engineers through upgrading software for or replacing equipment on their servers which they had purchased from the company. A full diagnostic check would be proactively run and the servers would phone home on a periodic basis.  I would address any hardware, software or specific technical issues every time they called to ensure first call resolution.  This would be accomplished by either me or by directly involving escalated tiers to solve the issues that customers had.  We would also make pro-active outbound calls any time we received any uploaded errors or red flags.  Extremely high technical skills as well as good customer service skills were required because of the high-profile customer base and server uptime contract requirements."
bad,"Muito trabalho pra pouco salário, liderança ausente."
bad,"Dell touts that it wants to be the best in the industry but at the same time has admitted to wanting to offer benefits that are at-or-below industry standard.  ""We expect this company to be the best but  your compensation and benefits will be average"""
bad,It was a great please for a springboard for another position. Another unstable organization since work is based on contracts with other companies. But a great location for learning
bad,"A typical day at work is attending a scrum meeting, for an hour and work with my team on the day to day tickets. Poor management and low team morale."
bad,"It was after the good times.  Management was young and in golden handcuffs.  The only talent left were those too conservative to chase the .com boom.  As a result, innovation was gone and I could not figure out how to disappear/have an accident on the way to work and still let my wife receive the life insurance."
bad,Dell was a roller coaster ride of an experience..overall it was a bad time for me. I would not recommend this for anyone. pay was low and management was shaky at best.
bad,"Depending on area, it is a good place to work.  For sales, it is good short term to get experience, but compensation is lacking when compared to competition with unrealistic quotas.  For example you may have a nice quarter/half and the next quarter/half, they increase your quota by 100% so that you really can't achieve the number so that they can control how much they pay you."
bad,"Worked at Dell for 8 years, and really enjoyed my coworkers but management and opportunity for advancement are based on who you know, rather than your performance."
bad,"es , Here you can share your thoughts in the technical aspects,so that managers can look in to that and will give the support to your idea if it is worth. Its been great to work with Dell for me"
bad,"too many managers, not enough workers. Cut throat atmosphere within HR, unwilling to find out best person for the job. No communication amongst the workers."
bad,"Dell is overly inward-looking and obsessed with measuring its own effectiveness. Employees don't feel empowered and are discouraged from taking ownership of problems that cross over into other functions. A lot of your time there is spent on ""managing up"" and creating information solely for the consumption of people who are evaluating your performance and supposedly optimizing operations. Not an innovative company but a stodgy stalwart. Not my cup of tea but for some, a reasonable place to make a living."
bad,"good company, lots of good people, i will recommended anyone to go work for them. work culture was good, management was ok lot of time to learned and learn"
bad,"Dell promised that the majority of EMC would remain the same however organizations were turned upside down, health benefits all changed (and not for the better) as well as many policy changes."
bad,Finns mycket att utveckla. Just nu turbulent i och med sammanslagningen med EMC.
bad,"Dell is trying to reinvent itself - thus the merger with EMC.  While the merger is presented as being of ""equals"" - and the executive management may believe that - lower level legacy Dell and EMC staff are at odds.  EMC was the more technically advanced company and knows how to drive the change the combination needs.  Legacy Dell was very manual and many of their processes are outdated and inefficient.  Legacy Dell staff are actively resisting change - even that initiated by their own management - and work to drive out legacy EMC staff.  This creates a dysfunctional and hostile culture and produces no improvements or value for the company."
bad,"If you can't say anything good, don't say anything at all. I like my hours. The TL had a hard job, in force dumb metrics. Not sure if it was due to not wanted to give rises."
bad,Worked in Dell services business which was bought by perot systems and later sold to NTT Data. Not many opportunities and they had long term customers which were limited in number.
bad,"Direction internally was good......extremely absent with Dell Hdqtrs. Culture was constantly changing because on Dell's lack of direction. "
bad,"OK company to work in."
bad,"While EMC only innovated through acquisition, Dell has cemented that approach. Not enough investment will be made in organic innovation - it will only come via purchsing innovative small companies. Which leaves legacy Dell EMC employees at a disadvantage... unless they start a company and get acquired!"
bad,I just feel like this job is lacking as far as I am considered personally as i have more ambition. There is not enough room for growth and user education
bad,If you are the kind of person who like to say yes to everything you manager say it will be a good place for you. Don't expect to work many years here because they will laid you off and hire you again so you don't make longevity with the company.
bad,"the feet on the street, meaning ground floor at Dell are all great people that just want to help the customer."
bad,"Easy to work , no growth opportunity. Learnt mainframes, oracle and unix here. Poor management and biased managers. No onsite opportunities. No work life balance. You can have ample of free time"
bad,"all about politic, no talent engineers, your credit will be taken by those who are good playing politic, they tie together, I guess you should know what I meant."
bad,"Very slow moving large company. Little chance of career growth or learning. Chance to work with a lot of traditional technology, mostly from the hardware perspective, little exposure to new technologies and/or solutions."
bad,"Dell services was run by former Wipro executives.  The entire business was run on a strategy of cost cutting and margin improvement while the rest of our market passed us by.  Hopefully NTT can right the ship before it sinks."
bad,"To be frank, the culture and management is really not good. All they care about are their customers and not their employees. Mainly Leads & Managers are mainly keen in saving their jobs and not worried about any things or any one else."
bad,"If you like a call center, then this is for you. I really didn't like it and it can get stressful at times. I would just be careful if I was you because sometimes they hate it when you take too long on a call."
bad,"empresa má administrada."
bad,"The job in it of itself is fine. Just tech support for customers, aka call center. Annoying at times because sometimes you get unreasonable people on the line, but you get used to it."
bad,A productive work environment where you learn about products and services the company provides to its customers. The co-workers and support staff give their all to bring beginning to end customer service to its clients. The challenging part of the position is time management customers and work demands. The pleasing part is being able to collaborate with peers on clients technical issues.
bad,The life at dell is pathetic . No payhike . Very bad management . No growth plan. The management does'nt care about people and about thier work life balance.
bad,"One of the challenging place to work.  Learnt to handle pressure under work.  Could work with very good clients in US like Mercer, Cambridge etc.,"
bad,Made outbound calls to other insurance companies inquiring on the status of outgoing 1035 Exchanges or other retirement plans in order to fund an annuity product. Made outbound calls to clients 81 and over regarding their experience with an annuity product. Generated emails to agents regarding missing requirements in order to complete the application in a timely manner and proceed with completing the application for different annuity products offered.
bad,I would not work for Dell again in my life. After 8 years i felt relieved when i found another job and could leave this place and leave their brainless/paper-pusher management teams behind. Always wonder why i didn't do it before
bad,"Working for Dell has been a good experience.  I have learned a lot to help me grow.  Certain departments are better to work in.  Unfortunately, the BPO side of the company is not the best place to work if you desire to grow in the company.  The growth and culture in this area is stagnant."
bad,"Typical day involved handling support tickets and developing modules in web application"
bad,Not a trust worthy company for the sales force. They ran HR through a temp agency that did not have a clue on how to staff and they under paid the sales team and made sales virtual impossible. Not sure if this company is still in operations.
bad,Terrible place to work (specifically this department). The management only promotes drinking and pot buddies. Very petty and demoralizing. Little to no chance of every moving out of temp status regardless of performance.
bad,Good office Environment. Slow growth and less to learn. Salary is never on time. Poor Management.Nothing much to personally grow & develop.
bad,"Agressive work environment, good salary, no challenges, NON-solid career plan, very political company. Very weak and incompetent managers and directors."
bad,"Too big, too political, slow moving"
bad,"Mgt vision not clearly communicated, horrible work life balance, lack of passion from Leaders as it relates to how the company will move forward,  Incompetent leadership able to make key decisions.  Too much churn not effective systems/processes in place."
bad,"Extremely micromanaged. Good place to work, so long as you're on an account with good management."
bad,"I have worked many IT jobs over the years. This is by far the worst. I believe I work at the same desk as a previous review ""not a fun place to work"" except my training was only 3 weeks and there is no stability to procedure. "
bad,"Support the EMC sales staff in their Dallas office.  Help to qualify and validate an opportunity based on the customers IT Needs/Pain/Risks.  After performing an initial discovery, I would run analysis tools to gather technical data if necessary for designing a solution. Depending on the need and how it matched up with EMC's Hardware/Software portfolio, I would then design and quote a solution.  Finally, I would present the solution to the customer, usually through a proposal and executive summary, along with the sales team answering any technical questions they may have."
bad,"Too many engineers at Dell are simply not motivated.  Management structure setup for little career advancement based on performance and merit.  Advancement based mainly on ""who you know"" and individual relationships.  Too much socializing and not enough team work.  Lack of centralized processes to work smarter, not harder.  Many team members take credit for work done by people under them.  Most developers / engineers call Dell the ""Walmart of Computers""."
bad,"Dell, large global company that is losing market share due to quality of the products that are produced."
bad,Continuously has many job cuts and not a culture that values people
bad,"Inbound sales for State and Local Government customers.  In-depth knowledge of Dell’s technology, products and services was required to meet and exceed divisional goals.  Ability to be involved in contract negotiation and possessing strong financial/business and pricing knowledge was required."
bad,This experience offered some interested work experience however was an motivating environment was never actually created
bad,"It has a great environment."
bad,"The hardest part of the job"
bad,I had a different view on how employees should be approached by management. I think that every employee is unique and a manager needs to adapt his/her management style for each person. I was fired for having a different view.
bad,"Meetings / Client Calls / One on Ones "
bad,"Only interaction with the customer was over the phone and to provide hardware technical support was very challenging. I have learned to be more descriptive and patient. "
bad,Working here is very much a fast paced and accelerated learning environment.
bad,"They are so busy that you will be working mandatory overtime, working during every lunch, and working late nights even if you have plans."
bad,I very much enjoyed with my co-workers. I worked only in day shift and general shift basis.
bad,"Not one of the best places. It's a call center and the co-workers are some of the best people that you can meet, but the management is not the best."
bad,Bad place for career growth and salary.
bad,"Life at Dell has been fun and at times sad. Got the opportunity to learn about new technology,understand customer mindset and learn management techniques. The day starts at night! Company provides cab facilities but I chose to drive my own vehicle to work.We start up with a pre-shift for 15 minutes understanding the daily targets and communications sent by the Leadership department. the average handling time is about 30 minutes or less.We get 2 breaks of 15 mins each and a thirty minute dinner/lunch break. There isn't much pressure as far as job is concerned. That makes me search for a new job. I would like to do some constructive work. Want to work with a reputed company overseas."
bad,empresa ambiente agradavel para trabalhar. excelente restaurante e ambiente de lazer para funcionarios.
bad,Clear hierarchy with management
bad,Company will provide competitive rates and competitive benefits but also is trying to re-work how the customer service engineer position is performed after the EMC merger. The company appears to no be familiar with how much risk the position contains. Room for error is very small and can result in lost of job very quickly resulting in a high stress position.
bad,Job was ok with ok benefits. I left cause of the the atmosphere there. When it was owned by Dell the pay scale for employees was off. I was there 8 years and was at the bottom of the pay scale compared to new hires I was training.
bad,company doesnt seem very innovative. Hard for a woman in the company to advance before male counterparts. They do pay pretty well and have a generous bonus structure.
bad,"I worked at Dell EMC organization and was subjected to poor training Micromanagement, horrible stress and lack of fair and balanced treatment.  It was a humiliating place to work."
bad,"contractors are treated as aliens and hard to find document to make any changes or implementations."
bad,"While supporting the customer is not usually an issue, internal issues to the company sometimes take quite some time to resolve. Attempts to transfer internally is nigh-impossible. Being told about promotion opportunities does not happen. Hunting internally is difficult at best. The general corporate culture is miserable."
bad,"Company offers great learning experience."
bad,"Poor management, very poor tools, little cooperation to reach group goals and hence a lot of politics.  Little focus on customer satisfaction because it took a lot of effort to meet required milestones and survive."
bad,"Company claims they want to attract the best and brightest, but they don't really show it by the benefits they offer compared to rest of the industry. They also do a poor job of recognizing talent and helping their employees grow professionally into more decision making roles with more responsibility."
bad,"No growth --  A lot of turnover. Not flexible and working environment is not cohesive. Management was OK, but processes were not aligned to team goals."
bad,"Starting at Dell i was ambitious and even through the training i was very excited to work there. After i was done with the 13 weeks of training and out on the ""floor,"" i realized a lot of the things they preach in training just simply aren't true. The main thing about the company is you need to get a solid manager. My manager would go around telling other employees other peoples business. She would go around saying ""i am trying to force this person out"" instead of trying to deal with the problems and talking about it like an adult. The account sets are not all equal. even though the quotas will be the same. They promote a ""flexible work schedule,"" but when you ask to work a different shift that better fits your personal schedule, it gets rejected. It is the definition of a ""who you know instead of what you know"" type of work environment. They say you get $54,000 a year, but you have to work your way up to that mark. If you hit 100% of your quota up until your 1 year mark, you will make between $40-45k and not the full $54k like you are told."
bad,I would come in to work and start by reading emails from customers that were upset or wondering why the issue was not resolved yet. I would then go into available to help out any customers calling in. You will wait for the customers to call in and most time they are upset with the computer and it not working. You will get two 15 min breaks that are timed and if you go over you will be penalized. The pay is nice but not enough to even live in Austin and the vacation is great if you can get it. You have to compete with the whole floor to get your time off and you will not get it off if someone has gotten before you. I will say the health and 401k is amazing but other than that I will not recommend working in Pro Support or Pro Support ELS
bad,"I would still be with the company if they hadn't force retired me. I enjoyed the job, people that I met on sites fixing their machines. Great place to work for unless you had been with the company for an extended period, then they thought they could replace you with younger, cheaper labor."
bad,Far too much micromangement for me. I have tried to move into management three times and been ignored. I have heard similar stories from around the company. I am looking to go elsewhere.
bad,"Employee for Dell, get on the floor, check email, review open tickets, must arrive 20 minutes early to complete that process."
bad,I liked the fact that the company encouraged the employees to participate in volunteer work.  The company allows up to 15 hours a year for volunteering and those hours are considered as paid-hours.  They also matches your donations to non-profits.
bad,"no job security, constant layoffs, heavy processes to get anything done... a lot of unhappy people here, no career advancement under current environment"
bad,Very rigid clock and phone management. Not able to do the job effectively in the time allotted. No real support when it is needed. Workload is way to heavy for everyone. Your support is to busy doing other things to help you in a timely manner.
bad,I worked at a Center of Excellence before Dell was in control of EMC. The work was standard cabling and racking of equipment with very limited opportunities for hands on technical training or experience. The point of my interneship was to receive technical training and experience to bolster my resume. I disclosed this information before my internship began and was given very little support towards my future. I ultimately became bored and felt unappreciated for all my work.
bad,A hard job as I was retrieving certain computers from stock for delivery all over Europe. Was difficult as some computers were often stored in wrong area which made the job a lot harder as a certain amount of computers was expected to be delivered each day.
bad,The company doesn't focus on employee development they just want you to get the job done anyway you can. Manage is too top heavy and don't understand how to manage or develop employees to help get the best out of them.
bad,Before it became Dell it was a much better place to work.  EMC considered everybody their family and when Dell took over people where treated like dirt.
bad,"Dell is a great place to work to gain experience in the corporate world. While we have the ability to work from home, it gets thrown in your face whenever you request a raise. Even getting promoted is a hassle. You are not able to to get promoted WITHOUT applying for a higher position, even if you would be doing the same job but with larger accounts and complexity. "
bad,"Don't have much projects in the company. No Hikes & Bonus."
bad,"Dell has many problems internally tied to a vacuum of leadership. In that vacuum, many people work to advance their own agendas causing a confusing and vicious work environment."
bad,"A pessoa responsável pelo funcionário não estava sempre presente e, muitas vezes, não sabia ouvir o seu subordinado."
bad,"Make calls to the Clients for New Business & existing Requirement."
bad,"Need to be a member of the ""Good Ole Boy Club"" to make it long term at Dell EMC.  Can make it based on hard work, but you'll sacrifice family, and burn out as Dell EMC will say they are ""work/Life"" balanced, but they are not"
bad,"A lot to improve, both on the account and how it manages its employees. As mentioned above the work their employees are asked to do is too much for the salary provided."
bad,"Didn't like working for Dell, too siloed for me and slow.  I need to be busy.  Also, I never really even seen co-workers since they were located all over."
bad,"Workplace environment varies from site to site, but in general, when hired, employees are left alone. This means both that you are allowed to do your job the way you want, but also that you are not formally trained on existing systems. Knowledge transfer is expected to occur informally from person to person."
bad,"I did not enjoy my time here, they only offered extremely short contracts at the time and very little notice was given each time whether you were being extended or not."
bad,"I worked here for almost 9 years, and despite top rating reviews year after year, I only got 2 promotions as I saw the managers' friends getting advanced fast. "
bad,"How you are able to advance in the company is very much about who you know. Have gone through two reorgs and Dell buying. No review of people's abilities or resumes for potential new opportunities. The company eliminated the group I hired for, but they never really put me in a role relevant to my background or skills, or what I was hired for. Yet, they stole my collateral and gave it to another group and wouldn't let me be involved. Not real honest people in management or care much about their employees."
bad,"Rock-solid technology, but EMC still has a reputation that precedes it to many customers in the market.  The pay is decent, but you will succeed at EMC (largely) if management wants you to succeed.  If you get saddled with a ton of accounts that don't like EMC, a reasonable conjecture is that management doesn't like you.  Strange experience all around."
bad,"Life if is perspective, attitude, and balance."
bad,Not very sympathetic to providing adequate vacation time for employees.  Very big brother atmosphere where you can't control your own sales.
bad,I am a remote employee with Dell.  They allow work flexibility.  The best place to work is Dell Corporate.  Their BPO office in Lincoln Nebraska does not have a professional environment and is not the idea place to work.
bad,"I thoroughly enjoyed my job at Dell SecureWorks. My co-workers were great and I met a lot of nice people. Initially, I really had some great managers as well. My managers were firm but fair, they were there for support when you needed it and had the expertise and willingness to be able to assist. "
bad,"Management has a very top-down approach at times, stretched teams, some antiquated / multiple systems to utilize. At times can feel isolated within the company with limited ability to transition to other positions."
bad,"Routine day work"
bad,"Very fast pace, entrepreneurial in some ways, with work from home possibility.  It is ambiguous as it is always evolving and changing."
bad,"Cool working culture but very slow chances of growth. Also, bonuses and benefits kept on delaying."
bad,"Division of work at Dell is not very clean. Skills and expertise are not taken into account for the same. As I have seen in last few months the employee satisfaction is very low at Dell. In terms of professional growth I don't see much scope out here."
bad,Top paying help desk in the area.  Treatment of employees is very poor.  There is a serious lack of leadership.
bad,"The local teams and managers work very long hours in order to please the customers in any way possible (which is our job). Unfortunately upper management has a different set of goals so we are torn between pleasing the customers and administrative metrics. We are able to work from host often when not out in front of customers so that's a place, but that also means we work long hours at night quite a bit. The culture is best described as do whatever it takes to achieve the goal, but often process and procedure bog everyone down."
bad,"50/50 pre-sales and actual sales carrying quota and forecasting it."
bad,Big co based in Mass.  Some of their webpages are weak.  Security is so tight - you're lucky if you can go to Google.
bad,"Okay job, but don't expect to learn anything new.  Team work is preached about, not practiced though."
bad,"Took voice initiated customer/internal calls. "
bad,Dell has thought me a lot I did no know or aware of about corporate America.
bad,m-f 5 -2 the parts of a computr good management great co workers the hardest part was the uncertainty of losing the  your postion seeign the enresults of a built product
bad,As a government contractor the parent company treats its employees like a billable item.
bad,"feel good work, slow growth in designation and salary, learning curve is less"
bad,After completing college this was my first job.  This opportunity provided me with the foundation to have a successful future.
bad,A company with good people but management lost in their past achievements and unable to make the adjustments needed to compete in the long term.
bad,"Typical day to day includes proactive maintenance, while providing customer service. I enjoyed my job but the company/employees almost made this job unbearable with the constant bickering and politics. Unless you are in with the ""IN CROWD"" you will not be recognized nor will you advance in your career. Management is poor here most are alpha male who demean anyone different than them."
bad,"Typical consulting job, changing projects, location, teams. Some good some bad. Nothing special. "
bad,Management didn't interact much with the team. Very rarely did they walk down the aisles where their team sat to interact.
bad,"As a Remarketing Specialist, I have developed training and mentoring skills as I train newly hired remarketing coordinators. I have also acquired and improved skills pertaining to writing process instruction documents. I have participated in many customer service training programs."
bad,I enjoyed my experience at dell it was a good work environment and a learning experience
bad,"While I highly respect the people who work there, I think Dell is in trouble. Upper management is under pressure to deliver results, but they're attempting to do it by doing the same old same old that had once made it a very respectable company. However, PCs are fast becoming obsolete, and the future is in services, as IBM had done. the transformation at Dell towards services is slow in coming and upper management is not doing enough to implement the recommendations of mid management."
bad,My typical day is scheduling customer meetings and conference calls and on conference calls.
bad,take escalated calls from tier1 agents.
bad,"Ownership is unrealistic in it's goals for sales and it's the Sales Reps suffer by fired dozens at a time for not acheiving their bloated Monthly or Quarterly Quota. Past success doesn't matter! What have you done this month? Be prepared to lie, cheat, and steal under orders from management to stand a chance to be their for 18 months."
bad,Great work life balance.  I've worked here over ten years with an MBA and continuously passed up by coworkers with no education.  Managers are not subject matter experts.  Dead end career.
bad,"This job requires too many hours and a lack of management support in getting your work done (to be fair, management is sometimes in the same boat). There is flexibility in working remotely, but the reality is you feel like you're on the clock all the time. They don't compensate well enough for that kind of drudgery."
bad,Alorica in Lake Mary has the Dell account. The upper management at this site is a complete joke. There is extreme favoritism. There are people in positions on that account that have no business being in the position in the first place. It is clearly who you know and how much you like to suck up rather than what you know and how you can make a difference that matters more. The company is so money hungry that they are over working the agents by increasing call volume when they clearly do not have the staff to cover it. The overall moral is extremely low to the point where even team managers are leaving regularly. I do not suggest accepting a position on the Dell account. I have heard great things about the USAA account though.
bad,"I have learn a lot from payroll position in this company. Not a very good management and very stressful workplace. Very competition, not a friendly environment."
bad,"Maybe what attracted Dell to EMC was its unspoken policy to hire fresh out of college. When you're that guy fresh out of college the opportunity is fantastic, but most people who get really good don't stick around. I Think DellEMC is a great springboard for breaking into the industry - but keep the resume and LinkedIn profile up-to-date. Get to know the great people who do work there and sharpen your skills for the next venture."
bad,"I'm not privy to all the details but the jest of it is that Alorica essentially negotiated a contract with Dell, outbidding other third party call center providers to take on ProSupport business growth. This extension of service has evolved into not only taking on new business, but taking over the support business of the other contracted support providers and is now evolving into the elimination of Dells inhouse support itself. This represents massive operations cost savings for Dell and business growth and profit for Alorica."
bad,"Mostly good people.  Only lip service to work-life balance.  Despite going private a few years ago, there was never any change to the obsession with quarterly results.  RIF's are a constant bad habit."
bad,"The company as good work life balance.However , due to integration with EMC there was lot of uncertainty and management  direction was missing ......."
bad,"The ping pong table and Wii were seldom used.  The culture changed when Dell purchased SecureWorks, and the CFO and Controller left for other opportunities."
bad,"Aprendí mucho en ese lugar."
bad,"It is a volatile time at Dell, in particular with the DellEMC side of the company as integration/assimilation is still underway from the acquisition.  EMC was know for having great benefits, Dell follows the industry standards and trends more closely.  "
bad,"The primary problem with working at DellEMC is the significant amount of red tape in place to hamstring your personal success. You cannot move up more than one job level per year, you cannot increase your salary by more than 20% per year by any means, and you cannot leave your department without one year in role. The one of these that is the major issue is the 20% salary increase. Should you start entry level, your salary is so low that 20% is not enough head room to move into a position you are actually qualified for. The only way around this is to quit and then get rehired else you have to work at the company for 5 years plus to get into a decent job. You are told grand tales of being able to move within the company once you get in, but those are daydreams at best. The work culture is great and the company treats you well most of the time. Unfortunately this culture is only able to keep you distracted for at most a year before you realize you have no where to go, and the only way to advance your career is to leave."
bad,"Company paid you well for the job at hand. Best quoting system of any major IT company I've worked for..."
bad,"I discovered that I do not work well in large companies where you're essentially a number on a list, buried in layers of managers, administrators, supervisors, directors, etc. Just maintaining your employment is a job in itself, with quarterly reviews and self-assessments. When do you find time to do the actual job? It was not for me. I've known plenty of people who have thrived here - I just didn't know until it was too late that I would not be one of those."
bad,"People are disposable in this organization.  Money counts, people do not.  When the company ""Went Public"", the reception was luke warm at best.  The company eliminated people to realize a short term apparent gain in financial standing to show investors.  Basically ""Kill the slaves to make the food supply appear larger""."
bad,Not so great company. Not many projects. Have not been merged with NTT data. They bid projects for very less amount and pay is also not so great. i joined as a temporary jump and hike.
bad,The Dell EMC Company has no regard for their employee's. They only care about the bottom dollar amount for each quarter.
bad,Dell has great benefits and a work life balance.  Unfortunately they cannot seem to place talent in the right position or keep talent within the company.  Their HR department determines who gets let go rather than management or if you are a great employee.  Buyer beware.
bad,Don't waste your time.  Dell is a reseller and that is their largest portion of revenue.  They make sub-par computers although that has little to do with their work environment.  You learn quickly at Dell that you do not matter and that anyone is expendable. I suppose this is the status quo for large companies like this
bad,"Not a very good company to work for during the time. Drove morale by bonuses, but not a supporting empowering culture.  I believe this is what led to Dell's current business situation."
bad,I've made some great friends working at Dell.  I feel I've had an opportunity to grow my skills and career.  Direct management has been mostly good.
bad,"1. Fun work place"
bad,"Dell has awesome work at home benefits"
bad,great benefits good hours good company picnics every year bonus profit sharing 401k sorry management poor advancement family life work life no balance lied to employee undercover drug culture amongst employees I work there ten years stared at 8.50 left making 12.00
bad,"16 years at Dell with an ever changing environment. Few good leaders, but a lot of micro-managers with little to no job knowledge in the organization area they cover. Top level has a plan but the individual mangers underneath this high level are doing their own things not in line with company goals. Typical work day is 8 to 5 or 7 with plenty of busy work, that could be improved on. Processes are behind the times, but legacy folks will not get rid of outdated tools. Management could be reduced, due to over abundance of management levels. Too many middle-men/women, not enough workers for the work. My co-workers were exceptional people doing whatever it took to get things done, with little reward and not looking for it. Our success meant company success, so we were good with that alone. The hardest part of the job was the great uncertainty on whether you were going to have a job or not as the goals of the company changed or the reorganization into new groups took place. No one had an idea what was going on, then you did not have a job at the end of the day. The explanations were weak and no loyalty to the people who stayed to see and help the company move from public to private. The most enjoyable part of my job was the non-management employees I met and built relationships with over my 16 years at Dell Inc, and the worst was the selfish management and lack of loyalty this company shows to its employees."
bad,"Worked as customer case executive and handling inbound calls and according to the model and issue placing a call to tech departments"
bad,Not suitable work place for freshers. No work life balance. Co-workers and not very supportive. Not an ideal place to work and no fun in working.
bad,"EMC has some great products and is well respected in storage as well as in security (RSA). This company gave me the best work-life balance I've ever had. When 5pm came, I shut down, went home, and wasn't bothered by anyone."
bad,"The downside of working for Dell is the fact the company is so large, it's difficult to NOT get lost in all of the processes."
bad,Management is lost. Bad projects are coming down the pipe. Management has no care about retaining great resources.
bad,"Assembling computers together"
bad,"Work at Dell is challenging and support organizations are resource constrained making resolution of customer issues difficult to accomplish in a timely manner. However, there are many good leaders at Dell and I was fortunate to work with and for caring and inspiring leaders."
bad,a very good place to work. a good company for electrical engineer to star with the carrer.
bad,One the lowest end of IT companies that do things right. Far too much BS that goes on there. The culture is top heavy and little things are hard to accomplish.
bad,"Typical day of work for a CE is contacting customers to verify site access for repair/maintenance work, verify location of needed parts, collect parts and meet appointment window to the customer site."
bad,"The goals of the company are structured in such a way that the individual obtain the goals, but the goals of the individual may not help the organization succeed."
bad,"A l'époque, liberté et gros moyens, puis fortes restrictions"
bad,Work will be interesting for sure with lots of opportunities to learn. Co-workers are fantastic and easy going
bad,Execution is appreciated. People are decent. Management is responsive.
bad,"There are a large number of employees who make $175K per year but they do not have a chair, or a cube, or a telephone. They roam the cafeterias, which all have wi-fi and try to get a bit of work done. As you might expect, productivity in this mode is not high."
bad,I worked at EMC for 4+ years as an Operations Manager.
bad,"When  I started this job I could not be happier.  It was great!  My managers wanted me to succeed.  I felt appreciated.  Unfortunately I had to take some time off to take care of my wife who was sick, and the manager I had then got me fired even after I asked for FMLA.  If you can stay away from this one female manager you will be fine.  The pay was very good, and the job was really fun."
bad,"If you are ambitious and knowledgeable, please don't join. If you want a relax life than plz join with minimal hikes"
bad,"It is just a place to support old products."
bad,"Company is Good but Management is less helpful. Have learned new technology and programming skill by code reviews. "
bad,"Since the IPO, the work environment changed. You are expected to "
bad,"It should have been a great company however some departments abuse the employees. Especially at the sales department."
bad,"It is difficult to advance with this contracting/temp service company even if you try to apply for other employment opportunities via the web site or at the local office.  The health insurance is not worth the cost.  As far as paid time off, you didn't know if Manpower would give PTO until the first month of the year.  There was at least 5 years that Manpower didn't give PTO and the company I was contracted to paid for them.  "
bad,"open 24/7 difficult to find work life balance.  great benefits and compensation.  Workplace culture casual and open.  great tools to do the job. facility was great, cafeteria and gym."
bad,It is a good company in terms of learning but they dont provide good perks and acknowledgement to their employees. Service bonus and appraisal dont have a fixed cycle
bad,"Dell is definitely a great place to get your foot into the world of tech, especially tech sales. "
bad,"Working is good but salary issue problem"
bad,"No matter how much hard you worked, your manager will not be able to provide you what you want. They may give thousands of reasons which doesn't makes sense at all. And finally you'll get a response that we should have luck to get succeed. which is highly intolerable."
bad,Management will be supportive. Persons working in voice process have a good future. There is no option much for Finance and Accounts process
bad,"The application was interesting but design wasn't really up to the mark as it was handled my many hands prior to my joining. Given the short time, providing a solution was challenging but still mind is lingering with other ideas where there is no room."
bad,"I used to work in 12 different shifts in 12 months.shifts start from 4 pm to 4 am IST login."
bad,"Key responsibilities"
bad,"The benefits are good, but in terms of career growth, job satisfaction, it's pretty bad"
bad,Leadership team has no experience is selling software solutions.
bad,"I'm sorry I don't have very much to say about this company. It was a great environment once I started, but then it went downhill."
bad,"Dell is an aggressive Sales environment.  The teams on the sales floor are motivated to make the sale and achieve their commission.  Dell sells almost anything related to computing solutions and services.  They have a strong portfolio.  However, the percentage of sales to support/operations staff is quite off the scale.  As a result, sales people constantly reinvent the wheel, their own portfolio of selling products and rarely focus on the companies desires to change to a full solutions company.  I enjoyed my position on the senior management team.  I contributed certain successful benefits to Dells operation.  However, I left disheartened that the organisation was not willing to work together more."
bad,the people are great going through massive changes and no stability
bad,"Equallogic was an acquisition for dell, poor prior integration by management, Dell IT budget so tight would not support hardware in a responsible manner, failing and expired/unsupported business imperative equipment not being replaced due to supposed budget issue (bickering between depts who should pay - for 2 years) although the local site is one of the best money makers for dell. Dishonest about training opportunities, when training budget was approved trianing was deinied due to understaffing, very understaffed local IT dept remotely managed by an over burdened manager. Nice people bad policies in the internal IT Dept. People were good, budget policies made the job a nightmare."
bad,"Internal IT was my job. Although I was paid well they are the cheapest group I have ever worked for. Simple things like office supplies, to maintaining backup tape machines is like squezing blood from a rock. The people were great to work with. I have heard other departments are very good to work for."
bad,Culture of unaccountability is the biggest reason acquired companies and internal projects do not get done on time or are decommissioned and moved to India to finish out the contracts.
bad,"The job I performed at Dell Technologies was constantly contradicted and the priorities changed on a daily, if not hourly, basis.  The management teams pushed what was important at that moment and did not commit to what was important for the long term."
bad,"We were a pilot company, so we learned as we went the first year. The job aids and system maneuvering were very confusing as well. "
bad,"Lots of downtime. Too many mandatory meetings for interns, most of which were not interesting or helpful. Management was okay but company policy surrounding hours was way too strict. Well paid, coworkers were able to advance within the company if they were qualified enough."
bad,"Serving as project manager for various large corporate clients"
bad,"For the first 10 years, my career was active, vibrant, and constantly increasing in both pay and responsibility. The last 10 years has brought it to a complete halt. No pay grade or significant pay increase, and a huge expectation to perform with empty promises for the future. I developed new teams, created new processes, and helped build a Federal Services team single handed.No recognition."
bad,"call center jobs do not offer a lot of advancement opportunity. "
bad,One man show. Led by management only. Very little impact possible by the employees. Very east coast driven. Decisions are made only there. Bad culture.
bad,"Very large corporation, but a lot of interference by persons not connected with operations, who have no knowledge how to take care and help its customers, only people who shirk work are applauded most of the times."
bad,"Cost Optimization comes First, Innovation and Growth comes Second. Leaders are excellent and ensure Work Life is respected.Salaries are above average. Encourages talent rotation"
bad,On adhère ou pas. Pas d'épanouissement réel. Les collaborateurs subissent et exécutent.

bad,"Good Company supporting hard working employees."
bad,"A typical day for me would incluce following up on outstanding insurance accounts. Each day I work different types of accounts to make sure I cycle thruoug my entire inventory of accounts. I also train new members to my team, lead team meeting and work with other staff to solve billing issues. "
bad,Dell is a good place to learn nw tjings but from career growth point of view its not a right company
bad,I have learned about healthcare and medical.
bad,"The site Equallogic - a very profitable take over, the support is second rate at best, budget for some departments then others starved. When they let people go they will make up reasons - take them to court and their lawyer doesn't even show as they never had a case. Such a pain in the behind. The people I worked with were great, the pay was good, the resources were limited and the expectations high. I think if the department was better managed it would have been better, but they kept saying ""budget"". They don't check job history and end up hiring people that can't do the work sometimes, makes it very hard on those that end up doing all the work. Best paying job I am glad to not have anymore."
bad,A typical day at work consist of handling at least 120 patients with billing and filing insurance claims for hospitals around the country.
bad,I came to EMC from a smaller company which was a mistake.  The PM roles is very marketing focused and not as technical.  I'm not sure what has occurred since they are now dell Dell but I don't think it got better.
bad,"Dell has an unstructured internship program. Evaluation criteria is loosely communicated and they pay more attention to their 1x1 meetings than to doing actual good work."
bad,"Understanding the concept of any product that is not given your immediate attention will be lost forever, with not another opportunity to fix or stop the assembly belt to finished productivity."

bad,Trabajo muy pesado y exigente pero se aprendia muchisimo.
bad,The people at your campus are great to work with. Had a good amount of great years there. High tech companies they come and go.  That is the main problem.
bad,"Everything is controlled by Manager who has no technical knowledge but interferes in everything which makes life difficult, wants to follow the same legacy coding techniques."
bad,"collaborative"
bad,"Great, fast paced, work environment. Very in depth 6 week training course. Unfortunately there is a very high turnover rate for management. Constant change in management and Constant change in the medical field was sometimes quite stress full and led to alot of time re doing things on what a previous manager said, When new management came in. Very low morale keeps things from being as productive as they could be as a whole."
bad,ótima administração boa e agradável pra se trabalhar

bad,"Easy job, good place to work long term, not much room for advancement, Could definitely use more recognition and  appreciation for the employees would be nice."
bad,"Long hours, no reward, always lay offs. There is not a lot of work life balance when it comes end of quarters. Management do not tend to reward their employees"
bad,The company has made major changes within the structure of operations due to merging with EMC. Currently my position consists of reviewing client project cases and performing Q/A tests.
bad,"Predominate focus on metrics and raising the bar - constantly.  Unrealistic goals - people were laid off frequently; many called this company ""Burn em and Turn em"".  I survived and thrived several years until the corporate direction changed and raised the bar.  Managers were losing opportunities to collect intellectual property and losing big $$ on the constant turn over.  The mindset was that for everyone sitting there - 3 or more were just waiting to take their place."
bad,"I was turned on to this position by a staffing agency, which accommodated the various technical certificates and security clearance required. "
bad,"I departed with the company shortly after the EMC acquisition. The people were great to work with and I had a great team. I decided to switch career paths, which led to my departure."

bad,"I worked at Dell when they were trying to get into the mobile consumer space. Unfortunately the company wasnt willing to invest in the necessary infrastructure or strategy and as a result it failed. I saw it coming and got out early. However, Dell as a whole is a great company it just wasnt a good fit for me at the time. This review is highly outdated and in speaking with friends the culture is different than when I was there."
bad,Good and pleasant place to work. Clean and spacious buildings which keeps you always cool to work. Freedom to work. Nice security all over inside the premises.
bad,This job was emotionally tasking. You were constantly being yelled at for 8 hours a day by irrational customers. This is ultimately why I left the company.
bad,Sold computers off a kiosk. Difficult management. Too much emphases on selling computers that customers did not need. Not focused enough on customer service.
bad,"Mostly great people to work with."
bad,"It is up to the management of the company to make employees feel good and motivated."
bad,The position I had was one where I could make it what I wanted it to be. With all of my previous knowledge of the business and other departments I was very successful in what I did. I implemented new processes to make our day to day tasks easier as well as saved the company hundreds of thousands or dollars.
bad,"Was a great company and would have rated 5 stars 8 years ago.  Now EMC management shows neither downward respect nor loyalty.  Released suddenly when my product's development and QA departments were shipped off to Russia and India.   "
bad,"My function at EMC is centered in Franklin MA. If you're there, there's a good old boy network of people that have been together for 15+ years. The company is entrenched in a set of legacy products which are starting to slump as technology changes. "
bad,Met alot of good people - but it was a contracted job that could end at anytime
bad,"mandatory overtime upwards of 20 hours per week.  Good perks, but very stressful."
bad,I have a lot of overtime but the experience I learn from them is to install and build computer they give me advantage on that. I wish I will a full time employee at dell so I can get my full benefit. The production company move to another state.
bad,Managers don't understand what it takes to write automation software; unreasonable expectations.  Some nice people though.
bad,"Dell is not for everyone, as it is a very competitive workplace, with little to no job work/life balance, depending on the dept and job that you would work in. "
bad,"Middle east office is ok to work in, but need improve in the culture. "
bad,"High expectations, significant changes, questionable business decisions."
bad,"Great people on the teams, but any ""people"" programs the company espouses are simply lip service. Managers are told to manipulate and outright lie to employees. Lack of ethical behavior and little integrity especially among senior leadership. Everything is about looking good for the VP. Peformance reviews are altered after the manager signs them to make the ""numbers"" work regardless of the performance of the individual and over the direct manager's objections."
bad,"Working in the technical support department of Dell EMC is as stressful and unfulfilling as just about any other service/retail/food job at minimum wage."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of my job was informing customers about new products. The hardest part was leaving. My co-workers were fun energetic people who helped the store reach goals as I helped them. I really learned how to be patient with management. The typical work day consisted of opening the store, inventory of display products, checking the merchandise, creating signs for promotions, sales, and closing the store."
bad,Zero tension.
bad,"flexible work schedule"
bad,"all the day are very active in this job, especially the weekends when customers are free to visit the showroom to choose the best choice. I learned how to answer their questions as well as the types of services the cars should go through in order to uphold for a long period of time. my management used to support with different training that guide us towards a successful sales, we were working as one team. the hardest part of the job when a customer complaints about a product, so we do explain the technical issues he / she may face in case of not being careful, but the most enjoyable part of the job is when achieve the target and make a good sale"
bad,Need to be professional. Routine work and do not appreciate change. Learned that compensation is not the only thing. Management needs to be more professional than being biased. Co-workers need to respect woman.
bad,"When i started working there it was a contract for another company dell was working with, so managers weren't too familiar either with this new company and its 900+ programs. when i first started we had back to back calls for several months. Also there wasnt a time limit on calls, until later it started to get shorter and shorter. .Also after a couple months alot more employees were hired, and the internet connection got worse and worse. The ticketing system locked up easily if you double clicked something, and the hourglass popped up after you filled in each box.. and you couldn't use words like no,not, or doesn't"
bad,"•	Built Relationships with Small Business customers to sell benefits of financing."
bad,A typical day at work included me taking between 20-60 calls depending on the day. My co workers are amazing. the hardest part of my job was learning stuff without being properly trained. the easiest part of my job was to make someone know that they were important.
bad,"From day one I was enjoyed to work at Dell. My co-workers and management are very co-operative and all together was we reached our targets. I was done my part very efficiently with quality. I learned a many things in team environment, How to behave and how to work and most important how to mange time in typical working days or at work deliver times."
bad,Very Good nature and attractive place to learn new things and it also very fun will be filled in the work place. The job nature is very Good in terms of very friendly environment
good,"My first mgr was only out for himself, then my next mgr was actually assisting in career developement, the last 2 mgr's back to only looking out for their career."
good,"EMC had an enormous in the race to develop the best and most advanced information Software in the Industry, and they were enormously successful.  The rest of the Industry caught-up, the dot com bubble burst, and the company simply became an unbearable place to work. I did learn a lot about hard work and discipline, but I also learned that leadership should treat people with respect and dignity."
good,"Just another IT services company."
good,"This job when I started was amazing. After they acquired a few companies their ethics because questionable. Management care not for the lives of their employees and do what they need to cover their own actions. The culture is ok, and the hardest part of the job is dealing with management and long thankless hours."
good,"I need to acheived the production and its my day to day activity."
good,"Took 2 months of interviews.  Ending up interviewing with the same manager twice.  Must have made an impression the second time.  They did that to almost every (+50 ish person there) very disrespectful.  Multiple times the manager would hire a young girl just out of college with no experience while doing the phone screen."
good,This was an extremely stressful environment.  Dell was a subcontractor and competed heavily to maintain this contract.  Often times expectations were unclear.  Very transient environment as people walked out or were fired daily.
good,"It's okay for freshers to start with thier jobs here."
good,Working five days a week from home using your home electric and internet without any compensation. Low salaries and very few increases. Remote staff work much harder than the regular staff with less pay.
good,"This is a great company for college grads but I would not recommend it to veteran sales reps.  The culture is immature, unprofessional, lacking.  This a great company for college grads as it will provide training and allow you to get the experience you need to advance.  Very political and close minded.  They teach that those that scheme and are unethical will advance.  There is no work/life balance.  You take a vacation you come back to 500 emails."
good,"Dell can be a very high stress.  Management tells you to get your work done.  They don't always give pay increases, preferring to have upper management bonus and billion dollar debt payments."
good,"I would not recommend tis job , it do not allow to grow in the company manager are very aggressive and are not willing to help to trained you so the job is self learning as you go"
good,"If you can manage the time there are a ton of documents, training materials (technical/sales/marketing/HR...) available internally. Awesome opportunity to learn."
good,After i finished my college dont know anything about bpo especially US  healthcare.but when i joint DELL my trainers are trained me so well. they take a total section in one month. really its very usefull for me. and then i started my carrer as a claim processor in dell and develop myself to become a claim adjudicator.

good,"Empresa tem um nome que cresce os olhos de quem não conhece. Mas cuidado, é preciso ter muita paciencia e aceitar o corporativismo da empresa para conseguir evoluir."
good,"Management didnt really care for the team I was on since we were technically a help desk and not making them money. "
good,Time Management is the most challenging part of the job. I enjoyed a good conversation with my customers as far as any kind of technical concerns or questions.
good,"I've heard of fun jobs that people have told me about at Dell, but working for Global Materials isn't one of them. The hours are horrendous, the management maintains a ""lean"" bandwidth which forces many people to work 12+ hr days and weekends. They tell you they'll advance you're job grade, but never do despite outstanding reviews. Not the place to go if you want to advance and have an actual life outside of work. Also, Dell talks about having their workforce working remote, GM does not support that at all and have very little flexibility."
good,On assignment in Honolulu HI was a nice place to work.  Per diem was ok but low other companies were paying $90 per day we got $50. Which is low in Hawaii.  Things are expenise.
good,Working for DELL was average.  The pay was not great but the benefits were ok my last manager was a disaster. Overall it was a pretty good company to work for

good,Have to start my day in data entry operator and have to finish it up as data entry operator. No better recogination or progression in this organization.
good,"Dell has taken the tech support call center and super sized it.  As an employee, you stop becoming a person and become a number.  All of your stats are recorded and you must fall in line with their expected numbers.  They do not pay much for an employees knowledge or experience, and they will openly agree that you should be paid more.  They just won't do it.  Trainers will tell you to use Dell as a stepping stone.  Get experience, then move on to a better place."
good,I enjoyed learning how computers and laptops were put together. There were times that the job was a little stressful because of a co worker leaving his post while I had to pick up their slack. Now talking to management about didn't matter since they turned a blind eye.
good,"This job was a very high stress, high pressure position. It entailed taking phone calls all day to help clients with an average call handle time of 7 mins per call where you had to solve the clients issue and move onto the next call. Documentation of a detailed log of the issue, actions taken and resolve and recording the call was also required to be finished within this time frame."
good,"The hardest part of the job is sales."
good,"Not having a good work environment. Job Security is not there. No Proper Growth. No Promotions for last few years, even no Increment for last to last year."
good,Chaotic environment void of leadership. Everyone was an individual contributor including management. Co workers were what ever they needed to be to protect their interest. The hardest part of the job was learning what to do next. No leadership. The most enjoyable part of the job was the autonomy.
good,"I worked at dell for 10 years both as an employee and temp. It was a great place to work in the begining before Michael Dell stepped away from running the day-to-day operations. When he stepped away he left people in charge that were incapable of running a global company which forced many to people in "
good,Production environment with closely audited review of work 
good,The majority of the individuals I worked with at Dell were friendly and outgoing. The most challenging part of the job was staying connected with fellow employees. I was a telecommuter for the duration of the job. It took a little while to get used to not seeing people in an office emvironment.
good,"Other departments seemed nice to work in, but their IT is very underpaid and overworked."
good,"Management really, really, really, sucks. Especially the whole documentation chain of management. They care nothing about the writers."
good,"Dell is an Austin staple. There are many opportunities for advancement and team exploration. They are very flexible with remote workers, cultivating a strong balance in that area."
good,"The company is undergoing a tough restructuring. No room for advancement. My co workers are nice, but my manager is a new manager who has never had that role before. Attrition rate is increasing each year. Job security is low in the support department."
good,Inept Bank team management.  Nepotism. No one manages client.  Team is consistently threatened with being fired for any human error.  Expected and literally told to be a robot.  We are told that the goal IS to replace us with robots.  Terrible morale.
good,It was such a bad experience I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy.  Politics play a huge role and if you're not liked by a team member they will sabotage you quick.
good,Great work experience opportunity for overview of  Budgeting/Planning/Marketing and Sales campaigns leads. The hardest part of this opportunity is sharing cubicle space.
good,Good company to work for but they certainly get their value for money out of you. Very long work hours and very little thanks for it. It is just expected to be part of your job.
good,"to much politics, Managers no leaders, no support, no support for multi cultural, none stop work, and you are at your own,"
good,"Dell cares about their employees, they strive to make the job comfortable and fun, as well as making sure the job is getting done. Need more encouraging factors when it comes to so much OT."
good,"EMC is a very competitive place to work. As with most corporation type companies.you are never sure, from one day to the next, what changes will take place within your field of employment.  Job security is non-existent."
good,"Steering the delivery of prediction models for Product software development projects on Big Data, Mobile, IoT, Cloud computing across systems management domain using Agile methodology"
good,"Work Place is Fun"
good,"Working in the consulting services was challenging because there were so many products to deal with it was difficult to get a consistent sales/presales engagement strategy.  Due to the high impact of storage sales, any next shiny thing would be placed in front of customer instead of looking at the whole relationship."
good,"Gained some knowledge about the field of printed media, the modus operandi of that involves the printing and the distribution of the weekly issue circulated in the particular area."
good,"There is a very serious lack of management in some divisions."
good,The Culture is lacking Trust.  Reps are battling each other or Access and hurting the bottom line. Non-existent Management Support to guys in the Field. Good luck to Dell.
good,"Dell is a good stepping stone for tech or sales minded individuals, however, the inability to advance, reduced headcount, lack of support, and bloated middle management teams have created an environment for poor moral for the majority of the current employees."
good,"Being a call center, work life at Dell is very different. Its havoc when you look all sides standing at a place. The managers are not professional. We dont get proper time to go and grab some lunch. The shifts are very hectic."
good,"There are different groups who work on different contracts. Your overall experience will directly correlate to the management on your contract.  As a whole, the company offers a lot of flexibility.  The customer and most of the coworkers are very enjoyable if you forge your own relationships regardless of other people's experiences."
good,"I leanred a lot while working on Dell. i almost spend 3 years here, management and coworkers all are  friendly and a good place to work . On Dell most enjoyable moments when we have team outings ."
good,Even when you work remote there is a lot of work to be done. Its nice to be able to work with people all over the world to get things done.
good,temp agency man power is a joke. the management at emc plays favorites with employees that have parents working there
good,"There is a lot pressure on agent level and fun work place."
good,"Dell's overall concept of doing business and ethics are above 90% of the companies, who's headquarters currently reside in USA. Being said that the actual individuals are selfish and looking to advance on any means necessary. If you are the Managers best friend telling him all he wants to hear you have a future. If you diligently do your job and think of the customer, you will stay exactly where you are, and if you make the top of the pay tier for you employment grade level, you will be replaced with two more that have no idea what to do."
good,"As a 5 year phone support engineer, was never rewarded for significant contributions or even acknowledged for these contributions. "
good,"Not anymore, the mix between Dell and Secureworks proved to conclude in a very low quality result. From a mature management focused on quality it became superficial management focused on volume with no regards to quality or care for customer experience."
good,Poor accountability of management / procedures.
good,"I worked for Dell for about one year , its was through a temp agency. I wasnt really working for Dell . I was working for Adecco...I enjoyed working at Dell learning to keep to lines running and making sure to keep lines stock up with materials. If we run out of materials in the ""market"" we had to ""steal it"" from another line.Before we do that we had to let shipping know that we are running out of materials. I also enjoyed working there cause it was a clean enviroment."
good,"fixing software issues, remove computer viruses and spyware."
good,I have a rather negative and bias opinion of the management & work environment here so I’d like to elect to just keep my mouth shut.
good,Rough economic times and downsizing made Dell an undesireable place to be.
good,Great co-workers. Some willing to advance by walking over you after stabbing you in the back. When things get into a hurry-up mode forget quality and customer's best interest. PMs are not the brighest. projects created and finished using tunnel vision. Managment can blindside you after getting good review. Dell is metric-centric not merit-centric
good,I was a chasis intergration team member we worked in groups of six and assembled the motherboard at a rate of 72 motherboards a hour.I liked the job and the people i worked with.
good,"Just like any big company, they pay pretty well, but they seem to have all normal issues big companies have."
good,Dell did not care about the employees . They were all about the numbers.
good,"Revenue goals drive almost every aspect of the business, cross departmental interactions are difficult, technical support is spotty and overworked. Great co-workers."
good,"Comp plan is decent and you practically have to not show up to get fired but they could care less if you have to work 50+ hours a week to get your job done. Very political and very much a good ole boys club. Management completely clueless about the work and needs of their Project Managers and the Team Leads show favoritism and treat all others like outsiders. For an IT company the tools essential to your job are an embarrassment. On any given day at least one tool/system is broken, down or malfunctions."
good,"Atmosphere differs on department. Remote managers not ideal, if manager is remote, less likely to be promoted. "
good,"The executive team communicate effectively on the overall plan and strategy, providing a direction for the company. Sometimes the work gets lost in the shuffle and it is difficult to remain aligned to cross functioning groups trying to execute on individual workflows."
good,I have worked for Dell twice. In my most recent position I was a remote employee. My requests were often ignored and the general consensus of most of the people I worked with was one of being overworked and underpaid.
good,"Okay place, cares only about profit and not employees."
good,Need more transparency in the organization. Work life balance was not there and career growth was stagnant. On top of this there was lot of unrealistic targets and lot of work pressure as well.
good,"If you want to work with Dell, you need to be offshore or in the Greater Austin area. Former EMC employees - nearly 60,000 of them - are nearly gone. And the company has no true desire to hire in the Greater Boston area - no matter what they tell you. Career advancement requires that you be in Greater Austin or offshore."
good,I've learned to be flexible to changing work dynamics.  Sometimes there is no typical day.  Every day is different and that makes going to work exciting.  The people I work with are wonderful.  I have made numerous friendships throughout the company and will treasure them always.
good,"It pays the bills but it's a grindy, competative, political job in a call center that is far more stressful than it should be, but it pays you and that's that."
good,"The work ethic is among the worst I have ever experienced.  It will take a complete"
good,"My experience was horrible but I don't think it was indicative of a normal experience with Dell.  I was hired by EMC as part of a small batch of employees which were given a verbal agreement of salary following a 3 month training period.  EMC failed to honor the agreement claiming that they were not aware of any such program (keep in mind that there were 30 of us, all with the same understanding).  Once Dell took over we no longer had any recourse, needless to say, attrition was high."
good,"Management are sub-standard in certain areas. Employee's are not treated fairly in some respects."
good,"A good learning environment."
good,Its very good brand name but not in the benefits like Salaries or like Benefits like cabs or some other. Very worst management with no value for working
good,"Dell is a great place to learn how to develop your skill sets and develop your goals and never give up. Your team can be critical and you will rely greatly on them for the answers and support you will need in the stepping stones to your success. At first it will seem overwhelming but you must remember the hardest part to life and anything you do is just show up - 70% of succeeding is just showing up, writing you name on the exam can be 70% of the passing the test, and that is what you will get from your team and mentors at Dell - They want you to succeed."
good,I enjoyed helping customers with their life insurance and I had wonderful relationships with my co-workers. We could always learn more and had the support from our management team.
good,"The people are the main reason I have stayed.  I work with amazing smart talented and creative people every day at my level.  Unfortunately even an amazing manager and teams aren't enough to make me stay any more. Since the latest deal with EMC, the stress level has increased, the employment uncertainty is higher, and while you can do things at a company this size that you cannot do anywhere else, the work-life balance and sense of fun isn't there any more in my division."
good,This company had no compassion for contract workers. Gave no advance notice that a lay off was coming up and just get a phone call that there's no work the next day and sorry.
good,"Dell EMC is a good place for starters to learn how to deal with environment, customers and learn the top technologies."
good,"The area of Dell I work for is a good group. The pay is good, especially for this state. The benefits are ok, healthcare is pretty bad  unfortunately that seems to be the standard. Management is ineffective at their jobs. However the top leadership and the product is good, if the middle mangers could get out of the way."
good,"Gained extensive experience in VMware VM. I worked from A to Z supporting the enterprise network of legacy Force10 Networks. Desktop, laptops, Servers, firewalls. Data Center Hardening"
good,"Hi, I worked in this company very bad managers and no hike and no facilities in this company, before joining they told it is Dell but it is not Dell, actually it's a ntt data ,worst company"
good,"Reorganizations and layoffs are common. It is stressful to push hard, do your job and hope for the best.  "
good,"Not the worst, major mistake was trying to tell a Software company how to sell software...Dell sold off the SW company formerly known as Quest at a loss. Had they allowed Quest to just be Quest, things would have worked out much better.,."
good,I really grew professionally during this position.  I went from a temp to perm to a promotion.  Spearheaded a sales blitz team to assist the Atlanta market.
good,"No long term visibility."
good,I learned a lot about US Healthcare and the management is good and the hardest part of the job is target which is so tough to ensure and the most enjoyable part of the job is co-workers.
good,"EMC has always been a very good company to work for but now EMC has been acquired by Dell computer, therefore is planning many layoffs due to cost cutting."
good,"Very sales driven company with targets getting tighter every period until the customer complains. "
good,"Great first start, but there is no job security here after the Dell acquisition.  Typical day was testing the new ERP system."
good,"Bueno Pues mi dia tipico de trabajos Checar cuanto servicioas  hay hacer una ruta, llamar al usuario para agendar cita y terminar la visita."
good,Good if you want to settle in same profile on what you joined. No career growth and salary revision. Not challenging and same routine work.
good,"Management is poor, schedule varies constantly, and no benefits of hard work. The only thing good about working for this company was when it was time to go home and that it was only 3 days a week."
good,"Face-paced environment, with high expectations from team. Team mates are good to work with, dedicated to providing quality product to the customer."
good,"Typical Day: Meeting with Architecture management"
good,"A typical day starts at least 15 minutes before your scheduled shift to start up your computer and log into the phones.  You were expected to have all this done before you ""Clocked"" in.  You were given no wrap-up time between calls to finish notes.  If you weren't on break or at lunch you had someone messaging you asking why you had the phone on pause."
good,some days productive work and other days no work and sitting around. we are here to do a job. so if there no work why are we here. You only come to work to do one thing and that to make money period.
good,"Dell has some strong points and weak points just like all companies."
good,"- My days consist of meeting with customers, prospects, peers and business partners.  "
good,be a great place to work again once they know where they are going.
good,"I didn't enjoy one day here.  No training for the job.  No direction from management.  The only words of encouragement came from the customers I helped.  I worked weekends and 70 hour weeks for their ""projects"" and lost my job when these last cuts came.  I'll never work for this company again, ever."
good,"GOOD place to work."
good,"IT at Tufts is a fast paced environment where you can cut your teeth on a variety of different applications and departments (clinical, administrative, research, etc).  You are able to learn very fast but personal development can be a challenge.  Management caters to the business first and the people a very distant second, which is understandable in a competitive market but this can create high turnover when the talented people would rather focus on long-term goals.  The squeaky wheel gets the grease at Tufts, so be prepared to fend for yourself."
good,"very casual work atmosphere.  friendly co workers.hglhbhb.jkb,m.n.jnbhlvkgtckhjvbnmbhj.n.lhblb.jkbkutv,chgj,kgcgh,hfhjgkcmghjkhjgtghvcgftcmhfjg,futyhk"
good,"Typical day results in high volume inquiries with scheduling interviews, interacting with candidates, clients, recruiters, executive level to confirm status of pending work. Fast paced environment and need to have a strong attention to detail, great multitasking skills a must .Management has taught me to push back  professional manner and to take lead on my own intuition and go with it. Hardest part, not being able to be effective when not given necessary information to get initial task done quickly, therefore causing delays due to me having to go back and do the homework for the person giving the task. enjoyable, being successful because everyone will see that."
good,good company.
good,"Typical day was come in, see what sales are going on, make sure on every call we maximize potential sales without being pushy to customers, and try and make our quota."
good,"if you join in Dell as a regular employee, it would be good place to work."
good,SellI.T. products to other businesses. meet and exceed monthly quotas. Make outbounds to assigned accounts.
good,"As a company.... Dell is a fun work environment. Problem is, they are moving away from manufacturing. So, the job is a temporary job. No chance of being hired on. But, if you prove yourself and your skills. The managment will do everything they can to keep you around."
good,If you want to succeed at dell inc you must give up your life you will make a lot of money when you do
good,"During my seven years assembling computers for Dell, I worked more 70-hour weeks than 40-hour weeks. Then the bottom fell out of the desktop market (just as they opened a massive plant in North Carolina). Now much of the manufacturing is outsourced. I'm sure they'll squeeze the life out of the remaining employees for whatever work remains north of the Rio Grande."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Dell but the management was not very inclusive to new employees.  Most of the employees had been there for 20+ years when I and another person began there in 2012."
good,Nice for learner you can make change to under the technology part if you want to analyze with bulk data u can easily learn lot of area to check your capabilities.
good,"Standard support environment, though innovation is encouraged. These innovations immediately become the property of the company, and must undergo several approval steps prior to implementation."
good,"Dell EMC has the same problems as most every other tech company in Austin, everyone in management has no clue or just doesn't bother doing their job. The teams all seem to be built on favoritism and back stabbing. Rinse repeat."
good,"ótimos beneficios e salário, porém péssima gerencia e falta de ética, como por exemplo, abre a vaga, ""promoçaõ"" fazem processo seletivo, mais na verdade já tem a pessoa pra vaga, o funcionário que se esforça para subir não tem valor, somente por afinidade."
good,Its kind of job that give you some hours to work with myown car and also not enough hours to work and not enough days. So i decided to continue with them only in emergency calls.
good,Contract work you are just a number. Told to not work over 40 hours but have no choice to get the job done yet when you go to leave early on Friday hiring company frowns upon it. In two weeks I have work 10.5 hours over and will never get paid for it.
good,Velocity is fast but manageable.  Expectations are high and thrilling. I enjoyed working on the various project teams and my co-workers.  Idea exchange is great.  The bad experience I had was that I had 4 different managers in the last 6 months I worked there and the last one was politically hiring who he wanted on his team.
good,"I had 4 weeks paid vacation, 2 weeks personal time off, and 1 week off at Christmas.  "
good,"Dell is a good company overall. However, there are many challenges needing addressed. Senior leadership is very closed off and rarely communicates with anyone outside of their pay grade. Advancement is very much based on who you know thusly making it difficult to move around within the company. Dell prides itself on a diverse culture but when I look around, I rarely see anyone of color in leadership positions."
good,no appreciation for new ideas   do what you are told and do not question even as a Sr. director.  I want to be held accountable for decisions.   Not people making the rule and forcing to follow
good,"mostly hire friends and not merit based promotions.  Lots of HR rules to keep salaries down and limit promotions.  Can't change jobs within 18 months of earning a new role, Regardless of experience you aren't allowed to promote 2 levels for a new job you've interviewed and gained, can't get a promotion within your current role regardless of experience,"
good,Worked as a contractor for 14 months. Work was ok. Did not like the non-casual dress code. I would not work there again.Thats just my opinion.Nothing else to write. Let me out of this page.
good,Working at Dell is a great experience but raises and promotions are very scarce! You have to move departments or companies to sniff anything above a 3% yearly increase. First focus is always cutting cost above anything else. Lots of people are forced out or leaving on their own and whoever is left takes on the load with no extra perks/compensation.
good,"Too much uncertainty after working 25 years for EMC, No feed back from management on current project situation. Only limited current cash making projects were getting feedback. Future potential projects were lacking recognition and that scares the hard workers."
good,"As a former longtime employee, the culture shifted dramatically from ""do what it takes"" and ""do the right thing"" to ""get it done"".  Doing the right thing became ambiguous, depending on the leadership and manager.  In my organization, it was more like ""get it done now, and we'll let you know how we like it"".  Management churn (I had four managers in two years)  I would not want to work in services again, but sales would be a good place."
good,"Target based work which we need to achieve on daily basis, if we missed then we need to stay back to achieve the target. Data entry based work, hence moved out of the company for my carrier improvement."
good,Was there very briefly. Position was eliminated because I was hired during merger. Was brought back for another contract. But overall not a bad place to work.
good,"A typical day at work is very busy and I always have something to do. I have learned to have more attention to detail with my work, as well as problem solving. The workplace is quiet and coworkers are friendly. Management could use some work; they are overwhelmed. The hardest part of the job is the 6-day work week. The most enjoyable parts of the job are the data entry, and learning the new pins to enter the data."
good,Dell has a unique work environment that allows you to work from home considerably.  The work / life balance needs improvement.  Some managers are not very supportive of commitments outside of work.
good,"The call center I was at was great and most of the management I worked for really did care about their people, but the over all management from higher up didn't really care much. Our call center was closed with no advance warning. We all came to work one day, just to be told we were all laid off, and had 2 minutes to get our stuff and get out of the building."
good,"Underpaid for role in Silicon Valley based on other tech companies. Poor management executing decisions with no direction. During EMC acquisition, absolutely no job security with organization restructure occurring almost quarterly."
good,Dell was very fast paced and stressful.  It was in the front of the pack for online sales.  My job was the small business online marketing and content manager.  Great if you're single.  Not great if you have a family you want to see before dark.
good,"poor management"
good,"Its not a great place to work . "
good,"Due to temporary job, there was not any benefit and no incentive to employees to stay in Dell. Most employees plan their future to work somewhere else."
good,"I relocated from SC to support special projects that would have me traveling to do site migrations. When the projects dried up, so did my job. I'm now stuck in GA without a job and no way to pay bills."
good,Left soon after Dell arrived and from what former colleagues tell me the atmosphere is not very good. Probably need to wait a year or two until Dell is done letting people go.
good,"Was fun until they moved all the leadership to the US.  Limited advancement opportunities and little to no Canadian employee support. Good people, but too many collapsed jobs and stressed employees."
good,"Office location is generally tricky to get to via public transport.  Fast paced environment with possibility to advance your career if desired. While supporting servers may be what you were hired to do, the case logging can be more involved than the case itself."
good,"Hunting for new Business."
good,"Pay is very good. But, the new culture with EMC reflects EMC more than it did Dell.  The Dell culture reflected more of an entrepreneur's spirit and the new culture is one of get the PO or your out culture."
good,"Prior to the sale, Dell striped all our bonuses and perks stating we did not provide enough support towards the corporate income.  Then 6 months later told us they were selling us.  Once they made the decision to sell they cared little about us and the jobs we performed."
good,Company has a good vision and growth but do not think about employee career development and beliefs only in transaction.If you are lucky enough than you can expect hike or promotion.
good,I believe a lot has changed since i left the organization                                                                                            .
good,Since this was my first company. Had learnt a lot through different acquaintances. However due to severe night shifts per my job description had to leave this company.
good,"Dell was a very recognizable place to work, everyone knows about it. The atmosphere was very laid back, we weren't worried about going under or not having work to do, so everyone just kind of did their own thing at their own pace. This led to a lot of unmotivated or uninterested people at all levels of management."
good,"Good work and projects, some very good people. Decent work and life balance."
good,"Feel like I choose the good company but management is hopeless."
good,"As a support agent you face a constant barrage of customer abuse.  Rarely will you work with a pleased or even thankful customer.  Satisfaction comes from knowing you were able to address and solve highly complex computer failures.  Unfortunately most computer failures are due to software issues, malware, or minimal user experience.  Job security is poor with many, many layoffs and firings not for cause.  Many positions replaced with foreign visa workers.  Many American jobs lost to overseas positions."
good,Learnt a.lot about medical billing. The environment is kept neat always . There is no work pressure. The only problem is no appreciTions or incentives.
good,Work is minimum.They do not pay you for the holidays and do not allow you to make up the time. The positive is that you get paid every week.
good,"Your sales job at Dell will pay the bills but you better be prepared to be ""Mr. Average"" if you want to advance: It's rare to see bright lights go far -you're more likely to see advancement given to folks that fit in with the less imaginative, less creative crowd who are simply steady and who do not rock the boat."
good,"Good pay, but you go into this job knowing that you have hit the proverbial ceiling."
good,"Slow to move and adapt. Complacency and stagnation. In terms of work-life balance, texts over the weekend were a regular feature."
good,"Contractors are second class employees, understand that and you'll do fine."
good,This company has been sold 3 times while I have been employed.  These acquisitions have had benefits and faults for my position. We have had multiple management reorganization which had a heavy impact on my job also.
good,"Had great coffee shop, Starbucks, inside Dell. Management was too focused on data reports and none of the databases were integrated."
good,"There is not enough transparency into the numbers given out that directly pertain to the sales makers attainment.  Reporting is consistently incorrect yet one is to have faith that they are being paid properly.  Anytime you ask management for clarity, it gets pushed to the back burner and no answer/resolution is every given."
good,It's fantastic people but I didn't care of the company.  I was laid off so it hurt my opinion of them.  Direction will be challenged with Dell merger.
good,While Dell is an ok company to work for ( I haven't been employed with them very long) this is not a position I would have applied for willingly.  My job at BCBSRI was outsourced so I had to take this job or be left unemployed.  I wish I would have come to the company under other circumstances and with the Corporate Dell and not Dell Services.
good,"The office was laid back place the people was laid back overall good , was high pace sometimes, but overall was fun it was also temp"
good,"it is great company to begin your career."
good,There was a lack of guidance and training but that actually helped me push myself and learn more from others. I would approach people and asked them to share their knowledge and expertise with me and combined with my strengths I was able to bring more value to the company.
good,"Challenges at work place with management who are not supportive in addressing processes and tools issues to handle consulting service infrastructure business. "
good,I was working in the inbound part of the warehouse supplying the line with parts to keep production going .The managment was ok but thay could know more about the employee
good,"Sales specialists placed into salary based positions so working anywhere from 8-10 hrs 5-6 days weekly. I worked as 3 positions during my time there. Assistant manager, Store manager and Regional team leader. The hardest part of this job was having upper management tell employees of raises, commissions and bonuses that never got paid out to anyone. The most enjoyable part of this position was building the #1 sales team in the entire Eastern region out of 50 locations."
good,EMC  had a good work life balance . The people  I worked with where very intelligent and easy to work with. I would work with some of these people again.
good,"Dell, i think wanted Perot's IT department and not so much the Revenue Cycle part of it. I think that's why they sold that portion of the business."
good,"I work in a fast pace environment dealing with issues from around the globe.  I have learned how to better integrate technology and be a better leader. "
good,"Pros:"
good,"I joined dell with high expectations but it hasn't fulfilled my expectations."
good,"Nice Work-life balance."
good,The hardest part of the job was traveling.  I had to leave my family for 3-4 days at a time.
good,"Responsible for answering incoming calls, identifying the problems  and directing the calls to the proper department."
good,"All day is very typical"
good,"The work environment is very interesting. Change is very good for any organization to ensure you don't grow stagnant and fall behind the competition. Change should always be strategic and well thought out. "
good,good & ppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
good,"If you are a college passout and would like to work in a company that offers a challenging and competitive work environment, This one's for you. "
good,Dell was not all that great company to work for. Contract to hire means once your year is up you need to find something else. I felt like it was a revolving door policy. Micro-management of teams killed the enjoyment of the job. It payed well but after long the job ran out after a year and they told you had to wait to be rehired.
good,Lots of hours each week 70+ management tough on family/work.
good,"Sales Representative "
good,"If you are willing to risk the transformation of the company from public to private and ""box seller"" to true solutions provider, you could potentially have a great career there.  The best part of the job is the amazing people (though fewer these days) you get to work with and learn from.  The most difficult part of the job, outside of the potential work/life balance issues, is dealing with the lack of long term strategy and vision.  The company has stated publicly that re-organization is not a strategy but it continues to be one of the only consistent strategies they have."
good,The facility I worked at closed its doors due to workforce reduction through labor trade. It was a nice job to have while it lasted.
good,"Dell is a true churn and burn operation. Dell does not take care of the people who take care of it. "
good,"this is a great place to start right out of school and get some experience, great resume builder."
good,"Don't let the informal attire of the employees in this office fool you; they are every bit as professional as you'd expect from a highly competitive tech/communications company. Management sets very high standards for their subordinates, strive for results, and in most cases are not disappointed; Dell hires very high caliber employees. The training is excellent and employees can hold their heads high when it comes to their proficiencies. "
good,"Need to be self motivated."
good,"Excellent benefits. Extremely poor, UN-trained, inexperienced management."
good,"Dell has a decent culture and some great people with a load of management that does not add value. The company is a pile of silos each vying to make a name and not trying to unify process, thus the content at Dell is completely broken as no one manages it or cares about the customer user experience. The work at home policy rules. Time for Dell to go private and clean house, not sure Michael Dell can do it. Work there now at your own risk."
good,"Hard to get promoted unless you know someone, work can be non-challenging. Middle management are line managers when they should be leaders."
good,"Great learning environment.  Company with strong work ethic.  I've been working there for 14 years.  A typical day is managing customer visits, pipeline and positioning solutions for our customers."
good,"This job did not give me a opportunity to where I can show my skills and hopefully move up in the company, since it was temporary work . "
good,Often time feels like close rate comes before customer service. It seems that there is no best practices to better serve the customer in making sales and services choices without need of a sales person (i.e. cluttered website). The Website is confusing to navigate for customers and sales agents. As a sales rep you must to a multitude of tools to sell solutions to the customer. This makes for a longer than necessary process to completing customer orders and providing quick solution to customer satisfaction issues. The mix of sales tools also makes for keeping up with customer history near impossible.
good,Dell Healthcare had outstanding benefits for their employees
good,awesome place to work just not alot of security
good,"Dell is a good company to start your sales career but if your experienced and coming in late in your career its a deadend. Very tough to get into the ""inner circle "" which consists of the Austin Mafia. More than performance time at Dell matters."
good,LVR: Customer service oriented operator/live voice response.
good,Very relaxed dress code. Lots of compressed training. Intense
good,Focus on Work
good,"it is a laboratory based company, they deal with calibration,"
good,"High energy fast paced environment, customer requirements and order completion as our daily goal. Driven to meet on time shipping constrains with quality hands on inspected consumer products. Derived satisfaction in knowing our stated cost per box was met, in addition to the end product(s) were developed and produced as expected. ""A satisfying day of employment."""
good,"It will not matter how hard you work, the numbers will still crush you."
good,"Service Delivery at Dell EMC / Mahadevpura / Bangalore.P"
good,"Energy and morale in Hopkinton is low since the acquisition by Dell.  Benefits are not as good, opportunities for growth are nearly non-existent unless you are are Headquarters."
good,"Te cierran puertas en pleno trabajo, dificultando el empleo."
good,"They provided all the proper tools x to 0 to succeed at your job. Just if you have issues with like having ADD or ADHD, it's not the best option. Loved my trainer and co workers.  They were awesome."
good,ok nothing great Job Work/Life Balance Compensation/Benefits Job Security  /Advancement      Management no friendly happy place low feel ok nothing great
good,"Money was bad, managers terrible and rude, long hours, and most of the people I know left for the same reasons, like I said, might be different now, so good luck,"
good,"Full night shifts"
good,"Nice place to work , good environment .	"
good,Work is relatively easy and workplace environment is friendly. There is some overtime but not frequent and usually voluntary. Hard to get hired permanently.
good,Employees are generally happy to work at Dell.  Salary compensation was somewhat up to industry standards.  Dell offers company Cell phones to remote employees.  Dell offers adequate Medical coverage to their employees in the US.
good,"De très beaux produits dont on est fiers de faire la promotion. "
good,"While Dell has a lot to offer (the good) - remote work options and a 401k match of 6% dollar for dollar being at the top of the list (in the US) - the culture is one of way too much work for too few people (the bad). And this effects almost everyone (the ugly) in spite of proclaiming  to provide a balanced work/life culture  - leadership, managers, etc. So it's like there's no one you can complain to because you're all in the same boat. Expect things to get worse now that they've gone public again..."
good,"Since the company caters to US Market, expect the work to be in Night. Also, be ready to serve more than 10 hours as there are some stingent targets to meet."
good,"Due to recent changes to the way we do business, there is limited structure and lack of definition of roles and responsibilities. In effect we duplicate some tasks and leave others not completed."
good,"Dell was my first real job and I worked with them for over 10 years. They taught me a lot about the business and gave me numerous opportunities. However, the company changed over the years and, longer you stay, more you realize they truly suck all your energies. The extreme tight deadlines, very hard goals and work days that can go over 12 hours it's okay for someone starting their careers, but for someone with years in the market and who is looking for work life balance, it can be very hard and take you to a mental break."
good,Multinacional onde os gestores são distantes de seus colaboradores
good,"Just like any large corporation that undertakes a merger (with EMC), changes are bound to happen and you need to be prepared to adapt and embrace/deal with such changes."
good,"The firm was reasonably good to work for but is really top heavy with sales people. if you were not booking time against a project, you were vulnerable. which is strange because as a consultant, you are not responsible for sales"
good,"Empresa boa de se trabalhar, oferece um bom salário diferente das demais empresas do ramo, porém existe dificuldade em crescimento interno pois infelizmente existe muita amizade entre operadores e gerência, o que se leva em consideração na hora da promoção do funcionário. Gerentes e líderes sem muito preparo para lidar com pessoas (exceto um). O ambiente é descontraído e é um bom lugar pra se trabalhar com ótimos benefícios."
good,"I felt that my contribution to my position was positive, but it was always a challenge, because the corporate focus was not always clear. There is always an opportunity to learn."
good,They have shut down their center in Edmonton. This is no longer a valid place of Employment. Good to work for while I was there. Very little information given to employees by managment
good,Worked 4 x 10 hour shifts. Decent workplace culture. No room for advancement in current department. Call center environment with dedicated break times.
good,"Learnt a lot from everyone, my shift starts at 9am. They have odd rest day( sunday and monday). Management can be improved, mainly chinese, chinese grow easily while malays and indians will remain the same even after few years. The hardest part of the job is the management do not appreciate the workers, and the most enjoyable part of the job is going back home"
good,Most days 9-5. Flexibility to work from home and leave as needed. Some amount of freedom to pick work / initiatives. Some amount of politics and and ambiguity on decision making.
good,Difficult place to work at due to the nature of the job.  Associates definitely take too much heat for customer call back that was not part of issue resolved.
good,"Accuracy of data was far from expected, however changes made improvements. Most managers only cared about making numbers look good, versus team and being a leader. No team spirit with constant manager changes and quarterly changes to role."
good,"salary is ok, however job security is bad and the management is lost  the vision of future development, since the market is shifting from tradition SAN to cloud and virtualization, the company act slowly."
good,"Dell call their first line managers ""directors"", so they think they really are directors.  Most wouldn't last 2 minutes in a real company.  The good ones tend to leave.  The place is bogged down with conflicting metrics and constantly changing priorities.  The arrogance is thick in Dell mgmt , direction is poor and nepotism is rampant.  Successful employees are folks who like to play the game and are good at schmoozing.  Pay and benefits are good, and mgmt makes very good money.  "
good,The company has gone through many name changes and is now owned by a different holder. The management was good and tried to work with you. Pay was poor with minimal raises or bonuses.
good,Company continues to optimize post the largest IT merger in history.  This presents a very uncertain future for the company and employees contributing to the high stress environment.
good,"Dell in Taiwan is a good place for ""Work life balance"" compare with others in Taiwan."
good,"Dell decided to get intop the Healthcare business, but I don't believe they understood it and eventually they sold our division and got back out of it.  I never thought they had a grasp of this industry."
good,"Being the first job at a Call Center is a taboo for majority of the population in India. But for me, this is what helped me into becoming an extrovert. I started communicating with Customers from UK and Ireland over phone. We were taught all the soft skills of the book to deal with all kinds of customers. Together, we had all the tools to supplement our primary job."
good,I like the flexible work schedule and employees can work from home occasionally.  People are generally nice and treat each other with respect.  Dell doesn't invest in R&D.
good,I am a EMC employee now working for dell so I can only comment on more the EMC side of things. I think Dell is great overall just the group I am in has some issues.
good,"Since the Dell takeover, everything is about cutting cost."
good,"Good place to learn but not grow.  Poor promotions or pay increase, however work life is good if you enjoy working remotely.  Too much middle management."
good,"Management was unorganized and wasn't wiling to work with anyone  who had a medical issue come up with not time built up, such as a car wreck, an accident on their property, etc."
good,Most managers are willing to work with employees to figure out how to give them the time they need to be effective. That being said it seems to be hard to advance in this company. They ask for volunteers for management but do not seem to take them or they promise members will get management postions and don't. It also seems that our pay is lower then industry standard..
good,Overworked and  under trained in an environment of 75% contractors who were woefully under paid. There was no real training except for required warranty training on Dell Products. Skillsoft training hard vary limited titles pertaining to IT. Quit paying for being on the on-call rotation.
good,"Good company to work with, get to learn new things everyday. Managers are very cooperative. Understand your needs and help you grow in your carrier. Do not feel the pressure of work as you have fun while working."
good,Decent environment to start a career in the cybersecurity industry. Stuck in antiquated corporate frame - not much room to be creative and grow from a personal perspective.
good,"Completely cut throat and gloomy. I don't recommend this place to anyone looking for a happy environment to work in. Pay is good, that's about it.  Good luck!"
good,"Management hardly advrkers of what goings on in terms of of what will affect employment etc. did not get any opportunity for career improvement, manager very secretive about company direction"
good,I took traveling assignment with Dell got to meet people form all over the states.  Management was not so well but had a good team lead. Learn net skills. The hardest part of the job is when the assignment is when it ended.
good,"Quick-paced work environment. Worked with a great group of coworkers. Dell provided an excellent training program that provided me with skills I still use to this day. "
good,"Everyone will tell you great 1st and 3rd job. Impossible to make solid raises without leaving and coming back..""Build your brand"" is more important than just about anything they will say. However, checking the box will definitely make your manager look good and help keep one out of the hot seat."
good,The merger has made it a difficult and stressful work environment as many thing continue to change on a daily basis.  Coming from the legacy EMC side the Dell Team works in a much more transactional way than we did at EMC.
good,Good work life balance. Work culture is very informal. No professional approach to process & employee development. Salary hike & bonus will not beat even inflation year to year basis.
good,"Company is very disorganized since buyout by NTT Data."
good,"Dell EMC is a huge technology giant in the world."
good,"I entered employment with the hopes of using my 14 years on management experience into a better position with Dell. However I realized there was no interest in helping me get a promotion much less a raise over a period of 5 years. My pleas for help went on deaf ears. I was only able to get a .65 cent raise in pay over a 5 year period. Health care benefits got worse almost every year and I just figured out there was no way I had a career there. By buying power was reduces every year I remained and my health care needs just were practically non existent."
good,I've worked twice for EMC which is now Dell and both times I have been laid off.  When layoffs occur the people let go don't seem to be the right ones in that a lot of talent is discarded.
good,"The work environment completely depends on the project that has been assigned to the employee, There is big amount of the cTC as variable that we cannot expect to get."
good,"As Customer service in Dell International "
good,I want trainee and job in network security ... I am hard working person .... I happy work dell company . I open to work in any hour . I always obedience
good,Dell is a challenging and wide growth company. they do allow promotions but strive on numbers and calls. Over all the company really try's to allow you to grow As soon as possible.
good,"Management is lacking engagement in all aspects, worries go unheard and issues go unresolved. Management needs to be more involved with the day to day."
good,Manager would not let you be creative and was not flexible about any aspects of my job.  Advancment was not an option and accounts moved without notice every other quarter.
good,Change is constant at Dell. Should know how to deal with ambiguity and be adept at managing changes. Good work life balance and flexible work culture but compensation is not what the Industry offers
good,"Fast pace enviroment, long hours, but overall a  very stable company to work for.  advancement is there as long as you put forth the effort.  work/ homelife balance is not there."
good,"Good work / life balance"
good,"Dell offers great pay and was offering great medical benefits however that has changed in the past two years.  No room for growth, limited opportunities for advancement."
good,"Got good exposure in VMware."
good,"Joined as fresher in the team. learned many new things like how to make balanced life culture, to be bold in approaching the senior management."
good,"Company was once a symbol of dominance and stability in the data storage and protection market, only to have lost its way in the cloud-era and letting its process-heavy culture prevent it from getting back on track in time."
good,"I found working for Dell to be fun and entertaining.  The people you work with are amazing, and unique!  Working for Dell made me a different person."
good,In the position I held it required sitting at a desk with 2 computers and taking the unapplied payments from one screen and applying them to customers accounts
good,Management is top-heavy and does not have a workable plan for change.  Change occurs as a repeat of ineffective policies and additional layers of middle management.
good,My team was phenomenal. Management is not the greatest. It is difficult to move within company. Explanations are not offered.
good,"Will be happy to discuss my job requirements and daily tasks upon receiving an interview for future job prospects."
good,"Poor management. No recognition on work performed. Things roll down heal when things don't go right, even when it's not your fault. Training wasn't the best."
good,"work as residential engineer is very tuf job in EMC, if client not allowed to learn new things some time. Singapore culture is not good"
good,"I was contracted through another IT staffing company, but the location was at Dell. Management was okay, but the hours were not."
good,"one of the largest data storage company's in the world, about 60k employees world wide.  Great experience and training, Lots of great people and good work environment"
good,"Though I haven't worked there in five years, when I did it was a good place to work.  Their focus has turned to business process output so  if you goal is software development this may not be for you."
good,Worked there for a summer internship. The culture seemed to be very difficult to get things done in a timely fashion. The internship was very unstructured.
good,Good from Salary point of view but bad for job security.. ..  If you are self motivated than you will get rewards.. Bad HR policies.. Lacks in transparency..
good,"It was a great experience to be involved with this company, I had first hand experience on what it would be like if I pursued this career."
good,"Everyday is a learning, with Some great people and great minds."
good,Co-workers were great people who shared their knowledge.  They were not afraid to help when problems arose and help fix whatever was needed.
good,"Dell is an awsome place to work, there is immense growth opportunities, but the package they offer for experience and tenured people are less as compared to the market, but this is a place for freshers to learn a lot about corporate life and much learning"
good,"Pros: benefits were fine including health insurance. Great discount on health insurance from wellness program. "
good,"The Dell consumer sales dept is the ground floor of the company, however it is the dept that brings in the most revenue. There is a lot of work and very little consideration of you as a person much less a person who is looking for a solid career. You're just a number to them at the very end. Again, there is a lot of work and if you can cope and succeed you'll make good money. Most management/team leads do not care about you, they just care about advancing themselves and their career. The team coaches however are gold as individuals, they go out of their way to help you succeed and help you get to the next level of the company. The coaches have compassion because not long ago they were in your shoes as sales reps. All in all, Dell is a good company to have on your resume but it is survival of the fittest. If you don't pick the sales process from the get go or get with a team coach that will carry you, this job is not for you."
good,"Effective fulfillment / direct to market model, strong presence in enterprise and public sector. Good sales ethos and pricing."
good,"Worked my butt off and loved the work I did. I learned a lot about Dell servers, project management and business process."
good,Mid-level directors are clueless and incompetent. I have no idea how they became the 2nd largest computer company in the world but its clear to me as a former insider and a current-outside observer that they are stagnating.
good,"Excellent peers that I enjoyed working with."
good,"Dell allows you to learn so much in a short time.  You feel like you are contributing every day.  You do feel uncertainty in your job, meaning will it always be there or not.  Everyone feels this way at Dell."
good,Currently i am interested in softare side as a fresher with training  or  else elctrical  side as a fresher
good,"I worked with great people in my office and I enjoyed supporting them. "
good,Many former Perot systems pm's are still present.  They utilize an internal methodology of PM3 for projects.  It is easliy understood as it is based on PMI standards.  There is little room for decision making and understanding of leadership direction.  Program management is loose and secretive.  I enjoyed working with the SME's and their abilities to tackle issues.  DELL is definately challenged in technology areas and many of the customers exploit this making project work difficult.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is that it was never boring; whether it was new information or changes in the adjustment of the medical claims or meeting with the client. This was a travel assignment to another city and state so that part was interesting. The hardest part was that the job was a temporary assignment so there was no stability to build permanent relationships.
good,"I take calls for Tenet Hospitals, Remote in to the PC's to repair Java issues and scanning issues."
good,"I enjoyed working there. it was fun when we celebrate festivals n birthdays in office. Regarding work I developed my skills and experience in numerous different ways. i did not worked on corel draw before, but seniors trusted me and they gave me my 1st assignment of it. now I am very good in corel draw. I also learned a great deal about handling clients directly. seniors n co workers were so supportive and co-operative."
good,"Dell is a very large company, with respect to Enterprise Application Services, Dell has very experienced consultants in the US in SAP however it lacks the staff & senior level consultants required to balance out the pricing for an SAP implementation.  With the acquisition of Perot Systems, Dell has a large offshore worforce and can provide the required outsourcing a customer desires.  From a work/life balance perspective you will need to find your own balance since most assignments will require travel.  Compensation and benefits are excellent."
good,This job is ok for a person with no technical experience to gain experience. My typical day stats at 6 AM and I take phone calls and look at emails all day.
good,Good work life balance.  Many changes handed down from management.
good,"•	Worked as an Assistant Network Operation Engineer and Executive in the Technical Support department providing direct support for Internet Application Servers."
good,"Generally routine PC tech support."
good,"no way to progress your career"
good,"*some times they gave more updates in one week, we always having confusions and we strugle a lot in that."
good,"As a Business Analyst I was responsible for writing all the policies and procedures of our software, including the regulations with handling a customers Life and Annuity Insurance policies.  "
good,"I took this job during my physical rehabilitation after a motorcycle wreck.  This job was in a call center and I sold home computers and built them to specifics within a range of cost, abilities, and knowledge of the customer.  Educating the customer on how software worked and combining this information to maximize the sale of computers, software, and accessories."
good,Pay is good.  Management is not consistent.  Favorites definitely played.
good,"Typical call center environment"
good,"Great place to work if you have an effective front line leader. Upper Management is largely living in the past. Driven from the bottom up where many project managers ""pitch"" their solutions rather than being aligned to strategic goals. Lots of redundancy and dead-end projects. Great potential with better vision and direction. Excellent compensation but little upward mobility. Excellent coworkers, very smart workforce in general."
good,"fast paced work environment, management let you be your own boss as long as the work got done, learned time management"
good,"Won a lot of orders for BFSI with HCL Infosystems. The major customer that were handled were SBI, BOB, Allahabad bank and others. My basic knowledge of IT cultivated there."
good,"The first time I walked in the door for my interview there were two people literally yelling at their headsets, a girl sitting by the door crying and someone knocked a garbage can over as they stomped past me and out the door. "
good,"Good training with emphasis on training."
good,"Take incoming calls from policy holders, multi-tasking is a must. Confidentiality is necessary. Not enough training before you begin and so much to learn to feel competent. Great co-workers. The hardest part of the job is never feeling confident about what you know as there is so much to learn, not enough training, and no two supervisors give you the same information when you call the lead line so it's confusing and frustrating. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to all of the nice people and being able to help them."
good,"You are always wondering if today will be the last day I walk through the doors.  This happens no matter your performance, you can get a rockin performance review one day and then be told you have so many days to find a job.  A person should not have to live like this.  Dell is becoming known for recurrent and regular layoffs..."
good,the people is what makes dell what it is today not Dell. the manufacturing plant is closing down so I would not recommend anybody applying for a job there
good,"Dell is Dell, this job was fast paced and the work place was pretty strict. Great job, but not very flexible."
good,"A good place for freshers... "
good,"verall rating 4"
good,"Typically 4 incidents/day (printer does not work etc) and 3 requests (need pc moved etc) at a typical 500 bed facility. All tickets treated as incidents on one of the accounts"
good,"My experience at EMC has given me valuable experience in learning the Oracle and SAP systems, EMC company standards, and has improved my skills in critical thinking and problem trouble shooting. Unexpectedly, I have also found myself in a leadership role where I train the other associates in my area."
good,"o ambiente entre os funcionarios e otimo, porem nao nao ha incentivo para que os funcionarios trabalhem motivados, nao ha processos celetivos para oferecer uma oportunidade de crescimento."
good,"It is a ever changing work place. In 5 years, I have 9 jobs. Working at Dell requires an ability to work cross functionally, and to be able to deal with ambiguity."
good,Dynamic working environment
good,"I loved working for EMC. I put in 120% like the rest of my team did. When things got hard, we took pay cuts vs.layoffs. Unfortunately at EMC, layoffs catch up to most. It is a great company to work for, but don't count on job security. You will have to change groups every year or two if you want to try to avoid being laid off. We all kept our skills up. We were the best of the best meeting and exceeding all of our quarterly MBO goals and educational goals. We cared about our customers and the work we did. The location is a 2 hour commute from Boston with traffic. Most managers are flexible and offer work from home solutions, but some do not. Work life balance does exist with some managers, but not all. You really have to be sure EMC is where you want to be and you can meet all the asks that are required. You also can't be emotional or surprised if you get laid off after a record setting quarter where you were told you excelled and would be getting a promotion 2 days later."
good,I worked for a small company (Compellent Technogies Inc.) that was bought out by Dell. Never worked for such a mega company before.
good,Working at the hospital when I was with Dell was interesting but working with the people (management) wasn't easy. Although I learned a lot more about insurances and how to better obtain authorizations the communication was not very good.
good,"I learned many thing from that company like sending mails, making SOP, handing team, sending daily report to team leader taking training for new associates, clarifiy doubts and etc......"
good,"Dell's biggest problem is that they would rather someone from outside the company and pay them more, than to keep their current employees competitively paid."
good,"Fast paced, lot of deadlines"
good,"Company doesnt really start new useful initatives. Unreasonable expectations and short leashes for employees. Training is inadequate and nonexsistant. Pays well for the the responsiblities. Vacation and Sick time are accured right away, no need to wait 90 days."
good,"When I started out working for this company it was Perot Systems, then Dell took over. After that acquisition many things changed and I was not happy. I am hard worked with great knowledge and values and my clients liked me, but I could not advance in this company the way that I wanted to, I felt like I constantly had to fight for a promotion or a raise. I did not feel there was a fair rating system."
good,Enjoyable work environment with good people to support.
good,"The products and training are best of breed but the company deserves its nickname ""The Boston Mob."" It's a good ole boys network where your value is measured by your employee number."
good,"Project engineering and project management of pump station design, pond routing, residential and commercial site design. Construction plan design and submittal, technical specification preparation, hydrology analysis and design, water system analysis and design, NPDES & CMP implementation, As-Built submittal and recording, opinion of probable cost estimating, construction inspection, volume computations, permit acquisitions, client/municipality relationships, project billing/conceptual, and lead design personnel coordination."
good,"In Dell service work place is very cool, there is no break limits, and the managers and supervisors are gave more support."
good,"Very, very high paced, little training, difficult department to work in due to the stress everyone was under to enter invoices, many different types of invoices, from piecework (where you would have to match pieces to the entries the manufacturing dept had input) to entering Hewlett Packard invoices, a huge part of their business, and PTC, right down to the local restaurant owner providing meals to workers in different departments who were there through dinner. Sometimes required to work on Saturdays, always required to be prepared to having the ""letters"" your desk was assigned to change. Once changed, very little training on the new vendors assigned to."
good,150 cold calls a day.
good,the hardest part of the job is to come on saturday. my co-workers are very helpful. i have learned my process and also i have learned other team process and supported the other team.
good,"Management is unfair, bias and inefficient. Limitted or no scope of growth."
good,"My typical day at work was nothing to write home about. I assisted in sales when co-workers were unavailable to answer the phone. Management (mostly upper management) was terribly hypocritical, pushing each person to make more sales and then firing them when they found new methods of doing so. Overall, if you enjoy working and not being recognized, this is the place to do it."
good,"The people at EMC are bright and wonderful to be around. Articulate, and funny the ambiance is good. However, the push to make numbers and the corporate mentality can leave talented professionals in its wake."
good,"Working as configuration management analyst and learned a lot like packaging deployment , troubleshooting and about the work culture, very hactic very little time to talk or to enjoy."
good,"They churn 'em and burn 'em here. If you're lucky enough to get a good manager (and stay with him/her) all is well. Most managers, however do not fall into that category. Questionable executive ethics, departments working at cross-purposes, constant re-orgs and a kill-or-be-killed mentality make this a stressful place to work."
good,Both a great and a terrible experience due to the various teams and supervisors I reported to. Training needs to be in place for people managers who lack soft skills; many I worked with were not equipped with these skills.
good,"Be prepared to bend over back words to help them. If you have any home issues, they might not be willing to help you with it. Even with FMLA and all of that."
good,Mixed bag of good and bad people. Be ready to move. Many groups with different cultures. very flexible work hours. time off is good. fun people to be around.
good,A typical work day is working with your Dell team and Account Executives for new acquisition targets to pitch Dell’s technology portfolio.  Work with your internal team to build a strategy on theses targets to build your pipeline.
good,Tools for the job always a secondary concern for upper management.   Changes in company culture due to purchase of EMC and going public again caused a lot churn in the workforce.
good,Good company to work with apart from few bad managers who always get away. Its a good launch pad for those who wish to start a career. has good training programs!
good,Ils ne sont pas capables de gérer leurs propres ressources humaines.
good,On. Time working and majorly finishing the target... Every day would be 1300 has to be finished within 3pm.. Which has been major tax and I ill be completing everyday.. That Wat I learned.
good,Good but still can be improved with goos salary .the salary is main concern.Technical growth depends on project and managet mainly. Technology work wise is good
good,"...trying to inculcate the culture of the new tech companies, but failing miserably. The teams spread out, the old-style top-down management are standing in the way."
good,"Its a great opportunity that provides amazing training, but the work'life balance at EMC is terrible. Its a ""dog-eat-dog"" kind of culture, but if you can make it there you can make it anywhere."
good,My first real experience working in a team environment with my IT degree. I had a great team to work with and everybody was very helpful and accommodating.
good,"Local management in general was very good, upper management is not always very interested on the issues going on with the employees.The job can be very stressful due to the fact that there are no enough people to do the work."
good,"There was also work to do. Never a dull moment, also training was very adequate and the account I worked for spent 5-6 weeks of thorough training. The starting pay was much lower than what the cost of living comparison to the location we live in."
good,"I found the people less then motivated for the most part and not particularly passionate about the product. For example, I was aware of numerous people who had Apple products where Dell offered the same product, at a discount."
good,"Spent 10+ years in Dell EMC. Gained a lot of skills and experiences."
good,"I was a coah for dell and honestly the job was great, I was asked to move to the Demo lab and during that time frame Dell closed the consumer division."
good,"Dell has been going through really trying times over the past 10 years with no real thought leadership emerging from the leadership team. Dell has made some very poor acquisitions in an attempt to grow inorganically and has had to lay off a lot of people in a bid to stay profitable. Recently there has been a lot of discrimination against, men. Yes, can you believe that? Women have been getting promoted very very rapidly after a lawsuit and this has really demoralized the men"
good,"Dell is still in great turmoil from the EMC acquisition in many orgs.Dells decision to go public has driven cost reduction at the expense of many US based employees, with many of these positions being sent offshore to ""lower cost"" regions."
good,"not a lot of structure, very disorganized. management is very lacksadasal when making corporate decisions. Team structure is very diluted. Not a lot of incentive."
good,"Employee oriented environment, good benefits, and room for growth. Only drawback is lack of hiring. Two year contract maximum for contractors. Call back after three months if needed."
good,"Good work/life balance, a lot of change undergone since Dell took over. EMC was very successful and workers enjoyed working there, Dell came in and some do not feel the same"
good,"Decent company for just a job, but if they bought your company, they quickly get rid of you. I wish they focused more on career growth and less on laying people off to save money."
good,"In my 2 most recent positions, one was high stress and log hours, but everyone was involved in meeting a common goal.  The other was more casual but found that not all workers and managers seemed to be focused on the same set of goals."
good,"I always had the proper staff at the proper time in the proper location and we exceeded expectations by delivering on time and on budget."
good,Frequent reorganizations result in job changes and unexpected staff reductions.  You should network as much as possible to develop alternate opportunities when there are organizational changes underway.
good,"Over all its a good company to work. "
good,"Michael Dell and senior executive leadership has done an amazing job transforming the company, but it is filled with poor director-level people managers that cares more about themselves than building the team. "
good,Shadowed by EMC leading to a Structured environment with Management politics. Promote new tools  often. Possibility to grow if you find the right niche within the business.
good,"Love my team and the people that I work with on a day to day basis. The benefits are good and the flexibility of WFH and time off are much appreciated, especially when coming off of 50+ hour weeks."
good,"•	Recognize the various types of effective communication skills in customer service"
good,Customers call in to build computers but can buy same computer from larger retailers for cheaper prices. Very hard to upsell customers and have them wait for their computer to be delivered.
good,"My scoring may have to do with the fact that I worked for Dell while being my company was being acquired by them. However, this job itself was not difficult, but it lacked any advancement or or investment in it's people. Dell's school policy was that they were willing to help fund your college while attending, but would only do so if you held the position you were currently going to school for. This made no sense especially if someone was in one role and trying to move to a different department (i.e., marketing or HR). "
good,My first day at Dell was the same day of layoffs.  Management was bad which lead to a negative work culture.  Pay was reasonable and work life balance was good.
good,"Decent place to work, good challenges, but lots of pets and protected people.  Boasted work/life balance but then high pressure to work nights/weekends/holidays.  Team members are generally good, management not so much. Watch your back, they espoused ""quality"" but then laid off the group's only quality engineer (me)."
good,"I worked from 8:30 am til 5pm,Monday thru Friday in the Shipping Department.Learned a lot about shipping/logistics/distribution. Management was more questionable after merger with EMC. Co-workers were great. Hardest part was feeling unappreciated by management. Interacting with co-workers as best part of the day!"
good,"emails, reports, scheduling and dispatch, coordinate engineers schedules for upgrades and IMAC requests. "
good,"after 2 years, the pay sucks and the job is terrible. client pro support"
good,Interesting work and plenty of it. Lots of talk about work/life balance. And there is some flexibility in some cases. But the work load is not sustainable even for the most dedicated and efficient of employees.
good,"Esta empresa me enseñó sobre la cultura de trabajo como organización. Fue una experiencia sumamente satisfactoria en su mayoría debido a que me hizo involucrarme e incluso identificarme con la marca debido a la cultura que promueven internamente."
good,"Early days were terrific, good career advancement and training abound. EMC management driven by Sales and they were ruthless and not technically knowledgeable."
good,"Expected to work extended hours, nights, and weekends with little to no incentive to do so, all while be highly scrutinized any time you have 'low utilization', which is completely out of my control to begin with. If you complain, you are called 'opinionated'. Way too much travel for me. If you love travelling, and spending your life in random towns and hotels, and have nothing better to do than work long days, long weeks, weekends and evening with little to no advance notice, you will love working here."
good,"Having worked for Dell on two separate occasions in different positions, it's safe to say that everything is done to keep the company running like a well oiled machine."
good,"Like any other large consulting company - as long as you are billable and want to disappear its great."
good,"Work wasn't too stressful here, but the leadership is what killed it for me. Product leadership (and direction) changed so many times, then advancements were held back due to that (??)."
good,"EMC was a great place to work. Culturally there has been a significant shift since the merger with Dell, for the EMC staff it has been a difficult transition. Ability to work from home from time to time really helped the work-life balance and the people there were fantastic."
good,"The manager was easy going and helped me understand the work required. Got a chance to brush up my LMS and LCMS skills, learnt quite a bit about the IT industry"
good,"As part of the services team (now NTT data), our support team provided app support for dozens of hospitals. Each hospital/organization had different policies and workflows so the majority of your day was spent trying to wade through the BS so one could actually tackle the technical issues. I don't see how they make money considering the amount of time wasted every day on navigating the red tape (prob why they sold out).  Pay is decent and some of the higher up managers are awesome, but you rarely deal with them soooo.. "
good,"Dell is like most IT companies in the new millennium, it is a very competitive environment. The company's bottom line does not take into account the employees working there hence the reason why they constantly go through work force reductions to compensate for shrinking margins because of over commitment to clients. That coupled with acquisitions like EMC make it difficult for employees to have a sense of comfort in their job security."
good,"Dell just acquired EMC, 1 year later they sold the software divisions which i supported the hardware and software design, installations and configuration of the Documentum suite of products."
good,"Executives don't stick with priorities, communication between functional areas is very poor, employees required to work from home leads to non-existent corporate culture"
good,average service for contract workers. Will be in contract for long time. 12pm -12am is working hours from tuesday - saturday (sun & mon off) but have to work on saturday if needed.
good,"Dell life depends on which manager you have, in the end my manager was a incompetent boob... other managers are good... I choose to leave for a different career path"
good,"Company is good to work in, but remuneration is not as per market. Good work life balance and lot of learning opportunity in new versions of Oracle. The job is challenging."
good,"Dell is a soul-sucking workplace that treats people who have been there for fewer than ten years like dirt. Advancement is near impossible unless you are willing to brown nose your way up the ladder. It is a popularity contest where the hardest working folks are rarely recognized and the mediocre rise to the top."
good,"- Employee friendly culture"
good,"Points positifs"
good,"Overall culture is good. good opportunities and good team members. "
good,"Dell EMC is a very very different company after the merger: budget constraints, lots of people leaving,  consolidation and ""synergies"" are the word of the day... unfortunately all this process took al the fun out of the job..."
good,"Pros: Some great people to work with"
good,An experience. Very challenging company and culture. Changes to any design very difficult due to the structure with Saudi Telecom. New office and Data Centre also in Dammam. Facility and out source teams were a big part of my role to try to get right.
good,Empresa de grande porte muito interessada na realizacao profissional dos funcionarios
good,After the purchase of EMC the company culture has changed and not for the better. Legacy EMC is influencing all corporate direction and it is becoming less about work life balance and more about what have you done for me lately.
good,"I mostly worked from home and when I was in the office, had little to no interactions with co-workers.  I learned how to work independently as well as how to work cross-functionally with other departments in order to get a task done.  Management in this department was lacking - no direction, no praise for jobs well done, lack of knowledge."
good,An individual is given the freedom to run his/her own buisness. It is a good place for someone wanting to learn. It is however undergoing consolidation so the company is in bit of confused state
good,"solid giant, lousy management."
good,Changed a lot after Dell purchased EMC. EMC was ranked 6th best company to work for in the Great Place to Work survey. I don't think they will keep their ranking post merger. Dell has much different employee values and benefits.
good,Work culture is good here and limited scope for development.Job is fixed no room for improvement. For freshers it is the best company. When it comes to salary part i can it the worst.
good,EMC was a great place to work for until Dell bought them out. I was able to work with an amazing group of people until my job was cut and they hired contractors.
good,"The company is in transition.  Great place to work depending on the organization you fall into.  I personally didn't get the right one, and had a terrible on boarding experience."
good,"Good Company to work for if you can get employed full-time/permanent through Dell Sales, otherwise, lots of overtime to take and decent pay for the job."
good,"the deptment that I worked in closed it doers and was laid off.  during the time I had my job, I helped customers with their accounts and took payment and answered questions."
good,"Recruitment and training pattern is great however the culture is very Male dominating, atleast in the team where I was associated with."
good,"Good place to start up for a fresher."
good,The workplace culture is very unique and makes you want to be a part of the lifestyle. I enjoyed the many events that they do there on a regular. The company is growing rapidly.
good,"Typing skill improved"
good,"Early start which I like, working with European customers which is sometimes quite difficult."
good,"Good co-workers. "
good,"I grew a lot from this job but also realized that I do not want to be working in the IT industry."
good,"Dell International is a good company but the negative part is their promotion policies."
good,"Great people, start of the art technologies and methodologies, little work life balance. Has gym available.  Collegial atmosphere between peers and co-workers."
good,Enjoyed my time there.   Upper level Mgmt has a great vision.  Mid-level seems to struggle a bit with how to implement.  Overall positive experience.  Politics played as always.
good,Good Work experience. Lots of knowledge gain and You will learn new things. Management is fair enough . Its only a work experience you would gain and good team
good,"Good place to work but constant organization changes"
good,"I start my day with a hand off meeting from the 2nd shift."
good,"Great salary, great benefits, great travel opportunities, great networking opportunities."
good,"I love all that Dell stands for, but it lacks in communication, leadership and working programs and operating systems. I've been there a whole month and still don't have all my systems working and still can't used all the software to do my job. Our leads are no help at all and tend to get frustrated because of the lack of inability to use our computers due to technical issues."
good,"I loved working for Phoenix Job Corps, however the company need better management. I love the trainees i worked with, I worked in dorm living, helping the trainee's transition to independent living. I conducted daily reports and cleaning schedules for trainee's, also monitoring their behavior."
good,We can easily mingle with co-workers. Fun work place with less supportive management. Job Security is not sure. They will fire out the persons at any point of time.
good,Fun place to work.Learned lot on people management & end user support systems.Good and awesome team members to work with and grow.No 2 days were the same and learnt a lot.
good,Recognition for experience people is low. New comer will get paid more than expr candidate even though both are doing same work.
good,"Very bad to get promotions/advancement, you must know someone or be bad at what you do to get advanced, hard working people dont make it very far"
good,"Great place to learn, meet professionals whom can help guide and support others."
good,"Management is non-exsistant, contracts and allocations are completely out of the employees control. Management does not assist in changing of jobs, or movement."
good,Dell is a nice place work for people having at least experience more than 5 yrs. as there are less opportunities to learn for a person with less experience.
good,A typical day in the office consisted of managing diverse teams and at all times remaining politically correct.  The management team is more interested in that aspect of the organization rather than getting anything done.  Constant review of decisions crippled work progress.  Co-workers were outstanding to work with however as frustrated as everyone else.  The most enjoyable part of this company is it's people - always.
good,Enjoyed working with my co-workers. However management was a bit in experienced and made the work place feel dark and challenging
good,"In my view , when a company's management system caring for all staff ( friendly relation and guiding) , company's production is growing up."
good,Dell took over the contract that I was working on and had very little engagement with our group. We started off with 10 agents working on our help desk until it was reduced to 3 then it was disbanded with very little reasoning. There were 5 years remaining on the contract.
good,"Empresa multinacional pouco preocupada com cultura brasileira, não tropizalizada força a todos utilização do idioma estrangeiro, humilhação  e assedio moral são bem comuns"
good,"It's OK to work at EMC.  It's a hard core, male dominated, sales driven company with great benefits and healthcare insurance."
good,"In my previous organization, I possessed the necessary knowledge and experience on .NET platform and C# programming language, where I was part of developing websites using ASP.NET for the clients."
good,"I started with Perot Systems when Ross Perot Sr. still owned the company and every employee felt like they were someone. After Michael Dell purchased the company layoffs began and employee morale went way down. They began off shoring jobs. Overall I enjoyed my 10 years there and was certainly not ready to be laid off. I learned a great deal about Service Desk, Customer Care, the need for team work, accountability, and Documentation."
good,"Set up project from order downloaded in a particular tool where budget included as well. One of the scope in Project Management. I have learned a lot, not only work-related but how to communicate with colleagues to drive daily activities. Time management is very crucial in my job scope, to set up and deliver within a range of time. I had a fabulous co-workers, one of the reason I had a joyful long working hours. The hardest part of the job is to communicate and deal with internal co-workers from different region. Due to the different time zone and culture, I find it challenging when communicate either via email or phone. When it comes to the most enjoyable part of the job, I would say hanging around with my reporting manager and a groups of colleagues. I have to admit, it was a tough decision leaving them to pursue my dream."
good,I've played in hundreds if not thousands of places. Some were good and some were not so good. Some were great.
good,If they can outsource or contract the position out they will
good,"Great place to work, great products & great people.  Management  had un-realistic expectations.  I suspect this has changed since it has went private.  I would work there again."
good,"A typical day at Dell would be managing an extremely busy calendar for 2 executives and their team.  I would schedule meetings, maintain outlook mail lists, plan offsite team motivating events, manage spending for the department.  Onboard new employees having their accounts set up prior to their start date with computer, phones, added to various meetings as needed.  The hardest part of the job would be the fast paced ever changing calendars on an hourly basis."
good,"Entry level positions, little opportunity to advance if you're in Canada, even if you get EMC's Proven Professional Certifications."
good,"There is a saying at dell - Dell is a good first job and 3rd job. "
good,"Good to work since the team I worked was excellent and Fantastic."
good,"Lots of opportunity for change, ability to work remotely, smart co-workers. Reorgs happen frequently so you need to be very flexible with the absence of structure and clear strategies. A lot of employee turnover, especially higher management"
good,This is not your typical engineering company of this century. It is more of a market driven engineering company where engineers often do not get a say in deciding on deadlines. Work/Life balance is not great and people get burned out fast. Compensation is OK but not so competitive compared to counter-parts. How good your job is really depends on the low management you are under. I was fortunate enough to have two good managers.
good,"Great benefits, great place to learn and challenge yourself.  It is a great place to put your 80+ hours work weeks in."
good,".I spent around 13 hours in office because lot of cases were pending and I had to skip my lunch."
good,"-Patrolling building for security purposes."
good,"Dell can be a good place to work but can quickly change to a difficult work place.  Senior management has no connection or visibility to the employees working on the sales teams.  Low level management is untrained and inexperienced.  Dell promotes good sales people to management but provides little to no training resulting in poor performance management. They hire entry-level based mainly on referral so they fail to recruit the top sales makers in the industry."
good,It is a good place to learn. I was able to learn about the job and developed my personal skills and ability.
good,"Learned about Fibre channel storage, zoning LUN masking, replication solutions, fail over and recovery concepts."
good,"Seeking right job for my Carrier."
good,"It is what it is, in my position in chat support, highly stressful dealing with 2 customers at a time frequently throughout the day."
good,Process a variety of medical adjustments for medicare and medicaid of AZ.
good,"Dell's transition to a private company resulted in people of all levels from the executives down to leave the company.  Great talent was lost in the process.  "
good,"Management unwilling to resolve issues causing continued increased costs of operation.  Interdepartmental boundaries resulting in allot of ""it's not my problem"" related answers rather than just someone taking initiative to resolve the problem. No cross departmental cohesiveness."
good,It's a good starter job for fresh IT graduates wanting to get their foot in the door with options for advancement.
good,"I worked for Dell for 8 years, started out when Dell was just at the beginning of its decline for customer and employee satisfaction.  Overall, they will pay you enough to make you stay, and you'll work hard enough to not get fired.  That was the relationship the supposed ""meritocracy"" enforced.  "
good,"Dell itself is not doing well due to PC market's decline. However, the people here are working hard to get the business expanded."
good,"good atmosphere to work, learn more about MNC, and adopt to work any critical starvation."
good,"Excellent work assignments and opportunities to expand knowledge , skills and experience. Great opportunity to cross functional boundaries and expand breadth of work experience. Frequent reorganizations, lack of strategic direction and frequent layoffs hinder opportunities for career development for many employees. My career ended after the continual layoffs caught up with me. My advice is work hard, manage your professional development and keep  your resume in play while working at Dell."
good,"2007 to late 2008: Teleperformance USA."
good,Execution was difficult when costs are so constrained. Frustrations grew and care flew.
good,"Uma empresa ótima, com varias benefícios  , mas o salaria poderia ser melhor , principalmente pela carga de trabalho"
good,"I contracted with the InfoDev Dept. for nearly a year.  After I was hired (along with several others), I learned there was a ""mass-firing / exodus"" in the InfoDev Dept weeks beforehand (in the spring of 2012).  I didn't understand, since the work environment was decent and my coworkers were excellent... though everyone seemed a bit skittish.  Just over 1-year later, and months before a major product release, another mass-firing occurred and over 25% of the InfoDev department was laid off or fired without reason. (There was PLENTY of work.)  Now they are advertising for Technical Writers again!  Apparently lining up a new crew for the 2014 slaughter. "
good,Was getting to work on the newest technologies on a day to day basis.
good,"My typical day at work is to ensure that material attributes are setup correctly based on the information given by the PM."
good,"Around 9 years of Experience in Systems Analysis, Design, Development and Implementation of various applications using Microsoft Technologies."
good,Good - they try to instill a sense of fairness in the culture.
good,"Open-minded, customer focus, interested by new technology, ready for new challenges and experiences..team spirit, and love to work in a multicultural environment or to travel abroad."
good,Learned many process in my job.
good,"Uma boa empresa, um ótimo ambiente de trabalho, com uma gerencia amiga"
good,Everything in the company was good except staff timing and attitute of working
good,"Work was fun. However, management trained you to determine what was the best option for the customer and offer those options but they would write you up if you didn't offer leasing options to the customer, even if leasing was not the best option for that customer."
good,Great people to work with but definitely major challenges with the compnay itself. Going through a transformation
good,various positions to go to & from with the process of learning
good,"When i was first hired the work environment was great, but thru the month the management team that was in place all left for new positions at other company's and the new management that was in place doesn't comunicate with each other or the team."
good,"Dell was good....lots of time off, challenging work environment. Raises are rare as are promotions or even the ability to move to different jobs. Dell jobs continue to move overseas on a regular basis leaving more and more people here out of a job. There is no job security at Dell - I would never consider going back and I cannot recommend anyone go to work for this corp. They treat their sales people like dirt and everyone else, not much better."
good,Good company but they need to align with their own values and commit to investing in people. They can improve by developing leadership skills that would be a force multiplier in workforce and promote from within.
good,Could learn a lot during my experience with Dell - project management and business analysis - Also learned a lot about Business process management
good,"There is extensive travel as part of this job, and is great if you have a ""boys club"" attitude. It is a bit difficult to integrate into if you are coming in from the outside. The most enjoyable part of the job is the flexibility."
good,"Its good place to start of your career, Growth option are very limited."
good,"Dell could be great but is disorganized, internally focused, & highly political. Relationships matter much more than performance. It is not a meritocracy and does not have a functioning performance management process. It's increasingly difficult to spend time with customers given the demands of internal meetings and reviews."
good,"I Joined Equallogic/Dell in September of 2011. The technology is superb in my thinking, but since they were bought out by Dell they appear to be very disorganized. Very chaotic in allot of ways. No sense of direction in my point of view. They do have allot of the latest technology available, which I took advantage of."
good,Average. No career advancement. Flexible work hours which is good.
good,Manage loss margin
good,The company has an excellent growth strategy. They are certainly lined up to continue to grow in the double digits for some time.
good,The rules always changed constantly. Management was never on the same page. Communications was a big issue.
good,Did learn a lot on the software part of the PC. Was a learning curve and was manly involved in the Virus removal and sofware related problems of the Windows Operating system.
good,"Great management team that would go out of the way to help. The people were great, but were always worried at that time if you would have a job when you come in the next day!"
good,EMC is an overall great company with great benefits. The problem was Data General was not a great company with inept micromanagers. My department was full of DGers low motivated non-professional. Do reasearch on area you will be working for. Would go back if department were run by EMC employees.
good,"Solange sich nichts ändert, kann man den Arbeitgeber leider nur als sehr gutes Sprungbrett betrachten. "
good,I left one Fortune 500 company to try it once again. I missed the global environment. I was assured multiple times that work-life balance was in sync. I have yet to see it. I am hoping it is the department I work for and not the overall company. Still not convinced.
good,"Ok place to work, opportunities and job advancement. Procurement professional with experience in price negotiations, supplier management, planning. Managed 3rd party suppliers to provide procurement and planning support for hardware commodities to support company owned manufacturing facilities. Able to organize and prioritize tasks. Excellent problem solving and conflict resolution skills. Successful in bringing material cost savings, cycle time reductions and process improvements."
good,"A good company, but EMC moving to the DELL culture which is extremely controlling  Great medical benefits but bonus isn’t paid until equipment ships which means there are times at the end of the qtr you will miss your goal although you really hit it! Very demoralizing and discouraging"
good,"Dell provides an opportunity to put down roots and settle into a long term career.  Branch offices are not very energetic, but you have the freedom to work from home quite often."
good,I have done contract positions at Dell three times.  My position was either eliminated or off shored.  It is my personal choice not to go back there but I have heard there are areas of Dell that are not like this.
good,"Accounts are constantly changing and you either get good ones or bad ones. You have to hit you MSP number each week, which is hard is sales are slow or you get bad accounts. You are told things that generally aren't true and if you say anything you are viewed as ""negative"". You are in a cold call scenario in a cube call center atmosphere. Culture is great but you're either an all-star stud or a dirtbag based on how well you do and the accounts you get aligned to."
good,Dell is a nice place to work. Family friendly environment. The hardest part of the job was dealing with disgruntled customers whom had complaints after being on hold for so long via the queue
good,"Dell has a large corporate structure that tends to lean towards micromanagement. However the benefits and pay are fairly competitive and I was happy to have many opportunities to improve my skills. The job can be very high stress and work life balance isn't very important here. It's common to work overtime, after hours and on weekends with little to no support."
good,Family comes first!! This has been my favorite part about working for DELL | EMC and never having to feel pressured to use my PBA time is a family emergency comes up!
good,"Work life balance and pay are pretty great. The work itself is tedious and boring. I have no job description and simply do whatever anyone tells me which ranges from generating metrics to googling answers to basic questions. Sometimes I actually get an interesting task or the chance to actually learn something new and useful, but management normally realizes they need some metrics and pull me off before I get a chance. If I were content coasting by, this job would be great, but I like to be challenged and improve so I find myself languishing and frustrated."
good,"Worked in the back and recovery section, which got split off into Quest.  Poor lead generation and continuously increasing call minimums lead to a stressful environment where success felt harder to attain than it should've been."
good,"Company is large so every team is different, not diverse enough and a lot of redundant workforce, but the core teams are very competitive.  So career advancement varies."
good,"Dell has a history of laying good performers off to lower the bottom line.  They have a philosophy of lay a highly paid person off and bring in 2 low paid people to do the same work, even if they don't have the same skills to do what's needed."
good,"Life at Dell is like a game of survivor.  You just never know when the ax will swing your way.  As a manager, I swung the ax more times that I ever wanted to and after 19 years, I was on the receiving end.  Just now a great culture, everyone is privately wondering when it will be their turn."
good,"It was a Voice Based Process."
good,"I worked their six years without getting a promotion."
good,"Wonderful atmosphere, close to inside knowledge of the Technology landscape.  However..."
good,"stressful place to work, i think management was not good i took  a lot of calls i did above and beyond and i felt like there was no room for advancement"
good,Working for Perot Systems was my introduction to being on the employer side of retirement plans. I felt this gave me a more meaningful mission to help our employees prepare and plan their retirements. Equally as important was the knowledge level I brought to the management team on all aspects of running efficient and compliant retirement plans.
good,"Loved it there until I got laid off - I'd still be there if that didn't happen.   I loved the work, and most of the people - didn't like the politivs - also I had a boss who told me I'd have a job as long as he had a job, he's still there - obviously I""m not"
good,"I am a remote employee, so Dell doesn't pay much attention to the support we need.  It is there, but you will have to work for it more often than you would think.  I have learned much from my time here both personally and professionally, most of it through observation rather than a deliberate managed structure."
good,Not enough direction from leadership after the merger happened. Very difficult to understand the direction the company is moving in and how resources are affected.
good,"The people who succeed at Dell started there very young and really don't know any better.  Compared to other employers in the business, Dell treats people like interchangeable parts and values conformance with policy much more highly than individual contributions.  "
good,"Flexible work environment is great."
good,I joined the company through the acquisition of EMC.  The financial systems and tools of these two gigantic companies are different from the architecture and logic perspectives.  We need a clear strategy / roadmap for the finance community to understand and envision.
good,"It's possible to have a good or a bad experience at Dell depending on the department, team, and manager you work for. I know this doesn't provide a lot of insight into this enterprise company, but take this advice with with a grain of salt and consider fully investigating the culture of the department and team you'll be working with as well as the personality traits of your manager.  You may want to keep in mind that managers and employees also change departments fairly often so if you work with a great team now it may not be the same 9 to 12 months from now."
good,"A lot of overhead and work pressure. Work life balance is a joke, it is 24x7 sweatshop for IT with global teams. Too many emails and meetings, promote the like minded and those who belongs to ""the club""."
good,"it has been an overall learning experience with dell. the professional life has been challenging and taught many expects of self improvement like self motivation, hard and smart work."
good,"Expect the unexpected, or as Dell likes to say in the new hire classes, expect ""ambiguity"" daily. Metrics change constantly but not communicated  clearly."
good,"I enjoyed my time while working at EMC, the work was very enjoyable as I'm a hands on person and cab building can be quite therapeutic. The wages matched the workload which was fine. Shift work was great. The only issue is the safety of your job,which there is none, all in all a good experience working for a big name in the I.T industr."
good,"-Typical day involves taking whatever case is handed to you by the work flow managers."
good,Following the acquisition of EMC by Dell many changes were expected and layoffs did occur. The company is positioned well if they can execute but must do so faster to continue to maintain or expand market share in a shrinking profit margin environment. May struggle to innovate ahead of smaller nimble competitors.
good,DELL SecureWorks is good place to work. Management is trying to take new approach in SDLC and doing okay. Work life balance is manageable. Overall good experience.
good,"Dell and EMC have fundamentally different corporate cultures.  While EMC invested significantly in intellectual property (R&D), dell it much more apt to invest in process improvement and mainstream or laggard technology.  R&D investments are shrinking."
good,Ability to define work/life boundaries is a must otherwise the job can consume you.  There is excellent variety available and the organization does encourage cross functional training and experience.  This is a good environment for those that enjoy taking the initiative and responsibility for tasks and projects supporting the business.
good,"With recent reduction in force is a concern for job security.  Management speaks about transformation of the business, agile development, DevOps, how actions still are about pushing the hardware and not leading with solutions"
good,It is a company wide policy employees are able to work remotely regardless of their current address/location which allow employees have more time to spend with families
good,"I spent 12 years at Dell, and found their compensation package to be excellent. Well above industry standards. I worked for some really great managers who have since moved on to other companies, and some managers who I couldn't wait for the next role to either move them along or myself along. They work you very hard, but claim work/life balance is a priority. Unfortunately, doing more with less is the nature of the business, so plan on spending nights and weekends on project delivery. This is usually not an issue, but moving to an Agile development method means spending 24/7 for 1 week out of each month on project delivery. People were making themselves ill trying to accommodate that schedule."
good,"Worked there 13 years"
good,"Recently joined, I am not say more about the company."
good,There are a lot of great people at the combined Dell/EMC company.  My experience is they work collaboratively in the best interests of the customer.   Best of luck
good,"Dell was a good place to work. One of the nice benefits was working from home and the flexibility of going to appointments if necessary. If I didn't get laid off, I would still be working for Dell."
good,During the transition from EMC to Dell change was a daily thing. Many times change was not articulated - causing a lack of transparency and ability to my best work.
good,"I interned in a group that lacked the collaborative culture I expected.  While everyone was willing to help, everything was focused on units, revenue and margin.  I did not feel integrated with nor did I make any personal connections with full-time employees during my summer experience."
good,"Dell provided a great opportunity for me to launch my career and was a vibrant place to work. Over time, the company became very ""corporate."" The benefits were great, but the compensation was not, especially, for long-term employees."
good,"Overall good place to work. Organized, proficient. Stressful however. You definitely need to know what you are doing in order to work here.Managers were all good people and easy to get along with"
good,"Dell has a reputation, well-earned, for being a hard place to work. Dell prides itself on being ""direct"" - meaning people who rise to the top of the stack can tend to be very forceful in their demeanor. Nice guys finish last in that type of environment. The culture is changing, but slowly."
good,Great brand name - can get a meeting wtih almost any customer. The key is your account base and geeting your specialists into all your accounts. The role of the AE is to oversee all the sales aspects within the Dell family of products.
good,"Overall, it was ok. DELL doesnt care about employees. They could be fired anytime. Doesnt matter how many years you have been working. Better not to join DELL."
good,"Benefits are ok, standard for the corporate world. Growth is close to impossible. Jobs security very low, hence the morale low too. Decent work life balance though."
good,"Most managers are not concerned about leadership or managing a function."
good,There are a lot of hardworking and smart people at Dell EMC.  The work/life balance is pretty reasonable. Software teams use Extreme Programming methodologies.
good,Decent company. They have great overtime towards the end of the year. Not a hard job. Show up every day on time and they usually keep you. Night shift is the best
good,"Average work with little learning, good work life balance, average compensation. NO fun at work. The acquisition of EMC has made things worse for legacy EMC employees."
good,"É uma empresa boa para se trabalhar, porem o gerente da área era incapacitado para gerenciar pessoas, tudo na base do ""vamo que vamo"" e ainda por cima mentiroso. É uma empresa que possui beneficio legais, tem uma certa flexibilidade horário."
good,"Good place to work, if you are looking for big / Multinational company environment, team to interact in multiple geographic locations  such as India , Malaysia , Ireland & Brazil"
good,They dont have any good project. They just use freshers as labours. Some managers give the work which even a 12th standard student can do it if he knows ms-office.
good,"Good company, great benefits and give flexible work hours. But it does not give enough opportunity to grow if you are looking to keep up with industry trends ad technology"
good,Generous vacation time and good health insurance. My manager is excellent. Hours are long because of traffic so long days but it's fast paced and  says fly by
good,"With the merger of Dell and EMC, there is a lot of uncertainty and work force reduction. A work force reduction would be the only reason for me to leave Dell/EMC."
good,"The team I worked with was excellent, cohesive, and worked well together. The management was very micromanagement and political at every level, from local up to Mr. Dell."
good,"If you are looking for a position to ensure that you meet an awesome network of people and advance your resume immediately, then this is the place for you."
good,The current merger from EMC to Dell is causing a lot of havoc and confusion. The work environment has degraded and morale is low. It would be wise to avoid the mess until the dust settles.
good,Ambiente legal com pessoas cooperativas e dispostad a ajudar.
good,Dell was a great company to work for before they started buying a lot of acquisitions and had to do layoffs to make up for them.  Had to make job cuts for the price of those acquisitions.  Also sending jobs overseas.  It got to where things were cut throat working there.  Never knew when you were the one to be let go.
good,"Learned a lot of different things at Dell, lots of daily pressures and escalations.  The hardest things that we had to tackle daily was using their antiquated tools."
good,"Dell company is a average eco friendly and does not have balance equabilram between work and personal life"
good,"Dell is a very good company. Job security is there but very harsh environment in terms of promotion & appraisal."
good,"Great as a foot in the door place. Not long term. Great benefits and fairly decent pay but has the ability to drain you mentally with the tedious, repetitive work."
good,"A typical day of work at Dell / EMC for me started at home and  travelling from site to site repairing, installing and troubleshooting, storage hardware and SAN infrastructure. I learned how to troubleshoot nearly every EMC product, how to maintain high availability and how to communicate effectively with customers. The workplace culture was mostly older generation of IT personal and the hardest part of the job were the extreme hours and long nights driving far distances. Enjoyable parts of the job were few and far between, most of the satisfaction I gained was from amber lights turning green when the hardware problems were resolved."
good,A very fast paced place. we were reach a particular target on a daily basis. A good place to work. But it is also through a temporary staffing agency.
good,"1.Develop and design websites."
good,"A company deeply committed to integrity and responsibility and a passion for helping our customers succeed. Endless challenges and rewards. "
good,"work culture is good, however the lack of QA technical path. Never seen aggressive road map or product delivery. Product managers are  not fit to market."
good,This is a great company to work for. Great medical and dental plans. Great family benefits. The best part is the work life balance. Lack diversity and mature management
good,Work is fine. It's just exhausting since i worked in the night shift job. Great benefits but low salary. It's been years so i don't know if the review is still relevant.
good,"Working at EMC (now DELL) was fun at first, when I was a consultant, once I became an employee, I didn't have assignments that would utilize my learned skills."
good,"A typical day at work is very productive "
good,Having trouble defining value proposition.  Needs to learn how to listen to clients and stay ahead of the game if desires to continue to grow.  Unstable ecosystem as part of newly-minted Dell Technologies family.
good,"It was a standard temporary assignment through an employment agency for the DELL consumer electronics sales department. I was on the inbound side, had a 2 week paid training process. Great instructors, understanding managers. Typical call center. We were encouraged to learn every product in order to hit bonuses and metrics for certain peripherals, such as software, printers, and etc..."
good,"Dell carries a significant brand name not only in India but also across the globe. The Company gives its employees a platform to showcase their potential and enforces a culture of meritocracy irrespective of qualification and gender of the employees however it is evident that some employees are assigned roles that are not commensurate with the pay they get and some resources are over paid looking to their potential and the level of job they are expected to perform."
good,"Dell purchase Perot Systems back in September of 2009, the culture of both companies seemed to be a logical fit but as the months and years wore on the similarities vanished. The proud culture of Perot Systems no longer existed."
good,EMC Was a good place towork but with all the continued changes in executive leadership at the time there were a lot of uncertainties.  They paid well and when I first joined the company there was good things going on.
good,"Good company"
good,"The management is loose, work/life can be balanced pretty well. People connect in the small cycles, if you're not in the cycle, can be hard to play the game... work pace is slow, people are not quality driven"
good,"I enjoyed the flexible hours due to being a mother of 2, but the culture of the company wasn't that great.  You were just a number.  Never got raises or promotions, not great with that."
good,"I had been with Dell/Quest for five years.  I started as a business development representative and learned the art of prospecting and cold calling.  "
good,Good company. not much issue with the company. Some don't actually care. Nice experience with the company though...................................................................
good,"The company is concerned with meeting customer demands and making profit There is little to no support for career progression or additional training for certifications when asked to management for support Operationally, the tools used are complex and should be combined with some of the tools being antiquated. New tools for business are being created that should enhance the effectiveness of operations and help to increase quality of service and profit for its customers if utilized in the proper manner"
good,"A typical day includes lots of meetings, many via webex"
good,"Good training policies. Knowledgeable colleague. Great people to work with. "
good,"Really smart, hard working people. Made some great friendships and learned a lot. Very large and political at times. Very challenging industry"
good,"Good work environment. However, a lot of control is still with the US office so not much freedom in India. Lot of flexibility in work hours though the hours can be long and weekend work often happens sometimes without any notice."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Dell.  There are a lot of great people and they make the difference.  On the downside, Dell tends to outsource everything so opportunities to do great things are minimized."
good,I don't really feel like reviewing something that was a company that I worked for about 8 years ago.  That is really all I would like to say.
good,"I worked well under the supervisor and team with which I worked."
good,This job is okay if you want to sit and do nothing for hours.don't really like being on the phone the agent are the meanest. But it is not a hard job if you are a quick learner
good,It's a good platform for freshers where they groom themselves in bestway. They gave the training in all the aspects both in coding as well as in personnality development.
good,The constant changes made it difficult. Stressed out management and too many reports on what you are doing instead of being out with customers and growing the business. Reorgs are common place every few months with all the acquisitions along with new strategies and management.
good,"a typical day at work - 9 to 10 hours, but flexible"
good,"No work pressure you can enjoy your initial time of career. You get lots of friends to have fun in office and hang around,"
good,At one time it was a great place to work.  It has now gotten too large and politics are more important then performance.  Promotions are largely decided based on favoritism.
good,"This was a great company to work for. Provided benefits, room for advancement and several hours for overtime. I only wish the company was still open in North Carolina."
good,"EMC used to be good company from the employee perspective. However, nowadays more attentions seems to be paid to cutting expenses then growing revenue."
good,I do not want to complete a review about my current company. This should not have any weight on employment with any other company's.
good,"La empresa callo en baches que ya no va a poder reparar, al principio estava bien, pero despues callo y ya no va a poderse levantar"
good,Me not being a very techi person had to struggle initially. However was able to manage my work on call eventually. Received awads for production and quality.
good,"Limited work/life balance due to the amount of work. Management doesn't play well together. Great pay if you can deal with the chaos."
good,Working for a vendor has the benefit of being able to work with a lot of technology across many customers.  The challenge is the ever changing business directions and culture.
good,"Senior Analyst for Account Service Management. Hard work is recognized by your direct management but not much of anyone else. The account is more difficult than it should be, but that's a government entity for you."
good,Eight hour work days. Building relationships with 70 plus enterprise level business with 50 plus employees. The hardest part would be the amount of Enterprise level products in Dells Data Base. The most rewarding part of the job  would be building out an custom solution for a growing company.
good,Its good place for culture to work and life balance with job security but salary is the concern for the long term growth and focus to the profile.
good,"Small user base 1000 Chicago area end users."
good,"My job was interesting and I learned a lot regarding software and hardware.  The management were ""ok"" depending on ""who"" managed and the employees were nice.  Learning the job was not difficult, because the trainers were good."
good,"The work/life balance is great, as are the health benefits...but the environment is 100% corporate.  Little room for advancement."
good,"Simply put, this company and culture was not for me. Worked with a lot of bright individuals who loved their role but I decided to move on."
good,"Don't come here to develop software, there is nothing going on. Maybe if you want to build enterprise networking software but that's about it.."
good,"At some point, anyone costing more than $xx.00 per hour will be cut."
good,"My day is completely SQL Server DBA task related.  Setting up SS OS on VPN's, stand alone and Grid servers.  "
good,Banking team where I was part of is the niche team with all team members having vast experience in different domains. There are knowledge sharing sessions between domains. Management is helpful and aligned to company's objectives.
good,"The work environment is very good at Pivotal, Palo Alto. Gives a feeling of startup and you will want to work."
good,"•	Responsible for Software Update Management for Client’s infrastructure (desktops/servers)."
good,it was long hours but decent pay with plenty over time and hard work but it was a nice place to work overall and i would work there again
good,"The substantive work is challenging and rewarding, and opportunities to learn and perform additional functions abound. Unfortunately, company policy and management make it difficult to obtain raises and promotions, and employees shoulder greater responsibilities as time goes on without the appropriate recognition and reward."
good,many things can be said about this company most of which for me were great.  I was able to learn a lot in this place and came across many different people throughout the time I was here.  I enjoyed my years here and the people I got to work with daily.
good,Dell is a good company overall an offers some challenging work assignments.  I was exposed to many different products and services.
good,The career growth depends on the team and projects you are assigned to. If you end up being with a good team your work and contributions will be recognized.
good,"I loved my position and the duties of my role however the staffing agency of Dell seriously needs to change before there is a case against them. There is A LOT of workplace discrimination between the temporary agents to the permanent employees. Permanent employees can be tardy, not adhere to their schedules, wear whatever they please and do however they please including their cell phones. However if you're a temp you cannot be a minute late, you're under a microscope 24/7, if you even breathe wrong they will either call you in for a meeting or end your assignment. Coming from Apple where we were all one and treated equal with that family feeling as well as great open feedback sadly that is not the same for Dell. The temporary staff management does not listen to feedback but feels that you are attacking someone else and feels you should just keep your head down and mouth shut. I learned a lot in the short time I was with Dell however I feel their management needs to improve drastically!"
good,"Although Dell is a leader in the computer business, it has only a small portion dedicated to Healthcare.  The portion of the business I was involved in was sold to Conifer Healthcare."
good,Dell is a good company due to the great benefits + compensation plans/remuneration they offer. Dell is also a remote-friendly company which gives employees flexibility and increase their productivity.
good,"Depending on management you can have a super one, who knows their job, or one who is hands off and only looking out for themselves My supervisor never supplied on-boarding...rather ""Thrown to the wolves"""
good,"No dia-a-dia ser ágil."
good,Worked in small engineering group that supported larger engineering efforts. Staff reductions required learning many new things and taking on more responsibility. Co-workers were supportive. Management was not always aware of what was going on in our work group. Hardest part of the job was trying to stay ahead of the next layoff.
good,I joined perot in July 2007 and later on it aquired by dell. It was nice experience with perot with good opportunity. the dell aquired all perks and fun things stopped. Only thing i got in onsite opportunity with differnet skillset what i ahve so i kept on changing my technical skills with change of project. Overall not bad experience so far.
good,EMC is a large IT company world wide with a diverse work environment.
good,"Ce poste été pour moi une très bonne expériences "
good,"Typical big company culture, where most of the people who do the real work goes unnoticed."
good,"As a contractor my job was reliable, predictable and enjoyable. The month long training was excellent, my hours were always just as stated and I could always depend on my pay weekly. "
good,Dell was a great company with high attention to work life balance.
good,"Lots of Learning, Good Salary, but Average Management and Bad Work and Life balance. Work load is increasing day by day and they are not hiring more people, trying to get the excess work done by the same number of employees by increasing work pressure every single day. Although Good Salary but no salary hike in last 2 years"
good,"Traz a competição para dentro da Empresa onde nasce panelinhas . Não se preocupa com valores sociais, ambientais. Não é um ambiente para quem deseja manter uma família sem  ter que usar de agrados para acalmar a falta de vida familiar"
good,"dynamic and challenging company, great benefits,"
good,"Typical Day at work - very much same like any  mnc company."
good,"THe team I work for is strongly motivated to making the customer happy. Though there may be obstacles that can make this more difficult, the attitude of the employees is definitely for the customer. We realize the customer is the one who ultimately pays us our salaries, so it is important to keep them as happy as we can within the company guidelines."
good,Fun place to work but you were always unsure if layoffs would happen.
good,"The most enjoyable thing about my job was my continued development of the relationships with my customers and the support of my devoted colleagues.  EMC's vast line of products & portfolios are the best in the industry.  Though EMC needs to seriously look into its flawed management. How some managers treat individuals, allowed to get away with verbal abuse to their employees, racism against certain employees and customers, lack of compassion for employees and their families."
good,"Leading edge technologies and great place to work."
good,"dell is good company,good work life balance but no salary hike from last two years"
good,"good  company to develope our personal skills,the most enjoyable part of the life"
good,"Decent training but almost zero advancement opp.  Metrics were outdated, comp was extremely unbalanced across depts."
good,This is a good company for those who is not looking for money.
good,used highly developed sales skills to produce high volume sales through online channel.
good,"Pros:"
good,"Nice work life balance, "
good,"the good:"
good,"fast paced environment & great co-workers"
good,"Good company to work, where is possible to exchange experience day by day, due to different profiles of customers."
good,Manage territory customer accounts and account executives.
good,Had mixed experienced at work. Both fun and also hetic. Co-workers were supportive
good,Dell's an ok place to start off your career.  The people are nice and they had a good culture.
good,It is a good place to work.  I took incoming calls from a contracted company.  Management and co-workers were always helpful.  The hardest part was being short-staffed with service level agreements that needed to be met.
good,Good place to get training if you are right out of college.The work life balance was an issue in the past but not so much anymore if you are in the right group.
good,"Interfacing with customers, internal Project managers regarding dell OS imaging services."
good,"Manque de matériel ,mais le Directeur de l'entreprise est un excellent  management . le climat de travail était acceptable et les collaborateurs sont très coopérants ."
good,"This is a very cool place to work if you are permanent, the work for the most part is steady and you will know what is expected. But some of the management of this company have no idea whats going on or who their ""work horses"" are. Most of the good employees; (contract & permanent) often get overlooked and taken for grantited!"
good,As long as you have some luck you can make a lot of money there. Make sure you stay connected cause you can't get by just on hard work
good,"You can learn a lot at Dell. "
good,Dell provides excellent work experiences.  Challenges are in abundance.
good,"Working at Dell is hit or miss, depending on your manager you may or may not experience work/life balance which may or may not be traded off for compensation comensurate with your workload.  I know you expect that some directors and VP's live to work, at Dell, the vast size of the company seems to attract, promote and retain those individuals with a ""sleep is for the weak"" mindset.  Dell is a machine, treat it that way and you'll not be surprised and you can plan for the future accordingly, expect it to take care of you and it will eat you alive.  I love working here, I learn more in a few months than in years elsewhere, and I accept that this environment is a fast forward for my career, it comes at a steep price, I wouldn't recommend it for everyone, your personal life will suffer for your fast forward and the cut throat competitiveness increases as you rise.  I speak from a cost center, not a profit center perspective.  I have no idea how the customer facing roles fit with my description above, I'm speaking from a professional supporting role within corporate accounting."
good,EMC is a very difficult culture to work in.  The work environment is constantly changing.  Management changes frequently and the company re-organizes at least twice a year.  There are at least 2 layoffs a year.  With all of these external things going on it makes it extremely difficult for employees to focus on their jobs and responsibilities.  If you do not have a think skin it's very difficult to be successful in this environment.
good,"No detail review at this time.  Challenging work, fast paced, large company management style."
good,"when I hired in, i received 5 weeks of training, that did not adequately prepare me for the job. After 1 day on the job after training management expected me to be up to speed with the others who had been there for years. Not much advancement opportunity since promotion is governed by the ""buddy system"". This job doesn't give me the opportunity to apply what I have learned in my studies in college, as it applies to Information Systems and business. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping soldiers with their IT issues, supporting those who protect our freedom."
good,Its very nice time I Spent in Dell. My colleagues are very friendly nature.
good,"Its hard to say when you are an HR of a prestigious organisation but it help you a lot to learn from each and every employee.No matter a college passout or an expericenced Mr or Miss..."
good,"*Typical day is fast paced."
good,"Its a great Brand to start you career, if you learn Technology then you should work for this company."
good,"Dell is a great company for opportunity, global exposure, and varied experiences.  It really is a place that you make it as good as bad as you like.  Recently, Dell Services has undergone management changes and with the pending Dell privatization, I am not sure the direction of the future company.  I work on a Global team with distributed team members.  Work/Life balance is good, with the ability to work from home as long as you deliver what is expected."
good,"Great working environment, supportive colleagues, encouraging incentives. "
good,"Great team members in a fast changing environment. However, a company is going through a big transformation with lots of changes in strategy and management teams. "
good,I support physicians and nurses on the EMR. I work in an environment that fosters teamwork and collaboration. Management allows great flexibility to balance home. The hardest part of the job is that there is very little direction on how some things are done.
good,Very focused on resolving day-today customer problems. Customer comes first and employees come next.The most enjoyable part of the job has been the dedication and commitment of the local team members.
good,Overall Good co but lots of org changes
good,-work for 4 hours
good,Good to work here but no new things to learn.
good,Work is fast and furious. Entrepreneur mindset still dominates - to a fault. Nice people. Not very well organized. Coding cowboys rule; standards and processes are not common.
good,I did the scanner filled paper work out etc.The workers good but I was moved to Ceva
good,"I spent most of my time on the road in my territory. I had the full support of my manager, as well as my co-workers/teammates. Hardest part was going through integrations as a result of being acquirred"
good,"pros: good pay, good benefits, free meals occasionally"
good,"I was at Dell for a number of years, I have not negative to share as it groomed me for success in many of ways. I did have a bad experience with management but is that not how it is in most places?"
good,Dell service is good place to work..I learned good team behavior..I my coworker is also very co-operative.Hardest part of my job its very difficult to move from one system to another
good,Company is pretty stingy with raises and promotions. I got a promotion and received a 2% raise. It basically broke down to about a $1 an hour raise even though I am on salary
good,Dell is a competitive place of work with a lot of oppurtinites and very good support from the management .
good,Typical day is spent on the phone talking to customers about their current network set up for small offices with less than 10 employees
good,"Delegate work to service technicians. Keep up with records and paperwork,emails that were involved with the position. The most challenging part of my position is trying to keep everyone satisfied."
good,"I enjoyed the work but hated the fact that they changed my supervisor, because her replacement was not dependable. I learned a lot about the hiring process. The hardest part of the job ignoring what I felt were insensitive statement made by the recruiter I supported."
good,long working hours : hardest part
good,"Prepare the teams for the daily production schedule. Resolve issues that may arise during the day. Trouble shoot and repair computers that may have failed the process. Communicate with managers during Production meeting,email,IM and spreadsheets. Work in a team environment which dealing with teammates and there issues with others was the most challenging which help me be a better Team Lead. I also learned to be better organized, interviewing process, mentoring associates and preparing them for advancement which I greatly enjoyed."
good,Always outsourcing - so not much hope from stable career growth perspective
good,I am working in this co kitting the parts of computer.
good,"Dell spends a lot of it's time catching up instead of setting the pace. In the early years they set the pace. Now all of their production is overseas. The people are great, however many in managent positions are becoming out of touch with what is needed to keep productive people in the company. They do not provide a structured internal professional training program. The hardest part of the job is dealing with self imposed ambiguity. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and working with some very talented and ambitious people. Overall it is a good company."
good,Use to work for EMC. Good company with excellent benefits but they tend to keep allot of dead weight in the company which affect the product delivery. The leaders don't push you to grow and when it comes to appraisal review the average is 3%.
good,"EMC is a good company to work for but hard to get hired as an employee as most of the time they hire temporary workers,"
good,"This is a great company to work for. The only issue i have is they tell you they don't want you to have technical knowledge of the products you are selling and throw you to the wolves to early and the customer expects you to have the technical knowledge.  Dell should not put people on the floor/phones until they have a better grasp of the licenses they are selling,  All reps would tell you this."
good,"Call center environment. Government contract. Helpdesk was under staffed the majority of the time and operators were expected to absorb the overflow, no time between calls."
good,"Dell supports many companies so the work depends on which account you are on. The account I was on was for a global customer, so I encountered lots of diversity."
good,"the company is good, with maximum support from the management, although the perks associated with the role is less but in regards to the working culture it is competitive"
good,"Auditing the few processed documents which has to processed"
good,"A place that respects the bottom line. A place where results are king. Part meritocracy, part elbow-rubbing, and the rest about moving product with a focus on the customers."
good,very clean place to work the employess was very nice to work around. I would not want to make a career  out if this job. the job was very unstable. the work place enjoyable
good,"Can be a demanding work environment, employees are pleasant to work with. Work/ Life balance is not allows taken into consideration, could use some improvement in this area."
good,Dell seems like a great place but was only there during the merger.  I decided to take the 20 plus year severance package and start the next phase of my carrer
good,"Good thing is WFH is available , good bonus and yearly hike is also a good thing and movitation as well, Team provides limited access to work , should be move fun loving team."
good,They are an ok place to work. Very confusing at times and did not have a good path for promotion. My day was working with the customer and my boss. ok
good,Direction is lacking when leadership take numerous projects and just focus on ones that gain any ground. Employees feel expendable and passed over. Improvements have been happening though
good,I've learned a lot during my time at Dell. From networking concepts to storage technologies to virtualization. I've gained extensive knowledge supporting Enterprise customers and have gained invaluable  experience working with some of the best technology available.
good,"The product planning is pretty chaotic, redesigns were frequent.  Strict and obsessive agile methodology wasted time on unproductive activities.  Using agile for a primarily hardware product is inappropriate."
good,"Pros:"
good,"Dell as a whole is a good place to work, IF you have an experienced Manager who understands the Team Members needs and isn't just worried about their numbers."
good,Overall it is good company. Top management is good. At the end of the day you should get good manager who you report that matters and he should trust you.
good,I worked with SecureWorks/Dell for a total of 7 years.  It was a fast paced environment with constant change. I enjoyed the team I worked with and learned a great deal during my time with the company.
good,"I was there 2 weeks and gave 2 weeks notice.  Some* effort was put into the attempted success of a company wide migration that included customer support.  I love helping people but I’m a Professional and just simply did not feel like the job was on the same level.  I suppose I could’ve just said it wasn’t a good fit for me, but the fact is it wasn’t a good fit because a portion of it was not handled correctly."
good,A big company with challenging work. The management is good and working environment is flexible. Teamwork is the must in completing any task to achieve quality of result.
good,"In my role, I work with Desktop Engineering, Security and Wireless Services performing a range of duties which support Desktop Support, Service Desk, Warehouse, Test Lab and the Customer directly."
good,"Dell is several companies within one company.  Organizations are challenged to compete to ensure that they are most profitable and deliver the best products and services.  This does mean, however, that the customer is sometime not as well served as she could be."
good,Hard work and commitment really pays off at this leading technology company.  Work culture is continuously evolving with a good mix of pay and benefits.
good,I need to be organize and prepared to work long hours.  Be patient for waiting for parts to arrive and go to site to do the onsite service.  Be prepared for customer to be rude and impatient for the service to be service quickly.
good,"I enjoyed working from home for Dell. The company provided good benefits suchas PTO, sick time, 401k with match 6%. Cross training was very beneficial"
good,"Generally fun place to work at.  Skill set of teams was balanced, but team spirit was lacking. frequent organizational changes.  Some managers were micro managing."
good,The best thing about Dell was the client Athena. Great client and because of which people started to join crazy for them. Apart from that the management was always about cost reduction and politics was as usual.
good,"It is not for everyone but the benefits will pay off if anyone continues to work hard. Having a business owner mindset helps get the extra bonus and higher commission,"
good,"I was required for the software storage where EMC/DELL provided storage solutions and continue to grow its customer storage base.  "
good,It was fine working there as a gitex promoter. being there only for a couple weeks doesnt give allow me to judge the internal working conditions of the company so cant say anything.
good,"I like my job and team but I want to advance and I don't see much opportunity of that happening.  I feel I do great work but it doesn't get noticed.  Benefits good unless your spouse also works and has option for health benefits.  In this case insurance costs an extra ~$1,500 per year.  Seems like discrimination.  My bosses are friendly but hardly know I exist or are oblivious to my desire to advance though I have mentioned it several times."
good,This survey is incorrect.  All of the information posted is not relevant to what my resume provides.  Please use my resume versus this survey as it contains the correct information in the right format
good,"cultura buena, calidad de trabajo buena, ambiente bueno. compania tipica americana."
good,"Dell was very through in it's checking into your work history. They told me that I was off a day or month of employment on my application. You needed have a High School Diploma and be A+ certified to apply. I had neither. I checked out 10 books on computer hardware form the local library in the next two days I read them cover to cover and called to see if positions were still available. They had me come in and do about 8 hours of testing on a computer, they took a Urine sample right there and hired me. If you work the assembly line you will have a quota to make. I have long hair (musician) and was told I would have to cut it shorter than shoulder length.Understandable. Safety reasons(many conveyors) . I had a girlfriend who was a hair dresser who put my hair up in a Japanese bun and threw on a Baseball cap. They never knew. I did learn a lot there and Thanked them for the opportunity there when I left."
good,This was a contract job thru Apex Systems.  It was very hard to get hired by Dell.  So there was not a good way for advancement.  The pay was not enough to pay our bills.
good,"Good Work Life balance is the key factor"
good,"Friendly coworkers,"
good,"Hired on was told it's easy to move up and that the pay for my current position was non negotiable. Had over 15 years retail experience under my belt to be hired on at lowest level. Others hired after me with way less experience make 20k more because of the level Dell needed at that particular time (2 weeks after I was hired) Yet it was never even offered or mentioned to me based off my resume. Have been there 2 years, hit quota every time, applied for several positions, yet can't even get considered for an interview. I feel violated and lied to."
good,"Obtain non-technical support for licensing, warranty, online account and other types of administrative help for your Dell EMC products. If you need assistance with a Dell product (monitor, laptop, server, etc) please select Technical Support."
good,"A typical day at work started with 8 o'clock meeting at home ( if any) and  a second shift starting at 8:00 PM for evening meetings."
good,"Relaxed workplace environment."
good,"coming in with no lab experience I have had the opportunity to gain valuable server and configuration skills, we worked well as a team and assisted each other often."
good,I was given a much higher wage when Dell took over my contract (by almost $14K).  Dell's management knows what's up.  They are professionals and understand what it takes to stay well-oiled.
good,Dell had few clients in Singapore due to which it didn't grown much in service. Dell has that capability through which it and enhance it business but it doesn't worked it out.
good,"I was there for over 8 years in 4 different roles and about 6 managers, it was tough, they changed a lot, they were very hard to work for, or I should say the culture was difficult"
good,"Smart and good people, but still going through significant changes post merger with EMC. Continues to see turnover and organizational changes, but may be turning the corner."
good,"I enjoyed my time working for Dell, but company management did not do enough to satisfy to customer under the government contract we were working, and unfortunately, lost the contract,"
good,"Working at Dell you have the ability to work remotely, be part of a strong work culture, and have a diverse technology portfolio to discuss with customers."
good,Job provides pretty good starting salary with a chance to earn more through sales goals and incentives.  Hours are long and work on weekends is a possibility.
good,Dell Services Federal Gov is a great place to work for recent college graduates. It allows you the opportunity to grow as well as become accustom to working in the real world.
good,Dell is an ok company to work for. As usual it depends on the team and it's leadership you are working with. The pay and benefits are on par with the IT industry.
good,"It was a short job, updating computers at the VA hospital's disaster areas. Have no real opinion on the job. Was a decent paying job for what it was for."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was working with a great team of like minded individuals. Management was very indecisive. Employees were not compensated well and the company did not take care of its infrastructure team!
good,"Didn't feel important, working onsite at customer location and not in company headquarters."
good,Dell was an average place to work as a first job.  I worked in a remote location so the management most times seems dis-attached or separated from us.  The pay was okay for Mississippi but raises were few and far between.
good,"I left after VCE was acquired by EMC Corp., before Dell Corp. acquired EMC.  I have little information about the climate and leadership at the Dell run company."
good,"altijd veranderend, beursgenoteerd is soms uitdagend. jonge club."
good,"They changed management too much.  The rules changed almost every other week so it was hard to stay consistent in processing claims correctly.  But once they finally got a new Supervision and a new trainer, it made it a little better with consistency in processing. The benefits were not that bad.  I really did enjoy the flex time because it allowed many of us to take care of business without using so much of our PTO or call in.  "
good,"Good work life balance "
good,"Handled inbound technical phone calls, troubleshoot for customers, ensure warranty"
good,Office was great.  EMC was bought by Dell and the whole team was being re-organized.  they couldn't guarantee a permanent position and I foung a permanent position elsewhere
good,"Strong Portfolio of products"
good,Environment was constantly fast paced. Teams were good to work with and management was good. The facility was in order and there were many opportunities to advance.
good,"Admittedly my opinion on Dell is biased from the standpoint that I worked for an ""off-shoot"" of Dell in the Security Group, so I didn't really get a true firsthand feel for the ""Dell mainstream"" culture, but from what I could see and hear from others, Dell is just another grind shop in the industry which doesn't leave employees feeling proud to have worked there."
good,Its been over 15 years since I worked there so I'm not sure why I'm required to review the place.  They had a lot of great amenities onsite used by employees
good,"Typical work day consists of troubleshooting health related tickets, and joining bridge calls if deemed necessary. I have learned many technical skills from working with such knowledgeable coworkers as well as with management."
good,"You are actually a contractor. Not an employee."
good,It has been over 5 years since I was there and Dell has gone through many changes including the purchase of EMC. I do not know how that has affected the culture.
good,"Too big of a company, after 15 years you usually get laid off. Not a stable workplace, long hours.  Company big, I really don't want to fill all of this out to submit my application"
good,"Fast Paced Work Environment that is Ever Changing.  Be ready to pivot at any moment as goals, initiatives are forever changing quarter to quarter.  Able to cope with high stress a must."
good,"First job in Dell was good and very encouraging."
good,"Their class they taught for phone support was excellent.  I had been doing phone support for 20 years before my stint with Dell, but they made it fun and relevant. "
good,"Working at Dell was a fun experience. I was young and worked with other young professionals. The management was new so we all got to learn together. We went through many audits, so we all learned how to document process and grow as a team. I would recommend Dell to anyone looking for an opportunity for growth."
good,"People for the most part are/were excellent, work hard play hard. quite a few very smart folks made up very good teams. Dell management is another story. They are woefully understaffed with actual good managers"
good,"Good to work here but less opportunities from growth perspective. After merger with NTT no scope of growth.so work life balance impacted."
good,Strong numbers driven company on a daily basis. Leadership and management skills lacking to grow and develop new staff. Work hours were challenging at times.
good,"I liked working here because the hours/ work life balance is fair as long as your manager is flexible. Culture is good, people are encouraging and nice."
good,"Good people, but cut throat environment, Decent benefits and flextime work from home some days."
good,"Joined as an Associate and promoted as senior associate and a mentor for the team, received a gold star for exceptional performance and also have received many awards quarterly"
good,"The place is alright. I can't think of much else to say about it. I hope the people do well there, but I am ready to move on and try something different."
good,"I can only say how it used to be, and not how it is today.  Everything has changed since Dell went private and bought EMC, and I have no idea of the culture today."
good,"a lot of work from home option is there,"
good,"Good Job to get your foot in the door for Health insurance enrollment.  Monday through Friday type place except during open enrollment. Starting pay isn't bad, but there is not much opportunity to gave actual promotions, just a lot of unpaid Interim positions"
good,My days at EMC would be that I would receive a call to fix one of the clients server equipment. On some days it would be easy and some it would be very stressful.
good,"Nashua was a small field office and therefore most of the time, that allowed a local culture to exist that was less corporate and more relaxed than HQ. That was a good thing."
good,"Dell, like all companies, had its issues but overall was a good place to work.  The people were bright and professional and there were good opportunities for advancement."
good,"Besides the poor management and micro management of their employees, it was an excellent place to work and continue to learn. Due to the CEO leaving and coming back, disrupted the company for a couple of years. "
good,"very little room to advance from the engineering level, mgt really varies, budget cuts associated with acquisition result in lack of annual raises and travel freezes."
good,"Good workplace for growth, but the salary is not very competitive. Opportunities are there to learn and advance your career. More management focus is needed esp in the light of the recent Dell-EMC merger."
good,"Good Place to work. Good to learn many things. "
good,"Don't look for something that may or may not be there.  Make your own experience.  Whether hostile or nurturing, you surroundings can't affect you unless you allow it to."
good,"Job is very easy but mundane, the workers are great but the job offers no career advancement without someone leaving. Also contractor conversions are very rare."
good,Ambiente de trabajo distendido y buen equipo de trabajo
good,Such a good company and every holidays they will give such a unique premium pay.They have a small community and they will provide an allowance for your meal with the use of a meal card
good,"worked for EMC and a joint venture; VCE.  Working for EMC and then VCE was high paced, customer and success focused.  EMC experienced business downturn, was purchased by Dell.  Major reductions planned and since implemented.  The company I left is not what the company currently is."
good,"Not sure why this showed up as a place I have to review. I have never worked at Dell, for Dell, at a Dell location or manufacturing plant. But if I had, I am sure they are terribly nice people to work for."
good,There were many different companies that worked in the same building but with a different company in every room. The job was a fast paced inbound call center. Most company there were for some type of insurance.
good,"Great place to start if you are fresher, Amazing work Culture, Courteous people around who will help you al the time, When it comes to working hours the company gives you a lot of flexibility ."
good,"Over all happy with Dell but now need to move to next level in career and look for relocation. "
good,"Responsible for the management of departmental resources to maintain operational excellence for the plant. Manage a staff of five direct reports consisting of three Production Supervisors, one Administrative Assistant, and one Training Coordinator. Assisted senior management with strategic planning and worked across functions to solve technical, business, and personnel issues. Developed performance measurements and drove continuous improvement."
good,"Why is it, that something forces you to write a review for a company? Isn't this, I don't know, forcing people to divulge information so they can apply for a job? Are you sure you're morally correct in this? Ah who am I kidding, of course you don't!"
good,I spent 20 years at Dell in a variety of roles.  I definitely favored the production side over the services side.  I found management to be much more capable on the production side.
good,"Cost Optimization over Innovation"
good,"Not Dell Computers.  The hardest part of this job is dealing with new corporate changes, layoffs, focus changed to profit-driven from patient and employee first philosophy"
good,"Loved the ability to telecommute in my role.  No traffic hassle!  Loved my co-workers and working with other business groups to resolve issues, complete work or projects and participate in developing and testing new software tools."
good,"Assembly line worker, pick and sort, supplies, kept area clean, worked where ever they needed me never had a set job they treated full-time employees better than temp employees there was always drama with someone.  Never was real happy but I did my job and went home"
good,As a contractor it seemed more about the bottom dollar than its staff. For some you work in the same position for years. As for others you were gone in 6 months
good,My day consisted of answering client's calls so I could fix their networking equipment when it went down. I also installed different software when it was needed on clients' software.
good,Used to be a nice place to work with good work-life balance. Not much job security especially if you are originally from EMC. No clear communications from leadership.
good,Dell was fun in the day until they thought they had to run the the company just like every other large company. when they started doing that they just became another big company where you only got job advancement on who you know....not what you know.
good,Dell is still a good place to work although they were much better several years ago. If you're a sales person or account manager I would recommend Dell/EMC
good,Good exposure & lot of learning. Good benefits and insurance. Flexibility to work from home. Flexible hours & timings. Challenging opportunities & advanced technologies to work on.
good,"Shifts not allocated properly. No time for living. have to improve Communication, training plans for employees, rewards, culture.Carer progression available to all"
good,Due to separation agreement I am unable to discuss my views on my time at dell for 24 months. until that time I will not be able to provide requested information.
good,"Good company to relax, grow slowly and fantastic diverse culture."
good,gud for starters and good incentives.. holiday pay with offs. Employee trainings are done to educate and keep the employees up to date ..gecnologically
good,"The benefits were average, the PTO was pretty good. My department manager was good. Communication could definitely use improvement. Other than that it was a kick back job"
good,This was one of my favorite places to work. The work was challenging and rewarding and no day is the same. This is the place to be if you want to constantly challenge yourself.
good,"stressful working and slowing overnight "
good,"Empresa com muita ""politicagem"" interna. Precisa valorizar mais os colaboradores"
good,"Company has changed significantly since I left, so any commentary I might add is very dated and of little to no relevance."
good,Spent a summer @EMC. Great people but the intern program (at least 7 years ago) was limited to business and sales ops and there was little room to do anything else.
good,Was originally part of EMC and when Dell acquired the culture has been shifting from one that focused on top down sales model to one aimed at middle up.
good,"Great people and work environment, Challenging opportunities. People are willing to jump in and get any job done. Lots of opportunity to move around in the company,"
good,"Dell was well on its way to changing their culture for the better. They were learning the value of teaming vs every man/woman for him/herself. They were pushing employees to innovate, test and keep testing new ideas. It was rocking. Then they acquired the ultra-conservative, ultra-CYA, and failing EMC and took a big step backwards in many, not all, but many ways."
good,"Dell is a mixture of stressful but rewarding.  The atmosphere there can be a little bit competitive, depending on what segment you're working in.  Sales is cut-throat, but that's to be expected.  Overall, a great experience."
good,"Nothing to say. The company new how to run an account based DC."
good,"In a sales role, the number is the key driver for success. Though I understand this is the main responsibility for a sales professional, there needs to be some trade-off for establishing deep roots in a sales territory to help cultivate large and sustainable opportunities for greater revenue. When the drive to get to the quarterly (or half) sales quota is the only priority, sales people tend to cut corners to help get the job done. In a lot of cases, this is ultimately doing a disservice to the customer. "
good,"great start for the career. good induction or orientation process. best training provided for medical billing. moderate pay in the industry standards,"
good,"It was ok for a plant job. Very fast paced and exciting at times, but there is very little work life balance at this company. It is very difficult to advance from within as well. Poor management of labor and overtime."
good,"It is a good place to work. "
good,"I did not work for Dell, I worked on/with Dell computers. I have installed apps on Dell computers. I have configured and installed Dell computers, both desktop units and laptops."
good,"I worked at EMC, not Dell."
good,"I stayed in the same role in a stressful position too long and burned out. Time to take my knowledge, skills and passions and do something else. I'd rather stay at Dell actually but the PC gig is getting kind of old."
good,Everyone follows the rules but it is fun to work with people who knows the business well. The work is enjoyable even if the load is heavy. Diversity..
good,"Well equipped fitness center and no charge to use. Good cafeteria food selection and professional food service workers. Convenient parking and 24 hour, 7 day access to facilities."
good,"IT Projects Support. I traveled around to all the Seton hospitals setting up IT infrastructure for projects that were contracted to Dell. Fast paced, heavy workload."
good,"Worked for EMC before Dell, so not really know enough of it. EMC's culture is relatively stressful. The benefit was ok. Most people are friendly, but some are aggressive."
good,its fine place to work not great though. Managment are not that good and the company doesn't help or support job transfer or in case you want to relocate.
good,"It's awesome working from home, but one bad manager can spoil your day. My prior manager was freaking awesome, but our new manager has demoralized the entire team. Our dedicated client is insanely demanding, and that makes it a little tough. On the whole, it's been an awesome experience, but my time at Secureworks seems to be coming to a close."
good,Atividades desenvolvidas diariamente muito tranquilas.
good,"There are a lot of people that have been laid off as a result of Dell buying EMC Corporation and they're not done yet. Once the one year anniversary passes, there will be more layoffs."
good,Ok place to work.  A typical week was 50+ hours.  It was a stressful job environment but it was a job.  The campus is huge and offered a cafeteria and gym.
good,This is coming up as mandatory for me to fill out but I did not work here!! I cannot really provide an honest review since I have no experience with this company.
good,When Dell purchased EMC I was offered and accepted a severance package.  EMC was generally a good company to work for but the general expectation was that layoffs and outsourcing were coming so I left before that occurred.
good,"You'll like it here."
good,"Lots of challenges with fast growth of team and high expectations."
good,"Management by too much delegation.  "
good,Very stressful place to work. Very fast paced and competitive. Very time sensitive. Alot of things going on at the same time so you needed to be on yo
good,"Processed and adjudicate Medical claims - not a lot of inbound calls, was able to under stand what was needed from you.  Did need some help with training - (with unprepared individuals) and system issues"
good,"My personal preference lies in working for more family owned businesses. If you like the corporate atmosphere with more of a ""High School"" vibe, then by all means, apply!"
good,"I worked night shifts 10 hours per night, 4 nights a week. My work consisted of supporting computers hardware and software throughout a large factory facility, working around heavy machinery and walking an average of 4 to 7 miles a night in the performance of my responsibilities. "
good,I ended up working on many things that I did not want to work on and never worked on what I was hired to do. Obviously the whole company is not like this.
good,"Dell Business Sales was pretty fast paced. Alot of times, you would work a ten hour shift and it would go really fast. This mean not to much time for lunch. Again, if you are into sales there is some good opportunities for you."
good,"Transition is affected more , I was a part of dell softwares group but recently its move from dell India software and became a single identify , this will"
good,I loved working at EMC I have no idea what has changed since Dell took over. All I know is that a lot of the people I know got laid off and had to find new opportunities. My review is neither negative or positive.
good,Workplace culture was good.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility to work from home when needed.  I specifically enjoyed the team I worked with.
good,Dell purchased EMC in October of 2016 and my EMC job was eliminated in early 2017. I cannot comment on working at Dell as I was not there long enough to give a valid review.
good,"focussed work place at the same time fun-filled, nice colleagues, possess both good and not so good managers as part of the group and fast-paced environment"
good,"I worked for this company the longest in my life, i was able to learn a great deal out the in and out of Dell computers and pretty much all computers."
good,I cant say much as it was a long time ago. But I remember the pay being pretty good for full time employees. Good hours. Clean work environmrnt. If I would have stayed in Texas I would probably still be working there
good,"Relaxed place to work, not a whole lot of advancement. Straight pay-rate across the board. Seems like everyone has a big head and is power hungry. If you do well, they give you more responsibility with no pay compensation. Benefits are good, so no complain there."
good,Company was developing and expanding into desktop market so was a very fast paced and hectic environment.  Enterprise support team worked very efficiently and professionally.
good,"At least when I worked there, Dell was trying desperately to enter the federal services sector. In short, it failed miserably. That was no fault of the employees, but the blame was squarely on poor middle management. There was obvious bias between work sites and work projects."
good,"Customer support over the phone."
good,"Dell is a dynamic and fast moving place to work, first company to offer the direct sales model and as a business it constantly re-engineers itself to stay ahead of the competition"
good,DellEMC is trying to be make all parts of their business best in breed but in doing so have cut back in storage which is causing a loss in talent and direction. to many products in the portfolio
good,Worked for three years on a new hardware project. Scrum teams worked in two week sprints using Lean Agile methodology. I enjoyed the work and learning new skills.
good,"I did enjoy my experience at dell,learned a great deal about technology and how to run my own business, The managers I had were great they just changed numerous amounts of time with all the turnover in the company."
good,"assembly line worker wow! learned how to label and sort product and prepare for large shipment. a typical work day prolonged standing either placing and item in a box then with label, or installing an device to help build a piece of equipment all will on an assembly line"
good,"I can't really comment because worked there as intern and contract worker. Only worked as summer intern, and then again as a contract worker several years later."
good,Potentially to make  a lot of money.  Though they are too focus on meaningless metrics.  Great people to work with and a fun culture.  Management seems blind at time.
good,"See ""star"" rating above. A typical work day is consumed with responding to email from internal team member. The workplace has a diverse culture of employees. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a great team."
good,I worked at Dell in 1999. It was very busy selling computers on the phone thanks to the fear of Y2K. After New Years 2000 people realized that the world wasn't going to end and the sales floor went from 150 people to 20. There were no calls. There was a base salary if you made your quota. But this proved difficult when there weren't a lot of calls. I just couldn't afford to work there anymore. It may have changed now.
good,"Over the years it simply came down to who you were working for at the time and what the global initiatives were that year. Overall still a good company, but I have been there in a few years."
good,"I enjoyed my time at EMC (now Dell EMC), however I would say they earn their pound of flesh from you!! Pay is generally pretty good, the vas majority of people and nice and helpful, however success was very much based on what seemingly random sales target you would get for the year and therefore how likely you were to hit your numbers."
good,"Good place to work for. Work life balance. Typical office hours would be 9:30 am to 5:30 pm. Also, the culture depends on the group you'll work in. Friendly management."
good,"I was responsible for growing Dell/KACE systems management revenue, margin, and services.Managed all public sector accounts in a 12 state region. Accounts included higher education, K12, healthcare, state and local government, and federal government."
good,"My First Job is in Dell International Services, I have enjoyed my job loved and learned many things about the employees and management strategies. How to communicate to the leaders, management and Sales Techniques."
good,My view of Dell is from a tech support role so if that is your cup of tea then I would say it is a good place to work. Lots of opportunities to learn. It is what you make it I guess.
good,"Pros:"
good,"Lots of changes recently with the buyout. A good company, but an unsure time. There are multiple jobs within this company, allowing for many internal moved."
good,I work at Dell EMC . There is  Good work life balance but very less hike and promotions are very limited .contract employees are hardly converted to permanent
good,Dell pushed the industry to deliver cost effective solutions.  The hectic pace was driven by quarterly results which adds to the excitement and stress.
good,"You can gain experience. Good place to work, helpful colleagues."
good,If you are lucky and get the right account set it will be a great career. There are many ups and downs based on the current market. There is plenty of busy work they will have you to do.
good,The place can be good or bad (depending on which dept you work in). Raises aren't given out as much as in the past. There is also more micro-managing going on these days.
good,"Not much of Stress of the employees"
good,"Dell Technologies is a big company.  If you like that, it's for you.  There are many opportunities within the company, but many times headcount reduction is needed and so there are layoffs."
good,"Dell employees over 55,000 people so it can be hard to get noticed and working your way up the ladder is very interesting. You are better off leaving and coming back to move up.  Also you can be subject to giant layoffs."
good,They give you the power to complete anything you want. They live by the honor system and most employees are willing to give you an extra helping hand.
good,"Dell is fast-paced and can be difficult. Dell Services changes daily and the work is often ambiguous. One will need to be good working with little direction. Management expects you to be self-sufficient and product results; get the job done. Building internal and external networks is paramount. It is definitely not who, but what you know to get things done quickly and efficiently. Sales is relentless as the above holds true; do your job and all is well. Overall great place to work. New to Dell will take some adjustment. Don't give up in the first year. Keep your head down, work hard and you can have a long career with Dell, Dell Services, etc."
good,"Dell used to be a different place to work, for sales. We are asked to do more with less, continually. I have been here for a long time and we are entering a different era, and many long timers agree. I believe in Dell though."
good,Leading a team of developer. Was also Product Owner for one of the Theme called TCO. This group used to develop tools for Customer and QA team to automate the process of installation and upgrade process. Developed Failover solution/ High availabilty for all the product under Smarts team
good,Its one of the nice company to work with. Shift timings is 10hrs. Weekend holiday. Bonus and Yearly incriment alone not available. Growth in work is not available.
good,"Dell was one of the best companies I worked for. I have had a great opportunity to progress and excel my career during my 5 year tenure at Dell. If it was not for the internship with BSI in the UK I would not have moved on from there,"
good,"Uma empresa muito boa, que observa o trabalho em equipe e aposta na união e harmonia dos funcionarios."
good,I definitely learned a lot more knowledge on desktops and laptops in my tenure with Dell. I was able to support customers with the skills and mindset on investing in a $1000 product.
good,"Very well managed company. Management and Human Resources departments are very helpful and will answer employee questions in a short manner. Workplace was good, advancement within the company. Learned how to do data entry functions and file clerk functions, followed my mail clerk functions as well."
good,"Inspiring people around you."
good,"Productive and fun workplace,"
good,"It was super good when it was good, but bad when it was bad. 8hr days are great, however the work environment was crazy when it came to being on two chats at once."
good,"Dell is a burn out job.  It is a great job for about 2 years, and then you will fall into zombie land.  The pay is good, but it is a cut-throat environment!"
good,Dell Services which is now NTT Data Services is mid range IT Services company. It is going through transition phase and will take some time to stabilize.
good,"Very set in old way of doing things. Very nice people, but over worked. There is not a sense of excellence when working on projects. Everything is about getting things done the cheapest way possible."
good,Best jobs seem to be those in salary because the sales quotas are inconsistent and often unattainable. What used to be a nimble business able to quickly react to the market is now a lumbering giant. Far too many of the people that made Dell great are long sense gone along with the once great Dell culture.
good,"Interesting projects of backup/restore and replication applications."
good,"You work that you may keep pace with"
good,"at dell we get lot  many new things learn at a workplace every day, a friendly management and comfortable workplace. diverse environment make it a best organization."
good,It is a not bad place to work. Workload is OK. But on-call duty is heavy. No overtime pay for on-call duty. The hardest part of the job is the on call.
good,It is a good company for freshers. As I was working on US shift. There was very little work life balance. Got to learn more technical skills. Good managers.
good,"Since its an MNC company it's take lot of time to for us to show our skills."
good,"5 weeks of dell courses and tests.  There was little to no hands on training, just an avenue too help pass all the tests. No rental car for 5 weeks, had to be shuttled from hotel to office."
good,"company is undergoing lots of change. Nothing much can be told as of now. very early to comment on the working culture and other details."
good,"The experience here was okay, not too good, and not too bad. I was working as a software test engg here and they kept on changing projects, and realigning a lot."
good,"Giant US Company to work with "
good,"Good Company, Need to be systematic for career growth, No business growth only accounts running from long time, mostly operation work, no development work"
good,ENJOYED THE JOB great enviroment. the one thing i would have changd would be the fact tha i was part tine i woud have loved too have vacation time and beniits
good,"Here we learn new technologies, good work culture, Organisation is very much result driven."
good,Good place to work. Enough opportunities. Post acquisition some issues in terms of direction and responsibilities. Work culture is good and one enjoys working here.
good,Workplace culture was good. Training was given before we hit the floor.only concern was work shift time as we need to work late nights.mostly between 12 am to 6am
good,A Good Workplace To Learn The Corporate Work Culture And The Demands Of Working At A Busy Technical Support Center. Benefits And Progression Are However A Slight Bit Slower Than In Other Places...
good,"first thing in the morning, we would alternate phone coverage, main functions were to be assigned work from our paperless system and process employee applications or cancellations, this would take a good part of the day and answer inquiries coming from other departments, mainly from customer service department...could be a customer wanted to know what they owed on a bill or they did not understand there bill...management was not too supportive of there employees, we were treated as just a number, there was no loyalty, we did have some fun, especially around the holidays, we would once in while have a pot luck or raffle off gift baskets."
good,"Good place to work. Got many opportunity to learn about technical things like third party software and Dell software , Dell products. Got hands on experience on customer obsession"
good,It was a very nice area to work in. I worked on a contract there and havent has any bad experience. Great work environment and great people to work with.
good,"not great work life balance, glorified call center position dealing with a lot of angry customers. Little guidance from management, not enough training."
good,"Nice Place to work and explore"
good,"stress is there"
good,"Assist on site engineers when needed.  Travel to customer locations to help install, upgrade, maintain, and deinstall EMC devices.  Worked mostly from home.  20 percent travel."
good,"Dell has changed their business model to be more of a hardware solutions provider and as such, our division, which is more services related, does not fit the model.  That's why Dell has sold us.  To that end, we never felt as if we were part of the organization."
good,"This company provided a lot of flexibility in the past.  This was something that was hard to come by.  I think a lot has changed since I left, but it was full of opportunity a few years ago."
good,"Al types of good at work.. I learning from team work..good "
good,"Dell empowers countries, communities, customers and people everywhere to use technology to realize their dreams. Customers trust us to deliver technology solutions that help them do and achieve more, whether they’re at home, work, school or anywhere in their world. Learn more about our story, purpose and people behind our customer-centric approach."
good,"I didn't like working there"
good,This was my first company and I have learned a lot. The only issue was w.r.t the compensation and the distance from my house. I must def admit that this company gave me a base
good,"Un ambiente muy competitivo, pero con competencia muy desleal. Todos quieren surgir a costa del trabajo e ideas de los otros. Nunca han aprendido la verdadera filosofía del DELL, desarrollar a los demás es hacerlos crecer y así tu también crecerás."
good,"It was a very fast paced environment the management  was kind and friendly the hardest part of my job was not being able to assist a member with there health insurance based off their income, the best part is hearing my customers happy"
good,EMC2 was better placed to work. After Acquisition nothing sounds good here especially EMC Banglore. Management becomes too much cost saving and removed all employee benefits. Firing happening frequently.
good,Learnt lot from here I know to manage and to tackle how to work and adjust the works. So am perfectly good to work in any situation and infrastructure.
good,"Good training provided. Good company to work for but salary isn't the best. Not to much progression available either. Also some good people work there, the managers were quite good."
good,"A lot of travel at the time, a lot of late hours, and not much of a work life balance.  But this job, allow me to experience more of the world."
good,Overall this is a good company to work for. It could improve in some areas. Management is understanding and understands the work and family life balance.
good,"Processed orders from 8-5 long days sometimes long nights "
good,"I only worked here for a short time, i worked in the death claims department and there were 4 of us on the phones and 7 or 8 that just processed death claims, management treated the phone people differently than the processors."
good,"a typical day at work, was working spreadsheets and reports that I was accustom to seeing that type of work was automatic from my previous employer."
good,Some managers would favor some over others. Dell was overall a good place to work at. I've gained a lot of experience working there and I'm thankful for that.
good,"The work was very manageable once you get use to all of the different things that you have to do such as recabling, installing servers, and moving equipment around."
good,"Dell is a great place to work if you like a fast paced and ever changing work environment. Dell has great perks like the ability to work from home or remotely anywhere in the U.S. However, the healthcare benefits are not that great, but I assume that is true for many large companies lately since the cost of healthcare is rising."
good,It's very nice to work with the company. Good working environment. Very cooperative companions. Look forward to working with dell.
good,"Channel expansion was a main focus thru VARs and distribution so channel strategy, enablement and execution were top priority in the company"
good,When I started at Dell I was in a tough situation and needed a job quick. I learned a lot of customer service skills. I learned to believe in my self.
good,The day is fast regardless of your job. The culture is always upbeat and forward moving .If you need anything your manager is there to help. A lot of good people worked there
good,"Buena para desarrollo personal pero muy exigente. Por lo general exígia una gran organización y el manejo de numerosos clientes, por otro lado requiere de altos conocimientos técnicos."
good,"At the time I worked there, manager was inexperienced and communication was lacking.  Typical workday was 8-4:30.  Most enjoyable part was the actual work.  Most difficult part of the day was the lack of communication."
good,"Provided onsite support for diverse and complex work stations including hardware and software configuration and application, and troubleshooting network problems server environments desktop support."
good,"The company is a decent company. However, the leadership team wants instant results and not allowing certain organization changes to bake before proposing additional changes. Dell is a demanding company and anyone who joins must be ready to stay on their feet at all times. Dell is a numbers company and if numbers are not met then changes will ensue."
good,"I work as installer and supervisor for all types of thermal insulation (cold-hot-personal protection -acoustic)."
good,"This was an engineering firm acquired by Dell at the time I worked there, and no longer held by Dell now.  Workplace was very modern, secure and accommodating.  However management was relatively young, narrowly developed, grown in house and not seasoned with much outside experience and hence did not lend an ear to advisement or strategy on matters.  Work load was not acquired sufficiently to sustain the manpower.  Management was not open to alternative directions for gaining new workloads/revenue."
good,"I worked for Dell for 3 1/2 out of the past 5 years - I received 3 merit increases, and been laid off twice.  I enjoyed my work, and respected my management in the department."
good,Work life balance is lagging as employees are requested to present at office during working hours .As it is recently migrated to DELL it is too early to provide a review about the company.
good,"This review refers to the time I spent working with the Documentum team of EMC prior to the merger with Dell. "
good,"Managed North America Channel Marketing and Programs so was involved in channel strategy, partner development, lead gen, communications, channel processes and systems to achieve business objectives."
good,"Hi,"
good,"Management is focused on consuming EMC acquisition. Not sure how successful Dell will be in such a mammoth task."
good,productive and fun working place. Got good experience in testing and good exposer with other applications. Attended trainings a sand when required for updating my skills.was responsible for E2E testing. got opportunity to lead a team of 3
good,"It was a good work environment but, the job isn't stable. I would have loved the job if they were stable. I learned to work with a team and further develop my computer skills."
good,Good brand to work with. Good learning experience platform for freshers to gain knowledge of various industry functions. Overall nice place to work with.
good,"Contractor"
good,Great company to work & learning opportunity. Nice co worker & competitive environment. Enjoyed working in Dell with work from home option.
good,Management is not good.your efforts don't get duly recognized.People who are in one project stay for long and you don't get a chance for career growth.Not an employee oriented company
good,One thing about my company that I really like is the teamwork. There is a sense of partnership and pulling together. That is important to me in my job
good,"DELL is an excellent place to work, Employee-Manager relationship is excellent. Frequent off sites and team lunches really motivate team members and keeps the team bonding at a high"
good,Managing a high performing team of corporate aligned sales executives/account managers.  Cross range of sales motions with focus on enterprise and mid market customers.
good,The Job is good the flex schedule is great the Manager is great but due to high management turnover and no solid stratogy overall the software divisions of Dell are doomed to sell offs or kill-offs.
good,En general muy buena la experiencia y donde aprendí muchas cosas
good,"Dell is a great place to work and just like any other big corporation, it really depends on your role, organization, and leadership team. Benefits and compensation are fair for all the work we do."
good,"great job to work on people skills. a typical day is answering about 7 or 8 calls a day, emailing customers back, setting up service when needed. I learned that it does not hurt to ask question and for help. co-workers are friendly. the hardest part is handling case loads. the most enjoyable party is helping customer with there issues."
good,"Technical details on Storage.... Was in Pre Sales team. Handled East, Bangladesh and Nepal. It was a good experience in IT Storage at EMC"
good,Lots of opportunity at EMC but also a lot of red tape and low salaries.  Would suggest this company as a great place to learn and springboard elsewhere.
good,"A company that does not care enough about their employees and their personal growth and career development."
good,"Good job, but political. A lot of managers have no idea what they are doing. Good old boy network in full effect. Would work there for the right team."
good,"This position is excellent at training you for a broad wealth of knowledge across the enterprise space. But if you really want to set yourself apart from the rest then you have to spend extensive amounts of time to differentiate yourself from the pack. It gives you the opportunity to get a small bit a knowledge about a wide portfolio of products, but you have to rely on specialists to be effective. "
good,"I am working with dell since 1.5 years "
good,"- Typical day has lot of security related incidents and alerts."
good,suited to professionals who can handle a fast paced environment with rapid change which can be constant across many of the organizations.
good,"I've worked at Dell for almost 2 years and the company definitely has it's upsides.  I learned a lot from the company, but the training is lacking.  It's sink or swim and very difficult to advance and be promoted.  Management does it's best to help, but the large company roadblocks make it difficult."
good,"Great co-workers, a solid & reliable team & management that backed up staff & supported them. Good equipment / hardware & one of the best office facilities/environments"
good,"I think the main problem with my job here was the management. There was internal conflict, and the management wasn't that great. Shortly after I left the owner left as well of the branch I was at."
good,"EMC is a Nice place to stay back a long time, but recent market dynamics have not been good for EMC management."
good,"Working at EMC was always challenging and you learned constantly."
good,"This is a place that's good for starting up. What you put in is what you get out. Learn as much as you can, then move on after 1-2 years."
good,"I enjoyed this job for one reason... learning tech support. Sitting in a cubicle all day wasn't fun,but dealing with new customers was a challenge."
good,An interesting place to gain experience and learn new skills.  The company is restructuring but made an effort to offer staff options for work and gaining experience.
good,This Work place provide me with the ample amount of Growth opportunities but lack the flexibility to evolve as a person.
good,There are way too many chiefs trying to pull everyone in opposite directions. And they are very quick to throw you away for their personal gain.
good,EMC is a great place to work and provides employees with great resources to get the job done. However ever since the Dell merger announcement things have got a bit rough; decision making is slow; the company is trying to save cash and not making any investment. Also there is no firm direction as top management is uncertain about the merger agreement and whether it will happen.
good,"Dell Services is about to be sold off so I really doesn't matter what I write about them. However, so far I have not had a very pleasant experience in that our customers boss us around and we have no backing to be able to stop it."
good,"Was directly reporting to the VP where in I was handling the all India network of dealers. Was the liaison between Sales, Production, Accounting & Management."
good,"Dell is in the business of selling things.  Their business shifts on a daily basis, and they are willing to make large changes often. This makes for an exciting working environment because something new is always happening. It can be challenging, because workforce reductions are a common occurrence somewhere within the company in any given quarter, and people tend to cycle in and out."
good,Busy days which I like. Learned a lot about factory work and working with a team. Management was ok you were left to it but when any issues or difficulties which prevented you from continuing your work was a little slow to help. My co- workers were fun ambitious and down for a laugh. The hardest part of the job was the long hours and having to do swing shifts. The most enjoyable part was the end results and knowing there will be a happy customer.
good,The Dell Healthcare Services strategy for UK is not realistic and this is proven by their need to sell the business and focus on the hardware side of the business.
good,"Days go by fast, always running 100 miles an hour. Accountability is 24x7. Responsibilities span wide which is good. Ability to change processes is more limited as the company grew larger. Not as nimble as they used to be."
good,Loved working in Dell except for the very long night shifts. Later on it started asking us TECHS to sell and then left the company.
good,"As large companies go, Dell is a good place to work, however the executive management team doesn't seem to be up to the task of transitioning the company from a strictly hardware-focused business to being a complete (end-to-end) solution provider (which includes software and services).  There are far too many old-guard managers who appear to be incapable of or unwilling to cross functional lines to work together to bring the company transition to fruition."
good,"Progressive Work Environment"
good,Dell is not a great place to be in for women. Women employees are harassed and taken advantage of. It is not a great place to be in.
good,"Handling calls, Assisting the managing Director and the corresponding with the marketing team. Handled all company emails and directed to respective departments. Managed filing system and attendance"
good,"Its a fun and good company to work for. Ability to treat team with"
good,"I am a goal oriented worker with 25 years of experience in IT, with the last 5 years focused on server HP G5-G9 and Virtualization."
good,"Imaging computers,  configuring computers"
good,"Job culture demands you to modify your skill sets as per the need of project. The good thing about thing is that you learn new things and the bad thing is of course, the modification part."
good,"Dell was a fine place to work. Great salary with great benefits. ""Show up every day and do your job"" kind of place; your typical American corporate gig."
good,Great people to work with.  Very intelligent and hard working. Willing to take on the extra effort to get things done. Will work long hours when needed.  Lots of training offered however sometimes the time to take the training is restricted. All is done on line restricting the personal interaction.
good,"Capable management, good people and good products but high turnover. Still heavily dependent on low-margin consumer business."

good,"Nice place to work with multiple technologies."
good,Dell was very enjoyable to work at. Good management and flexible with employee needs outside the business. The facility shutdown shortly after my departure and moved to Ohio.
good,Coworkers are great and supportive. Always different challenges. Quality of management in HR varies depending on what group you're in.  Most challenging part of job is the bureaucracy of a big company and trying to make significant impact.
good,Dell was an excellent first job to be able to develop skills and advance my knowledge in the technology arena. Trainers trained very well to support the product and L2 had answers for hard problems quickly
good,"I feel as if the job can be a great place to work if everyone knew how to act like adults and get along with one another. I have been here for a 1 year. The job is very diverse and you can learn alot from working here. There is a lot of things that can be improved upon but, it is hard to change things here when you are only a contractor. The hardest part of the job would be making sure you are doing your job correctly and that there is no issues. The enjoyable part is meeting new people and learning new things."
good,"Very bad place to work, the management doesn't take their jobs very seriously. I was unfortunately stuck at the same position for two years and didn't have any opportunity to progress in the company."

good,"They give you a very nice laptop so you can work from home when needed."
good,"I wish I had something positive to say about EMC. Unfortunately, they filled my head with false hope. They said I had a year to pass a certification exam, but let me go after I was unable to pass it in under 3 months. During this time I was expected to pass different test each week. This fast passed expectation only lead to anxiety and ultimately my inability to pass the initial exam. They assured me that I still had time, but let me go at the end of my training. I left my previous job for EMC and I regret doing so. They should be more upfront about their expectations. In addition they should allow for more time or early access to the study material so that people attempting this entry level position can better prepare for the rigorous ""boot camp"" EMC puts you through in Boston, MA."
good,Workload was the hardest part of the Job. sales reps often had too many other distractions to concentrate 100% on selling. Management from the start was excellent then as it moved to more corporate remote managers it was only focused on sales numbers. co workers were the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,Emerald City Designs is a very upscale and professional place to work.  They allowed their employees to use a lot of creativity.  It was very neat to see all of the classy and fun events.

good,"A typical day at work is dynamic and ever-changing. There is much to learn at Dell due to size and industry of the company. If you are adverse to change and ambiguity this will not be a good fit for you. Management is professional, but your mileage will vary depending on what part of the company you are in. Co-workers are quite diverse as Dell employs over 100,000 people globally. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the corporate politics and bureaucratic obstacles that prevent one from getting the job done efficiently and effectively. The best part of the job has been building relationships and working with amazingly talented people from all over the world."
good,In my time there I learned how to assemble electronic cigarettes. The workplace didn't provide much room for error or nonsense. A well rounded job that paid well and had good benefits overall.

good,I left this company do to new opportunity. The company didn't respect my wish during my departure that lead to complaints.
good,At work we sit at our desks and answer phones and support end users. I learned the ability to fix problems by remote and how to be a better troubleshooter. Management has pretty good approaches to things and they are easy to talk to. I love my co-workers there very friendly. Hardest part of the job is figuring out what to do with tickets and the high stress of a call center. Most enjoyable is they let me have time off to pursue my development skills.

Dit overleg is van belang om een helicoptervieuw te blijven behouden over de afdeling, wat speelt er, waar liggen kansen en mogelijkheden en welke prioriteiten moeten er gesteld worden voor die dag. De hektiek en drukte is dusdanig dat het ieder moment van de dag een uitdaging is om alle commerciele taken en doelen voor ogen te hebben en na te streven.

good,"I've worked for Dell as a contractor and also as a permanent employee. The culture is very compartmentalized. Compensation is decent, but advancement in the company is mired in red tape. After applying to a job on their internal site, I was told that I wouldn't be considered for a position because the pay disparity between the position I was in and the position I was applying for was too great. I was more than qualified for the position in every other way. My HR rep went as far as to suggest my leaving the company and reapplying after 9 months for the position I wanted as being an alternative. "
good,"Long hours."
good,"In My Perspective Dell provide good transport facility and it is a great security for all employees who are all working there, We have a team outing once in quarter and we have a hike once in a year and we have been awarded for the production, quality and attendance once in quarter."

good,"Very fast paced work environment, you will learn quickly, and team members and manager are"
good,"Company had a great start, went south after hiring a lot of outside management.  Focus went from quality and customer service to cost containment (OPEX).

good,"Dell is not the kind of place you go to for changing the world or to be recognized for your efforts in trying to do so. Satisfaction varies widely by position and management reporting structure. Opportunities are best for those with a good buddy network or a dang the torpedoes ethic. Frustration is around every corner. There are some gems and some really good people, but not nearly as many as you would think in such a large place."
good,"Making a million phone calls in cubicle...get ready to wear a headset.  A sweatshop, but learned a lot about hardware and software."
good,"While at work, you usually receive one hundred or more compensation tasks via email/IM issues to resolve daily.  I learned to multi-task financially in different programs and in- conference calls, excellent customer service, and diverse approaches in problem solving. Complete as many tasks and calculations, and reporting during the week to meet close deadlines for pay reviews and exception reviews to become successful. Management treated the employees with disrespect, and had HR issues, they also decided to outsource entire teams instead of attempting to find a better business solution. The hardest part of the job was ensuring payouts and reviews were 100% accurate, with system issues always present. The challenge was the most enjoyable part of the job, and working with dedicated and intelligent team members."

I am thankful to this organization for establishing a strong and experienced business professional in me. My personal observation is that Dell gaps in retaining high quality management staff. Constant reorganization and frequent changes in my direct management (11-12 times for that past three years) have been the hardest part of my job in my pursue of career growth. I have very good memories of the times when Dell felt and was my other family. The most enjoyable part of the job is the personal gratification from achieving company's goals, enabling every customer to grow and thrive by sharing latest technology and know how, as well as driving a Leadership Development Program to set my teams for success on a clear career path."

good,had a good environment to work with our manager and team members.
good,"Dell has nearly sucked out nearly all of my ambition and desire to achieve. It feels as if no matter how hard you work, what you accomplish, or improvements (to the process or environment) it is just not good enough to warrant an award, promotion, or pat on the back."

good,"Not a bad place to work, great people. Global challenges with stiff competition."
good,It was fun & Learn at work always.
good,"I can only assume by looking at others around me that Dell was a pretty good place to work. My specific group had a rough start but had mostly ironed out by the time I left. As a whole, the company seems to be going in the right direction if they can stay on track while not forgetting the sacrifices of the employees that stuck through the bad times."
good,Dell was an enjoyable place to work with career advancement opportunities.
good,"I think the company was an excellent place to work. I would still be employed, if they didn't close my location. I didn't have any major issues with Dell other than that."
good,"great place for those starting out, It took me too long to get at the same pay scale as others though in different companies with same timeline and experience but less success."
good,"Large stale company with products were falling behind. If you weren't in Boston (corp) you couldn't move into a leadership position. Good employees, decent expense report flexibility."
good,Job responsibilities can be very tedious. Often hard to move up in the company. Pay is not too competitive with other companies. Culture is very laid back. Working from home is the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Flexible workplace with a great work/life balance and high job security. Pockets of innovation, some legacy applications that desperately need to be updated, but overall moving in the right direction of modernization."
good,"I was a long time employee at Dell and would like to remind everyone that one's happiness can be greatly impacted by the quality of your manager, as well as, the quality and attitude of your teammates.  Unfortunately, I experienced situations that were great to those that were miserable.  "
good,Good experience with Dell now it's NTT data and very productive and we have lots of fun . Good facility they providing. Best complete CPC and join as medical coder at Dell gives bright future.
good,"Be prepared to work hard. The training is somewhat unstructured. Some get more formal classroom training, and some get none. I had to train by observing others, taking notes, and asking lots of questions."
good,Everyone I worked with on-site at Dell was fantastic.  Very friendly and easy to work with.  I had a few issues with upper management not listening to the local engineering site in MN and making some bad decisions.
good,At Dell what I like most is allowing the employees to pace their deliverable s. There is no expectations of start / stop work schedule in a day. However that makes the employee available 24/7 but I think that is a good thing because employees are able to attend to their personal family matters whenever it does not conflict with any work related meetings. This actually maximizes productivity and keeps a healthy work / life balance.
good,"Working for Dell is really a privilege as the Business Environment and the Management and people are very cooperative and linked together. I like to work in such kind of Business Environment where people help each other doing their daily work."
good,"Flexible Work/Life Balance and Schedule.  Mostly worked from home but attended important meetings in person.  Not a typical 8-5 job as I supported teams in the US, Latin America, and Asia.  Co-Workers were amazing and supportive.  In the end, new management changed the culture and outsourced jobs to more ""cost-effective"" countries."
good,Dell is a place with constant pressure with ever changing targets and little reward to the employees. Senior management recognize people who can talk about so called plan of actions but in reality nothing has been achieved in the background
good,"Family friendly and flexible.  Great for high performers to enjoy stability; however, slow advancement.  Attrition was low; therefore, teams were stable."
good,"I worked in Dell for almost 6 months as an intern. I learned a lot during the time I was there. Everything from Forecasting to Unit Testing. My team took me in had me work with them on the project which was done in the Agile Scrum process. I got to learn a lot about the company and industry. This experience had a profound impact on me. I really progressed my skills and acquired many new ones."
good,"I worked there for almost 6 years, but should have looked elsewhere after 2 1/2 ~ 3 years. Good old boy system. Dell's meritocracy is a joke. Glad I left."
good,Dell is a challenging and fast paced place to work. Very manual processes used instead of systems or automation. PC culture overall and that is to squeeze costs.
good,"My tenure at Dell EMC was a whirlwind of exciting opportunities with the ability to progress into upper management.  If you work hard enough, your efforts pay off.  No doubt, the work/life balance has been challenging; however, it was a personal choice in order to advance in my career.  One thing I learned with this company, is that you cannot stop the forward momentum.  If you like a challenge, this company offers that and more to those who want to excel."
good,"+  The company is going through massive restructuring following the acquisition of EMC and subsequent plans to go public (IPO'ing through the DVMT VMWare tracking stock)"
good,"Dell is a company that is excellent at self promotion and marketing.  Maintaining a work-life balance can be challenging.  Continuous change, state of flux is the norm."
good,Dell is a huge company that employs people all across the world.  They do require employees behavior outside work to be above reproach.  They have quarterly recognition events.
good,"Many learning opportunities with the provision of instructor led training in certain instances."
good,Difficult to advance if you were not considered in the upper part of the management team.  Dell had the basic right ideas and produced a very good product.  However work life balance was not always the best.
good,"the workplace is antiquated and they are not open to new digital trends, the quarterly planning stil relies heavily on old strategies that wouldn/t necessarily work in today's landscape."
good,"It is a great place if you are just starting out in IT. "
good,"Dell EMC is reshaping the industry through IT Transformation, combining leading infrastructure, data storage, hybrid cloud and data protection solutions."
good,"It is a good place to work for a while, I feel I need more challenges. I improved my English, the colleagues are great. There's good teamwork in general."
good,"Everyone was nice, including management. We could listen to music. It was fast paced yet easy. We rotated, which I found helpful to keep the momentum of things going."
good,"Do your job well and you can have a stable career there. Moreover, there is opportunity for advancement and growth.  I would go back if the compensation followed suit."
good,Mozy (SAAS software backup company with good corporate culture) is acquired by EMC (hardware onsite backup company). EMC is acquired by DELL (hardware company). DellEMC sales Mozy backup services to competitor (Carbonite) to pay off a tiny bit of its' debt for acquiring EMC.
good,Good internship at a volatile time in the company. many changes were being made so things were hectic and people around were unsure if their jobs were secure.
good,"As a contractor, my tenure was short and restricted. The culture is friendly and concise. The people were dedicated to the work they did and found fulfillment in it. Leadership was excellent."
good,"Slow paced."
good,I had previously worked in startup companies. Dell is definitely a large company with the work atmosphere to match.  There is much more bureaucracy and pointless exercises in spending time satisfying edicts from corporate headquarters.
good,Employees have work pressure on which they need to meet their daily targets on continuous basis and they are evaluated on the language front for which they are not properly trained on.
good,growth was vital to EMC and it showed in my objectives; the company wanted professional services to be an integral part of growth however constrained my ability to generate revenue for services.
good,"Change was a part of the culture, new products, new management, new priorities.  When Dell took over, the changes accelerated and continue at a prolific pace."
good,"Great working environment, great people, lots of opportunity to progress and move departments. Dated facilities but everything you need to do your job"
good,"A typical day at Dell will start early and often finish late depending on what issues have arisen during the day.  "
good,"My company was a part of a larger acquisition. I joined a fast paced collaborative place with a true startup culture, but since the acquisition the amount of bureacracy has tripled. Basic enablement services such as helpdesk, provisioning, tech support, and even SKU and administration setup grounds to a snail's pace. To get anything done you need to be part of management's chosen project, which could change at any time. Reorganizations appear to have every 6 months. "
good,"A nice working culture, and potentials to accomplish more and an encouragement to learn new skills and enhance already available one. A good work culture and positive environment"
good,Being able to work from home is a plus. You get to work from the comfort of your home. Good benefits and work with friendly coworkers and support is always there.
good,Work is project based. Short term projects do end up with you on the bench for awhile until your manager gets another project. Most eventually get on a long term project that lasts indefinitely.
good,"I learned a lot about sales and the computer industry as a whole. Dell takes care of it's employees financially. However, the sales work is mundane, grueling, and stressful. Sitting for long periods of time and constantly on the phone with customers."
good,"Product was good, nice culture, helping people in the team and plenty of choices for cross collaboration. Compensation depends on position and a good dev position will get a good salary."
good,"I have been through two mergers within 2 years so it's been a bit of a roller coaster.  They have done a great job with the integration but there is always some challenges when merging tools, operations, sales forces etc....  It's a great company and strives everyday to improve customer experience."
good,"As is typical of mergers, there was pretty strong uncertainty about the organizational changes accompanying the merger. Upper management had very clear execution direction, which unfortunately didn't get passed down to mid-level management."
good,Reviewing as a legacy EMC employee. Dell is only focused on the bottom line. Customer service roles are no longer valued as they were at EMC. Employees seem expendable and will be outsourced or contracted out if possible.
good,Trouble shot problems and changed Dell hardware on laptops and desktops in customers’ homes using technical skills and excellent customer service. Worked at my own pace.
good,"It's been awhile since I was there, but what sticks with me about my experience on the manufacturing side of the business is the vast differences in culture and methodology between different business units."
good,EMC had a fantastic engineering team and environment.  I really miss working with the people there. Over the past few years there was a big push to move to agile and that move was successful and really improved the ability to get products out faster and with quality.
good,"Work was a constant learning curve. Its a good place to learn new technology. Resposible for testing , and each day brought something new. Learned a lot, but hours worked each day tended to stretch beyond 8 hrs a day."
good,"My expertise includes: Debugging systems, and networking, power and hand tool operations, PC troubleshooting: repair and maintenance, cross-training other technicians, computer workshops,   Excel and Word.  "
good,"New learning, work flexibility is one more positive aspect as an employer where many companies fail to treat the team member in the same way. Lots of changes."
good,"Dell is, depending on what year it is, a good place to work or an almost-awful place to work.  As senior management rotates (and they do, regularly), compensation policies, advancement opportunities, objectives, and culture can shift from very balanced and fair to just the opposite.  If you work there long enough, you will see both in play; if you are hired at the wrong time, it can be very difficult to maintain.  The front-line and middle managers are typically quality people who care about their staff and especially work-life balance, a big plus.  The opportunity for advancement and wage growth can be equitable, but suffers from the pendulum swings.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with co-workers and dealing with customers; the hardest part of the job was the ever-changing focus on margin vs. market share, and see also above.."
good,While the culture at Dell is great they have highly unrealistic expectations for their technical support. Free food and games don't mean anything if the technicians can't enjoy them because they are literally glued to their chair.
good,"Overall not a bad place to work. Every job has it's downsides but I have been at far worse company's. Dell has a lot of the same downsides you see with companies all over: Benefit decreases; Demand increases with little to no added compensation; Poor training for new hires etc."
good,"Was hired to work on long term project and when project was complete, I was let go after being on the bench for 30 days without a new project to work on."
good,"Good place to start off your career in IT. For the first few years it'll get you exposed to different functions of a storage career, and broaden your skill set. But, it's recommended to expand your skillset by diving into all categories of being a TSE within your product."
good,"No real job culture."
good,"Management the leadership team for Dell EMC were outstanding great leadership team , work culture was amazing and conducive for employees to give their 100% learned a lot thanks to DellEMC"
good,come to work do as much work as I can to have a productive work day help others if they need it learn more about what I do  and how much help I can be to others in the process and become the company's best proformer
good,A challenging customer facing role in which we need to build up the trust and accomplish the customer demand.Plenty of learning opportunity to face multiple client requirements and develop analytical skills.tough customers are the most challenging part but it helps to grow up in a better level.We worked as a team to make every minute enjoyable.
good,"A typical day at Dell ProSupport was hectic but fun. Working at a call center, it's expected to gets numerous inbound calls but the ability to troubleshoot and help people with their technology problems felt amazing! "
good,"Great place to work for work/life balance. However if you are seeking career advancement and opportunities, you came to the wrong place.  Management may get really insecure about employees with potential."
good,"Incoming calls range anywhere from 80 - 120/ day (about 15 calls per hour). Customers are extremely rude, which I realize isn't the company's fault, but you basically are required to be verbally abused by clients unless they swear at you."
good,"Dell is known as a revolving door company from many who have worked there. Layoffs seem to be the norm, so getting a job does not mean you will keep it forever. Pay and benefits are great, if you can stay at the company. People are great, and the teams do try hard to help the customer. Management is very much a ""yes man"" attitude and don't seem to support the teams as much."
good,"With regular layoffs, job security is non-existent and there is a constant sense of ""do more with less"".  The level of work was challenging to keep up with. The speed of Dell is stressful.  The people are great, though, and my direct managers were amazing."
good,The job as contract labor and it did not last as long as I was told that it would. Training was good but there were multiple system issues. I enjoyed the job.
good,JobWork/Life Balance is one of the best reason to work for Dell.  Opportunity changes and you learned a lot every year due to re-organizing the team and departments.
good,"good place to work, big campus, earlier dell now its NTT Data. work pressure is little more sometimes.timing is the hard part of the job.other than this its great place to work."
good,"At the time I left Dell, I was burned out. I made a career change. In retrospect, it is a company I would not mind working at again. If you were a good employee with a good work ethic, so many opportunities were available. They offered great benefits."
good,"-Unbelievable sales training program"
good,"Over all itsgud,and work culture is good:-)And we can enjoy the work at the environment and will be working daily 9hours,again it depends on the deliverables"
good,"A company with excellent pay and benefits; however, the expectations are high.  This can lead to an undesirable work/life balance.  Can be a really good company to work for if you good a good manager and you have the correct expectations of what will be expected of you."
good,"I had a great opportunity at Dell as a TSR, learned everything I could in 11 weeks and over attained almost every quarter.  Only thing I would change is the salary."
good,Solid Workplace To Learn The Ropes And Corporate Work Culture. Lot's Of Areas To Learn. Progression And Benefits However Are Slower In The Long Run....
good,"Getting agile - needs to keep at it"
good,"I was involved in developing and executing performance test scripts for a host if enterprise applications, predominantly .NET/Oracle Database based."
good,This company is great to work for when you are hired in as a Dell/Dell EMC employee. They unfortunately hire though contracting agencies first. There isn't much room to be hired in as a Dell/Dell EMC employee at the moment. The work environment is excellent. Anyone you ask will say they feel appreciated to a certain extent. The company does a lot for you when they can.
good,"Good work/life balanced job that allows for future career advancement & more opportunities."
good,"I was only there a short time, but it was a nice balance between a relaxed atmosphere and everyone being highly focused getting there work done."
good,"My manager make my job enjoyable.  Great mentor."
good,"Plus -Got an opportunity to Work with the brightest and the smartest people in my entire career."
good,"I love working as a accountant\collections agent , because I like to put things in order ,solving other people s issues ,handling valuable accounts worth milions of $ and being on top of the situation."
good,"Great place to work if you would like to be involved in some really cool engineering projects relating to data storage and if you like programming/computer science. Almost all employees are under 35 years of age and do not stay here very long. There is constant fear in the air of layoffs, buyouts, and ""changes in company structure"" but maybe that has settled down now that the Dell acquisition is complete."
good,There are a lot of changes being made at the company right now.  I liked the company more when it was just EMC. Dell is making changes that will hurt the company.
good,"I have a veteran's view of what used to be and what is in specific organizations.  Some are progressing, others are lagging, but that is the state of any company of this size."
good,Dell is a proper Bps concern.  Safety wise 100% reliable concern. Cab facilities we're good.  Salary was not that good and internal assessment and hike was not that great.
good,Global work nature and require weekly night calls with different regions.  Reasonable salary package.  Good coworker but office politics is common within management.
good,"The work/life balance was good when I first started.  As time progresses, and after going through several rounds of reorganization, more work keeps piling on."
good,"Dell is currently in the midst of a $50 Billion acquisition in EMC. All internal moves have been frozen and advancement of anytime takes a minimum of 18 months which is frustrating. "
good,"I overall like the culture and the importance held on overall life-work balance.  This is a work hard, play hard culture.  My co-workers were great and overall were very team oriented.  Senior management changes were significant and the culture is rapidly changing as it is spun out of Dell at this time."
good,"collegues are good"
good,"My experience at Dell is not good. The people I had to work with was very individualistic and not ethic at all. I raised the point to my manager and HR and no change."
good,"Its very nice to work, it has good work life balance. Again that depends on manager. Great place to work.need to concentrate more on the existing employees than who is coming from out side. As an organisation should focus and company and employee growth."
good,We have really good superiors there and every day is always enjoyable to go to work there. Despite my low salary compared to my previous jobs this place is really fun to work to.
good,"Dell wants you to be with them for the long term. They appear to want seasoned sales professionals that are able to quickly adapt to customers needs and upcoming technologies."
good,"Dell buyout is the best thing that could happen to EMC!"
good,"One of most international company in this world, my job description is wonderful one. Daily increase the my knowledge of production, the most enjoying our work situation"
good,"Selling Computers and Accesories, doing daily sales and monthly report, talking to my client explaining the advantage and disadvantage of the product that i promoting..."
good,"Dell pays well and lets you own a lot of your own work which is rewarding, but is a complex organization with a lot of redundancy."
good,"Dell offers good opportunity for advancement. Work life balance is great. However, training is lacking and I do not feel that management has provided me the necessary tools for success."
good,"A very large, hierarchical organization in which the senior folks seem to have little appreciation for how they sound, yet there is seldom any push-back from the rank-and-file. The result is a lack of honest communication, so things seem to fester endlessly."
good,Contract role for 18 months.   Very fast paced environment with expectations constantly rising.  Large company where you have do go above and beyond to be recognized.  currently under a M&A
good,"Been with DFS 10 years, great place to grow.  Unfortunately there is no room for growth in my organization.  No raises or bonuses for the past 4-5 years in the Operations department."
good,I work from home and enjoy the ability to be flexible with work hours. Much of my team is in India and very often we have to compromise on meeting times.
good,"If you are starting or just recently coming from college is a good place to start. You can learn a lot of new stuffs if you like technology."
good,"Dell India is a short term focused unit of the Dell Inc. that changes its management structure, operating model every year (sometimes every 6 months)."
good,"good place to start a career, love the people and my team, good work  life balance, low stress, taught me where I want my career to go but there is not a clear direction for me at Dell, lots of rules and politics with HR that prevent employees from advancing their career at Dell and they feel forced to leave"
good,"Work with good people but a stagnant environment for career minded individuals.  Advancement in duties & responsibilities without increased pay. Some teams have had no prospects for raises in several years.  Some training areas are not available to certain departments/teams, which can slow/prevent skill development.  Great work for someone who is satisfied with a fair paying job with benefits & is without ambitions."
good,Dell was a overall great company. But the issue is that most departments are trail basis. so you can loss a position easily. They pay great and most managers are great.
good,I enjoyed the work with Dell. Training sessions are very interesting.Lots of work pressure in there however the employees get paid well too.
good,"1) Responsibility of entire purchasing of 440 kV, 765 kV Transmission Line material. Executing supply of material as per Indent and Project requirement."
good,"Stable company with great facilities on site.  Benefits were great, but the pay could have been more in line with industry standards."
good,"Providing support to various types of customers to resolve technical issues is a dynamic role requiring you to be in the role of teacher, researcher, or student.  One learns to adapt to different situations in order to be effective.  Fellow support personnel often rely on each other to bring resolution for the customer.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the immense world of technology that constantly changes.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the part which allows one to be in the teacher role."
good,Empresa que dá oportunidades de aprendizado em diversos setores.  Bons benefícios
good,"The company is very involved in and shows amazing corporate social responsibility.   "

good,"It's Typical Day shift at Dell, I would love to be more on Field sales , meeting potential customer's & designing right solution which solves customer issues & it's customers."
good,"Relaxed work environment, flexible hours and the ability to work from home, if necessary.  I enjoy the team concept; helping each  other accomplish each day what is needed for our clients.  Everyone backs each other.  I enjoy speaking to beneficiaries and offering assistance where and when I can.  I enjoy helping people and providing a service in their time of need."
good,Productive and focused work environment. Teams practice effective communication in order to ensure the timely completion of tasks.
good,"It was a fun atmoshere. Had a work out room, gaming rooms, basketball court. They kept the moral up and thats why i liked them. We took about 100 calls per day and stayed real busy asisting users with reseting passwords and usernames"
good,A typical day at work is based on emails from different Dell reps and customers. Make around 50-70 calls a day. Manage a team of 8 BDRs who handle the whole territory of Latin America. Part of a team of 12 reps who oversaw the Data Protection team.
good,"Great training materials available via streaming"
good,"Dell is a great place to work if you want to get exposure to multiple functions or get deep into a particular area (e.g finance). The people are smart and hard working and generally want to do their best to improve Dell's bottom line."
good,"Call center therefore always on the phone, unable to provide great customer service due to metrics...answer the phone and transfer! Dealing with irate customers as they have waited in queue a long time only to get transferred again. If you like call center, this job would be for you"
good,"Getting involved with the Business from the Pre-Envisioning phase and gathering business requirements."

good,"Good company to work with"
good,"In a typical day, I spent time supporting the current build environment while adding current generation features and assisting with the transition to our new build and release model."
good,Fast pass with keeping an eye on details and always changing. Dell is a growing company getting new coustomers. Fun co-workers working as a team. The hours are flexible.
good,"Coworkers and lower management are great to work with, but upper management do not care about the employees just the results and getting those results for the least amount of money possible."
good,"A typical work day starts with either a phone call or a mail."
good,"I thought Dell was a great opportunity and in many ways it was.  I never worked so hard as I did with Dell, your peers are usually all in and you have to really bust your tail to hit quota. I had a lot of fun but felt that in the sale perspective, the easy part should be the order placing/processing and this was the most difficult part.  It was very frustrating.  I would recommend Dell to most people but they are still have internal issues that prevent them making it an awesome place to work."
good,Nice place to work with good learning and the hardest part of the job was profile(calling)
good,This company is Best for me.I enjoyed working for Dell. I met many great people both on the company and customer side. I also was able to grow as a professional and enhance my leadership skills by being the Site Lead on projects.

Reviewing their applications and insuring that they are matching the set criterias. Assist Partners with issues/queries and liaise with Sales representatives to provide a high level of customer services. Regular meetings with co-workers to discuss how to improve the quality of the services provided and dealing with complains. Dell provided a flexibility that suit working Mums and allows working from home."
good,Management is excellent at Dell. Our managers understand how to build Morale and team camaraderie. Co-workers are a joy to be around and provide an excellent support system at work. I have learned how to handle irate and upset users. My customer service skills have been sharpened in my time with Dell.
good,Troubleshoot computer issues over the phone or the internet.
good,EMC clearly articulates company values and objectives at the top level.

good,"As I am promoter in dell laptop I have some target, but it is easy to achieve targets. No work pressure."
good,"my work day starts very early in morning - usually first meeting at 7:30 -8am.  My mornings usually full of meetings, I often have quieter afternoons which is the time to get hands on work done.  I meet people from all over the world either online during conference calls or in person when there are big anural meetings.  Most co-workers are nice and easy going.  Not much hierarchy shown in work environment.  Flexible working hours,  sometimes need to work extra hours to get things done before timeline.  "
good,Dell Wyse offers/understands how important work/life balance is very respectful to this when working for them.
good,"Dell is a good place to work. It has better than average compensation  and good work life balance (encouraged to work from home). However, it lacks leadership and direction at the executive level. Furthermore, its HR calibration methodology needs a complete overhaul and although it claims to be a meritocracy it is not. The company culture is good. For most part the co-workers are smart and hardworking but due to corporate bureaucracy its takes a while for things to change/improve."
good,"The company has some nice products and the work environment is decent. However, the company is in the process of being taken over by Dell, Inc.. As a result, many individuals are living is a sort of ""state of fear,"" not knowing what the future hold for their continued employment. This seems to lead to an amount of tension in the workplace."
good,"Dell is a great place to get a variety of experience. An employee never stays in the same role position too long before moving to support different projects or teams."
good,Its a good experience to work at Dell Services. People are good. 
good,"Hard working environment"
good,"Approve task orders, contract amendments"
good,"Job advancement and job security are major career risks.  The company is obsessed with ""reorgs"" - the process of shuffling jobs and managers on a regular basis."
good,The positives:
good,"Typical day at work for reaching the target for the day.Learnt many thing for the years i worked,met many people,learnt change management,being approachable.Management was helpful in bringing me up to my career level.I mostly enjoyed working there."
good,Dell is an excellent place to start in sales but respect from the top is lacking. The company does teach many valuable skills in technology and dealing with different types of people.
good,a typical day at work would be assigning claims to be resolved by my subordinates (the team that I handle)
good,The best part working here are the people.
good,Experiences at Dell generally vary dramatically based on who your manager is. I have had the fortune of working for some fantastic and inspirational leads as well as some who suck the life out of everyone around them.
good,This position requires that you be a strategic thinker and have the ability to perform variety of tasks in order to be successful.
good,I would have stayed in the position had I not wanted to move across town.
good,Dell gives you a fair work environment where you can learn with the good quality training and team of experts.

good,EMC is a large organization which offer fairly competitive salary. No other comments
good,"Great work experince, and I learned so much about the IT industry"
good,I worked at Dell a very long time ago when the stock split a second time and there were some very wealthy employees who were extremely happy. It was very exciting and was a business that really supported employees and provided great benefits. I was in customer service and would answer over one hundred calls a day on a call que. There were always manufacturing delays and customers were not as computer savvy. It was a challenge calming down some and very rewarding helping others. The coworkers were always very friendly and it was very exciting working for such a large company.
good,"My job is made much more interesting and fun because of my co-workers and team. Without them, I would have seeked employment elsewhere a long time ago."
good,"long work hours, great team,learnt to make client calls, process documentation, client interaction was the best...."
good,"Point of contact for service providers, Data base entry, copying, faxing, mailing and filing, answering incomming and making outgoing phone calls and routing appropriately. Provide tech support and update customers on ticket status. Work as a team."
good,"Typical day at work involved; suplying production lines with materials for assembly in a speedy manner, having materials set up in advance for change-overs,retrieving materials from stores or trailers as needed, keeping an account of all enventory for continuous non-stop production. Learned alot about shipping and reciving, logging in trailers and cooperation betweeen deparments. Had outstanding co-workers with a family atmosphere. Hardest part of job was often having to work unexpected overtime with no advanced notice. The most enjoyable part of the job was having the day run smoothly with no problems or down time. Management worked well with workers. Only bad thing about the job was they closed (moved) the plant after 5 years."
good,I was hired as a Technical Support Executive.
good,"EMC is a typical giant corporate where human interaction is limited, and you are burried with meetings on your Outlook Calendar."
good,"Overall Dell is a good company to work for. My team is fully remote with minimal to no travel requirement. Work-life balance is good and most managers allow flexible hours, as long as deliverable and meeting goals are met. "
good,It is neither good nor bad company. Job nature is stressful. But every good manager and team lead in almost every team on the floor. Biggest disadvantage is it have only drop facility. No pick up available.
good,"Management needs to do a better job of encouragement of their employees. Throwing things at the wall and hoping it sticks does nothing for an employee, but bring the down from their role"
good,But I would rather work for someone else. Work culture promotes meritocracy. Local senior leadership doesn't have much say over corp decisions. No brand recognition in software industry.
good,"Productive and relaxed work space, option to work remote. Very collaborative and innovative teams.Work-life balance is very important to the company and benefits are amazing."
good,Dell strikes a good work life balance. The work culture is all about being inclusive and accommodating people from all walks of life. The company constantly seeks out to grow either by developing or accruing technology needed to take the next big step.
good,"the work culture here was flexible. the hr department it unto the mark. the most enjoyable park of the work was the canteen lol ."
good,"Dell/Emc in manufacturing in Franklin Ma was still run like EMC ."
good,"Good company, can use stronger programs for advancing mid-management employees to their fullest potential.  Good benefits with plenty of opportunity to work remotely."
good,"Dell is full of great people and is good, stable job.  Promotion from with in gets bogged down and leadership is always changing direction.  The amount of benefits they offer offsets this gripe."
good,"Dell is an OK place to work. Usually easy going and pretty relaxed, unless there is a deadline coming up. Sometimes required to work outside of normal hours and weekends."
good,"Unimaginable targets being set for the employees and expect unreasonable quality of work. Though we had pick-up and cab drop, even the most resourceful and knowledge coder could not survive in select specialties."
good,I was a senior advisory consultant in their Asset Management practice. I had to leave due to relocation to California otherwise it was a great place to work at.
good,"Dell has a entrepreneurial culture which can be great.  It can also be bad, very bad.  Instead of investing in tried and true tools, they use home-grown options, the creator leaves, and your stuck with a poorly band aided piece of software.  Dell needs to invest in enterprise tools that enable their employees to complete their day to day activities in an easier manner. "
good,"Dell is a open door company and has a great work involvement. "
good,My time at Dell helped shape me into a more well-rounded sales professional. I had a lot of product training and became a mentor to new hires in my time working as an ISR (internal sales rep).
good,Learned a lot about the scrum methodology and was encouraged to attain a Professional Scrum Master certification as well as a SAFe Scaled Agilist certification.
good,I have worked at Dell since July of 2015 and from day 1 I have loved the people I work with hands down. The day to day job itself gets very old and promises are made that are not kept throughout the company.
good,"The benefits is amazing."
good,"Many great, intelligent people here, but information dissemination (after the EMC/Dell merger) is dismally lacking. Beyond ""reorganization"" and ""product rah-rah"" emails, there is little to let us know the company direction or plans."
good,"Low turnover - people tend to stay at Dell for careers.  Re-orgs are fairly typical, and can be disruptive to customers. Managed like a B to C sales company, despite growth with channel sales providers."
good,"Pros:"
good,Good company but with the recent merger between DELL and EMC things seem unstable. There did not seen to a be comprehensive transition plan in place and there seems to be some confusion as to which group has certain responsibilities.
good,"Culture could foster more software in the solutions. Great people that work there, and they have a genuine interest in making sure you are taken care of socially, mentally and professionally."
good,"Generally very good benefits and work environment. Work environment is amenable and there is fairly good support for extracurricular interests. Could benefit from increased mentoring, review and structure in providing opportunities of advancements."
good,I have learned Flexibility and was later on very helpful in my career. Client handling was something that I have learned here in Dell.This was also very much helpful.
good,"Three years ago, when I departed Dell, I would have given it a much harsher review. Looking back, it wasn't bad, but some unfortunate occurrences surrounding the privatization move foiled a couple prospective internal opportunities that would have kept me at Dell had I the chance to pursue them as planned. Nevertheless, your politicking is going to bigger the single most important thing you can do to advance your career. Do good work, know the right people, and, with a little luck (unlike me), you'll fall into the roles that you want."
good,"First company which helped me interact with people on a global level, taught me how to communicate , best training policy and teaching level . Learnt to troubleshoot laptops , printers and desktops"
good,"All good no complaints, solid leadership and high expectations on flawless execution.  CEO is very bright, very involved and very interested in all aspects."
good,High volume work.  Remote opportunities helpful for work/life balance.  Career path isn't clear.  Salary and bonus fair and balanced.  Paid time off commensurate with time at Dell.
good,I enjoyed my co-workers.  Laid back environment.  The work life balance was not the best - the overtime hours required made it hard.  The Managers were very supportive though.
good,This was my first job and Good work experience. Worked in a day shift. Had good team to work with. We always ensure to complete the whole volume which we receive from our clients.
good,Dell is a nice company to start with but should not consider the company for long term. Personal benefits on of individual are not up to the mark. Dell needs to work on this area.
good,"I've worked on software engineering in two separate regular engagements with Dell. One ended in involuntary separation due to the divestiture of my project and team, and the other in post-merger ""resource actions"". It was not unusual to come to the office at the beginning of the financial quarter and see a few newly empty desks to square up the financial numbers. In those experiences, it was clear that Dell only cares about how the employee contributes to the bottom line, and that they think and act like a hardware company in all aspects, with no clue how to manage software development."
good,Great products but the atmosphere and opportunities were slim to none when it came to advancements. The wages were terrible considering the work and product tats was produced. I would not recommend this place for the average employee. Best opportunities are definitely in management here!
good,Its nice place to work for women employees but work timing is too long. No hike for experience employee . partiality management . No future in employee.
good,Nothing noteworthy to be seen here.  Slow corporate environment with an overburdened middle management staff that spends more time calculating safe moves and is very risk agnostic.  Has turned into a vanity metrics based company.
good,Dell Inc. is a large organization which works to promote a feeling of family and togetherness as do most organizations.  Like any large group it simply has a hard time delivering on its promisses.
good,Working in Round Rock was great until an acquisition of a dying company in Santa Clara changed the entire work environment. We went from a team focused on shipping products and getting things done to a huge bloated division where finger-pointing and back-stabbing was the norm.
good,Great place to work depending on your manager. Great people and good work life balance depending on your manager. Good benefits. Can be very fast paced.
good,"I have learned Selenium, QC, JIRA, Bugzilla. Dell has a good work culture. The management is good. Timing is flexible. The hardest part of job is not able to learn more things"
good,"For the application I supported, we were low on manpower with only two people supporting it in the US. This was a main concern because our app was downstream of several applications in Dell. So we were flooded with trouble tickets if an issue occurs through any of the upstream applications. Build up of these tickets took our attentions away from actual issues in our app, as we had to spend time trying to find the correct team that had knowledge to fix the issue"
good,Dell has a good team environment that can be relied on to get tasks done in prompt and timely manner. Manger is very involved and help the team succeed in any way possible
good,"Working from home was great, just like the customers. Management was not the best. They did not provide a solid direction, on how to progress within EMC2"
good,"EMC was a great place; Dell, not quite. Layoffs are frequent, no RSUs, etc (since privately held); not enough Long Term Incentive either. Not a great place to work.."
good,"Dell is fast-paced and a lot of times, teams take the quick route to ""from the hip"" solutions which inevitably fail in a lot of cases. Typical big company that moves fast, but also serves a massive customer base and accomplishes some incredible things for those customers. The old saying at Dell is like the weather in TX; just keep your head down when it gets turbulent and let it pass; things change very quickly and you need to be okay with ambiguity. Heavy on email communication inside the company; you have to be okay with that. Overall, I spent 18 years there; some good and some not so good. At the end of the day, I would go back and would recommend Dell to anyone who has a desire to succeed, a thick skin, and a top notch work ethic."
good,"When I began working here, it was before the division was acquired by Dell and was EMC. The culture and people in my location were great.  Up to the last year or two before the acquisition, there began to be much more uncertainty and what seemed to be lack of a clear sense of direction. Nothing seemed to be the same afterwards. I hope things have improved since the acquisition, but I cannot say because I am no longer there."
good,I worked here over 10 years ago and I am sure the culture has evolved since then. It was a young company with a fun staff and culture at the office. There were plenty of opportunities for growth.
good,"I have been working at Dell/EMC for 2.5 years as a Lab Systems Engineer.  I started out as a Tech 1 level support engineer, but quickly got a promotion once they saw my capabilities."
good,Great place to work.  Excellent benefits.  Work life balance was the best I have ever been a part of.  Knowledge taken from working there is priceless.
good,"The company has an amazing work culture and the people become so friendly so soon, that its like another home, things does not go as planned at times, due to pay structure, and if joined taking the money money in mind, you would have to real real patient in order for that."
good,The engineering organization is a great place to learn. However more importance is given to the domain knowledge than technology. As an individual contributor you get to work on all aspects of software development. Flexible work hours which means you are expected to be available any time of the day. No grade specific KPIs defined. Performance reviews are a farce. Management favours people who have been there longer.
good,"management is so kind to the employees,lot of benefits to the employees,hardest part of the job is whenever there is new technology change we have to learn them quickly"
good,ambiente bom para desempenhar os trabalhos propostos
good,Worked at EMC before the merger and can notice the changes Dell has added to the work place. Unstable case volume and changes in work structure which leaves often at times confusion on case management
good,"Very employee friendly; provides good opportunities to employees;"
good,"Managed four different teams while at Dell Computer.  The teams were in transition as the company was realigning to the changes in the business model.  Also, managed a telecom call routing team that provided all of the connectivity to call centers around the world."
good,"Handled inbound calls of DELL customers from US. I was responsible to undertake troubleshooting for Dell computers, both desktops and laptops while providing telephonic technical support across varied segments of Dell's U.S. customers. Also actively participated in implementing Standards, Support Processes and Strategies while functioning as an instrumental member for delivering operational excellence."
good,"Inside sales varies on RTM. Sales processes are defined accurately. Management is very focused. inside sales is not independent, depends on outside sales resources. You can handle pressure if you are in the correct sales RTM."
good,"Everyday, i would log in to my dialer on time. Check my previous cases and its present status and update accordingly, if necessary i would schedule a call back and update the client with further progress. I would then handle inbound's and clear queries and provide resolution on call."
good,Jury is still out on the new culture.  Feels like more of a dictatorship than an environment of listening.  But we will find out more when the dust settles.
good,The company is very professional and has an enormous array of cultural activities.  You must be willing to drink the kool-aid 100%.  If you don't work overtime and involve yourself in weekend culture you may be looked down on.
good,"Good company to work in, however very frequent changes in Org which impact Individual growth plan. "
good,"J'ai pu créer mon équipe et travailler en étroite collaboration, faire partager mon expérience et développer un portefeuille clients conséquent"
good,"Did the best I could to balance the work life but still took work home. Customers have high expectations from when they are sold the support contract but the support they're promised is unreal."
good,"Managers and co-workers have commented on high levels of accuracy and work productivity."
good,Co-workers are creative and strive to produce great content. Teamwork and singular goals are stressed. Life/work balance is the true standout of a career there. Information regarding company status/business changes are plentiful.
good,"I am not directly employee of dell"
good,"Best part of the job is the schedule flexibility. However, there is no career advancement opportunities. They want you to do one thing and one thing only."
good,"Pendant mon parcourt chez Dell, j'ai pu apprendre d'avantage suite a un programme personnel de formation appuyé par mon manager et j’apprécie énormément d'avoir eu la possibilité de pouvoir approfondir mes connaissances."
good,"Fast pace, multiple responsibilities, every day is completely different."
good,"Nice co workers"
good,"I would work 60-70 hours per week and watched my income decrease year over year since 2015. Lots of stress, but also good about work from home and time off for family needs."
good,"1. Technical skills"
good,"This job i can personally can work very well for those who enjoy the sales cultures and, talking with their clients on a day to bases for solutions in the computer world. If you are a curious person and want to try something new i would be careful about applying because it is very fast paced and entitles you to also finish your work on your laptop at home. If you love making deals and so on this is the job for you, but if your someone looking for a different direction and like to go into the office cubical life just be prepared for a fast paced environment and yes dell has an awesome atmosphere among colleagues, but that comes down to your adaptability or suitability to the environment. If you dont work with the culture of dell well then expect a lot of stress from the position. Either then that It is over all a good job for students out of school seeking for work and so on."
good,"First of all, I would like to express my sincere appreciation and gratitude towards you for supporting me on position Graduate Practitioner of Procurement contracts team. The experience was more than I could have expected and allowed me the freedom to develop and maintain individual skills as a member of the team. The colleagues was most responsive to my requests and always made me feel like a full-time member of the group. I was working on many interesting projects with different tasks. Every day I learnt pretty things about contractual process  on General Procurement. I was excited to learn more about the position at Dell s.r.o and I feel that my experience as skills in organize data quickly, establish priorities and maintain prompt response would be of benefit to my next career."
good,"I was very fortunate to work in an innovation area of Business Development for  Cloud and as part of an exceptional  team so on the basis of that I was in a 5 star environment.But overall EMC is a tough company as it is relentlessly demanding of the very best and can sometimes have too much complicated processes and internal confusion and tough old fashioned management which some can find challenging but it is also a great place to learn, advance skill set, meet very smart people and if you are fortunate enough to travel and have an entry into fantastic customers / partners. Due to the Dell / EMC merger as well as the general market positioning there is likely to be confusion moving forward which is why I rate it at 3."
good,Very regimented with very little internal creativity and movement.  Executive management driven not by this subsidiary but by corporate who do not understand the work-space involved.
good,"I prefer a permanent position. This facility is not reliable for a permanent position, as 70-80% are contracted employees. Basically in the meeting they said you have to know someone who knows someone. There are a lot of family members and friends and neighbors working there."
good,"It was mostly a daily routine working at EMC, so I had all the knowledge I need to know to complete every task. From packing and wrapping to picking and shipping. Every employee was always nice and generous and never had any problems with any of them. The hardest part of the job were just orders that I had to pick that didn't have the right information given on them and go through a process to have it correct."
good,Good work culture.Work and personal life can be balanced.Good policies for female employees.Need to grow more in services.Salary benefits are very low for old employees.
good,"Overall, working at Dell has been a good experience. However, I've learned there is little room for professional growth within this company. As well as, not to expect any kind of raise. The best part of my experience has been meeting other people with the same professional goals and creating a broader network of technical contacts."
good,"Company is a Leader in Hardware of Dell Computer Products. Now the company is transitioning itself to Software Products, since it could not en cash the boom in Smart Phone and Tablet Computer Markets."
good,"Dell was a good place to start in the IT field. As far as job security, don't rely on it. My first two Managers were excellent team players. The last Manager was very unethical, and he wanted to fire whomever he could due to outsourcing."
good,I was able to get a lot of training and a certification.  Work from home was available.  Most of my leadership was great.  I enjoyed the job and the people.
good,"Dell is a large company with lots of opportunity to move around to different positions to learn new things.  However, it comes with the same headaches as any other large, global company.  Meetings at all hours, lots of miscommunication, and executives with conflicting goals."
good,Dell is one of the best organizations to work with. They have great organizational culture and best Work Life balance. The co-workers are very friendly. The Higher management is approachable.
good,life and work balance is good. upper management did 2 layoff in the time I was there. compensation was cut once. sales teams were changed frequently.
good,"friendly team members, everyone is open to learn from each other;"
good,"Glad I was there as I learned a lot, met some great people, did some impressive, new things but after 4 1/2 years, glad that I'm not there any more."
good,Dell managed the IT at BCBSRI until Oct 2014. At that time BCSBRI decided to go with a new vendor.  Dell provided support to those that lost their postions as a result
good,It was very stressful. I was thankful to have a job. I enjoyed when I could help people and the good days.
good,"Good company over all. Pay was great but they restructured the pay so you make a lot less now. there is not too much that is bad, just got to keep up on the latest phones."
good,"A typical day 8-10 hours . "
good,"Dell is a great place to work. I have learned a lot of things, which i still apply in my daily life. The most important thing that i have learnt at Dell is Team work. Without a good team, no one wins."
good,i was working in technical support international(US) as a technical support representative and initially i found it fun however after few months it becomes monotonous. The crowd is ok and the management is good. A good job for someone who is new to the industry.
good,My onsite manager was great. The rest of the management folks above him weren't so interested in us since we were not in Atlanta. The onsite location was good in general but very mismanaged by the local directors.
good,"When I was actually employed with Harvard Pilgrim, it was productive and fun.  When my dept was outsourced to Perot and then Dell, it was just all about production.  They were based in Plano, Texas, so we were never included in any of the social activities at our site in Quincy, MA.  Other than my great co-workers, every day was 8 hours of sometimes very stressful work."
good,"Daily activities involved the build of specific Dell platforms and the testing and certification of software on those platforms by certifying that specific motherboard and chip-set combinations performed together. I also designed a number of Dells test labs.Dell as an organization is a solid large company with a culture of innovation. "
good,"Option to work at work or home"
good,"It is a productive place to work with a good work culture."
good,"A typical day at work involved the following:"
good,Working as a Consumer Sales Rep was great. There were no cold calls to be done like other telesales. People shopping online who had questions or needed help checking out will call the 1800 number and get directed to a sales rep. Working over a 8 hour shift you would usually take between 12-20 calls on a slow day. Making it hard to hit your numbers selling computer packages and warranties. The job environment was great and fun.
good,"Good Work Experience. "
good,"I have been working here in Dell. I have been trained in Business Intelligence & Data Warehousing Stream. I have learned a lot here. I have worked on several tools for projects in Financial, Healthcare and Enterprise Business Intelligence Domain."
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job was if you find any new resolution which took less amount of time ,it was really appreciated and implemented ASAP."
good,"Freedom in work place,decision making,Inventory management,safety in work place, Balance in work culture with personal life."
good,"Empresa com ótima cultura enraizada, porém sem prespectiva de crescimento dentro da empresa. Ótimo ambiente, bons gerentes e bons colegas de trabalho."
good,"Everyday will be learning "
good,Good benefits and training. Very creative people work there.      
good,International georienteerd bedrijf met veelal kansen voor mensen die het op salesvlak willen maken.
good,"Guide team to the provide an excellent customer service"
good,"A typical day at work involved resolving issues for the customer. I learned the value of a customer's voice, listen to them. I worked with many managers whose behavior was unethical and toxic to the team and Dell Financial Services. Many of my co-workers were unhappy with no voice. The hardest part of my job was working for toxic managers.  The most enjoyable part of my job was mentoring my peers and assisting the customer."
good,"EMC is a very succesful, results oriented company. This is a part of the culture."
good,"I gained lot of things like "
good,"Working in Dell is better than not being employed. I changed 4 projects and changed 11 desks while working in Dell. I did all the work while my leads got the credit and If something went wrong I got all the blame. Any how, over all Dell has excellent health benefits and excellent compensation to start with."
good,Dell is a great place to work with very bright people.  Have learned how to deal with many challenges and obstacles to get the job done.
good,"Fun working and work is balance with life."
good,"Had a good time working there but with all of the changes recently with Dell going private, my position was eliminated.  Dell does not value talent and has laid off entire groups of very talented and loyal employees.  Ever changing management at the higher level as well as the contact reorgs of the various divisions is going to continue to drive Dell downhill.  Very hard to get promoted once in your job."
good,"Dell has a track record for success, and leadership clearly is willing to move in directions it believes will further future success for the company.  Workforce is highly engaged and are a high caliber group - understanding the issues and motivation of the work force are rarely issues.  Due to market downturn and internal restructuring, the most difficult part of the job has become the recurring expense reductions and dwindling opportunities for growth. The best parts of the job are the people you work with and the opportunities to get engaged across multiple business lines to work on various projects."
good,"I worked there for 16 years, was disappointed to see that Mr. Dell sold us to mexico, so I and alot of others layed off work."
good,"Manage the Technical customer Escalations on daily basis."
good,"Dell can help you grow your career, only if you know what you want."
good,"* Person can learn culture "
good,Dell is a Good organization to work . For beginners it really provides a strong platform to get transformed into highly competent and skilled resources.
good,"I have been lucky to learn about both parts of the business- meaning International and North American.  I enjoy my coworkers very much, and have worked on some extremely difficult projects this year.  I learned so much from them, but it has been a bit exhausting and overwhelming.  We have lost a large part of our team to layoffs as the entire company has and I feel it is time for me to move on to someone else."
good,"I call and verify Insurance and document the information on the patients accounts. I have learned about the different types of insurance, the co-pays,deductibles,co-insurance. I enjoy working with my co-workers. We help each other when the other one needs help. We have a real good team. The hardest part of my job is when I do not have the correct information on a patient. I have to have correct insurance companies name, ID numbers and patients correct names and date of birth."
good,"At Dell, I was able to learn a lot of things from my office mates."
good,"Dell is good place to work. The company missed a few key technology trends including mobile and cloud, and is now attempting a massive transformation in an attempt to catch up with some of its peers and as well as recent start ups. The company promotes ethical practices and values diversity. The company appears to be  following a sound strategy, but needs to improve on the execution capability."
good,"1. Good placed to learn and use new technology in market."
good,"Dell SecureWorks is a good place to work because there are many opportunities for growth and advancement."
good,Its a nice job as a fresher for me. Its a great experience and knowledge to improve analysis skills more. Performance wise its a sportive and typical environment.
good,I am working in dell india private limited as a client technical representative to handling customers.
good,A typical as an Account manager consisted of outbounding and building relationships with Small and Medium businesses that do little or no business with Dell. Co-workers were very helpful and had the opportunity to build both professional and personal relationships during my career at Dell the hardest part of the job was the sense of insecurity in my role as well as the fact that my career was determined by uncontrollable circumstances out of my power. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning the ins and outs of Technology business and building relationships with both customers and internal co-workers.
good,Dell has acquired many companies in the last 3 years to build their products portfolio. It is a continuing challenge to intergrate them in the the sales and service organization.
good,Very stable
good,Educated and sold Dell products and services by responding to inbound calls or placing outbound calls.Responded to customer inquires regarding products or services and recommend solutions and troubleshooting steps.
good,I expected management being hands on with employees which wasnt the case. Hardly ever saw my manager and had to ask other employees 80% of the time who to perform a task.
good,"Fast paced, dynamic environment. Interaction with many diverse people and business groups."
good,Pay and benefits were very good.
good,"In the IT department the motto seems to be cut twice measure once. While management has spent a lot of time and money creating and defining processes, there is relatively little enforcement. Therefore, many (most?) projects go awry."
good,"Great first job. I gained a great deal of sales experience and learned alot about how large corporations operate. Being on the front line you deal with all aspects of the business including finance, logistics, sales, and marketing so you get a broad vision of how the business ties together from the beginning to the final product."
good,"I've been in the IT industry since 1986. I worked internal support and Tech Support until 1997, and since then, I have been doing customer facing pre and post sales engineering."
good,"Dell pays senior staff very well and uses this pay to attract and retain talent. While there are creative and talented members of staff, Dell focuses more on tactical execution and processes. Management training is very light, so skills among the leadership team is spotty."
good,"I have been with Dell for around 8 years now. It is been a roller coaster tide as there were projects all the times with the challenging timelines. It was intresting to get the things done with the diverse capabilities, talents we have got. Overall it is a very good learning in my career."
good,"Dell is place which will make you learn what is the importance of customer satisfaction and how to deal with different religion customers and help them solve their queries."
good,"I see in Dell is, Privatization has reduced the need to take approvals from multiple levels to just innovate which has led to some amazing portfolio of products coming out of their stable in the past few years. The products are world beaters Alienwares, Inspirons, XPS are better than any product at that price range in the market."
good,This is a great job for those looking to make a lot of money in sales... it is a grind to build your pipeline to meet quota and responsibilities change often so half your time is spent cleaning up fake opportunities left by someone else.
good,"I worked on a team that implemented and revised open source code for a major project, and I enjoyed the opportunity to interact with an extended team."
good,Sales Quotas would change quarterly and usually be unrealistic with account sets. Sales could be very cut through at time. They did pay pretty well if you were able to hit your commission goals.
good,I was contracted to the DOT of Virginia. So federal employees are rude. Management would always take there side even if they were wrong. People were all kind and helpful.
good,"Typical big US corporate with strong push for consensus across teams when making decisions. "
good,Working for Dell via an Alorica call center hasn't been all that bad. There is plenty of proper incentive per month to really do the best you can in your position and plenty of opportunity to progress with a career with them.
good,"You are weighed heavily on metrics, and there is not a lot of back-up when a customer becomes unruly on the phone, you ultimately have to take the abuse. If you are able to make it the benefits are there for you to have and they are not bad. My coworkers are really what kept me going to the job day to day."
good,"Dell used to be almost a family company.  It's now undergoing a lot of change.  A lot of the processes are broken.  Where folks used to take ownership of problems, there is a greater likelihood of someone referring an issue to another team.  There is a huge disconnect between how senior management thinks the company is doing and the rank-and-file feels the company is doing.  While the executive Team says the the company is have a great quarter, travel is restricted, and no one can have a team lunch."
good,"Silos by product line. Friendly work culture."
good,"É uma boa empresa para se trabalhar, tem uma ótima valorização de recursos humanos. Precisa melhorar o preparo dos gerentes pois uma pessoa leva anos para estar pronta para direcionar a vida de outras pessoas, falta maturidade na maioria dos gerentes promovidos."
good,Won the smart step award for taking the lead in process/project streamlining through operational value additions displaying innovative and by going beyond the call of duty
good,"Dell has very good work culture. "
good,I enjoy meeting and speaking with customers and discussing their security concerns.  My management was supportive and is happy to jump in and help if needed.
good,We had long days and worked alot of hours. Overtime was great and the pay was okay. Very competitive among co-workers but good people to work with. Good benefits.
good,"All good, i am looking for a new role for improve my technical skills."
good,"Trabajo intenso con ritmo frenetico."
good,"Brand for the company will give proud. Many learning and updating programs conducted, events and fun at work takes place, easy going team leaders and co workers"
good,"The day started off with taking multiple calls while trying to deal with other calls from the past week and getting everyone taken care."
good,"no comments at this time - as a result of the merger, several things changed from both a cultural and operations stand. My particular area of expertise was not needed."
good,"To whome it may concern,"
good,"Provides good work life balance."
good,"Flexible timings. Good facilities. Work from home option was there.salary hike is good."
good,"we work more than 10 hours a day and still we did not appropriate wages as per our work. Work life balance & work culture is good, however wages is very less as compared to work done. No enjoyable part of job is here."
good,"My experiences with the supervisors and the type of work I did at Dell were very good. I was allowed to work at my own pace and was not micro-managed. I always got clear directions and knew what was expected of me."
good,"I like working at Dell but the commute is too far for me. The managment here after the Dell EMC merge is very lacking, That is one of the other reasons I am looking for a new job."
good,Well and good.. Able to work all kind of shift.safe and security is more.cab facilities are superb..same time little more work pressure. Decent work experience.

good,"I worked for Denials and Remittence. The process is, claim has been  denied due to some reason and I am behalf of provider and call the insurance company to get the information about claim and will update the notes and finally forward into onshore team. I really enjoyed well in Dell and the atmosphere is very very good to learn more. And there is always supportive managers and leaders."
good,"Depending on which team you work for it May be a great experiece or it might be horrible. Be sure to interview with the people in your immediate team and know what other teams or departments you'll be working with. Some teams are fantastic and some are not so great. Fortunately, I had an excellent team that I worked with."
good,"Work teams were very isolated."
good,"Working as a virtual employee for many years, the work/life balance has not been an issue or a problem. Compensation for the position and responsibilities is not as the initial expectation set prior to accepting the final offer. Benefits are average for the industry, and management is overwhelmed. The job culture is impacted negatively as a result. Overall, about an average company to work for, that experiences change frequently, and often is at the mercy of customer support needs."
good,"Expériences formatrices, permet d'évoluer (dependant du secteur, plus difficile dans le back office), bonne rémunération"
good,"A typical day consist of answering phones trouble shooting computer issues for doctors, nurses and other hospital staff."
good,Great Benefits and work life balance. Teams are fairly compensated.Dell has a great campus in Santa Clara that they are building out for executive clients and dev teams.
good,Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally develop and grow. Decent salary and compensation but this is expected from a big company
good,"The job is good and the leadership is not bad. I don't feel belittled or like I am not part of the team, however, it is a hard work/life balance. There are constant deadlines and the work load piles very quickly. It is not hard to get on top of it if you are a quick learner."
good,Providing an accurate and timely response to my Customer's requests for quotes and purchases.  Everyday was a good day when I could keep my turnaround time on same day.  The hardest part of the job was when Customer's needing a quote and the server was down and not being able to provide them with the quote.
good,my desktop support job with vanderbilt was outsourced to this company. dell is the walmart of information technology. they do it all. they love to micromanage and treat you like you're expendable.
good,"it was nice place to work but the process is shifting, hence looking for a change.nice place to work with but cant leave my parents and move on"
good,"I enjoyed a lot working in Dell family in the beginning days. By days going there i s lot of work pressure. And lots of team moments this thing is mainly loosing co workers and there is no fun kind of activities like games, events, refreshments"
good,"Perfeita, muita estrutura para os funcionarios e umaótima gestão de gerencia"
good,"Dell's remote option enable each analyst to focus on system support and maintenance, while maintaining a work/life balance."
good,"DELL was also a good place to work. However it did have much oppurtunities over cross platforms and was dedicated to a single line of business @ Pune centre."
good,Dell has a great culture and is a great place to work.  The layoffs are frequent however and can be nerve wracking.  Great management teams.
good,"•	Working in a Sales Team environment."
good,They offered as many hours of overtime as you want.Great place to learn about the internal parts of Personal Computers
good,"Everyday will be hectic , we need to smart enough to simplify the complex work environment, there have been unlimited days i had to settle down for just a coffee break or for that matter ask my colleagues to fetch one for me, Lot many things to learn but not very systematic, Different process has different strategy for the same things."
good,1st and 2nd level appeals for claim paid in Bakersfield CA due to claims were paid in and out of network but no balance billing law in that State.
good,"Designing & delivering sales training content to trainers across the globe in each of Dell's regions including EMEA, North America, APJ & LatAm."
good,Dell is a technology follower and not a trend setter.  That goes for their benefits and pay.  Everything provided is either under or at market.  The provide no additional benefits or perks that make them standout.  Dell is also not growing so it is hard to move up but it is easy to make lateral moves within the company.
good,"I learned many thing in this comp."
good,"Dell's brand value is huge, which you will realize when would be working for it."
good,"It was an challenging work And maintain the Patient Medical Records."
good,Fast paced company that is constantly growing and evolving in the market.  High energy and high rewards for a job well done.  Company represents many amazing products and has very loyal customers and partners.
good,"Rainy days "
good,not bad but they never give any benefit such as salary increment  
good,"Force10 Network was acquired by Dell.  Shortly thereafter, a re-structure lead to an organizational lay off.  Not enough time at Dell to make more of a review."
good,"Worth to work for freshers. great place to start BPO career"
good,"I Identify and provide resolutions to an assortment of technical problems on SAN Networking and EMC Storage Virtualization platform VPlex to all EMC Customers Worldwide."

good,Business unit lead on Customer Experience and External Problem Resolution metric.
good,"Dell has great opportunities for building lasting relationships, a network of peers, and life lessons for personal growth."
good,"The job currently into its a voice process and the main thing that i have learned from here is handling stress, and all my co workers are good. but the job which im into is no where related to my qualification, the hardest thing is the night shifts."
good,"A typical work day at Dell Inc., was very productive and stressful. The training classes were informative, but not nearly what they should have been. Though I did learned to better communicate with people and better analyze situations."
good,Need to achieve weekly numbers
good,"Dell was very proactive in teaching and suggesting new selling techniques. They would keep the employees informed of what they did correctly on a call and what could have been improved, there was always balance on positives and negatives. I loved helping customers, especially if they had called in before and was unable to get their issue resolved previously. They were fantastic about giving bonuses for a job well done. The major thing that I would have changed about my position there was the constant changing of schedules with virtually no notice. I was told that schedules would change quarterly and ultimately it was changed monthly with less than a week's notice."
good,Del Technologies offers great work/life balance and the flexibility to work remote when needed. There could be many more opportunities for career advancement and better employee benefits.
good,"Productive, and challenging place to work. Management leaves their employees alone to perform their work with out looking over their shoulder or micro management."
good,"I did not have training provided to me to gather enough information to do my job to a full potential. I had to physically get out of my chair and ask co-workers to show me something and even then, they would re-direct me or state that they didn't have the time."
good,"It's a good place to work but unfortunately it is really a Dell takeover, not a merger, and this has significantly impacted legacy EMC.  Hopefully things will get better."
good,"Very good company if you like comfort zone and good work life balance benefits. They need to invest more in their internal tools and challenge more their employees, but in general a safe place to work."
good,"EMC, acquired by Dell, was a great company to work for as an engineer up until 2001.  After that, acquisitions and engineering leadership replacements turned it into your typical heirarchically bound corporation."
good,"Great work culture, good offices, average pay and benefits."
good,Working at Dell is great to really learn and experience multi tasking but its a call center and still has the culture of call center life. Numbers are put before employees.
good,"The work/life balance at Dell (in IT) is great. But there doesn't seem to be a lot of room for growth and technology adoption does not happen as quickly as it should. Lots of bureaucracy, not the best looking workplace, and there are no typical technology company benefits e.g. free coffee, snacks, etc."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Dell and all of the skills I learned. I really matured as a seller, but the job was very, very, very, Very stressful. And politics is a huge downfall in the workplace."
good,"The most important aspect is the flexibility provided for remote workers. But, it is middle heavy and growth is slow. In light of the EMC merger there have been lay offs"
good,"There are many teams to work with and depending on how they are you can have a great career path. it is not made for all, but perhaps very data, sales and operation driven people."
good,"A good place to learn for all entry level people. I did my part to elevate all of my team members to the next level in terms of gaining skills, knowledge and position."
good,Excellent place where you would make friends for life. Compensation and Benefits are almost nil. There are absolutely no benefits in terms of employee motivation.
good,"EMC has always been a great place to work."
good,"Good work/life balance. Good projects, opportunities for growth, compassionate managers and colleagues. Challenging work assignments, opportunities for learning"
good,For an outsourced agent the pay is only Okay. You often feel like your told to not script your self and not allow your self to be scripted. However there are so many rules for the manner at which you converse with customers that it seems like micromanagement.
good,"Massive email communications, Lots of tool issues, Always plenty of work to keep you busy, Average about 10 hours a day working, "
good,"Good work life balance."
good,"The best part of the job is by far helping my customers and seeing them succeed and grow."
good,"Worked on world's top 1% major crisis and had a lot of pressure."
good,"slow moving, relatively low pay, but get to work on cool products!"
good,"Excellent perks, work culture and job security. I recommend working with Dell"
good,"The camaraderie within the company is a great pro. As a contracting company, they make sure to keep all of their employees employed."
good,A real employee friendly place. Work can be slightly disappointing as it is more or less repetitive. Most of the good analytics work is outsourced to third parties and largely reporting work is in-house
good,"manage 80 public accounts."
good,Dell currently has many challenges but with the right management team the work environment is made better. Work/life balance is great.
good,"A lot of politics and business strategy that tends towards maintaining revenues at the expense of what is in the customers' best interest.  It's not all bad but with the politics and pace of getting things done, it can really drag down a high octane individual who is passionate about his or her work."
good,"The day is busy and there`s a team of carers working together to meet the needs of the service users. There`s care plans to be followed and healthcare professionals to liaise with. I have been trained in Dementia and Moving and handling, first aid and dignity. I record information and do ongoing assessments of service users. management are welcoming and involved in the running of the home, interacting with service users and staff. The team are close and friendly. The hardest part of the job is the demanding physical and mental energy required from you on each shift, but the rewards outway the demands when you get positive feedback from the staff, families and service users. "
good,"A company that wanted more production and didnt care about our health , I developed cts and even right after surgery with in 2 weeks I was being called at home to return to work where I could use my hands or not .. Dell cared more about production than people or families"
good,In Dell you can pursuit your goals easily with the help of a great team where you learn a lot of things not only professional but personal.
good,Interesting work
good,"Lot of responsibilities to learn,grow & thrive along with cross-cultural teams (Regional & Corporate teams)on regular business activities."
good,"I started off in consumer sales which was tough but I had many advancement opportunities. From there I moved on to customer/care outbound sales, and finally retail order processing before I was laid off. I came back as a contractor and was able to get a role as a sales support analyst for large enterprise and was able to add more to my personal skill set. In the entire time I have been with Dell I have avoided 3 RIFs and was taken by one, the RIFs are very common so they can be a distraction if you let them be. The best part of the job was the management, I always had quality managers that knew what they were doing, and through personal interaction had a lot of confidence in me. The hardest part of the job was simply finding a role that would not be outsourced. I learned many things at Dell, from sales and presentation skills to analysis and coaching and training other team members. I learned a lot about how a global company operates and adjusts to the changing global economy, and how products go from concept to production and how to acquire and maintain accounts with large and demanding customers."
good,The managers are fair & overall the enivronment is pleasant. Benefits are good. Pay is average. Advancement does not seem to be frequent & I have heard neither are raises. My biggest complaint is mostly feeling unchallenged as I have been processing for many years & training is slow here. But otherwise a good place to work.
good,"Great employees, but old company (35 yrs) acting like it. Red tape the norm. Trying to modernize development toward better Agile approach, while leadership is waterfall."
good,"Nice place to work, friendly coworkers, mostly pretty easy and low stress from my experience. I recommend this business to anyone looking for a low-stress job."
good,"1)Work life balanced."
good,"Dell is a fun place to work and a lot of politics are involved so there is a less chance to grow in dell ,lot to learn ,management is very friendly lot of trips,benefits."
good,"Every day will be challenging as new issues in out work and provide us the scope to learn more and work more."
good,"we can learn the process easily as it is of non-technical compared to HSBC."
good,As a fresher i have joined in Dell and got a good team spirit and i have involved in more fun games.good incentives provided by the company.enjoyed a lot.
good,"Dell is a wonderful company to work for, but work you will do. I cannot speak for higher level roles, but I bet it is an amazing job. the work culture is great, everyone is willing to help you progress yourself, although provided training is very limited in the technical side of the company. you are expected to study on your own time new company policies or equipment, as new release systems are very limited in appearance in the technical support side of things. But other than that, The benefits are great! decently Affordable medical insurance, as well as 3 weeks vacation a year! Entry level roles tend to be high stress environments, but dedication and hard work can open up opportunities for much more rewarding jobs. If it wasnt for the lack of business products knowledge for our technical environment, I would give the company a 4.5 or so rating. Great culture and entry level roles can have nerf wars."
good,"Fun, great people and ability to work from home. great place to learn about technology, very good working tools as well."
good,Can improve our communication had lot fun with my friends learn more things about process very good working in this organization
good,"The benefits of working at EMC are great. Good healthcare, employee stock purchase plan, free life insurance, and other side benefits."
good,"DELL is very excellent company."
good,"Learn IT implementations, from assessments to complex implementations. "
good,"- Call center, support technique pour les enterprise"
good,"Good Work Life Balance"
good,Amazing place to work llearn more with high values and ethics along with a proper work-life balance
good,"EMC has sometimes been called a ""whitecollar sweatshop"" or ""the Evil Empire"" but my experiences were very positive overall. What made the workload bearbable was the attitude of management and the dedication to duty of the people with whom I worked. It is no Nirvana, but if yoiu apply yourself and look for ways to contribute and grow, it can be a great experience."
good,"Dell's goal is to continue being profitable. They care about their people. They want them always trained and want them always succeeding. They sometimes slip with their sales model and management isn't always the best but most of the ones I know are incredible people. They train so much, your quota can sometimes seem impossible because you will feel at times you are in meetings or trainings too much but when you look back, it will match what you desire in an ideal job."
good,Best company for freshers i would say.. but cannot expect more salary.. They have enough employee engagement events.. No work pressure.  You will have enough free time
good,Un trabajo muy bueno en el que pude desarrollar mis capacidades lingüísticas así como también las aptitudes para negocias y relacionarme con mi entorno.
good,When it was dell things were pretty good when it became quest it has become trash. One good thing about this company is you can work from home unlimited.
good,Our team consists of 20 members and every 60 days we have an outing such as bowling or dinner. We are at the brink of being replaced on a constant basis.
good,"a great place to learn a lot of technologies especially in Healthcare domain. "
good,This is a great company to work for. The people are great and the job is always challenging and enjoyable. The only downside is the lack of advancement oppertunities and no possibility of raises. It's a great stepping stone towards a bright future career.
good,"The culture is very open, the managers are very approachable, relaxed environment and a fun place to work with. One can work, learn and have fun at the same time. The company gives you enough options to rejuvenate to the employees. Sense of job security is there. It gives the employees enough opportunities to shift between departments as per the capabilities."
good,This company mostly preferable for lot training and leanings platform...Good environment but there is no appraisal past 2 yrs...Cab facility should give 2 way.
good,"A Dell é uma empresa de grande oportunidade aprendi muitas coisas la , mas a mas difícil foi montagem de notebook muitos detalhes masnada que com alguns dias nao fique facil depois que peguei jeito tudo ficou mas facil e bom"
good,"Handling in-bound to out-bound calls, wether the consumer calling in is irate or not learning how to defuse situations without having to esclate. Using mulitple systems from Softheon (docking calls) to FMS (billing system) an many more. Getting the liberty to go into the walk-in center to handle face to face issues/enrollments with costumers i'd say is the best."
good,"Teaching about how computers store information and how the internet works, and that there is no filter over what goes on the internet."
good,"Supported  Large Enterprise segment Fortune 500 companies for all of US.  "
good,"I really enjoyed working here. It was a small and cozy group I worked with and I will miss it. It was perfect for going to school and being able to live on my own. A typical day was waiting around the mall until someone took the slightest interest in a computer, and then I talked with them to figure out what they needed in a computer, became friendly, and then suggested something for them."
good,"Dell is an excellent place to work, it has very good work culture with good salary benefits"
good,"I have like this job. Because, everyday i have met a different person and I have learn little about the work."
good,"Talking to customers  all day "
good,has accomplish all and learn all company policies and it was success working very rewarding and the benefits help a lots of families.
good,"One would be required to work mostly in Graveyard shifts, dealing US Consumers of Dell. Technical Support executives will be made to even sell Dell parts apart from Troubleshooting client issues."
good,Typical day would include ghosting and deploying multiple PC's. Dell provided needed documentation for all aspects of this job.
good,DELLEMC has helped me shape the person i am today. This has been my second tenure with DELLEMC and it has helped me develop myself as an Outside Sales Manager with the confidence to engage in IT based conversations at any level.
good,"Overall good iam working there for 2+ years"
good,"Would like to speak about the Technical staff to train employee is best 4 yrs before not sure now."
good,Company is driven on sales numbers like any other but take the work life balance and shift it fully to work. Worked close to 70 hours per week and 13-15 hour shifts opening to closing. Affects overall morale of employees and performance due to staffing issues.
good,I have more than 2 occurrences of commissions being withheld or not paid.  Dell kept commissions from me due to management discretion due to over payment.
good,"The work is enjoyable enough, however, the leader ship is severely lacking. Once you go above the team lead position everyone is aloof and evasive. Speaking only for my team, our team lead has made this a miserable experience. We are split between two locations in different states, he gives no attention to us locally and shows clear favoritism for the 3/4 of the team that are at his location."
good,"This company has great products, great sales people, but the management are too scared for their own jobs."
good,Dell's only concern is the bottom line.  They do not value the employee as they preach.
good,Working with dell has awonderfull experince have learned carporate culture and professional knowledge
good,busy matchdays at kc stadium and craven park. not enough gaurenteed hours. co workers was lazy in most cases. hardest part of the job was making the best of staff shortages. most enjoyable was delivering great customer service and experience on match days and functions.
good,"it was a good, learning experience. Answer 20+ in bound calls a day regarding anything from questions/complaints to sales opportunities for consumer computers and software."
good,"A typical day. Starting the day off with a goal in mine...learned how to lead a team and take care of daily task to get the goals required of my team and myself. Management just someone telling you what ever it was they thought you might want to hear that was great. Wonderful co-workers, friendly, outstanding. Telling a temp that he/she are not needed. Getting up every day knowing I had a job to do and to do it will at a 150% in mine."
good,"Manager had unique style of managing staff that made working in the off undesirable. I would enjoy working for Dell in a leadership role. Outside of a difficult manager, my time with Dell was great. I would have liked for the organization Director on campus."
good,"The company is great and continues to take market share, but the individual contributors are overlooked, overworked (expect 7 day work weeks to complete all assigned tasks) and inflated quota as a means of controlling pay grade."
good,"Dell is a LLC of more then 200 companies, there is not just one Dell, each department is their own LLC They also only hire for contract.  Which is why I will never go back there again."
good,Non-American managers are not good. Communication/collaboration is very poor. Don't expect replies to emails or IM messages if you are a contractor. Don't expect your managers to attend a meeting if you have sent an invite.
good,"Very inclusive company, all are welcome"
good,"Dell-EMC Is a great environment.  The only downfall is being underpaid for the work we do.  "
good,"stay tuned... lots of changes occurring due to: Francisco Partners and Elliott Management Complete Acquisition of Dell Software Group - Nov, 2016."
good,I was QA at EMC through a software transition from Oracle to SAP. We didn't know I'd be QA when we started. I worked with great people at a job I enjoyed. I was kept as a temp at $13 per hour for three years and had larger responsibilities than my management team. I left prior to Dell buying EMC. I wish them luck.
good,Our team is all about the numbers but i got the opportunity to work with customer feedbacks where i enjoyed working since we will handle different scenarios.
good,Spent my day creating reports and analyzing data. I learned so much about Excel. The management was mostly easy to work with and as I worked from home the coworkers were great. The job wasn't very difficult or challenging.
good,"The schedule is flexible and working at home sometimes is an option.  Most team mates are well-trained and have interest in technology."
good,"Its as simple as that, from my joining in dell till now a good learning experince and fourtunately this is my first job. All co-workers are helpful and supportive especially our managers. And if there is any backlog in production in the floor, we have experienced a lot more pressure. And few tours to favourite destinations like ooty, ellagiri were unforgetable...."
good,"Good job. Pay and benefits great. Learned alot. However, working 80 hour weeks, week after week for 2 years takes a toll on one's health and life in general."
good,"The manager and one level up determines your success and demise. If you have a great manager YOU will do GREAT if not, you need to find one fast or start looking outside of Dell for work as you will not be there much longer."
good,"The enviroment is very fast paced and covers 65 acres,"
good,great place to to work for beginners. but i wasn't a beginner. just needed something until the right opportunity came along. i really did enjoy the unsupervised work though. they gave you a job to do and you just did it.
good,"Good part is that everything is objective; sad part is that it is the only consideration. Even if you work for 15 years, it makes no difference. Be ready to expect to be laid off any minute."
good,"Good company to work with. "
good,"I was in the EMC part in Santa Clara. They did well on the sales side, but most of the company was controlled by the East Coast. They need to empower people on the west coast."
good,"a empresa oferece muitos benefícios porém, tem falsas avaliações anual, operador e gerencia, operador atinge todos os objetivos ganha promoção e é desligado por causa do alto salário, se for péssimo funcionário e aliado a gerência, se aposenta na empresa."
good,"I did support for a medical client they had.  Dell was the outsource vendor, and the medical customer let go of IT staff to bring on Dell.  Naturally, those leaving the medical business were not happy about that and it presented a lot of ugliness and politics."
good,Working for dell we was good.  To bad thing they provided employee with low end laptops.   Had to change laptop multiple time due to disk failure and had to re-image laptop multiple times also.
good,Management sucks.  Most are not knowledgeable as required.  Replace upper management.  Overall pretty good company to work for.  Would work for them again if given opportunity.
good,Its good company to learn in pressure.But the process and management is not that much good as compare to other leading companies.........................................
good,"Fast-paced, dynamic, competitive"
good,The working environment specially on client deployed projects is fast pacing. There are many tools that you will eventually learn to use which will be helpful on future projects.
good,IT is a good place to work where one gets freedom to do a lot of exploratory work. It is amazing to work with some of the brightest minds of the industry.
good,"It was a fun and interesting job. Working with a diverse group of people. "
good,"Good place for freshers"
good,"working in dell was quite good but they provided an unhygenic workplace  and unbalanced management."
good,People works there are very friendly. Easily you can find the stories and areas in the website. Just dial have huge data collection. All the process speaks about the data
good,"Case management, key account stake holders status, follows up, SLA's, meet dead lines, internal team coordination, logistics conference call, meet daily productivity."
good,computer company standard corporate america.  worked as comupter engineer no management potential eventually entire group was RIFed
good,"Been a while since I worked at Dell and lot of things have happened in the recent years. This is a company trying to reinvent and make itself relevant. Dell missed lot of opportunities in the past ( 2006 - 2008 ) year  time frame,."
good,I like the company.. the benefits but it is very unstable...
good,a good working atmosphere with highly motivated leads and energetic  colleges and motivating leads. lot learnt from them and a overall personality building. training was the best part which i enjoyed to the core.
good,Need to face day to day new tasks and work and implement some new ideas to learn something new daily.
good,Good place if you are working purely for money. Dell gets the best out of you as it pushes you to the core!
good,Architect and Implementation procedures allowed me to get involved with various SAN Storage related environments. Co-worker relationships were great for trouble shooting issues. Good company to work for as a whole
good,"Dell is a tough place to work. It's hard sells, and as a result has a lot of turnover. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people."
good,"Everyone is overworked in product management, there is little opportunity for advancement and the top management doesn't listen or give any credit to product management there."
good,"my start of shift during the evening would be 30 minutes early and in meeting to inform me of prior shift's day and the agenda for our shift's production goals. i would start with my team in a production meeting and inform them of our goals and how long shift is and any other issues, if we got assistance from other areas or new contract workers i made sure they were properly trained to assist in the production area. the hardest part of the job was when running lines short of staff myself and my team members took on the work to make sure we keep line full with work being send to builders or to make sure there was a good production flow of work to the builders. the most enjoyable part of my job was the diversity of people i was involved with and also the interaction with other areas of manufacturing and being able to learn in other areas of manufacturing building"
good,Good place to work even for those who just move to Austin. The staff is friendly and other employees are easy to work with. The rules for attendance is strict but helps keep everyone on track to be there for those individuals that want to work on a consistant basis.
good,"Good work place to work but the salary is very less and career advancement is not that much at dell, if you want a casual job and just pass time, i think this would be great place for you folks!"
good,"Dynamic place to work, typical day is up to you in accordance to service level agreements. Culture is good, management is rated yearly through survey, they do respond to results."
good,"Aprendi muita coisa, muito mesmo."
good,"I worked closely with the R&D teams of most business units owned by EMC, and even worked for a couple of the others before ScaleIO, and can confirm that ScaleIO is the most poorly managed of the Company's offerings."
good,day to day is very busy handling customer requests while prioritizing the calls at a high level and fast pace - having the  ability to make quick decisions and having the correct outcome to provide the best timely service
good,Do more with less seems to be the common theme more and more each day. No end in site. The company is s Granat company for exposure and experience but it’s takes its toll. Moving up isn’t easy as it’s all about how you know and with the hope someone doesn’t intentionally try to hold you back. Would change the past and work a different company to start as I gain a lot of industry knowledge and experience.
good,The heading says it all.  Michael Dell is a corporate raider.  He purchased EMC a year and a half ago and things have gone downhill since.  I am not sure what future EMC will have in the Dell world.
good,My contract with Dell under Insight Global was a great learning experience. It sharpened my skills with Desktop support and migration systems helped me gain IT tech positions elsewhere.
good,"In the 16 years I worked there, both as a contractor and then 13 years as an employee, I created a lot of work that I'm very proud of.  Some of the oldest material is still in use today.  I am also proud of the programs and standards that I spearheaded, which helped to bring quality and new revenues to the company. The job came with a lot of autonomy and my mid-level managers were excellent to work with.  The team I worked with was 10 out of 10 and all very competent in their skills.  I worked hard and I delivered on average about 4,000 pages of published work per year for 13 years, which is also a great accomplishment that I am proud of."
good,"Business managers oversee the activities of workers; hire, train and evaluate new employees; and ensure that a company or department is on track to meet its financial goals. ... In a smaller company, the production manager might perform these activities herself."
good,"Competitive, can be rewarding. Has 401k and insurance. Insurance is expensive and coverage is less every year. However, this seems to be happening everywhere."
good,"Work Hard and Party harder, you will be rewarded good if the project deliverables are on time and with quality. Good place for freshers to start and learn"
good,"The hardest part of working in Dell is that everyone works on VISIBILITY.  If you like it, then you will enjoy working there, otherwise, you probably would love to work for a smaller company"
good,"Mangement need to work on attaining assignment stability. However, career progression is pretty hard, no real mentoring, defined career progression, also salary and benefits aren't really up to the market for the similar size of company."
good,"The management changed and the new manager's style was difficult to understand,"
good,Job was taken away.  Produced tremendous value and that was not taken into consideration when job was pulled.  Miss working with a strong productive team.
good,Great company to work for I enjoyed working with the people there. They were great and very understanding. It a very flexible company and great diversity.
good,"let me go after 16 + years when company was cost cutting, kept less qualified people to do job experienced people should be doing."
good,You never know where you stand. Changing schedule based on what management wants. Selecting people to work weekends is random and more directed at whom they liked or didn't like.
good,"Della Tecnica is good reputed interior designer company which in Mumbai."
good,"Long day hours standing"
good,There are manager there with no leadership skills making it some time a uncomfortable place to work sometimes. We you get outside of that it wasnt it was ok place to work if you can deal with management short coming.
good,"Open door Policy which allows the information to flow and collaboration among different department making the processes more efficient to better respond to the Customer needs"
good,"Great place to get your foot in the door, however layoffs and uneasy atmosphere can leave you feeling highly stressed, not knowing if you will have a job from day to day."
good,My job is a simple yet sometimes stressful job. I answer and direct phone calls to potential customers for EMC. I must do so with a smile and ensure exceptional customer services. I must maintain a diligent work ethic and record failed data entry logs of EMC employees.
good,"Working for Dell is a great place to work. The benefits that come along with the job is great, however the management needs work"
good,"The work was awesome"
good,"Graveyard shift"
good,As per my experience its my memorable working place and i enjoyed work there so overall nice
good,"Dell has outsourced most of it's work so the job culture is difficult. "
good,"Captive company"
good,"Lots of work, less fun, good people."
good,"EMC has great people and products. EMC has grown immensely over the ten years that I have worked their with now close to 60,000 employees. EMC adopted agile as a development methodology and that has help them scope out projects and to better track engineers time, but also to ensure we do not over commit."
good,nothing to say about this place. It was a okay place to work job security was not good.
good,"Working at Dell was very stressful, but I loved the stress. It kept me on my toes everyday all day. It was all about Dells numbers."
good,"Dell was a great place to be.  Over 14 years they were very good to me and I had growth opportunities.  However, I was in the batch of RIF employees and was laid off.  I would still recommend Dell as a good place to work."
good,"1) My Team is with less members. so in this case heavy of work load will be available."
good,"EMC is a great company to come into. They have competitive pay until you get into the company. Then the company policy makes it difficult to move. Most job ""advancement"" opportunities force you to make lateral moves with little to now pay change. EMC pays well for new hires, but does not make the same offers to internal employees that have more knowledge, experience and understanding of company culture."
good,"Dell provides a relaxing, flexible workplace culture with good facilities and benefits to its workers. "
good,"I love working for Dell Technologies and Michael Dell's bold vision for the future; however, do not expect to get paid anywhere close to market value and if you work in Software Development look somewhere else. I've been paid substantially under market and the response from management for a pay increase ""You already make a lot of money for someone your age."" Note: I am 23 years old and responsible for the development of a globally used internal tool. They don't mind expanding your role as long as they don't have to pay you more."
good,"Great company for work and cultural inclusiveness. Company want employees to grow and think next level. Some thing like ""We just don't make client, we make relations with client""."
good,"Very Good Benefits."
good,"Dell is a very good company but the managers are so biased due to which lot of employees face problems."
good,Still EMC mgmt ran building and offers little to no information on the future or motivation of build or area. Everything is status quote for now until someone wants a change. More of a customer support environment then a engineering one.
good,"Contracted at Dell / EMC for less than a year.  Many contractors come and go, enjoyed my time there.  Worked mostly with off-shore employees, very busy and at times chaotic atmosphere but overall good experience."
good,Work life balance really makes all the negative aspects of working there less important. There was a marked change in culture and management following the acquisition of EMC (whom I was hired by).  EMC seemed to care much more about their employees.
good,"day do day job is ok, but there is very limited career advancement options. since it is a bpo job security isn't really there. but the workload is fine as long as you are doing it asap."
good,"Typical day was reporting, answering queries within SLA, generating sales reports, providing analysis for the business, reviewing & approving commission payments"
good,I love the flexible hours. I love the people. I need something permanent and which has an opportunity for advancement. I love the work and the company's flexibility with work-life balance. I love the constructive feedback for production and quality
good,"During my time at Dell, I learned a tremendous amount about effectively running a business through financial and operational discipline. My daily schedule was typically overloaded with meetings - being double- or even triple-booked during a time slot was a common occurrence."
good,Good place to work. Immense learning. Work satisfaction granted. Work load based on client. Banking expects after hours and weekend work. Management is good.
good,"Worked for company when it was EMC, enjoyed the high caliber employees and opportunities to grow and develop. Culture is tough, very competitive. Opportunities to advance were very influenced by relationship with manager"
good,Fantastic company to start your IT career in sales or support. I worked here for almost 16 years. You can run your own career. It is limited on promotion advances with annual salary thus the reason I left.
good,"Dell itself is a great company with tons of room for advancement if you're an internal Dell employee. If, however, you are through a 3rd party company like Convergys, Concentrix, Stream, or Alorica, such as I was, the pay rates are sub-par and benefits are non-existent. I have had several friends make the transition from 3rd party to Dell Internal, and though they had to relocate from Florida to Oklahoma or Texas, they very much enjoy working for Dell."
good,"Culture was good, management needs to get a little more proactive too long to make simple decisions. "
good,"Классический корпоративный монстр."
good,"Ambiente muito bom de trabalho bem dinâmica,parte dificil do trabalho é que não efetiva."
good,I enjoyed my time there and would go back if given the opportunity. The work/life balance in particular is great. The 401K is awesome. The medical benefits are just okay.
good,"Great company, but sometimes poor management planning with company transitions when company changes happen. I enjoyed working with people across the globe."
good,"Excellent platforms, leadership is getting better though managers kept much of the tools & methodologies to themselves - just dictated ""key punching"" tasks. Awkward client relationships at times."
good,"While somethings are great, with Dell EMC merger, Dell has fallen back on the pizza box mentality of everything has to be an appliance and killing a lot of good EMC products."
good,"This is day time only, with personal cubicle. The environment is kept very cool. If you don't like to sit in one place for over 4 hours this job is not for you."
good,"The pay is not good. Other benefits are okay. Dell bought a SV startup here; but many were gone for now."
good,"Dell is a good place to work.  Great work/life balance, average pay, and the people for the most part are awesome.  However, it is a very stressful environment, and they will cut you at the drop of a hat when they are cutting costs.  They have ZERO loyalty to their employees, everyone is expendable, and will become so at some time."
good,"Dell International Services"
good,"Lots of lost benefits when we merged with Dell."
good,daily i used to get learn new thing that makes me feel better. Client handling is the best part here. We always works with Good attitude and that's what i have learned here
good,"Dell was a fast paced, cutthroat place to work. It was fun at times and pay was moderate. I was given a great opportunity when I was hired on at Dell."
good,"Dell EMC is a good place to work.  Company is large and going through a few changes due to large acquisition of EMC, but that also provides opportunity for career advancement or change"
good,Really isn't a bad place to work. My team is fairly small. Not a lot of room to grow in my area without but certainly is if you branch out. Great benefits and pay.
good,High expectation from senior management and long working hours. Fun place to learn and has one of the best working environments. Best HR policy and processes. Candidates can learn strong fundamentals. Very bad work life balance and average pay-out.
good,Loved working with the diverse group of people at the account I supported. Hardest part of the job was dealing with last minute demands and weekend work
good,Work life is good and learned many different internal tools which give the option to perform work easier. Management is good and workplace culture is comfortable. The hardest part of the job is to work with no excuses of time 24/7. Colleagues and work environment was enjoyable.
good,Dell provides all the basic employee needs. but no futher allowances unlike most BPO companies will provide.  we just have a small count from the date i was hired and everyone seems to a good relationship with each other
good,"Good management, work life balance, flexible timing up to certain extent[depends on team], work from home facility. Overall it's a good company and worth to join."
good,"I had the pleasure of working for DELLEMC and it was a joy. I met new customers everyday, traveled, and did what I loved to do. However, the constant travel and hours put in on a daily took away from life outside of the company. I needed something more fixed."
good,The culture is pretty much the federal government culture as opposed to Dell's company culture.  Working in government facilities and playing by their rules.  Dell's culture is laid back and balanced from my experience.
good,"must have a strong work ethic, must be self-motivated, must be willing to go the extra mile all the time. "
good,"Dell is a good company to work for, it has been a rewarding experience for me & I have learned alot of skills useful to my future career. Management is very laid back & work to life balance is very complimentary."
good,Dell has a lot of fun activities on weekends for their employees. They have a Starbucks and a workout room for employees. The cafe includes 3 chefs for breakfast and lunch. They also provide a dry cleaning pick up and delivery.
good,Rather not go into specifics about this job................................. Simply put there is no job security at this job and Temps are not treated fairly!
good,"floor events"
good,"DELL is a customer first company and get lots to learn & also a challenging role to pursue. DELL/EMC is a great combination and work nature of both companies is different, but good to know."
good,"A typical day at Dell involves being the first to arrive on the job for my project...getting the phones and software up that I will be using for the day to help medical providers/brokers and members with their insurance benefits and claims...Checking resubmission of claims for completion. All interaction with members and providers is by telephone."
good,My Opinion is that Dell is very good company. Work Culture is ok but not great. Management need to improve and high level management is not consistent always changes.
good,Contract was related to opening new factory.  Spent 2 months in North Carolina.  The time in the factory itself was enjoyable.  Spent 2 weeks at a time at factory.
good,"program management to drive hardware program from concept to release. Working with XF teams to drive program planning ,schedule and execution."
good,Dell is a good place for a person who has no family and little responsibilities.  A constantly rotating shift isn't exactly friendly to a new budding family.
good,"use the latest technologies, enjoy the team work, and very nice place to work. A typical work day, sprint scrum meeting, design discussion, development, support QA, deliver the contents, and social :)"
good,"•	Solutions selling through computer hardware/software and solutions to government entities, healthcare and educational institutes"
good,Dell was the parent company . I did not have any direct contact with them. It was apex systems I had direct contact with and they were great.
good,"Ambiente agradável, atividades desafiadoras e participação de reuniões e treinamentos construtores."
good,"I enjoy my work. Its a great opportunity working in DELL."
good,They ran 15 software companies into the ground laying off 1000s of people while losing billions of dollars and destroying great software products.
good,"Starts with application health checks"
good,busy all in type environment.  Customer always came first. There was a lot of pressure to respond to issues immediately.  Nice facilities. Included GYM with pool.
good,Dell has a great work/life balance.  You are able to work from home when needed.  The company awards bonuses and raises according to tenure.
good,"Dell has been growing since I joined the company.  After some minor hick ups, Dell did two things:  went private, and decided to buy EMC.  Both of these decisions were good ones in my opinion.  Time will tell."
good,"its a great place to work for ,you do not have a vertical growth but you get lot of things to learn. you have great work life where your thoughts are valued"
good,"For my department I can say that unless you want to be a supervisor there is no advancement. Trying to advance to Senior takes a long time and they have no real guidance. Work/Life balance, sometimes aspects are great: work from home 1 day/wk as after 6 months of contractor work, 2 days/wk for full-time, leave early for holidays. The only time Work Life balance doesn't work is End of Quarter. In my department do no expect to have a New Years Eve with friends and Family because you will be in the office until midnight processing purchase orders that customers send. They do feed you though. Flexible work hours.  "
good,There isn't much room to move up in EMC at this current time due to the Merge to DELL. I have worked here for almost 4 years and i am still a contractor. I was told multiple times that i would be converted so i waited and i worked hard but i am still a contractor. EMC is a great company if your in the right department or position. The only problem is that its a very internal company if you want to get anywhere you have to know people. You could be the hardest worker in the building but the laziest worker could get promoted because his dad knows the boss.
good,"They train their people well, but have zero plan to keep the great people who they train. These great employees who produce and keep Dell successful just slip through the cracks every time there is a downsizing. Each employee is just a number on a spread sheet and the bean counters tell the Top what to do. They could be 10 times more successful if they would stop training their own competition. They need a plan in place to go over who the different dept. s are letting go and figure out if that is the smartest choice or if that person could be moved to another dept. that needs them. I’ve watched people who have 5+ yrs. at Dell who are great producers helping Dell make lots of money be shown the door over and over again with a severance package. It’s crazy."
good,"Good place to learn and gain experience in the real world.  Most companies do not work like dell as it is very strict on what you have access to.  You get experience and learn technologies but you don't get to experience many other things."
good,There was no job security. Everyone was always scared that they will be laid off next. Also there is a lot of CYA in Dell and not enough we are team
good,If you love being one of a million then DELL is for you. Don't expect much of a personal experience from Dell Management. Are you ready to be outsourced?
good,"Emc limited is a big established EPC Company provide services in Transmission, Distribution & substation division in India & overseas both.I am working with this company as a Senior Engineer in substation & Distribution line. My key functional area are designing & Technical review of vendor Drawings of substation.Working under a good management all works are well distributed and organized."
good,"I worked in the same group for 10 yrs, while I thought that was a good thing I soon realized I was wrong.  I wish I was told sooner that you need to change jobs every 2-3 yrs to move up."
good,good place to work just take too long to hire people on thought the company
good,"Fun and productive place to work for, people were great. Alot of diversity and integrity in the company. The company was great, learned a great deal about computers."
good,"Good place to learn new things and work."
good,Very positive experience working for Dell and Amsterdam customer
good,I enjoy it just a bit far of a drive for the pay. Great people to work around and very fast paced.
good,"My experiance was a good with EMC,,learned alot and put into practice Lean Manufacturing principles,"
good,"great group of employees to work with."
good,"A typical day at work would start off with checking the CSAT scores, "
good,"A typical day at work places a person into a well-kept environment with climate control, hands-on technology for troubleshooting and training purposes, and a vast collection of resources available for each employee to use in order to thrive in their position."
good,"Good work life balance."
good,"Dell International Services is the support and services division of Dell Inc., the large American computer hardware company, with operations in India (Bangalore, Noida, Hyderabad, Chandigarh), Europe (Bratislava, Bucharest, Dalian), Latin America (Panama City, Brazil, San Salvador), Africa (Morocco), and the Philippines, (Quezon City)."
good,"Dell Engineering Services was a descent place to work overall.  A typical day at work depended upon what was current.  Searching for work from existing customers was one aspect that was on-going.  As far as Cad work it consisted of a variety of customers, and multiple programs.  Designing in Pro/E, Creo2, non-Cad work such as circuit board design, analysis of power systems, creating project plans, scopes, budgets, timelines.  Great group of co-workers, easy to get along with and a good team environment."
good,"Take incoming death claim calls"
good,One has to put in long working hors everyday. A good company to start with having a good training program. Several opportunities to hone technical skills. Management is under constant pressure to deliver results using least of resources. My co-workers have been very supportive. The most difficult part of the job is to maintain a work life balance while the most enjoyable part  is the circle of contacts one makes while in the company
good,it was very chalenging nices places to learen and improve  your carrier
good,"Its a good company with lots of new things to learn innovatively,had a good time there."
good,Good company to work for. Lot of restructuring going on as a result of privatization.
good,EMC has its good and bad traits.  Like most IT sales companies today they have good reliable products that meet the need of the current business environment.  EMC is not on the bleeding edge of technology but stays close to the top on in all of the storage categories. The compensation model for most employees is on target with the high mid tier of the industry and benefits are good.  Still a lot of work needs to be done in the Partner Community.   There are many opportunities for a good sales rep at EMC but advancement is tough
good,"I took job under beliefs that this was a Sales Engineer position as told to me by a church affiliation (he received a commission for bringing me in). It was a CallCenter telemarketer position. Six weeks into job out of training was introduced to the actual job. "
good,"I could find one typical day at work and learned lot of things. Management is the only concern I am leaving dell. Defiantly nice team to work with a very good team support, the hardest part of the job was when someone stand on your head and ask you work. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning my process everyday there is something new to learn."
good,"Dell is an extremely fast-pace company.  Management has a high level of corporate politics. Co-workers are a lot of fun to work with. The hardest part of my job is to completed my projects with very little upper management support, there is a lack of management sponsorship. The most enjoyable part of the job is the flexibility to balance my work/life activities."
good,Many Organizational changes that don't allow folks to mature in role.
good,"Dell is a great company to work for.  I enjoy my team mates, I enjoy the work, I enjoy the work/life balance Dell offers."
good,"I am Working here from past 2.7 years, I learned so much. but in other part like salary, it to o low, no sufficient increment."
good,Typical day consisted of producing sally Hansen nail polishes and I learned a great deal about being an assembler as well as a line leader. management was okay. co-workers were fun but drama.
good,"Nothing really interesting happened working here. Picking up phone calls, taking orders, etc."
good,"I learned how to rebuild and assemble a computer and how to troubleshoot them and repaired"
good,"Recruiting and hiring."
good,"here i learn goods in/out, dealing with customers, shipping all over the world and VAT forms."

good,"Empresa boa, porem instavel pois os orçamentos demoram a ser aprovados,deixando os profissionais sem certeza da continuidade dos contratos."
good,No guarantee for work .
good,I learned how to build desk top computers on a assembly line. I worked with a lot of different people. I enjoyed the challenge of building a computer and putting in my part to make it work. A nice environment to work. It was a fun place and friendly people.
good,"Working at Dell Inc. was a wonderful experience. A normal day at work would consist of assisting customers via phone, email, and/or fax with any questions or concerns they had regarding Audi vehicles. There was great growth potential as well as multiple training classes available for you to expand your knowledge about the company and its products. I left Dell Inc. with a great sense of what great customer service is."
good,long hours with little or no credit for the work
good,"I enjoy each day working as a medical Coder. Learnt to manage associates by leadership training. Now,working in the Quality Team and a back-up for a group of associates,keeping a Quality check and improving the Quality. Working my best for meeting the customer's needs and satisfying them."
good,Good place to start PC support. Company willing to train you on what you wanted.
good,"A great work environment with fantastic coworkers. The office is complete with coffee, tv, and music. This makes the work environment less stressful and monotonous. The office is filled with positive and encouraging slogans and support from coworkers and management."
good,I enjoyed my job even though it was repetitive. I liked the overtime and being able to provide for myself. The benefits and 401K were especially attractive. I learned so many things about computers in addition to the knowledge I already have.
good,It is a very demanding company providing the best environment to learn the storage and cloud market. They do business with the world's most demanding and largest customers.
good,"Overall my stay with Dell was short. However, the time I spent there was filled with learning about sales and calling on customers, not to mention the technology."
good,"Lots of learning and good company to work with. Employees working here are enjoying the work culture, flexibility and benefits. I enjoyed here and moved to next company."
good,"Medical is really good as company contributions are more than half the cost. good 401k contributions. Good vacation days, sick days and national holidays are given"
good,Extensive problem solving and relationship management. Managing the conflict with Direct sales team is most difficult. Weekly sales forecast can be cumbersome.
good,"It is very good platform to learn and explore new technologies , workplace culture is good and typical day goes smooth and you have a really very good management"
good,"It's all about hitting goals and doing so with the best quality of work. As with any job, it has ups and downs of how things progress. New products get added all the time and keep the place busy."
good,I really enjoyed the company until I got promoted and my new management was awful. I got pregnant and they treated me as a bad employre because I had doctor appointments.
good,"Good place to get a stable work life balance."
good,"Enjoyable group to work with.  Opportunities for advancement.  As with most jobs, your achievements will be based on how hard you are willing to work."

good,"Good learning Curve. Did lot of new experiments, worked across different teams.  Good work culture lot of good friends.  Different technologies to learn."
good,"At a client location so not direct involvement with Dell Technologies, but the Manager and the company benefits are good and you are allowed to grow in your role"
good,Dell is highly focused on cost and efficiency. Great people to work with there. Focus on cost can be challenging and restrictive. Strong team of people.
good,It's been a while since I've worked there so I don't know what it's like now. It was good when I was there. I enjoyed the job i had. I wouldn't mind doing it again.
good,"Work is really heavy, more work less people as people were let go after merger with major companies."

good,Learned a great deal and accomplished a great deal. People were great to work with. Introduction to new technologies. Great work/life balance. Great company!
good,"I loved working for Dell.  Unfortunately, I was laid off."
good,"Reporting sales volumes"

good,"Work life balance is pretty good. very flexible. Remote work possible."
good,"Provide technical support to ADT employees needing assistance with Citrix, Active Directory, Bomgar and VPN connection, Microsoft Office, and Windows 7.  "
good,Dell was a great company to learn some of the early ins-and-outs of sales. Quality of work life depended on the sector you were assigned. While I did not fully enjoy the area I was in there were plenty of other segments that seemed to give lots of opportunity to it's employees.
good,"Dell was a good company to work for as long as there was a job that fit your skillset. However, if that wasn't the case, there was no measures in place to allow you to contnue to be emplyed by them."
good,Dell is a company whereas I wouldn't mind working for because they have helped me on my journey as becoming an Information Technology Specialist. Dell help me gain work experience.
good,Dell is globally company they promote an environment that is rooted in the entrepreneurial spirit to what the company was founded. The teams at Dell follow an open approach to technology innovation. Dell helps the employee's out by investing in a career path.
good,"For a consultant, EMC was a mixed experience. On one hand, it is a large company with many resources and opportunities (with other companies under the EMC umbrella like VMware) . On the other hand, it is not a consultant-first or services company."
good,"Company lost the contract, i was hired through an employment agency and didn't work directly for Dell. "
good,"Dell career of 13 years allowed me to grow skill set; master leadership and development of teams.  Company holds strong emphasis of customer experience excellence, individual development and engagement with community"
good,"Dell is a great place to work if you are seeking success, accomplishments, advancement, income, benefits, and creativity. The culture is one where getting things done takes precedence over just about everything else. However, Dell's leadership and people managers encourage and allow contributors to always to more regardless of the time required or the lack of support resources necessary to accomplish goals within normal hours. So, hard work and getting along is rewarded, but work life balance and support from leadership is pretty bad."
good,"I worked at Dell Technical Services and the place is ok. There is a little bit of flexibility, but not a whole lot. I learnt how to deal with angry customers."
good,typical day at work go and take calls learn how to make customer satisfied good to work hard part was can get any over time there most enjoyable part was going to GYM at work
good,Really wasn't much to this job. Very very strict on you being on time. Taught me the importance on being on time on your job. Not very flexible. Good lunch. Didn't get along with alot of my co-workers they were very rude and nasty. Didn't choose respectful and polite workers
good,It was fun working on teams that could get products delivered on schedule but direction from business was vague and there was too much big company bureaucracy to deal with .  I was able to work on a wide variety of interesting projects with good people.
good,"Bra arbetsmiljö lokalt, om än väldigt toppstyrt på Finansbolaget (ifrån HQ Dublin)"
good,I don't have much to say.   Everything was fine and good. Please adjust and resubmit.  Your Review doesn't quite meet our quality guidelines.   it was excellent
good,Lots of opportunity to rotate.  People are friendly and intelligent and there are opportunities for advancement since the company is so large.  I would recommend Dell.
good,"I am well versed with Dell desktops and laptops. I worked at Boeing (Space Shuttle division), Harris County (IT department), and major corporations using Dell desktops and laptops. As a result, I am familiar with Dell technology and setup."
good,"It was difficult to find new opportunities in other areas of business. Felt restricted to a path...change tends to be tough to execute. Learned a great deal about technology trends."
good,"Dell-EMC offers a technologically sound development environment for products for many of the most important companies in the world.  They use cutting edge technology to develop products that suit enterprise needs.  They offer training to improve your skills.  It is a very visible job, with customers around the world to service on products that are very valuable to the market."
good,A typical day at work is to provide planning and analysis for the Americas Enterprise Sales organization.   The people are the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,enjoyed the workplace as it involved multicultural atmosphere.learnt a lot about technology and its use.got an exposure to international customer base.

good,"Dell EMC is a very successful technology sales organization, selling technology solutions across the board, focusing on IT solutions for both the Client End User and Data Center."
good,"*** Innovation promoting"
good,Great Benefits and they give you alot of tools to learn. Lots of people work remote so the company culture isn't as apparent as average companies. Employees for the most part are happy but there are tight deadlines and often long work days.
good,This company was as excellence as a company can be. They offer great incentives to employees that show potential. I loved working for them and would go back if I could.
good,"Worked in the server lab running tests.  Very loud environment with all the server fans but that is expected with servers.  Good pay, good supervisors and engineers."
good,I would highly recommend Dell as an employer of choice. Good starting salary and regular opportunities for pay advancement. Believe they could do more to enhance job stability.
good,EMC2 a subsidiary of Dell was a great working environment assisting internal clients issues. Collaborating with IT co workers in different departments to resolve issues (ie networking).
good,"Dell offers many oppurtunites to those who go above and beyond the required skills and the teams are family-oriented who understand the day to day struggles with life. However in the workplace there are some flaws such as Communication barriers between teams, promises that are changed later down the line as well Non-Useful Meetings that took time out of your deadlines for projects."

good,"Great place to work, fast paced lots of work though more difficult to move around if your a contractor. Nice people all about the customer. Would recommend to potential candidates."
good,The temperament has been to not expect to advance in anything passed the Sr. Technical level for me experience. After several one on one meetings with management still there were no lateral opportunities for advancement.
good,Great pay but awful working 12 hour shifts over the weekend. Very stressful but the management was very helpful and accommodating to employee needs. Might have been more tolerable if I worked regular hours during the week.
good,Initially due to staffing the workload was constant and fast paced.  If you were not available for a call management was right there to see why.  Later after staffing increased the pressure went down and eased.

good,"The Dell culture is a very fast paced environment that is also very matrixed and constantly going through reorganization - all of which can make it challenging to navigate Dell and get ramped up fast. Initially I felt like a mouse trapped in a maze, attempting to navigate myself around to find that ""cheese"" or answer to your simple question and getting the answer to your question can take longer than you expect. Because of this, ramping up took longer than I anticipated but once I got the feel of the culture, systems and processes, then I felt more equipped to thrive. To succeed at Dell, you have to be tenacious in finding and getting what you need to get your job done. You can the same. "
good,It is a good and stable place for those who are looking to learn some stuff about this industry. Recent merge with EMC may or may not have some impact on your future career.

You have to be on top of your game or be replaced by the next hungry pup waiting outside the door looking for their chance to shine. Compensation is good if you leave and come back versus staying in house looking for advancement. That being said besides being well compensated and a pretty good work/life balance outside of sales, be expected to work your butt off!"
good,The work life balance was great. Co-workers are great. Paid time off and holiday pay was great Pay is great when they actually calculate it correctly. Lots of issues with the finance and comp team paying accurately and on time. Lots of changes mid quarter that impact pay. The tools and processes are the worst I've ever used - it makes the job more stressful than it needs to be.
good,"My position at the Dell kiosk was pretty easygoing. The pay structure was supplemented with commissions, but the brand produced plenty of traffic, so the money was steady. The closing of the Dell Direct program terminated my position with the company."

Every day was a joy to be a work, the calls from our members, the associates, the information we shared with each other.  Starting early and finishing early every day.

good,"Good job atmosphere."
good,although my 10+ years were a challange I will give Dell props for allowing so much flexibiltiy with schedules.  Working with some managers is a struggle especially because Dell likes to bring in interns that try to come up with ideas that have been tried so many times in the past but I will say that they are the only company in Austin area that will work with your personal schedule and allow alternate work schedules which is a big perk.
good,"Fast business environment"
good,"Must be able to work independently.   My job requires that I define and complete my own work objectives.   The ability to assess, analyze, and come up with process and service level improvements is a given.  "

The team consistently steps up to deliver however and there is good camaraderie in the push to make things happen.  In my opinion, EMC needs to pay more attention to major competitive technology tends. The technology landscape is shifting, and I hope EMC can keep up with change.

Dell managers for the most part aren't micro managers, but there are a few still out there. Everyone can get a little obsessed on hitting metrics versus booking business for the company. For example you could achieve your daily quota but if you didn't make 50 outbound phone calls, you might still get threaten with a written warning. It's elements like that which led me to pursue other opportunities. "

good,"we receive calls daily, troubleshoot computers and dispatch both replacement parts and field technicians."
good,"People are great to work with, work-life balance is great for some folks. have to put in your time just like any other organization.

This just mean they have terrible Directors at that level taking care of their own."
good,"Good company to learn different technology"
good,"Work environment was rigorous and very demanding."
good,"Dell takes good care of their employees, as long as they produce. There's a decent commission, along with spifs and lots of opportunities to win cash and/or prizes for various sales objectives.

good,"Dell is a great place to work if the client base is strong enough to sustain a team of consultants. This wasn't the case when I was brought on board, and there were growing pains and downsizing. Otherwise, the opportunities offered were many, the teams were collaborative, and the clients were interesting."
good,"I worked at Dell Inc back in 2004 and got hired on through a temp agency. I was grateful for the opportunity but due to Dell relocating to Ohio at the time destroyed Austin, TX job market and I was forced to take a package due to no job security."
good,"Good exposure to clients"
good,"Overall, Dell has been a great learning and networking experience. I have gained numerous certifications and trainings. Management is always changing but the ones I've had have all been great leaders."
good,"I worked for Dell for 14.5 years. During that time I was afforded the opportunity to learn something new every year. My days started at 7am and ended when I got my work completed. Because most of my positions were global, I worked late hours Mon-Thurs. There was fantastic flexibility around where I worked. I was able to work from home and go into the office as needed. This makes working long hours tolerable. The people I worked with were brilliant. It was a good experience."
good,"Dell is a great place to work at, but if you do not have patience and cannot take outside priorities out of this workplace it is not a place for you to work. The pay is exceptional, the hours are also and the customers you have to deal with thru the health insurance companies are sometimes rude. But if you can handle it, then go for it. I loved working here, I quit only due to transportation. The staff and managers were always helpful also even though they were busy more than we were. Training was somewhat okay, overall it was well needed, but if your not willing to cooperate during training you will no doubt do terrible on the floor. This facility also has a cafeteria including a Starbucks and also a gym. It has a walking trail as well as a basketball ball court outside. The environment is somewhat comfortable similar to home, but just a workplace of course. Furthermore, overtime is mandatory. If you want extra bucks you wont have a problem with that, but if you don't you will; look forward to a challenging job ""not a hard job at Dell""."
good,"Working Dell is all about your group and manager. Overall, it is a great place but management is everything, and the culture can vary widely based on that."
good,"Dell only gives out contracts to low pay for higher skilled positions with no benefits to Contract Companies. The majority of their staff for Sales, Customer Service, and Tech Support are contractors. Most are not allowed to work more than 18 months before they are laid off and never hired full time on Dells payroll.  It is a shame they have a revolving door of good talented people that are left without another job to replace their one at Dell due to contract was dropped due to the 18 month rule."
good,"It has been too many years since I left Dell to write an accurate review.  It certainly was a great career for me from 1992 - 2010. "
good,A typical day Included packaging and shipping of computer devices.  I really did not learn anything new.  The workplace culture was diverse.  There was not really a part that I considered being difficult.  The most enjoyable part was the job was easy going along with the people.
good,"Company had just acquired another company therefore everything was in flux. They were firing people left and right, therefore moral was low and job security was uncertain."
good,"People are really sweet and are willing to go the extra mile to help you. Laid back and not very tech savvy. If you are looking for a job to learn the latest technologies, this may not be the right place. But, if you are looking for a job that balances out life as well as work, look no further."
good,"worked on time, no extra hours of work and if we worked for extra hours also we are paid for that, good work culture and no pressure. we are taken to outing once in a year."
good,"good smart people to work with, good projects"
good,"Legacy EMC Teams work really well together and have a reputation for delivering results, both to Customers and internal partners. Maintaining a good work-life balance can be challenging, but legacy EMC Businesses do a good job of empowering their teams and helping them be successful. Merger with Dell has seen more focus on conforming to Dell corporate culture which is slower paced and not as focused on timely delivery of new products to Customers."
good,Dell as an organisation is a good learning working place. With proper guidance you can do good. One needs to be on top of the game & should be ready for changes. Numbers with ethics are driven.
good,"EMC were a very comptitive vendor who were extremely good at articulating the business focused benefits of their technology."
good,"Dell was an excellent place to learn new skills.  It is a fast paced environment and the latest tools are available for doing your job.  It was a great meritocracy environment. There are often times when long hours are required.  However, you will be handsomely rewarded for your hard work."
good,"* Provided customer service support for new and current medium users with Dell platforms"
good,"My day to day Job involves giving support to Desktop and Laptop users. Creating users in Active Directory, reset password, disable accounts, renew user accounts etc., Configuring outlook email, create PST's, map PST's.etc.,"
good,"Pros"
good,Dell prefers to silo individuals based on their technical skills. This did not fit for me to wear multiple hats and work in multiple disciplines. This was not for me.
good,Its good place to start your career i was part various teams in Dell i joined in sales and later moved to finance and later Order management and later pricing and costing team.
good,"EMC prior to the merge was more focused on mainframe than Dell is. This may change in the future.  To many foreigners are being hired imho."
good,was in the manufacturing side of things so worked the 12 hour shifts monday to thursday. mad hours but had long weekends which was nice. management sucked big-time
good,"Great environment to grow professionally,Great work."
good,"Over my four years time at EMC, in a broad scope I moved between two different roles. From Channel Operations to Corporate Pricing. This transition was valuable for me in many different ways and as my experience grew I also became more comfortable carrying much larger and more mission critical projects."
good,my time at Dell was enjoyable. Good work environment and fair pay and benefits. Competitive workplace but not cut throat. Good people and good level of diversity.
good,"Lots of talented people working here.  If you want to advance your career, there are many people willing to assist.  Mind your Ps and Qs and network, network, network.  It is said that Dell EMC is the best 1st and 3rd job one can have.  Make sure that you get hired in at the right job grade for your talents.  It is difficult to move up more than one job grade at a time and most often your time in role is more than 18 months.  Expect to grow and learn. Expect that it will be a challenging environment.  The Dell EMC experience is whatever you make of it"
good,"This was the first job where I would be working from home (San Jose CA). My mgr was in LA, and most of my team members were in Texas. "
good,"Strong sales culture, what I appreciate because I am a natural born sales person. The managerial team has strong company culture incorporated what helps to understand some ambiguous situations"
good,Great people to work with.  Great benefits.  Dell Technologies just purchased EM and the new company culture has not been established to evaluate at this point
good,Dell is a great place to work and used to have great work life balance....the culture has changed and bit but it is not all that bad. Money is fair and the people that work there are fairly good people.
good,its a nice place to work with .. just that my account is shutting down .. i have to leave the company .. so as a job wise its a nice place to work around
good,"They provide good environment to their employees, every one can learn new technologies in their own work area.employee friendly management,western culture."
good,"I have learned there is always opportunity for growth. A typical day at work is self pace, load your laptop and start your day. The workplace culture is very positive. The hardest part of the job is sitting at a desk for long periods of time."
good,You just have to be in the right role at the right time. They do not pick you on your skill level for the position they only pick you on who you know.
good,"Work culture within employees is good. There is no compulsion to work in office only always. "
good,"Many hours on conference calls with overseas companies and Dell employees in Asia."
good,"Good place to work. Recently Dell acquired EMC, so nothing much to say as of now, will see the benefits or downside in the near future, So far work is good, free training and certifications available to scale up your skills as and when required."
good,"Good Place to work.                                        "
good,"Solid corporate environment.  Good, smart people working for common goals.  Dell merger was a negative as the company has lost too much talent.  Cannot speak much to new Dell leadership."
good,It's a graveyard shift. I learned a lot of things like troubleshooting different kinds of computers. The management is good and the place is very good and had a lots of fun. The hardest part of this job is when you are talking to an old customer that does not accepting any explanation. The most enjoyable part of this job is you will learn a new things every day
good,Good training and learning experience. The night shifts/work hours made things difficult for me otherwise decent experience. Great experience if you find a good team and lead.
good,this job is a little stressful but good benefits. There is not much opporutunity to grow and branch out! upper management can be a issue as well. Also a little unorganized!
good,Dell is a place for youngster from different background but they fail to follow the work culture set by the management. Work stress is way to high and job security is not provided.
good,Dell had good facilities for the employess atleast when I was working. Not very sure of the situation now. It was pretty much only work and little time for anything else.
good,"you work on a contract basis, once your contract runs out you are benched and you better find a job fast, they don't help you find a job, even though there are many jobs open within the company the other managers take their time hiring knowing that those on the bench are on a short period of time"
good,"Dell EMC is a good enterprunner company with lots of product focused. Sales is robust engine what management drives. If you are able to drive sales and achieve success at DELL EMC."
good,"Good people but poor management. They were trying to do a 3rd party spin off for Enterprise Network Sales and Services in Tempe. Training started off well, but Corporate did not provide same support as provided for Dell direct Employees. They ultimately closed the new vertical."
good,"Helping Client with hardware and software computer issues"
good,"Nice place to work. Challenging job...as sales target is high...but loved hitting the targets "
good,Nice Company. Pay is very less. but the campus atmosphere is so good. very good people to hangout and work atmosphere is so nice .
good,"Its a very nice company to work for. After Dell take over, some policies are changing but hopefully they will be more employee aligned per product company standards."
good,"My Great Place to work."
good,"chaotic days, however they are manageable. "
good,"It was quiet challenging to work for a US based health care company, fully productive and less fun. Less time to make friends. Enjoyable part is saturday and sunday is fixed off."
good,It was a good job until they called us in a room one day and told us that they were taking our jobs overseas.  Good severance package though.
good,"As long as if we think we are working for Dell its fine. Once if we start working for ourselves things and surroundings will definitely impact .."
good,You have to do a lot of installation of servers and recabling. A lot of physical labor. There are snacks and drinks. Co-workers are pretty nice. The job requires a lot of learning if you haven't touch a server or switch.
good,"They closed down many of their centers over the years due to loss in revenue and cost cutting,  leading to loss in employees trust."
good,"Dell is a good company to work for, you can strike the work / like balance at Dell and you can have sort of flexibility on what you are doing or what you want to be in the future"
good,"Bom lugar para trabalhar. Com um clima inovador, preocupada com o bem estar do funcionário."
good,"I had good years at this company, but there was difficult to move up,"
good,It was a good place to work since i had different tasks at hand however over time the work became monotonous. Good management. many opportunities to improve skills. staff were good.
good,"There are many intelligent, hard working people at EMC. I worked in the software support center. There was pretty good training on the products in general, but more recently the workload didn't allow for the proper time frame to train for new products appropriately. Nevertheless we were thrown into supportingf these new products."
good,"Performance Evaluation is a multi-purpose tool used to: Measure actual performance against expected performance. Provide an opportunity for the employee and the supervisor to exchange ideas and feelings about job performance. Identify employee training and development needs, and plan for career growth."
good,"Typical day started at 6 AM. Working for Dell in a hospital environment with on-call was very demanding. Our department went from 3 people to 7 within 6 months of Dell taking over the IT services. Prior to Dell Hiring me I worked as the Network Administrator. Management style was different, never visisted our Dell main office to get a real feel of how Dell works as a unit. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with so many applications and continously learning new products to make our Infrastructure run according to the staff. This was a great experience and I'm very appreciative of this position I hold."
good,Great working environment. Former colleges are extremely helpful and help you do well. Management is very friendly and like to make things better and good.
good,"Dell has moved into a direction of sales and client engagement. Moving away from technology and services is a bit of a let down from my point of view."
good,Worked primarily in the Financial Services Practice until the organization decided to change their business model. The organization had a sizable practice until the realignment.
good,I worked as a contractor for Dell at their customer site.  through anyone company.  Had very little interaction with Dell employees
good,"I am a Dell contractor posted at a federal facility so I did not work day to day at Dell. However, I was in constant email communication with Dell management and got a strong sense of the company culture and direction. Work for Dell at the CDC was rewarding, professional, Dell management was responsive and engaged and overall the working experience is very rewarding"
good,My coworkers are fantastic. The facilities are pretty depressing but that not consistent with all the buildings. Learning the inner workings of Dell is the biggest mountain to climb.
good,Very nice place to work when it comes to a professional life. has no restrictions of any other ethical activity at work place. Feels like you are with a family.
good,"Good place to work with, great sales environment, fun atmosphere. Commute was terrible if you live in the Austin area, but all in all, good place to work."
good,"I enjoyed working at EMC.  Local management is supportive and truly cares about work life balance.  Great culture, very diverse."
good,"Sämtlichen Kollegen denen man persönlich, am Telefon oder via Video-Meeting begegnet - sind super nett, hilfsbereit, kurz: Man fühlt sich wohl und es ist sehr Kollegial. Die nächsten Vorgesetzten der Management-Ebene sind ebenfalls überwiegend nett und kompetent."
good,"I really enjoy working at EMC, the environment is healthy and the job is always changing. I believe change is an important thing to be able to work with daily because that is how you take on more work and become the best employee you can be. I have worked with 100+ million partners daily and I have become the support for all federal partners in the one year I have been at EMC. The reason I am looking for jobs elsewhere is the merger that has made job security, not as strong to say the least. Right now I am a contractor with Judge through EMC and that is another negative. Overall I have grown as a business professional with EMC and I recognize that this is a great company."
good,"Empresa com ambiente muito bom, plano de certificações técnicas, flexibilidade no horário."
good,"Dell has given me lot of opportunities to learn and earn certificates like Train the trainer, six sigma trainings and presentation skill trainings. The culture of working in night shift helped me to think broad."
good,Dell has given me to grow my professional and inter-personal skills. Seniors were co-operative and created a fun evironment during work. .

good,"room for advancement, proper training, great benifits and well compensated.  the work/life balance wasn't always the greatest, and the management had some weaknesses, but overall, had Dell stayed in town, i was really getting to like the place."
good,"In general a pretty good place to work. The work life balance will depend on what team you are on. Most teams and managers are great, very few are terrible."
good,"cumplio las expentativas como trabaj, desempeño buen sueldo y buen ambiente laboral"
good,"Great place to work, the work atmosphere is great but there is not a lot of internal movement and management is not the best"
good,"Excelente ambiente de trabalho, grande aprendizagem, pressao positive dos numeros, bom relacionamento com o CEO"
good,"Very fun and productive work place, always seems to be busy through out the day, always learning new things every day and meeting new people. The hardest part of the job is when it gets busy, but you just have to make sure to keep your cool and do your job correctly and get to the next person as soon as possible."

Enabled teams to deploy architecture and avoid issues, large and small. Leveraged troubleshooting skills,  break/fix experience, engineering knowledge, problem solving, and performance tuning to deliver a seamless solution to the business needs."
good,"Dell has excellent pay and benefits, but expect to work hard and put in some long hours.  The opportunities to move around and progress in your career are out there, but they also have a yearly 'purge' which means job security is challenged on a yearly basis.  Management is good and bad.  I had excellent managers there who 'had my back' and believed in developing me and supporting me.  Other managers just didn't do that.  "
good,"Good company culture. I like the level of diversity displayed during my daily interactions. Benefits are good I suppose, as I have never compared to similar companies. Work life balance if pretty good."
good,"Fast-paced call-center environment but with the added responsibility of trend analysis."
good,"•	Handling all the Inbound and Outbound calls from Dell US Consumers with regards to customer grievances."

good,"being my first job,dell surely enchanced my selling skills as i continued to be regular revenue star for my team.As i was also in charge of the sales tracer for my team,as i learnt how to motivate my team."
good,"The work environment at EMC is challenging in a good way. They expect a lot of every person. The one draw back is that the facilities and policies are 5-10 years behind a cutting edge technology company and as a result the innovative and creative elements suffer. "
good,"EMC is a great company to work for, it has a very friendly work environment."
good,Had driving culture.  Current reorgs in the delivery organization have eliminated some great people who are now seeking new employment opportunities
good,"It was fun to be part of EMC. Since I was there in summer lot of activities took place. Only travelling is the concern."
good,I managed a team of 48 associate in Indpls and Evansville that supported the desktop and laptops for over 34000 internal associates.
good,Great pay good company to start your career with. Fast pace very competitive environment. The campus is nice and the lunch 😋 is awesome 🙆.  Work and home life sometimes blends because of the demanding work but the pay and the experience is worth every bit.
good,The team concentrates in reaching the goals established by senior management.Good company to work for despite the size of it. Offers great flexibility.The hardest part is to reach goals with lack of innovations on their products as the competitiveness is very aggressive.
good,able to stand on my feet for a long peered of time. Manage to build pc in a timely fashion. Able to move through the assembly doing different builds.

good,"Conservative company, hard to advance within the organization.  However, I was thrilled with many appreciation and recognition from old executive management and engineering team from Legato (EMC purchased Legato System, Inc.) for my contribution.  Learned new software application with Oracle but advancement within organization was limited."
good,Each new day at Dell presented a new challenge on how to help improve the customer experience. I loved my team and the customer's I worked with. I enjoyed the challenge and keeping the customer's happy.
good,"Dell has been my first job since retiring from the US Army.  It has been a wonderful transition, and I enjoy the current challenges of my job.  I have higher ambitions than staying in a Network Operations Center, and currently there is nowhere to grow.  I am finishing my degree in Networking Management, and working towards Cisco certifications, but once those are complete I would like to look forward to more challenges and greater opportunity to affect and build networks."
good,"It was a fast paced office that required the need to multitask daily. It required high Customer Service Contact, along with the ability to know the ins and outs of each companies' products (5 companies) and how each of their products functioned, as well as the ability to work with clients, agents, companies and other office personnel with fluency. In the time of being employed with them, we maneuvered several company changes and mergers in a short period of time."

good,"Dell is in a tough position and will need to make some drastic changes going forward.  I believe there could still be a lot of opportunity there, but there will continue to be job uncertainty for quite some time."
good,Repcol India was a great workplace with and amazing work force. There was never a dull moment on the floor and the pay offs were simply mind blowing. There were always some offer running on the floor for a hourly or weekly or monthly spiff. The work atmosphere was amazing too and there was always help at hand. The whole organization had a Town hall meet every Quarter and we didn't just had fun activities but we also shared the performance of the org and the best practices.

good,"EMC is a great place to work.  Advancement seems to be a bit difficult.  The production floor can become a bit rutine, where you go through the same motions everyday.  I work third shift which is the worst thing.  The best part about my job is that we have a nice fitness center in the building.  "
good,* Management is horrible...other wise its a cool place to work
good,It was an experience i was the oldest person in sales in roseburg. i enjoyed talking to people from all over the us. I did not like being times and evaluated on such. The pay and perks were fantastic The harder you worked the more you made..
good,"I have been employed here for over 6 years. This company does have great benefits and treats their employees very well. What is lacking is changing things too often to try to save money, on the product side especially. Work life balance is hard in certain departments, especially sales, but has improved since I started. Management is given an enormous amount of pressure, and it does trickle down."
good,Nice company to work at.
good,Challenging work place; access to leading hardware and software technologies
good,"Started out with 5 weeks of training. It was fast-paced and informative. My biggest regret is leaving before I had the chance to get some good IT certifications paid for. Wasn't there long enough to get a feel for management, but the first-line supervisors were very accommodating and had no problems answering questions."
good,I would update customer data and troubleshoot various issues over the phone. I also was part of a team responsible for keeping all other teams informed of any new policies or changes to current policies.
good,I worked at Dell Australia in the Small to Medium Business sector. I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Dell and would highly recommend them as an employer. I was employed as a Sales Support Administrator and moved into an Inside Sales Representative role within 3 months.
good,"I made my own hours here and really did enjoy working for this company, I left wanting to better my career. I learned most of my customer service here along with most of my medical background.

good,"Constantly learning, Management was always willing to work with you, Co-workers were very helpful and friendly, at the time the hardest part of Systems Test was working in the different enviroments and the most enjoyable part of the job was knowing you were appreciated."
good,profilen van klanten een heel andere kijk op eindklanten.

good,Now a days working environment in Dell is changing and is not employee centric.
good,Dell was a great company to work for minus the job security and advancement opportunties.
good,"It is a fun filled work place. As far as the productivity is concerned, I am getting closures more than expected. hence, in the my leisure time, we study new features yet to be released for the product, configuring lab environment to replicate the issue and jolly out with friends. Management is good and focused. They will be having one-to-one meeting every month with the engineer and speak about his month review. The hardest part of the job is when we are experiencing heavy call volume. We will be on call for almost all the time, sometimes without breaks. But the most fun time will be having some tea breaks with my batch mates and speaking about funny customers."
good,"Not much in the way of creativity allowed, always scripted, and very metrics oriented. Calls too long, not enough of them, bad logging of calls, etc. No kudos for jobs well done, only scrutiny for any variance from the norm."
good,Enjoy the work and opportunities to grow within team.
good,The call times where great and a lot of knowledge that u cant learn from anywhere else was learned with Dell. A typical day in the office was talking to great people on the phones which added a lot to the job. The coworkers and management where excellent still have some friends from Dell. I learned how to navigate and resolve issues quickly and effectively.
good,"There is no micro-management (at least not yet) and I have been treated pretty well so far. I work with a great team of management peers, and I have built a very good team of my own."
good,1. Great place to work
good,Day begins with Team huddle related to Fun activities and process updates ...
good,Decent place to work if you get to work with a great team and management. If you want to learn to be tough then this is the place to be!
good,"Very accommodating place to work. Usually flexible regarding time off. But rather stagnant work. Very little room to move to a different business unit or up the ladder. As a remote office, there really was nowhere to go unless you were willing to travel a lot or work from home. As a business model, this works fine, but working with other people in person is on the way out, as a way to cut facilities costs."
good,"It is a good place to work if you are in good team & having good salary, else not. I joined in EMC which was The BEST but later on it got merged with DELL, so my happy review would be more for EMC as my experience with DELL after EMC isn;t so likely as there's a drastic change after collaboration."
good,Dell Services was a great company to work for Once purchased by NTT data the state side support was diminished greatly. I was out sourced to off shores support
good,"Good work life balance"
good,Overall is a good place to work. Flexible hours and remote opportunites are there. My Direct Manager is sincere and helpful. They are working slowly in terms of improving the management of their own employees. HR is non existent at times.
good,"One of the best company to work , Balanced Work life ,"
good,I have worked at Dell EMC for two years but I was under contract with EMC before they were bought out by dell. I have enjoyed my time with them and I have really enjoyed the team. I made a few friends there. Unfortunately a majority of my position is becoming Automated and Dell decided to outsource my position along with 2 of my teammates. It is a fast paced atmosphere with many e-mails.
good,"Overall good experience"
good,Great work culture. Good environment. Good innovation culture. Everything is process oriented. For IIT graduates it can be a good start. Patents can be filed under guidance of technologists.
good,"Actually i worked in dell bpo, it most enjoyable part of the job, management is good, workplace is good, recommed for freshers not for experience people"
good,"To make it at Dell, you must be:"
good,"Working at dell gave me the opportunity to gain experience working for a fortune 500 company, by providing training and working knowledge of all aspects of area, position and the job."
good,"With reach to our other families like VMware, Pivotal ,RSA..etc.A wide range to learn and explore with flexible working environment. Could be overwhelming given all the cross collaboration across these solutions. Nevertheless, a good problem"
good,"Good The following errors occurred"
good,"I was always learning on the job and pushing myself to my full potential to do better everyday. With the dynamic work environment, you are always on your toes to excel in your KRAs."
good,"Dell caters to those early in their careers more than any other group, which is good to know so that you can make the best decision for yourself.  Very good benefits and comp for an early career job, and even potential for really good money if you are in sales and happen to luck into the right territory.  Yes, luck is as important as your efforts.  Both are usually required to make the good money."
good,"Good pay,  large bonuses, excellent benefits. Company is very involved with helping the community, and encourage all employees to do so as well. Paid for me to move for the job."
good,"This was actually my 2nd time working at Dell. The first time was when it was a call center. The 2nd time around I started off as a contractor in software sales. I didn’t like the process of getting hired on permanent. You basically had to work for up to a year on contract doing the hardwork for a sales rep and they get the credit and commission. Then after meeting all of your metrics, you have to interview with all the managers in that department even if they didn’t work with you directly. So basically if one of them didn’t care for you, you wouldn’t be hired. Long story short I ended up getting hired in a different department. That department offered little training related to my department. Basically I was never training for the job and had no clue what I was doing and I didn’t have anyone on site to help me so I ended up quitting."
good,"You receive benefits and PTO from day one which was cool. The training seemed rushed as there was a lot of material to cover. I worked in the imaging department and things could definitely become hectic at times, but overall it was a great experience."
good,"It is a large company that has plus and minus. It could be very inflexible at times. In general, it is a good place to work with good people around.  Flexible in terms of working from home."
good,Good place to learn and provides stability.  Upward mobility is limited. The same leaders get advancement opportunities and have been in place for 10+ years. Company politics paralyze initiatives.
good,"Buena flexibilidad laboral, buen ambiente de trabajo. Muy difícil surgir y crecer, dada la burocracia de tener funciones de RRHH centralizadas fuera del país y al ser una empresa con foco regional."
good,"Dell's company culture is one of the best that I have ever seen or been involved it. You have a task and several different ways that you can complete it. I also like the flexibility that is allowed. There are a lot of pros here, but the cons are huge work life balance is rare and that won't work for a lot of people. Also the goals aren't attainable for everyone, but you can learn so much, it's worth it."
good,"I enjoyed the atmosphere, training, and the compensation. Life/work balance was emphasized and we were encouraged to take breaks. Training was ongoing and extensive."
good,I worked at Dell for 19 years and the people are what kept me there.  They became family.  I was able to work from home a couple of days of the week which was nice.
good,"I worked at Dell only briefly as a temporary employee over twelve years ago as a material handler. The job was fine, I was trained appropriately and was treated fairly by supervisors."
good,"Big organization, fun culture but working hours are not consistent."
good,"Was sorry to see the contract go overseas.The work environment was great. The people I worked with was like family, we had fun at work. The training provided was outstanding."
good,The fast paced production line was interesting and fun to learn about which was different from Aircraft maintenance. I left the job to relocate to California.
good,"Days were fairly routine"
good,"I joined Dell during the acquisition of Perot Systems so my review is not ideal.  There was much confusion and internal power struggle between certain divisions of the company.  Growing pains, essentially.  Politics were thick and things were edgy, to say the least."
good,Dell is a good company to work for in the local area. I enjoyed working for a $1B business unit within Dell.  You can learn and take on as much as you are able to sustain.  Drinking from the firehose is often an expression heard there.  It was an incredible learning opportunity. Career advancement was not a strong suit for the company.
good,"Dell prides itself in operating above reproach in ethics.  I have never felt it was a closed door company.  Your experience is predicated by your manager and the executive that runs your department.  The culture of legacy Dell vs legacy EMC are 180% different.  If you do not want to be at risk for layoffs, take a role where you are tied to revenue and margin # or move roles every 2 years.  They flexibility to work from home is great."
good,"Technology Corporation always advancing technologies."
good,"Dell is a productive work environment and very bust always about what is next.  Dell will consider just about anything and even try an idea to see if it works, if it doesn't wont hesitate to move in another direction."
good,"Just can talk about Dell EMC as it became the part of DELL ."
good,"Didn't give any bonus dor incentives for the performance."
good,Desktop support at a hospital.  Mostly nice people but a bit stressful.  Good boss and coworkers.  Got good performance reviews but few raises.  Seems like there is a trend of reduced benefits for the average employee.
good,I recommend this company/position for individuals who are enthusiastic and with great communication skills. Daily tasks included inbound and outbound calls/emails with clients and consistent collaboration in a team environment.
good,ability to work from home as needed. advancement opportunity but layoffs a lot. relocating and travelling for your career. great benefits and fantastic pay and benefits. Very flexible hours
good,It was a good experience and i'm sure things are done much differently now than they used to be and pay is different. Dell is a good company to work for .
good,Dell is a great place to start your career.  Dell provides has many different areas to gain experiences and opportunities to learn in different areas from the business to HR.
good,"A typical includes a full 9 hours of work and an opportunity to socialize with various departments with we generally don't get to work."
good,"Pros: Competitive Salary. Great work life balance. Great place to work with wonderful Colleagues."
good,"Good company to work with , it takes care of you at work , able to balance professional & personal life. Management is transparent & cooperative with the staff. Hygiene & quality is on the top when it comes to food."
good,"The management was often unable to implement processes or new policies, or really anything without making the transition rough for everyone that these changes affected. I believe that, for the most part, the management is trying to do the right thing by the Dell employees, but it can be very complicated to get everything right when there are so many moving parts in an organization - especially one that acquired a company (EMC) worth more than 2x what Dell itself is worth, and is tasked with the responsibility to integrate the two companies' teams, management, back-end processes, databases, CRM software, etc. "
good,I worked around some of the industry's greatest people while working at Dell Nashville. that said the pay was not remotely on par with the industry in the Nashville area. we had great benefits and i've never worked in a place that had so many meetings. Team building was a wonderful thing here. department and team managers were all awesome to work with. Disappointed that the entire Core support and eventually XPS teams were just abandoned by Dell and laid off but while there the people made the job worth coming to every day. Many of my co-workers and managers are still friends to this day.
good,"Dell was a fun/challenging place to work with flexible work, hours, environment and remote work opportunities.  Lower group management was good, higher up management seemed out of touch."
good,"Have my internship in EMC for 6 months. Very good teammates and participated in the poster session every month, I obtain a good opportunity to strengthen my interpersonal skills."
good,Able to learn more platforms working with break fix servers. A good place for someone looking to start a career in IT. Highly competitive work environment. Nice people to work with. Good work/life balance.
good,"Empresa con cultura de inclusión, desafiadora e divertida."
good,"Great place to work, lot of focus on people , career path, employee satisfaction. Good place to learn lot of new and latest technologies. Lot of transformation from Waterfall to Agile and from Agile to PCF. Extreme programming. Focus on Test Quality metrics and Automation. Really enjoy working and taking challenges."
good,Started my career with this company. Good opportunity for new joiners however witnessed layoffs of employees during bad times. There have change of management multiple times so not sure of current state of affairs.
good,"The Dell people are great to work with. The project lead spend time getting we new contractors up to speed with the code base, and helped us in other ways. The bad is the group in Dell only had funding for just one quarter (3 months), so we started getting good just in time to leave! This was not our fault of the manager's: just Dell corporate policy. They have a great, varied cafeteria on campus, and an on-site branch of my bank!"
good,The people here were very nice and although I was layed off I was given plenty of warning. This was really a nice company with plenty of perks and PTO days. I really enjoyed this place.
good,"A typical day at work would be answering phone calls and troubleshooting computer problems between hardware and software, I have learned a lot from office ethics and troubleshooting."
good,"I worked at Dell for a dozen years as a phone technician.  I had to leave for family reasons.  I could not go back if I wanted to, as my entire job function has been outsourced to India.  Used to be a good place to work, but between outsourcing and ""enhancing shareholder value"", meaning the rich guys keeping all the money and not sharing with the workers, I do not think Dell would be a good place to go back to, and I could not recommend it to anyone.  The danger that one's job will be outsourced is too great."
good,Overall good company to work for.  Positions can become stagnant with not much opportunity to advance or move potions. Have been able to travel a bit and meet new people.
good,"this is a great company to work for. "
good,The people are great. Management can vary from great to poor depending on what team you are on. The workplace culture is pretty good too. The work is very interesting. The only problem is workplace stability and morale.
good,"DELL/EMC  has a very workmanlike culture with very little drama.  People just come in and get things done."
good,warehouse job putting computers and laptops in boxes fast paced working well paying job would reccomend it for those seeking warehouse work good supervisors
good,Dell was a fast paced work place and provided room for advancement.in all areas of the plant.Management looked for employees ready and willing to move ahead.
good,"EMC being a store technology dominant, offered various certification courses in it's field which helps it's employees gain knowledge while working. The other good thing was the work atmosphere and the location of the office. It was a quiet but dynamic environment where even a lazy bug can emerge out productive !"
good,This job can be enjoyable if you find yourself in the right division. Make sure you can network if you want to move around within the company. It's not what you know but rather who you know.
good,"Good to work, Culture wise its very good company, Learned lot in Dell Teradata, Terdata Macros. SSIS, OWB. its very good company work in my career. I love to work in Dell"
good,"2016"
good,Dell EMC is focused on ensuring that sales managers exceed objectives and track results on a weekly basis.  Constant inspection is expected but a manager can develop his/her team as they feel necessary in order to exceed their goals
good,Interesting work and great colleagues to work with. People care about customers and work hard to meet their expectations. Opportunities are available to learn and develop new products and technologies.
good,"Clock in, greet coworkers, pre work meeting and stretches."
good,Great co-workers and a fun environment! Metrics driven. Raises and advancement take a couple years when starting in Sales. Ambiguity the norm around Dell.
good,"It seemed fast paced in all departments. Lots of collaboration. Always someone around to talk ideas, solve problems. Great coffee bar, gym on site, walking/workout trail around pond on the grounds."
good,"I enjoyed my job and the people that I worked with on a daily basis.  I met and worked with lots of people who became friends and I am still in touch with them."
good,I was a logistics coordinator as well as being a trainer for at that time EMC Corp. This job required traveling. This was by far my favorite job of my working career. My classes were approximately 10 to 20 people per class. I am very passionate about training it allows me to utilize and share my experiences with others. Management with EMC was always open to any ideas and suggestions and allowed and trusted their employees to carry out their day to day responsibilities.
good,"Enjoyed the work and team.  All the managers were great.  Beware if you don't work in Round Rock, TX your career growth is VERY limited.  You'll see almost every US mgmt role wants you in TX."
good,I enjoyed working with salespeople and helping them improve.  I loved the experience of moving to Oregon for 3 months to open a call center and train employees.  The only reason I left was to pursue a lifelong dream of opening a business with a friend.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job. "
good,Enjoyed my co-workers and the fast paced environment.  Some seasons were busier than others leading to long work hours that sometimes became stressful but overall a good balance.  After having children it was hard to find a good work/home balance.
good,"A place where I grew my experience and learned from a world class organization!"
good,Work 8 hours a day.  Received federal holidays off.  Management could use some improvement.  Overall a relaxed environment.  Could use some more support from management to complete tasks.
good,"Workload is much more than anticipated which leaves no time for proper training and proper designs before implementations.  The pace at which we do implementations are too fast and cause more do overs."
good,"Depending on the department I was in at the time, my typical day included inbound & outbound calls with customers.  I also reported quota attainment, sales forecasts & call information.  I would also attend sales meetings with managers, team & directors."
good,"Great place to work! Fantastic team members and culture is very fun."
good,"I loved working there and hated leaving.  If you enjoy getting on a plane every Monday and returning on Friday DELL/EMC might be for you."
good,Nice place but rapidly changing culture with the Dell take over.  Very little opportunity for advancement under the current management structure.  Downward salary pressure
good,"Like most technology companies adjusting to being past their prime a bit, Dell tries and buys a lot of things to be relevant. They provide a good product, but they're in a tough industry. Being an employee is good, but I did question the management's strategies at times, and often you have to navigate the ant-hills of competitive directors to try and get things done."
good,A typical day at work is fun with responsibilities. A good platform to learn management skills and sales skills. Technical knowledge grows with the experience and the perks benefited from the team is interesting.
good,"Dell has many departments and you cannot make one statement for all of Dell.  Each department or group at Dell is different.  Some have a better work culture than others."
good,"Competetive salary, great people, flexible workschedule.  Interesting work, advancement opportunities.  Great location. Diverse environment , supportive"
good,"I am not sure that my experience with Dell is typical but I found the management to be dismissive, demanding without providing clear direction.  It just seemed to me that the culture of this organization was diffuse and not well defined for the average worker.  I make this comparison based upon other companies where I worked so it may not be fair - I may be comparing apples to oranges."
good,I love the job and the management. The only complaint is that we should have gotten paid a little more an hour. The advancement or career development options are limited in the Services sections. This area of Dell's business was recently aquired by NTT Data which further's lack of knowledge on career progression and potential raises.
good,"- Have a good fun at work "
good,"Good place to work overall"
good,"quando não havia produção"
good,i was on a temp assignment with Guide IT. Assignment was fun and learned new things. Pay was very good through the agency. Assignment ended after 5 months.
good,"The work has been good, although it's a difficult environment since the Dell acquisition of EMC.  It is certainly a place you can find a home if its the right fit for you."
good,"I was able to learn a lot of things and deliver lot of things."
good,"I was able to work from home after training most days.  My management team was very focused on monitoring all time while working, this was exhausting to me.  Vacation perks and personal time were nice.  The culture was a bit stressful, work yourself to death & be happy you have a job.  Audits were punitive measures, rather than learning experiences."
good,"As a participant, making my presence at DELL EMC technical event and talking to the dignitaries and my fellow participants were a remarkable candidates."
good,"I have worked as a process analyst. In the Emc 2, "
good,"-Great Work Culture , you are in charge of what you are doing and feel appreciated"
good,"A typical day at work for consisted of bringing materials to the lines to be made, packaged, and shipped off. The most enjoyable part of my job were the relationships I made with co workers."
good,"over all culture at dell is good."
good,Great place to work if you don't ever need to grow financially.  They at one point gave bonuses.  That ended also.  Hard work didn't pay off financially.  But great people to work with.
good,As being a remote employee I had the daily task of working with customers via emails and telephone calls. It was then that I was to determine what it was that needed attention. At times I would need to visit the customer to work on equipment or deliver parts as needed. I worked together with other team members and together we resolved many customer issues. The hardest part of the job at times was to be able to get parts in a timely fashion and resolve the issue with the customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was having the opportunity to meet and get to know such a wide variety of  people and companies.
good,I got a chance to work with some of the best and highly professional managers . The whole working environment was good and an easy access to gym was a keen benefit
good,"Great People."
good,"Good Place to begin your career , this place gives you a picture of challenges ahead in life and prepares you for the same. Was good experience to begin with"
good,"Exciting time at DellEMC due to the acquisition. Growing pains are inevitable though."
good,"This is a fairly typical call center escalations tech support position, Most days are fairly routine, but there are days where you face extremely difficult issues. It can be a very rewarding career, if you are okay with only ever fixing problems."
good,"Good Place to Work"
good,Have to adhere to roster and complete log in log hours. Have to achieve daily targets of calls and metrics. Support people are available always. Assistance is always handy and is roles are distributed across different teams.
good,"It is very productive and funwork place,flexible timings,cab facility is good, no long hours,very good team work, encouraging every employee, rating individual performance of the candidates."
good,"pull orders and scan product "
good,"The day is well spent in organisation.Tasks assigned needs to be completed timely which is done easily."
good,I worked at Dell EMC. I had the experience of learning many new technologies and industries. That was the great side of my experience. The company sometimes did not really stick to a strategy long enough and tended to look for the next exciting thing.
good,Lo que aprendi fue a conocer mejor las parte de una computadora y como mantenerlas en buen estado.
good,"I was in Services my entire time and it was not ideal.  Product side was a better culture.  I would work there again."
good,Good job for entry into the work place.  Learned a lot and made great contacts.  Insurance could be better.  Good vacation and PBA.  Flexible work schedules.  Work from Home.
good,"Strong collaboration working culture across different departments."
good,"Dell EMC is no 1 Technology Company in India."
good,"Since the software division at Dell got acquired, we faced many administrative decision changes. Apart from that, there was a good work-life balance, mentors who'd help you out anytime you got stuck and an excellent and supportive manager. The working environment was too good."
good,EMC is an excellent company to work for. I was treated and coached very well. I enjoyed every single day spent at EMC. I learned a lot about IT and customer service.
good,DELL/EMC was a very positive place to work at. Everyone were very nice to get along with. Great place to work at. I have learned a lot working at that location.
good,"Culture encourages professional development, online training and certification programs. Also, great storage solutions."
good,"Mucho trabajo diario, cotizaciones, seguimiento, llamar a las  áreas correspondientes (crédito, logística, partes, etc), era muy interesante compartir los conocimientos adquiridos con mis compañeros,  siempre con buena actitud y siempre encontrando las respuestas que los clientes necesitaban, conferencias cotidianas con los responsables de las cuentas globales, ya fuera en español o ingles, presentar propuestas integrales a clientes de mayor consumo."
good,"Every day is a new day here, different situation and issues to be resolved and you learn a lot, especially things related to computers and technology and also sales techniques."
good,Opportunity for stock options open to most employees regardless of position.  Large corporate offices allowed opportunity for changes.  Training opportunities abundant.
good,"*The best place to learn as well as enjoy while working.Learning and training is awesome. Nice environment with amazingly helpful  co-workers."
good,"A progressive and innovative company, constantly in flux. If you do not like change, you will not like Dell. If you thrive on challenges and can self-promote, you will have a rewarding experience."
good,Good place to get acquainted to a enterprise level work environment. Lot of people to offer advice and personal experience. Exceptional management to explain policies and procedures.
good,The work environment itself brings out the best in the employees & working in this highly competitive environment feeds into the progress of individual employees.
good,"A typical work day for a Field Engineer is very taxing on the body, but there is always a new task, which is great. Management varies by who is over you. My manager was great, but there are some managers who micro-manage and can make work less fun. The hardest part of a Field Engineer is the traffic and always feeling like you're at work even when you are off."
good,Was a great honor to have gotten a chance to work with a great team and appreciate all the training and knowledge obtained. Everyday was a new challenge that I enjoyed learning how to solve them.
good,"Typical day at work involved about 30-40% development activities e.g. design, testing, analysis, 40% improvement activities and 20% group discussions/meetings"
good,"Good local mgmt teams generally.  Employees also very good people to work with.  Upper management on the other hand too focused on hitting targets or ""averages"" and not interested in what average actually means and how it should inform business decisions."
good,Great Technology to work& the learning are great with respect to projects & people. Exposure to new technology which makes you know the current market trend.
good,Good life job balance with decent compensation.  A fun place to work but there is end of quarter pressure.  Co-workers are really nice good fun people.
good,"A typical day entails opening all required systems necessary to adjudicate medical claims for BC/BS NC and DST Health Solutions."
good,"Worked with one of their contracted support clients, they invested a fair amount of time in training, ongoing coaching to ensure your success."
good,"Encourage work remote and change job."
good,"Dell is a challenging, but rewarding workplace.  Dell is a large organization, it is important to network and get to know your coworkers and understand their respective regional roles and responsibilities."
good,"Complete end to end development Documentum D2 REST services for D2 solution . "
good,"Job Work/Life Balance good "
good,"Good Working Environment, Good Learning Place, Cab Facilities for Night Shift, Night Shift Allowance, Job Security, Good Job Culture, Weekend Allowance, Salary Experience, Weekend off."
good,People are the key to any successful business...Dell EMC is no exception.  Work life balance is sometimes hard to achieve due to scheduled night meetings with Asia.
good,"Great Place to work....must be able to handle constant re-orgs and layoff."
good,"The MISO service desk at the CDC was fulfilling helping people with solutions to their software technical issues.  Contributed to the development, enhancement, and improvement of administration and operations of the organizations internal/external systems, operating policies, planning, internal controls, and assessments of reporting requirements to promote process and business delivery improvements."
good,Overall EMC had a pretty decent work life balance and pay structure compared to other tech companies that I worked for in the past. Being bought by Dell with obviously change things quite a bit so it will be interesting to see what happens to the various divisions that made up EMC. Their East Coast culture was at times at odds with the west coast divisions as they were a little more old school.
good,advancement is limited off the phones. lots of politics and only advancement opportunities require certifications - does not matter what you know only if you have the paper certifications.
good,"Dell's management clearly values it's employees work life balance."
good,"Work life balance is good.  "
good,I worked at Dell for a long time and they provided me a career with an opportunity to provide for my family and grow both as a professional and a person.
good,"The company is very good but the managment is okay nice working with co employees,company is very good and working late hours is problem,remaining every thing is fine."
good,"Dell is a great place to work, but is tough in that the quota's that are set can be very unrealistic when bonuses are reduced or taken away."
good,"Great company, great perks.Self-management promoted. Reactive rather than proactive environment makes the day fly by. Company's future uncertain with looming Dell acquisition."
good,"Generous big-company benefits. A nice professional environment. But very insecure these days, as they are exporting a lot of jobs."
good,"Work culture, Industry best practices, industry leader, work from home option, learning new skills, alumni connect is a plus point"
good,EMC had a great culture but over the last few years is has become siloed into separate business units with their own agendas.
good,Its an excellent company to work for. Dell stands behind it brand in delivering a quality product and solutions. The company is growing at a very fast pace which at times can cause rapid change in the org structure and dynamics
good,"Data Entry, Medical billing, etc. I work with all the doctor and other physicians of information giving back and for information."
good,"Good people to work with, actively encouraged to better yourself and support provided for advancing your career."
good,"it was great working at magna, obtained good knowledge in the domain of CAE and learned many good tools, Co-workers were very fun loving."
good,"Internally Dell makes a very big deal about work/life balance. Unfortunately, the reality is that it is fictional reading. Dell does a lot of things very well, but creating a relaxed culture is not one of them. Dell can be classified as a culture of ""workaholics"" because we are driven to perform at a very high level to ensure goals and and performance relate to high output. "
good,Answering calls through a call center environment. The management was very helpful with tips and pointers. They have been there too. You really need to be self motivated to be successful in this environment.
good,Dell is an US based organization and i have worked in Dell short duration. And managment are restricting to provide good package to Employees.
good,i learnt more about computers and other peripherals good training team but management has to be improvised along with providing good facilitires and team memebers for the job
good,has flaws with the management. Requires modern day thinking. Has to be clear in appraisal and rating system. Has great training programs.
good,"Our work is mostly related to High Priority incidents which is the edging area of Service desk jobs currently. So constantly facing challenges encourages me to explore my potential harder."
good,"There is so much more to be involved with at EMC which allows both the sales and marketing people to understand the needs of the security department."
good,They pay well and are flexible with working remote. Unfortunately the company is in the middle of a major restructuring as its core products are starting to fade and the company is being bought by Dell.
good,"My job is very flexible. Staff are team players and Tech Leads are awesome to work for. Advancement is tough, but can happen."
good,Dell is a great place to start your career. There are many opportunities depending on what you are interested in and what you are skilled in.
good,"The company was a fun and productive place to work. I felt like it was a very stable job where I could continue to work up the ladder. The main problem was the management style towards the end of my time there. Since the Dell buyout was announced, many people have been laid off and others started to become complacent. Management did not care about what was going on with the projects anymore so it became a place where it was no longer productive."
good,Dell was once an exciting place to work but over the years has changed so much that it seems like a different company. Still great in many ways however not a good fit for me any more.
good,"never listen new joiners plans and ideas they decide what they do , never give opertunity, for job they do bad works that affects client . and they money ."
good,"I loved this job. it was nice to get to work one on one with customers. The only set back was that they withdrew from the community of Twin Falls, Idaho and many lost their jobs."
good,"Depending upon your job profile you will have the ability to expand your knowledge of the IT world working at Dell."
good,"Slow to adapt in sector that changes rapidly."
good,"1. Good exposure to technical knowledge , giving attention to micro details and good trouble shooting skills"
good,A typical day would be any time of day as it was shift job which means every month i would have a different time for work and different weekends. I had to deal with home users and issue with their computers. learnt a lot about computer Hardware but since i was dealing with a non corporate person i learnt the virtue of patience and how to deal with people without losing my cool. The management kept changing and hence it would be difficult for me to comment. So did the teams that i worked with but they mostly were amazing to work with and learnt a lot from them. The hardest part of the job is when you are faced with an issue you know you cannot solve or sometimes can be penalized for even attempting and have to convey this to the customer. It was enjoyable when i could deliver a quick solution to the customer for problems that seem complex also enjoyable were the team bonding sessions.
good,The job involved placing outbound calls to onshore facilities and inquire on insurance claims of the client. The role enhance my communication skills and helped in realizing my tacit knowledge. The company was functioning on the grounds of a usual corporate structure.
good,"Friendly environment, learned a lot from each department. My fellow coworkers made it even more at home with there desire to work hard."
good,The day starts with greeting all the team members.A typical day at Dell includes direct contact with customers.A Dell customer's problem is handled with great attention.The speed of resolution to a customer's problem is fast and effective.I learnt to work in a team and develop competencies required to build a great company.The management at Dell is the best.They take care of their employees very well.My Co-Workers are very supportive and share knowledge.I love my job at Dell.The most enjoyable part of my job at dell was customer resolution.
good,Dell is an excellent place to work with good environment. Coworkers and employees are some of the best of the bunch. Dell provides an excellent continuing training program to help sharpen and maintain skills for your position. Great variety of service calls coming into the call center ranging from simple hardware issues to complicated RAID or No POST issues.
good,"It is an interesting place to work. "
good,"One must be willing to be self sufficient but also able to network within a diverse segment of people. You must be able to join different organizations and put your name in front of opportunities to excel. Customers are the number one priority. If you take care of the customers than Dell will take care of you. In sales the sky is the limit, it is where you seek to reach that will determine your advance."
good,"supportive  management ."
good,"Great company for those who are good at what they do. As long as you put in 200% when it is busy, you are not even expected to show up when it is slow."
good,It can be a good place to work if you have a high position. Some company politics but that's to be expected at such a large company. Pay is decent but nothing amazing. You have to try hard to stand out  and not just be another employee. Job security is on the lower end.
good,"Dell is all about the numbers where I worked, unfortunately this can at time be counterproductive as learning and personal growth is stifled.  Co workers for most part are supportive and want you to be there.  Unfortunately there is some favoritism at DELL and good management usually doesn't allow for this sort of thing."
good,"Any customer facing role at Dell offers a broad variety of challenges that requires constant learning and daily research. Ambiguity is encountered routinely. Leadership selection is reliable, and I have had the fortune of working for strong leaders. The work culture is positive and productive. The most difficult part of the job is determining a resolution path for emerging issues on new products. The most enjoyable part of the job is achieving a quick solution using the resources I have on hand."
good,"Overall good workplace with fun and attractions around (ping pong table, Xbox, sport and social activities, cafeteria vouchers, transportation to work .. etc). Also, there is a possibility to switch to other relevant departments and try new adventures. However, centers of excellence are mainly for cost-reduction so don't expect a lot in terms of career development, salary, and other benefits."
good,"Great place to work,fun flexible company. I enjoyed not having a micro manager and working remotely. The team that I worked with became my family and we helped one another with task if needed."

I'm answering incoming calls all day and logging tickets for engineers, responding to emails, and assist with incoming customer chats via Live Help Now. Co-workers are all hard workers and close since most have been there up to 10+ years. The most enjoyable part of the job is that everyday we start fresh. No paperwork or deadlines. I work with a group of 5 people answering calls so we have to coordinate when we can take breaks/lunches/restroom breaks."
good,"This was a fast paced environment which required constant updating for every time the class was taught."

good,"Worked the trenches between the operations group and the sales reps. Responsibilities included accurate and timely input of orders to make sure sales reps were properly compensated and revenue was recognized. We had sales reps with million dollar orders and sales reps with thousand dollar orders. At crunch time - the operation folks wanted to process the large orders until the sales quota was achieved and ""push off"" the smaller orders until the next accounting period. I had to walk the fence to make sure all orders regardless of size were reported in the correct accounting period."
good,"dell is good to work India. Good culture and learning opportunity."

good,"Job Work/Life balance"
good,Got the chance to help a lot of people deal with their daily technology issues.
good,"Dell fue en algun tiempo una buena empresa con buenas prestaciones y facil crecimiento. En los ultimos meses, con la nueva estrategia de trabajo, la empresa a corrido a mucha gente y cargandoles el trabajo extra al personal existente. Esto puede ser bueno para Dell como empresa, pero esta desgastando bastante a los trabajadores actuales, quienes temen que si no cooperan, seran los proximos en ser corridos."
good,"A typical day for me involves taking calls for various issues from locked Active Directory accounts to Creating Email accounts to Network Troubleshooting."
good,I work security so it it not the worst place to work. The facilities are kept clean and the staff are generally liked.
good,"In my experience Dell is very hetogeneous.  Depending on which team you're on you'll have an amazing experience with lots of novel opportunities or you might end up in a cell-like office with no windows and so much work that you can never leave your desk to talk to your coworkers.  It's not surprising that some people rate Dell 1 star, some 5 stars.  I think both are correct."
good,"I call it a well oiled machine coz of all the processes in place, however a flip side to it being it did not challenge you to bring out your creativity."
good,Dell was a great place to work but the work life balance became an issues as the campus was shutting down.
good,I was a contractor at EMC for about 4 years.  There were a lot of good people at this company and management is very agile constantly looking to the future.  Company stays on top of new trends and technology.
good,"Work lots of hours but work from home 3 days a week so little time commuting, which is a plus.  Work with a wonderful team and have gained considerable knowledge during my tenure at Dell.  Since going private though, lots of re-orgs and the management changes make for an unsteady and unhealthy work environment."

good,"Pros – "
good,"I worked in the ITES sector, supporting clients from USA. So basically there is rotational shifts. A lot of learning from the team members, team leaders, team managers and management."
good,"The great thing about Dell is it has good people that it compensates well to work hard and has the money to do projects the right way.  However, in the current transition there will be winners and losers, and it is difficult to know how to stay ahead of the ever-changing decisions and keep yourself positioned to keep growing.  I have a great team and the people are definitely the reason I keep working here."

good,"Busy bright people to interact with, interesting work-- there is always lots of work!"
good,"There were no typical days at work.  The constant was change.  I learned how to extend my efforts and succeed beyond what I had thought possible.  Management was driven, talented, inspiring and in the end in denial of market shifts. "

I learned how to prospect potential clients, and go through the sales cycle from beginning to end.  I had great coworkers (for the most part). We sat on tables of 6 people, completely open environment.  I had a great relationship with my managers which I value in any business setting.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with it being so repetitive.  We cold call a lot and work from 8-5:30pm every single day. The minimum expectation is to call 140 people a day, which is incredibly hard to do. Most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of closing a deal.  You put in a lot of work to close deals, and once they close, it is very gratifying. "

good,"EMC is a great place to work for for the initial job you hire on at. There is limited advancement and raises as the implied meaning of the company is to hire outsiders. They do not endorse internal promotions and raises compared to other companies I have read about. An average raise when being ""promoted"" is around 10-15% regardless of the pay scale of the new job."

good,To enjoy the Dell culture you must embrace change at every turn. The salaries more than compensate for this continuous change.
good,I currently work for Dell and have been there for 12 years. Depending on the area that you work in and the manager you work with can make this a good or bad place to work. Most of the jobs that I have had at Dell was a great experience. You have to work hard but can be very enjoyable as well.

good,They pay for performance as far as wage goes. Bonuses are handed out to Managers pets first.
good,Extending Technical support assistance to the customers is quite an interesting part of the job.
good,I worked between 8 to 12 hours a day at times. I was always available to help with any request given to me. When we worked long hours they would provide us with lunch. I transfered with Dell from Idaho to Texas. Its been a long road one that had brought many changes and adaptability. The hardest part of my job was transfering from Idaho to Texas meeting new people adjusting to new bosses. Transferring locations brought on a lot of challenges trying to fit in among new people. The most enjoyable part of my job was the challenges brought on with my job customers sales reps and complicated orders.

good,"Learned a great deal in the Support Center, mainframe systems, problem solving, customer service trainings. Management was great!"
good,"A typical day a Dell includes sifting through hundreds of e-mails, extreme multitasking, constant meetings for training or metric analysis. I found the upper management to be detached from the actual day to day operations and only see the bigger picture without understanding the dynamic of realistic execution. I loved my co-workers as most people that work at Dell are innovative and very driven. There are very few people that slip through the cracks and not carry their weight as there is a lot expected from each employee."
good,"Dell has a lot of great benefits for their employees, also the environment and people you work with are a pleasure as well."

Great team, good friends, a lot of good work and social experiences there."

good,"The pay for a TSE II per Dell is under market value by around $10,000 a year. This has caused good talent to leave Dell for competition's higher pay. "
good,"Dell does a wonderful job on work culture and diversification.  The work is challenging, and there is a great deal of collaboration.  Most team members want to work together to be successful.  Similar to other large corporations, career advancement and promotion is not always based on your level of success and accomplishments.  Compensation is average, but don't expect significant annual increases.  Overall, Dell is a world class organization with strong leadership at the top.  You will definitely be pushed, but you will also learn a lot."
good,The only reason I am not working at dell now is because of business reason and my area in manufacturing was laid off and there were no other positions available.
good,"Key learning is that one must create an internal network that includes people in as many functions and business units as possible. This internal network will be invaluable to get things done for customers. In my job, knowing people in Customer Service, Customer Support, Professional Services, Consulting, Sales Operations, Legal and Finance made my life simpler. The company is huge and every work group may have different success metrics than that of the group you work for. Understanding this and compromising when needed will go a long way to create a collaborative environment. "

good,"Good opportunity to grow  and develop.  Oppurtunity to train as much as you want with a plethora of courses and work with leading edge technology."
good,"You have “war stories” after a gig like this.  Life on the road, customers standing behind you loosing millions of dollars an hour while your equipment is down; Tight change windows, all different personalities to work with, and a ton of new advancements in many product lines every year.  I made a ton of overtime money as a young buck.  Tech favors the young, I burnt out after six indescribable years.  I heard old veterans say this and did not understand, but it was one of the greatest experiences of my life, and I’d never go through it again."

When I left Dell, they were still #1, since that departure they have steadily dropped in quality.   I was layedoff from Dell for the 'needs of the business'.   I think its a great company, but as you acquire tenure in the company you become a target for layoff.   That is not fair to the employee.   Other than that, I loved the place!    Its a very laid back environment, you constantly are updated on newest technological advancements, and procedures.   Majority of the managment is good."
good,"Dell/EMC was a great place to work and continue my career in Project/Program Management in Logistics and Supply Chain."

good,Nice working environment with comfortable desks and seats. Relaxing room with cafeteria & free meals. I was provided with a Business credit card for business trips with a high amount of expenses allowance.
good,Dell is a company that allows its employees and schedule that supports a life balance. It is also committed to support minorities and environmental causes
good,"Don't expect much of hikes but work life balance will be there. Don't expect any onsites. Working culture and management is good. Employ benefits are good,"
good,"Dell was a great place to work and the people there were very nice, the only complaint that i had was that the management promised advancements to the contractors and it never happened.  We were contractors there for over a year and a half and with no benefits, no holiday pay, no paid time off.  Being a contractor that long with a family was not going to cut it."
good,"Dell is in transition period after major acquisition. Roles and responsibilities have settled, but overall work direction is less focused. Cultural blend of Dell and EMC is still WIP."
good,"Focus is on relationship building rather than quality."
good,Overall a good place to work with many opportunities to control your own career. The people are great and always willing to help out.There are times where the tools and processes seem outdated and difficult to navigate through.
good,"Great culture and work-life balance. The management team has a clear, visible strategy and works hard to communicate it to the rest of the company. The company provides a challenging environment but also provides the tools to succeed."
good,"Excellent work life balance, comprehensive benefits, generous 401k match,  but there is limited upside -- no stock options. Re org after the acquisition is challenging."
good,"-Alot of meetings, alot of goals, alot of business"
good,"Work Culture and Management style depends on department and how you are treated depends onnposition, number crunching, goal counting, fast pace enviroment"
good,Dell was a nice place to work. However they did have an issue including remote employees in decisions.  We didn't always feel like a part of the team.
good,"Working with metal in fabrication "
good,"In the five years I worked there I found it productive and fun yet challenging. However, after the merger with EMC, there were many management changes and many changes to upper management that changed the direction of the division I was in and caused many problems."
good,Nice new place to work.   Dell built the building originally and was first tenant.   Staff were helpful and experienced.   Managers were there for support and assistance when required.   Got to work with and play on new Dell computers that were being released to the consumer.   Testing new products.
good,"One of the best friendly companies I have heard and seen . Having more than 3 thousand employees, situated in heart of the city with good environment."
good,"Good work-life balance, good place to work for women, good work culture. Good initial package and designation but not much increment thereafter. Lots of annual leaves and work from home is allowed."
good,"Plenty of opportunities to volunteer for community activities. Many opportunities to work from home. Dell has a great culture of networking, you are able to reach out to anyone and set up time to chat. Dell is all about results, so they are flexible when it comes to working from home and work/life balance."
good,I really enjoyed working at EMC. I loved the different languages spoken at the call center. The people were very nice and smart. I would definitely work again here if I could.
good,"Dell EMC is a great place to work with lots of opportunities for career advancement. Work/life balance allows a flexible workday. Given the opportunity, I would work at Dell EMC again."
good,Dell/EMC (especially Isilon) is a fast paced environment. The workplace culture is very diverse and inclusive! I have learned a lot in the past few years.
good,Being a remote employee has been a great benefit to have. The team works mainly via Skype and it seems to work well. Being remote comes with a downside of not having too much visibility with leadership and thus one ends up becoming stagnant in their career path. The benefits are spectacular and the amount of paid time off is above and beyond all other companies. The pay is on the lower end of the spectrum but I feel that Dell tries to make up for that with supreme benefits. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the lack of direct leadership... it is difficult to grow when the leadership is not totally vested in your team due to being vested in too many teams.
good,"Great Job. I enjoyed the enviroment. The staff was treated wuth the utmost respect. Unfortnuately, we were part of the Washington, DC BRAC so we had to relocate."
good,"Azienda con un grande portfolio di soluzioni IT."
good,"Pros- they keep you focused on learning the changes to the product line. The benefit of Dell / EMC Technologies is the width and breadth of the product set. That is also the curse, most employees tend to narrowly focus on a set of technologies."
good,"Sales is where you can mint money with 2X , 3X salary . The more hard work you do the more your earn money in intensives.Lot of Parties and vendor sponsored  events and training programs."
good,"Good company to work for, but bad management and sometime from the different organization team ............................................................"
good,Dell is a laid back culture with all of the resources to drive home results. The internal processing tools lack performance and are not reliable from a daily basis.
good,"I would recommend Dell \ EMC to anyone looking for a job. They are a good company that pays well and has dynamic leadership."
good,I am looking for a reliable workplace which provides good working environment and gives opportunities for career growth which is recognized by smart and hardwork.
good,"In certain departments I feel there was favoritism by managers to certain employees.  I felt advancement was difficult there.  I did enjoy the people I worked with and the work that I did. I enjoyed developing training, training employees and mentoring the most."
good,"As in most large corporations, there were both good and bad managers, but 2 of the 3 I experienced were above average. Forward thinking with remote working environment led to a good overall culture and environment ."
good,Great place to work with great benefits when full time. Temps and part time do not get benefits. Clean campus with security. Comfortable work areas and friendly people.
good,"Fast Paced environment "
good,"Answering telephones, and directing customers to solve computer and peripheral troubles.  I was empowered to sell contracts, take payments, and help customers fix any computer and equipment, lan, wan, or network problems, under an expired warrantee."
good,"-  I learn to communicate effectively to various types of clients."
good,"Yes , Here you can share your thoughts in the technical aspects,so that managers can look in to that and will give the support to your idea if it is worth. Its been great to work with Dell for me"
good,"People working in Dell regularly use the expression of ""The Speed of Dell"".  It means a lot of different things.  On the positive side, it means that Dell can implement good ideas faster than any company I've ever seen.  On the negative side, it can implement bad ideas faster than any company I've ever seen.  It is agile in its ability to respond to new situations, but it also can change strategy in an almost arbitrary manner.  Every day there is a new initiative or new idea to try, and that activity generates an unbelievable volume of work.  I have worked hard my entire life, but harder at Dell than anywhere.  When the experience is good, it's gloriously addictive.  When it's bad, you wish you could get off the crazy carousel."
good,Dell is great place to work and grow.  The opportunity to move around and continue personal growth is outstanding.  The pace is fast and frenetic--never a dull moment
good,"Flexible work hours, but no regular telecommute is allowed."
good,"There is a great work life balance. Dell promotes working from home which is nice. However, sometimes the office is very quiet and feels like there are many people leaving the company."
good,"good service compnay "
good,It has been an experience working for a contractor with this company. It was a great experience in their building. They offer great security. The company I am employed with covers call center Health Conector for state od MA.
good,"enjoyed my time in Dell,made some great friends and loved the work,good pay and benefits.learned alot about production and computers.Great culture and work ethic"
good,"Organization ambiance is good, people are very supportive, always helpful. workplace culture is really good. i thoroughly enjoyed my tenure. Its been 3.5 years with Dell International Services"
good,I had a lot of great experiences at cliebtlogic which was a third party outsource for Dell computers Customer care and technical support call center. I learned a lot and earned 16 Dell computer certifications there durning about a year.
good,"The culture was geared toward working many hours and feeding u at the desk and training"
good,"I've enjoyed my tenure with Dell Secureworks.  However, I am looking to grow in other areas of the industry.    A typical day involves an 8 hour shift answering calls from clients for assistance with troubleshooting network issues. The job can be stressful at times."
good,This company does require a lot of your energy and drive. They expect you to move up through the ranks or at least be come more of an expertise in the field that you work.
good,"Your success at Dell is dependent upon your group and management. It was an excellent place to work, but challenging based on all of the companies that Dell had acquired in the last 2-3 years, which is why the culture can vary depending on the different areas of the support organization you worked alongside."
good,Good experience working in this organization. Work life balance is good. Work is fine. Looking for more challenges and better position. Hope to get it.
good,"Meritocracy, many various functions, fast paced and lots of good people. Most rewarding job I ever had. There were some of the best managers I ever worked for."
good,"Dell is one of finest compnay i ahav acome across. "
good,"The culture in dell is quite vibrant. The skill sets that one acquires in dell is not restricted to his/her line of business. "
good,"If you're looking for a flexible place to work, this can be it. Although they have employee and team goals, setting your own goals is taken with a grain of salt. No real preparation is given to move into other roles, especially if you excel at your current position."
good,Good company on the cutting edge of IT transformation. Not bad to be here if you're used to the culture. Technology is great and very competitive. Noticed a significant change over the last year where there seems to be a diversity quota attempting to be met.
good,"You are always learning something new. New systems, ."
good,"Una empresa que te desarrolla, ciertos fallos en procesos y estabilidad como ambiente outsourcing, pero se puede crecer y se tienen muy buenos beneficios y oferta salarial, una cultura de inclusión y aceptación muy buena."
good,Good for starting your career.  Operations are yet to be stream lined after DELL-EMC merger.  Helps for people living in off-shore locations if you are in IT.
good,"Enjoyed working with many professionals at Dell.  The camaraderie and teamwork was great.  "
good,"Most of the job perks are tailored to an older generation (eg. family healthcare, college planning for children, etc.). Add more flexible work options or educational benefits to capture the millennial crowd. A budget for an occasional happy hour or the ability to work from home can go a long way towards making younger employees feel connected to the company."
good,"There are many software products competing to get attention from a few hardware products. Since most times the software is given as part of hardware sales. Your products relation with the hardware sales guys makes a huge difference."
good,"The workplace environment is great, company provide to and fro cab service. Management is quite impressive. The work culture and people are good for your career."
good,Great place to learn information regarding the fraud industry. Great advancement opportunities. Great office culture and work environment. Work/life balance is hard to manage.
good,"- Great bonding team"
good,"Enjoy the job environment , my boss, my co-workers, and generally the interactions are positive and edifying as an employee. That said, they are still lacking in development of training, especially soft, interpersonal skills, and aren't really paying persons with bilingual skills at the level they probably should be."
good,I Liked  to use my hands and this job was right for it . I was able to be apart of something great building dell computers.This was a great place to work at.
good,"Work/Life balance is great, benefits on par with rest of industry. Remote sales staff can work as though they own the business which in a sense they do."
good,"Dell sold the services division to NTT Data when I left the company. Dell had not provided raises and little bonuses the last couple years. I believe this was to reduce expenses to make the division more attractive to buyers.  The people are great and hard workers willing help their teams and peers.  I enjoyed my time at Dell, but it was better years ago when there was more resources to take care of the business."
good,"Brilliant work life balance."
good,"Amazing company always listens to employees cafe and food is good transportation is bad ,location is worst,managers are cooperative,incentives are less,celebrations are minimum"
good,"Was fairly happy at EMC prior to the Dell merger, but since then (~OCT 2016) things changed pretty fast for the worst. Within ~8 months my entire org was basically 'restructured', tons of layoffs all the way up the management chain. Lots of corporate BS about new plans & directions but didn't end well for my entire org."
good,"Very fast-paced."
good,A lot of uncertainty due to acquisition of EMC and company wide consolidation. Co-op experience has been good. Most people are easy to work with and pay is decent
good,"Come in early, stay late and stay on top of everything. A typical work day start at about 730 AM and then ends once your emails are manageable. You take incoming calls and assist customers with there needs ranging from large to small and providing excellent service. It's definitely interesting working with people for all around the world and learning how technology effects businesses at large."
good,"Work-life balance, great products, employee friendly, flexible work hours. I worked as a part of DELL EMC and I would definitely recommend it. A great place to work!"
good,"Dell is definitely tops in its field and keeps producing inovations that drive business.  Salaries were competitive in the market and the benefits were excellent.  Smart people can definitely have a great career at Dell.  But mid to upper management positions are often given to people with advanced degrees and/or are hired from outside of Dell.  Typical of most large companies of course.  Without having an advanced degree or extensive experience from outside of Dell, promotions are slow and job changes are mainly lateral."
good,"I had a great 5+ years at DELL-EMC. When Dell acquired EMC, layoffs started."
good,"Good Place to Work, although i cannot give a good or bad review because I only worked with Dell EMC for four months after the takeover of EMC. When I started working there, it was just called EMC and Dell weren't in the picture."
good,i love working in here. hope can get opportunity also in here. all team is very nice and helpful. the accommodation very nice and highly rated. easier to work in here because more parking.
good,"Dell, overall is a good company to work for. There are plenty of opportunities for career advancement up to a certain point. At the more senior levels that I'm at now it gets a little stagnant as upward movement depends on people leaving."
good,"Very busy and stressful at times but the team pulled together to get through whatever issue or new implementation came up."
good,"Hi my name is prashanth, I am working in Dell looking for good opportunity, my work in Dell is handling chats technical support. Looking for very good opportunity near to my place."
good,"work culture is good,"
good,Dell cares for employees and their familes and encourage time off to spend time with family.  Learning and training materials made available.  i enjoyed working for Dell.
good,"Great workplace and a canteen that while isn't always the best, is always enough to get through the day and for a good price subsidized by DELL."
good,Very supportive at work.Very helpful colleagues along with management.working with the team is always enjoyable here.Learn a lot from colleagues and as well from management.
good,"I have worked at Dell EMC for almost three years. I have enjoyed the project opportunities, but find the management difficult to work with and they provide little direction."
good,A company where everybody should work atleast once in their career. Lot of facilities for the employees which the candidates realize once they leave the company
good,fastpace job that requires total concentration come in at 3pm and get a 20 minute meeting . Then we see who we have and go to our areas and talk to the 1st shift area managers to discuss the workload and evaluate which employees can have a big impact on the day go to lunch at 7pm (hour)  then start the second half of the shift the bulk of the work comes around this time right after lunch. All employees are focused and locked in to whats has to get done the receiving area is starting to slow because we stop receiving at 9:30pm and allthe employees over there goo to the shipping side of the building
good,"got to learn about dell computers topology, work culture and sales skills. a great place to work with, great management, lots of opportunity to learn and grow, but sometimes few managers ruin everything by their own insecurities."
good,"It was a good company while working there. Good people and benefits. Great discounts on Dell hardware while working there."
good,Dell Technologies is always growing and looking for exceptional talent.  You can certainly grow your career and work with amazing people around the globe.
good,"To assemble computers, to help others to ensure all the products runs smooth and good condition. "
good,"Good company to work with, get to learn new things everyday. Managers are very cooperative. Understand your needs and help you grow in your carrier. Do not feel the pressure of work as you have fun while working."
good,"Dell is a dynamic company in a competitive technology space. Its not for everyone but I really enjoy it and have had a ton of success. Helping business solve IT challenges and shearing best practices is really rewarding. Things change on a dime at Dell, so you are always learning new skills and having to keep up with tech trends. The company can 'shift gears' in hours - and you must keep up! Turnover is high because they will weed out the lazy employees.  I've made hundreds of new friends and have moved up the ranks at Dell."
good,"The FLDP gives broad exposure to various parts of the finance organization and great opportunities for career advancement, growth of personal networks"
good,"This is a great company to work for, but like others has been caught up the off-shoring game.  This has led to some aspects of the company declining in quality, however, the EMC merger has great potential."
good,"1. Typical day at work - Starts with a sync up meeting followed by working on the tasks we were assigned to. Two breaks for tea and a lunch break at flexible hours. No restricted timings."
good,"Hello"
good,Lots of process and work available and good in work culture and training part...management is good but facilities are not up to mark..infra structure is ok
good,"Dell is an excellent employer and a great place to work, I would recommend .the company for employment   to others.  Dell is focused on product and needs to focus on service and product."
good,"I've been with the company for almost 2 years, there are lots of team players willing to help you accomplish your career goals. The benefits and company culture are some of the best around. Pay is a little below market at this time."
good,"It was the hardest job I've ever had, but also the most rewarding.  The co-workers were great and management did they best they could. Great services."
good,"It was a good job with a reasonable amount of management that were interested in helping us learn the job and get better. "
good,"was a great company to work for, people were professional, management knew exactly what they were doing with great communications from the leadership teams"
good,"I have worked at Dell for over 8 years, and I must say Dell is a great company to work for. They make a ton of investments to ensure Dell portfolio is the best in the industry. The only downside of Dell is the constant head count freezes that are placed on departments that prevent you from taking or pursuing new better paying opportunities in Dell. My suggestion to anyone looking to work here, would be to move through Dell as quickly as you can, and avoid staying in one place too long. Once you get complacent, it becomes extremely difficult to move onto new positions.  Also, be sure you network ALOT with managers in other departments, to ensure you get visibility needed to get hired elsewhere in Dell."
good,This was a fast paced but quiet call center environment which dealt mostly with Outlook and Lync issues. There was plenty of support within the team I worked with.
good,The motto at Dell is to gain as much experience as possible by having more responsibilities added to your plate without even a small bump in pay.  It is expected that you work around the clock - especially if you are in a global role.
good,"Working for Dell is a great experience,  they provide excellent paid training that help you tremendously before going on the floor.  The atmosphere is casual but appropriate attire. Every customer service representative have there own work station that is not shared,  you can decorate and make it your own. The only thing I wish was better is the pay. It's not bad, but it could a little more."
good,"My day to day work involved interacting with the field sales executives and driving sales cadence with them."
good,"The organization is exciting and fast paced, always keeping the focus on the customers needs and expectations.  Very good to employees, fair and accommodating.  September through January is non stop, project planning, being flexible to adjusting goals and objectives, assure we are hiring the best diversified candidates for the various locations within Massachusetts. Overseeing site locations and placement of resources by location, technical requirements, and insuring that good workforce communication - union and non union employees."
good,Most enjoyable was being part of a company that experienced exponential growth. The stock soared every year for a decade and the challenges were plenty and fun to resolve.
good,People are very polite and well-oriented about their duties and responsibilities. Very good management and the environment is very welcoming. Fun place to work.
good,"I started as a phone support tech and moved into a career as a business analyst and product manager. I had a great time at Dell, and only regret the fact that they laid me off when they did. I had no desire to leave and would go back for sure."
good,The summary above explains the gist of the experience. A nice place to work with awesome work-life balance. Salary and compensation could be much better when compared to the industry and this doesn't come as a surprise as Dell was never regarded as a very good paymaster.
good,"Good work life balance."
good,"Dell was a great place to work.  They allowed for work from home and believed in having a great autonomous culture to be your own boss.  They had realistic expectations and really believed in their employees.  Due to the acquisition of EMC, there were a lot of employees that were laid off but it was  a great culture."
good,This place is a great place to work. You know that it is a leader in the IT industry and is moving in the right direction. Excited to see where it will go.
good,"After the privatization of Dell some years ago (driven by the move to being a Services and Software company), the organization is still dealing with the realities of changing jobs mid-stream. Much as an individual would."
good,"fast paced environment, working with good people who care about each other and the company.  never a dull moment as business needs change and policies and procedures change to align."
good,as a support technician for Dell you never know what kind of calls you will receive. it could be from a business or from an end user with issues on there home computer. there is no down time when you are at work. calls are constantly coming in. that does help the days go by faster.
good,"Opportunities in Dell are unlimited. Got exposure to work on various tools and techniques. Great place to enjoy the work. Multicultural environment, fair chances to learn more."
good,"Great people, work life balance was good.  I worked from home for 6 years.  Not a lot of opportunities to move up.  But as a remote employee that is expected."
good,Une entreprise dans la quelle on trouve un océan d'opportunités pour s'épanouir et trouver le poste adéquat à ces compétences
good,Good company to work here. Work life balance is there. Career growth is not there with this company for individuals. Over all its a good company. Thanks
good,i have given my whole and soul to company but now a days company want us to do a housekeeping job also. which is not possible me to do. over all i have learn so many things from
good,Elevated my technical expertise by leveraging Big Data resources. Excellent access to data for research and predictive analytics.  Intelligent and motivated Data Science teams.
good,"You will have lot of opportunities to explore within company"
good,"Grandes posibilidades de capacitarse por cuenta de la emresa; ambiente de alta tolerancia, flexibilidad entre vida personal y laboral"
good,"Great Place to Work"
good,"Nice place to work, But having frequent layoff. Management is poor as dell software group is currently acquired by francisco and partners another legal Entity."
good,This is a On rolls job with good work culture. They drive for target and achieve them with high numbers. Good knowledge about present market and competitors.
good,"great work in certain teams. good for experienced professionals with families, since work life balance is the key value proposition. Slow career growth in junior roles, but perhaps similar to large legacy firms. Average tech brand firm vs leaders such as Apple, Amazon, Google, etc.."
good,"My second Job was at EMC and one the best places to work"
good,"Dell International had an extremely competent work environment ."
good,"In Dell working as a process associate for Reporting, the job responsibilities are as follows: "
good,Learned from scratch on Backup Products. Flexible timings to work. Great opportunity to learn new technology. Good facilities. Enjoy team parties every quater.
good,"At Dell you get to scale across several job functions and this is what makes the job fun.  You will learn a lot if you put the time and effort.  The workplace culture varies between buildings and teams.  The most enjoyable part of the day, lunch - you can take a nice stroll in the sun and decompress a bit.  Hardest part, every so often, lots of rumors of layoffs."
good,"I had no personal life when I was at Dell, but enjoyed it immensely. It helped that they paid me very well and that the job I was hired for was very well respected."
good,"Good experience working with Dell & Learnt new things and enjoyed working at dell"
good,"Good company with a wide range of storage products."
good,"While I was with Dell India, it was great place to work when it was still public incorporated company. As it has been 9.5 years and company has gone private after a leveraged buy out, things may be different."
good,With 150K+ employees worldwide do not expect a nice and cozy seat you can retire from - it can be a great learning curve and massive career booster to work here but the sheer size and revenue-driven attitude keeps you on your toes at all times.
good,"Good benefits and decent pay, and culture was pretty good to start.  Management was good, but too much micromanaging and the culture became too toxic for me or several others to continue.  Industry was interesting, products were good, and majority of coworkers were good.  Cold calling for tech sales is a tough job, and not for the faint of heart."
good,"Good working environment and facilities"
good,"Plenty of room for advancement, Good pay."
good,"Was brought in to turn around a failing project.  The project was turned around and completed successfully on time and under budget.  I had several additional projects all of them also completing successfully, on time and under budget.  Then there was a change in management and the new manager brought in her own team."
good,EMC has a great set of products and a team of employees who care and strive to do the best that can be done.  The Dell acquisition has caused a lot of layoffs.
good,lots of learning opportunities.great work place.supportive management.liberty to plan our work and can take breaks. transportation is issue

good,"Install and Implementation of Data Storage systems."
good,"A lot of hands-on experience and knowledge added on a daily basis through the direct contact with customers."
good,"I was originally hired by EMC Virtustream, which was a fantastic company with flexible schedules, remote teams, excellent compensation, and good benefits.  Well Dell acquired EMC there was a layoff of many Virtustream employees at the end of the 1st month."
good,"This job at Dell was very rewarding as it offered both technical work to keep fresh on current Dell products, as well as a unique insight into front line agent interactions with customers."
good,"-Great working culture"
good,"Dell EMC is a great company to work for.  Work at Dell is fast paced and non-stop.  As with any great company the employees are Dell's greatest asset. While the atmosphere may seem stressful at times.  There is always a team oriented can-do attitude that permeates throughout the numerous departments and groups. During my tenure at Dell I've learned skills ranging from the highly technical scripting languages such as Perl and Python to soft skills, such as interfacing with sales makers and irate customers.  The hardest part of the job is saying ""no""."
good,"When we come late to work, i hate coming late"
good,This place has a great work culture. It is a very good place to start when it comes to the IT field. They provide opportunity for advancement in pursuing certifications.
good,Nice environment. And i learned how to be patience and how to love my work. Because there's so many work for me but my co- workers to be with me. And but there are hardest part of my job The Encode so many paper works but i love and im enjoy it :)

good,"Scoping Professional services, efforts estimation with List price geberation."
good,"I enjoyed working for Dell, I met many wonderful people along the way. I have had many doors open by being able to meet so many different people. I look forward to working with my connections I have made at Dell."
good,"Es un excelente ambiente de trabajo, motivante y retador, con un constante proceso de aprendizaje de parte de todo el equipo de trabajo."
good,payment posting is my role of this company. My co-workers was helped me to when i was fresher. now itself i need any help they can help me.
good,Pas une minute de latence forte creativitée et objectif toujours en focus
good,"Great place to work in."
good,"Great work culture . learned to communicate with people , process knowledge and worked with some great managers and colleagues. Night shift makes the Job little tough or else its a comfortable job. the work culture makes it enjoyable."
good,Amazing company and a great place to be. Great management and a Great visionary CEO. This is a really good company. I am not sure how many times I can advise how great a place this is to work
good,"Fun place to work, constant and consistent changes. Salary is decent. Difficult to advance in broken structure. Have to be a flexible person, stability is not something you can count on here."
good,"Work flexibility is the first thing that pops up in my mind about EMC. There was a healthy work atmosphere. The co-workers were great and made the journey easy. EMC offered quality trainings that helped me evolve technically. "
good,"Good company to work for but without a degree or friends in management, you're unlikely to move up very quickly. For the work, the pay is okay and benefits are great but for the mentally active, it gets boring quick. Also, along with the slack contractor workforce, much of the lower management is way too soft and it shows on the production floor."
good,"Excelente salario y prestaciones, pobre a pesimo desarrollo."
good,the company probably has the best tech resources in terms of storage tech but lacks in management and understanding the latest tread in the services sector of the IT industry.
good,Dell was the first company to have worked for and that was time i actually started understanding how corporate companies work.
good,Working with Dell was my dream. Actually it totally depends on in which project you are and who is your manager. For me it is a good experience.
good,"great team and fun people to work with! People are willing to help. "
good,"Being on the phones can be stressful. In my time at Dell, mt technical knowledge has increased greatly. Management and co-workers are some of the best people I have ever had the pleasure of being around and associating with."
good,"Great sales support structure.  "
good,"Great place to work for. Nice coworkers, good management - even though sometimes they don't know what they doing (but this depends on department to department)."
good,"Employee friendly organization in  terms of learning"
good,"EMC are ranked 3rd among the Best Large Workplaces in 2011 and, coincidentally, 3rd among the Best Large Workplaces in Europe 2011, it is a Great Place to work and Great people to work with in the company. Up to the minute technology and a real fast paced environment."
good,"Great place to work if you are a self starter and self motivated, plus you like to talk calculated career risks.  If you like jobs with very structured environment then this is not the place for you."
good,"I enjoyed most of the time working for EMC.  I ended up becoming the manager of the DVT test group, but due to personal situations, asked to become an individual contributor.  the manager they brought in didn't know how to manage people and made it difficult for me as well as the rest of the group.  This caused a lot of problems. "

It has been an amazing experience as Dell is the first one to introduce me to corporate world.Since I provide support to US customers, so the busiest shift was the night one.

Lead the team to deliver key operational deliverables."
good,"A good place to work!"
good,People are great and intentions of leadership are genuine.  But they can't turn the ship fast enough to compete in emerging technology space.

good,Good place to work with multiple opportunities. Great training for managers. Multiple re-organizations caused churn and re-inventing processes.
good,"I liked the company very much, free to say our ideas and thoughts."
good,"We work with the coolest technology in the world!"
good,"As a manager, I would come in every morning and depending on the work load, take one of my team members down for coffee.  We would talk about his job at Dell, his aspirations, and his family.  After that, it would be time to head to my desk and begin the work day.  Getting to know each one of your employees is key to trust and reliability.  The downside to that is having to also maintain the manager/employee barrier.  Having the ""Hard"" conversations would require me to remind myself that it is business and not personal.  I really did enjoy helping to develop each one of my team members and watch them achieve.  At times I would get a flat screen TV from the Lab and bring in an Xbox.  Dell would be short on funds for offsites, so we would improvise and have an Onsite.  It usually was also a potluck."

good,"Working in Agile PLM domain,"
good,"While I didn't exactly fit in with the culture at Dell, I was glad to be part of it for awhile. I would compare working at Dell to college life. There were a lot of very young people there, with strong cultural biases. I had a lot of fun just observing the day to day workings of the people there. The hardest part of the job was working ""Dell on Call"". This was very difficult, as we were to provide support for any software that the customers would call in about. Many times it was software we had never heard of, so we had to preform internet searches for solutions. Without direct hands on knowledge of the software, this was very stressful."
good,"Co-workers are nice and helpful. Typical big company but not so slow or bureaucratic, maybe because I'm in software group."

good,Can learn a lot of things here. Excellent management and co workers.
good,"A typical day is dealing with customer's network issues, most of whom are partially upset when you get them. I learned a lot about Blade devices which I didn't know. Co-workers were all good people. The most difficult part of the job is dealing with Customer's incorrectly set expectations but we were equipped with several means to get them felling good again."
good,"My day would start at 6:00am and would go until 2:30pm. We would have shipments waiting at the dock doors to unload and take to the different stockrooms. We had deliveries scheduled for every 2 hours. When they arrived 1 person would receive the parts in to the system while the others would make the deliveries. If UPS or FedEx would come in we would have to sign for that delivery after verifying the parts to the packing slip. I learned how to drive an elfrider, forklift and a slipsheet machine. The receiving team was pretty much left to manage ourselves. We had a great lead. The hardest part of the job was the long hours at the end of the quarter but my teammates made up for that. They were great people to work with"
good,A good company to start. I learn lot of new things Friendly people with positive attitude towards work ethic.

good,"Awesome company to work with, had amazing time working with Dell which believes in creating leaders, the most enjoyable part of the job is fun activities on the floor, team dinners. Again the hardest part is long working hours like most of the other companies."
good,"Working for this company has been a great ride. Job is fun and I have a great team. Managment has taught me quite a bit. The job is challenging at every turn. The downside is, however, the company as a whole will not promote within teams. You must apply outside of your dept. to be able to advance."
good,Hardest part of the job is rotational shifts.Your lifestyle will changes..
good,"Day at Work:"
good,Typical day was 60 plus phone calls for various types of issues. I have learned overall better multi-tasking skills and processes. My co-workers are very knowledgeable in the IT field and always gave a heads up. The hardest part of my job was informing a customer that the issue would have to be escalated to the next tier.

good,"A typical day of work is hard to describe.  The one thing I love about my job is that the structure stays the same but the specific functions change on a daily basis.  I learned to take charge of my future and that valuable employees can become stagnant if they do not take their future into their own hands.  The hardest part of my position is walking away from my computer during busy season.  It is easy to work 24 hours straight before the realization of what you have done.  The most enjoyable part of my job is my team members.  They are caring, kind, and contribute tremendously to the overall success of the company."
good,"A Typical Day at work starts at 7 AM...Planning up the Magical things to be the done that day, Doing the Interview Follow up calls , Meeting up the Stakeholder's , Sourcing , scheduling and releasing the offer letter's + Team Meeting - "

good,"Typical day at Dell"
good,"good life @ dell-perot systems"
good,"The management of Dell services is simply awesome.  The way they handle all the employers is simply wonderful, they response for each and every call u give them, for what ever tickets u raise you will be given a explanation by the managers ."
good,I had an excellent career working with Dell but currently the company is struggling because of the overall economic pressures. I believe there are lay offs happening and it is also planning to shutdown some non performing support sites.

I have work with many technicians from various backgrounds and have benefited from knowing them. The challenge was getting the  computer installations done in a timely manner, which was always accomplished. "
good,"EMC is a excellent company to work for the great benefits.  My typical work day is coming in and focus on the task at hand, setting daily goals and reaching them.  My co-worker are  excellent team players, supportive and hardworking.  The hardest part of my job is trying to balance work-life and home-life.  What I do enjoy about my position is being able to  resolve complex cleint issues."

It was a call center environment, but it was fulfilling work and grew my customer support skills."
good,"For only being in the company for a little over a year as a temp, I enjoyed being a part of a few departments in Credit and Collections. From the start, I worked with the tax team. I was responsible for validating and updating the system with current tax exemption certificates as well as providing tax rates for collectors. Recently, I have been working with the cash applications team, specifically with processing credit card payments and depositing live checks. I was fortunate enough to learn different responsibilities from each group in a short amount of time."
good,"As a whole Dell is great. I want to specify that my issues were not with Dell but with the third party Dell was providing service for. They in general had no empathy for their clients or their issues. There was no accountibility in the processing department. The manager for the ""Team"" I was on had never actually done the job being performed by her subordinates and there was a general lack of organization and knowledge of processes and day to day job tasks. Almost daily there were computer system issues. Management on multiple occasions would give ""I don't know"" or ""thats just how it is done"" responses to questions with out resolution or regard for how we are to relay this information to clients. Dell has amazing benefits and discounts other people I knew that worked there loved it, just make sure you are going to enjoy the company you are working for thru Dell."
good,I really enjoyed my time at Dell. Great values but struggling with the declining PC market while trying to integrate the new IP they acquired. Tremendous talent on the sales teams.
good,EMC has been a wonderful place to work. I am currently a part of the Backup and Recovery space. This division has been born out of several acquisitions. It is a dynamic and supportive environment.

good,"Pro ativa,dinâmica e ágil,aprendi que o trabalho feito em equipe chega em maior resultado e feito com atenção melhor qualidade.Com gerentes treinados e capacitados,a empresa em si tem o maior desempenho e a forma de lidar com os funcionários torna mais agradável o dia a dia."
good,"long hours, but there is the ability to have flexible work schedule. On-call rotation is a must. must be self-starter and work well independantly. many opportunities to learn a new skill as the IT team is small and must cover all aspects of the systems."
good,"Good corporate culture,"
good,Dell is a big company. Really big. That brings advantages and disadvantages.
good,"Management is struggling to 'transform' the company to a software, services, and enterprise company, and they have lost focus on the core business that drives the companies financials. As a result, expect a few challenging years ahead. Good place to work if you get good management and good team."

good,"Work as a helpdesk tech, day is spent assiting users with reset and remote access issues."
good,Good place to work great benefits very diverse great co workers enjoyed my job and the pay
good,"One of the best paying companies out there. When it was good, it was good. When it got bad, it got bad. If ever the opportunity came for me to work for them again, I'd jump on it. The pay and OT is good enough. Then add in the benefits. Two weeks of paid vacation up front with approval by management. Hands on learning about every process there is from beginning to end. I would take this job back in a heart beat."
good,"I spend days writing e-mails, answering phones, and the usual work of making sure stuff gets done on time and within budget."

good,"Great to learn and grow in the organization, a lot of benefits and visibility on company goals and performance. The company gives a lot of importance to training and skill development this even helps you when you go out of the company. Onsite opportunities are less."
good,"Great Support from our team manager, excellent workplace and fun filled environment to work and get along with the team mates. Lots of cultural and sport events are organized to enhance the talents of the employees working in the DELL."
good,"It was a nice workplace but the interns didn't get the best equipment. It took me a while to get monitors. The hours were very flexible though and all interns could work from home pretty much whenever they wanted. I often just stayed home because I felt like it and even took my meetings from home if they were online, especially on days when my team also worked from home."
good,Watch out for lay offs not sure how the down size is determined but thats the down fall off this company....other than that Dell is a great place to work
good,Dell can be a great place to work if you enjoy change. Management changes often and each manager has their own opinion on how to achieve success. Advancement is there if you are at the right site and department. You will be held in role for at least 18 months per HR. Benefits are great. 6% match on 401k with ROTH option.
good,"If you want to learn new things, it is a great place to get your feet wet and see where your career can take you. There are plenty of orgs you can go to and get experience"
good,"Dell is a good company to work for, especially the learning environment. There is plenty of advancement opportunity. Constantly changing products forces you to stay up to date on releases."
good,"As a server technician it is often to feel like the outside group of Dell. Due to the upcoming lay offs most of the Dell Management have given up on encouraging the employees. I enjoy my job, benefits, and pay but the drama in my location can be a bit much sometimes."
good,Great place to work and receive experience. No complains only benefits. Had a great time working for Dell. I would recommend it to anyone looking for work . Great people and culture . the pay is so so..
good,Dell believes in ethics and values and also work for customer satisfaction. Dell is transparent towards its employees for growth and maintaining brand value.
good,"Work with a team preparing and receiving shipments. Assign carriers and drop zones. Process invoicing and shipments. Great to work with a like-minded, laid-back team."
good,"Good opportunities to apply skills."
good,"Many meetings."
good,Recommended company for start of the career. Opinions varies towards managers some are good some just get sour on you without listening the idea. Salary is low.
good,"Good work Culture a great place for the talented and will get good opportunity to grow in a competent market "
good,"Pros: Good work/life balance. Flexible schedule. Can work remotely. Medical benefits are comparable to other companies, global company, well program"
good,It is one of those places where they pay you well and thats it. Quality of work is good but recently the firm culture is degrading due to lot of regional and management issues.
good,"Joined EMC and it was an amazing place. With take over by dell things were bound to change , some good stuff was removed and some were added overall a god place to be"
good,"I got good support from manager and teammates, they gave me lots of advice and were willing to help me when I encountered problems. More, Dell offers flexible workplace and worktime."
good,"Overall Great company to work for. Management cares about their employees and looks after them  Many opportunities for growth in the company."
good,"They embraced open source and pushed you to bring your best to the table. Everyone would listen to your suggestions. A sprint encompassed solving different problems from different projects maybe in a different language, so it always kept you on your feet. I enjoyed my time and really enjoyed my talented and awesome team members. I would do it again any day."
good,I enjoyed working with my team.  We collaborated on a lot of task and had a great working environment.  I loved mentoring the new employees and the other departments as well.
good,"The culture at Dell varies from organization to organization and team to team. There is a laser focus on making the customer journey a positive one. People can advance, but like many companies, Dell does a poor job of preparing or training their managers to be leaders."
good,"Definitely a great atmosphere for someone trying to get back into the technological work environment. The opportunities for advancement are poor at best, and the wages are hardly mediocre; it’s still a great starting point for anyone trying to get the foot in the door to utilizing their tech skills & abilities"
good,"Great Company to learn Leadership, technology and management. Supports Work Life Balance, growth, learning, open culture, supports diversity and positive attitude."
good,depends on department and location can experience can very.  overall good learning experience and enjoyed doing my job to help patients.  would work here again.
good,"Various experience in the field service as an analyst tech. Assist with outage, Physician & Clinicians on the field, thru various. The hardest part was meeting a timing manner to close SLA SLO tickets. Isolate the needs during a clinical critical time. etc."
good,Contract employee with Manpower. Was told assignment may last 2 years but only lasted 5 months! A lot lay offs once quarter ends . Only old timers survived pretty much which sad to say least because they train you . You put out most production and then laid off if they don’t like you . Management needs get hold that atmosphere
good,"Decent place to work"
good,"Early on, Dell was a great place with career advancement and opportunities for self improvement. After the first layoffs, the environment became toxic with everyone waiting for the next round of cuts. It is not like the professional positions are Seasonal Work. Dell needs to get better at supporting their internal customers."
good,"Work life balance is good. "
good,Dell was a very good company to work for. It provided the latest in technology and training. Enjoyed the people and the culture. I would recommend working here to anyone
good,The survey asked me about working at Dell.  Dell was not my last employer.  that seemed strange to ask since it wasn't timely.  Also I worked for a business client and not at the Dell campus.  So it was mostly a remote support position.  Just wanted to note that.
good,Little to no pressure. Rely on many manual reports and employees are not provided with robust systems that can handle so much manual data causing systems to reek havoc at times. I love the flexibility that allows for work/life balance. Managements does listen to employees concerns.
good,"At Dell Technologies there are many avenues for personal and professional development. From free LinkedIn courses, tuition reimbursement, Dale Carnegie, Toastmasters, and mentoring, someone looking to grow, doesn't have to search long."
good,I have been with the company a year and I am happy overall. All jobs and companies have pros and cons but more pros. Great benefits and good people on my team.
good,"Great place but demanding hours. Everyone, whether Salary or an associate starts on second shift. It gave a culture that no one is ""better"" because of title."
good,"Working in such a big company cannot be really evaluated since it depends on what group/department/organization you work in. "
good,"Working Environment is Good, best to increase your skills and production. Best working culture and the most enjoyable part is fun @ work. Getting interacted with management team is best."
good,"I enjoy working here, it's quiet, friendly, collaborative, team players, management is willing to help you advance overall environment is worth coming to work."
good,"Ambiente ético e desafiador, centrada em meritocracia"
good,"Responsible for large account development and management in the financial sector. Responsibilities included consultations, quotations, sales and service of large-scale IT related network solutions and upgrades. These involved working alongside competitors as well as strategic partners.  "
good,When I left the CEO had changed and the changes the new CEO put in place drove business needs with no consideration for the customer's actual needs. After their worst year they later reverted back to their original win/win scenario (at least last time I checked).
good,"Dell is a great company with excellent benefits and job security. The people you work with are friendly and always willing to help. Michael Dell is truly a visionary of the future of technology, and knows where to lead the company to stay competitive and successful. You can make your way to almost any position in the company if you network well enough and are willing to put in a lot of time doing work you're less passionate about."
good,"It has been 20 years since I worked here, so I'm sure many things have changed that my input would be irrelevant.  At the time, the work culture was very pleasant.  Although quotas and projections were the focus, the people who worked here were fun to be around."
good,If you know to handle pressure.. This is a very good place to work. The annual bonus is very good but the annual increment is very less... There is work pressure but it can be managed
good,i have good experience of working with Dell. I received an opportunity for career development and know that this experience will help me in my future professional life
good,"An organisation which has leveraged technology for Human Resources Management to the optimum best"
good,"No rest for the weary would be a great description of working for Dell.  Yes, the environment can be fun and rewarding, but at times the pace may seem frenetic and filled with chaos.  Buckle up for the ride - it's a crucible for those wanting refinement, and a furnace for the lazy and unwilling."
good,"It is a good company with talented people, I think people above 50's does not fit in their needs."
good,"Great benefits and lots of opportunities for advancement into various departments.  But sometimes a manager could block your advancement if they didn't have the time to train or hire a replacement.  That delayed a promotion offered for 9 months in my case.  At the time I worked there, layoffs were common and new hiring classes always began at the same time.  But great people to work with.  Very flexible and enjoyable environment.  Lots of vendors supplied Spiffs and other bonuses as well as catered food."
good,"traveled, and helped customer make there environments better"
good,"Job role did not match the brochure presented in the interview. They had great expectations for my role that never did come to past even for the three years that I was there. Each department in the cloud services ran their own projects and caused integration issues when released into production. It seemed my role would change due to the conforming to the self-started fires.The Virtustream cloud product doesn't seem to be growing as it should at this point in time. I'm sure they'll figure it out."
good,"Really easy to come in, do your job and go home. Which worked for me. Not super huge on building the team culture but that's not huge for me. Would recommend."
good,It was a good job out of college. Got my foot in the door to a lot of future opportunities. I was able to work in a great work environment with a lot of diverse people.
good,"Loved the people I worked with at Dell, but once the EMC transition began culture started to shift. I have had some of the best managers I have ever worked with at Dell, but there are also pockets of management that don't know what they are doing."
good,"Daily Quality report check, huddle, work scheduling, pulse call, Sr Manager review call, ETA, SLA, Project status, Pre Quality report check, EOD status."
good,"A typical day at work for me was low tempo for the most part provided that your team was productive. It provided a great environment to work and learn. Management at the ground level was responsive to worker needs. The hardest part of the job was communication with the customer on recurring problems where resolutions took a long time to be addressed and understood, mainly due to the ticketing system. Training on new platforms and having the freedom to troubleshoot issues with different approaches was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Long hours, (50-60hrs), managing multiple priorities and projects with executive visibility to various deadlines."
good,Several great managers.  Multiple chances to migrate within services.   Many challenging projects and good teams to work with.  The organization can be hard to figure out.
good,"A Place where an employee's job security is of prime importance, considering the performance. "
good,"great place to work , nice people."
good,"Great environment, healthy work culture, excellent campus and HR policies. It was a pleasure to work for Dell and indeed a great Brand to add on in ones profile."
good,"I enjoyed my Day at Dell, and left only after the division I worked for was sold. Looking back, I probably should have stayed. I can highly recommend Dell as a great employer."
good,"It was nice work culture there.Learning is the key factor,very disciplined, punctuality on timing is very important. you can grow because there are lot of opportunities."
good,"If you are focused and a workaholic, this is the place to be in. "
good,"Good benefits however, never a raise in 5 years of service. Poor training strategies. Team leads assistance non-existant. No raises ever, not even to keep up with cost of living."
good,"Awesome group of professionals, team work like never seen before very independent and empowering team environment. Loved going to work every single day"
good,Dell focuses on the small group to let other groups compete without discouraging growth. The management needed a little help to being more focused on individual growth within the group.
good,"Great 6 yrs with Dell. "
good,"Dell is a forward thinking company, consistently working to provide IT solutions that fit today's environment and moving the industry tomorrow's IT landscape."
good,"Dell EMC has a unique call center feel while still learning and working with IT professionals. You are the professional for your product and you are the one that will fix the issue. It is either that or you will have to escalate. The problem with Dell EMC is you do have to spend many years 4+ to get an advancement to their next level. Otherwise take a different route to move up."
good,Great work environment. A lot of opportunities for learning technology. The job security was not strong once the company went private and closed down Nashville operations.
good,The Work environment is very good and there a lot of benefits. The salary is good regarding the high level of life in here. However the respect of different cultures is not something they have. They fight you.
good,"Met a lot of long-standing friends in this position, was well compensated and learned a lot about the IT and customer service field. Days were long and the shift bidding process was nerve wracking. Was laid off when the office was ramped down and eventually closed."
good,"se trabaja muy comodo, trannquilote permiten hacer tu trabajo sin precion siempre y cuando este listo al final del dia.de trabajo. Aprendi a compartir exclentes ideas de trabajo con mi equipo, la parte mas dificil del trabajo pues ni tanto es el challange que se te presenta para una nueva oportunidad de crecer para con la empresa. Lo mas que me gusto del trabajo es que aprendi a colaborar como equipo, aprendi ayudar y brindar soporte a mis team mates."
good,Dell was a great company to work for. Unfortunately for a newly single dad it wasn't very accommodating. Long hours with siloed departments often undermining productivity. Endless meetings during office hours led to working too much from home and a low quality of life.
good,"Great People to work with.  Very sharp an smart folks.  Management at times can be too focused on operational vs professional development."
good,Dell is a great place to work at.  There is a lot of good opportunities for career growth.  The company does a good job of work/life balance.  I would recommend to a friend and old colleagues to work at Dell.
good,Good place to start your career and also enhance it. Provides good platform to learn new technologies in market and ample opportunities to grow and get promoted
good,"Dell is a great place to work, assuming you are always ready to raise your own bar.  The ability to deal with ambiguity is considered a ticket to entry.  People either thrive or get very discouraged.  It's not for everyone, but if it matches your personality you will enjoy it.  "
good,"Great place to work, great perks with staff , discounts, healtcare etc. Fast paced and huge learning. I was taken under senior staff wing and learned a huge amount."
good,"Good company, good salary and benefits such as private healthcare for you and partner, good incentives. sales role was highly pressurised and involved lots of cold calling and basically being creative with building your own marketing plans - little or no leads provided"
good,it is a good experience to work in this international company with professional people. High pressure environment and definitely can learn a lot about time management
good,I would recommend as a good starting IT job to get your foot into the door of Technical Support. Very flexible in regards to scheduling. Ton's of knowledge to gain on Windows and Microsoft.
good,"Good Company for Software Engineers."
good,"Good start for fresher who are out from college."
good,"Multiple meetings"
good,"Good work life balance with friendly management policies. Salary structure was not perfect and job profile was confusing. "
good,"My time with Dell was spent on a contract, where Dell was the holder of said contract, so I did not get the fell experience of working for Dell.  The experience I was was based off the contract, and not working with Dell."
good,"Great place to learn eCommerce Business, Software Ecosystem. Ocean of opportunities to perform various roles and responsibilities. Excellent place to build your experience and skill set."
good,"Fun with Agility Journey and Experience. Great place to learn the eCommerce Business, IT and Operations. Have a greater choice of roles to play across organisations."
good,"Decision were made quickly on strategic issues.  Work life balance was great.  Mostly great people to work with. I once saw a Sr. VP lie to save his own rear end with the Vice Chairman of the company."
good,Was fine until laid off. I know they were trying to save money but reducing head count but it is always difficult when yours is the had they are reducing.
good,I had a very good manager and director during my internship there. People are very nice and friendly. It is happy to work there because you can gain lots of support and guidance. Benefits are not that competitive.
good,Working at dell was rewarding and my growth curve there was phenomenal. We were creating new service offerings and providing sutlers with custom solutions.
good,"I was a Systems Administrator at Dell.  I maintained all kinds of servers with full life cycle - build, maintain, fix/repair and finally decommission them"
good,Dell provides the opportunity to work remotely and has a corporate direction to allow up to 60% of their work force to be able to work remotely by 2020.
good,Working in a new production manufacturing facility is very busy and somewhat stressful because you are building PC to the customers requirements and not duplicates of each other.
good,"The division I worked in was under the software sales team, typically, the busiest time would be at the end of the quarter, the last two weeks in the quarter were pretty stressful. Sales reps are bringing in all their deals to meet their quarterly numbers and I would be the one processing the orders for the reps. throughout the Qtr, it would be busy, running reports, reconciling opportunities and running reports."
good,"very helpful people ,  manager was supportive ,team mates are supportice,  monthly team outing, team lunches .Flexible working hours, flexible work  attire."
good,"Enjoyed the early morning shift,no weekends, paid holidays, & the way everyone pitched in in helping out,good customer service,quality food & service providers to customers."
good,"Dell has a unique culture of being fast paced, which I work well in.  You need to be able to be self driven and motivated to learn. They pay well and you work hard.  I recommend working at Dell"
good,"Now that we have our Customers systems working properly.  The work load has decreased."
good,I enjoyed working at Dell/EMC due to the people I worked with and the way they collaborated on projects to help ensure success.  Direct customer access in my role was a plus in understanding their needs and issues and how the products could aid their business success.
good,Dell is a great place to work granted that you have great management just like any other place. I have absolutely no complaints. There is plenty of advancement opportunities as well as continuing education.
good,"very stressful job and a lot of travel. a lot multi task and a lo of admin work."
good,"Dell/EMC is a good company and has a good culture and wonderful resources for its employees. The software tools that they have are very good at finding what issues the systems may have, also they have very good resources for hardware issues that arise as well."
good,"Navigating the org charts was often a challenge, but this is a company with lots to offer. Very customer-focused, with a strong ethical foundation. Innovation encouraged."
good,good company i am felling well on working this company very good management and support team i got more experience on this company other then i got very much of team support.
good,"I do not want to leave information about my work experience. "
good,"Perfection is barley good enough at Dell."
good,"I do not want to partake in this at this very moment. Thank you for your time as I did love working for Dell a lot of my years there. "
good,"Installed, upgraded, and troubleshot software requests. Additionally, installed and replaced hardware components as needed and configured enterprise systems and applications."
good,"Working in sales for Dell will teach you A LOT, but depending on who is your manager, your worklife balance can be drastically different from reps on other teams. They’re good about providing plenty of resources to help you succeed. But if you like to do things your own way, heads can butt as training/coaching is often mandatory."
good,Typical day work starts with process oriented. All are with System and you will have very good boss to explain the process. Hassle free work for report generations and Management reports.
good,"Imaging of multiple computers daily, audio visual support and setup for multiple meetings daily. Desktop configure and setup for new and visiting offices. Mobile device setup and configuration for network use and email for iPhone and Android users."
good,"Very competitive place to work, I think trainings should be more in depth before employees hit the work floor. it can  better with how computers work,"
good,"Good culture and good time off, but they consistently under pay all their employees.  Medical benefits are pretty bad.  Until you get up to L3 level, the pay does not compare to other companies."
good,I do not want to comment negative or positive because everyone has different opinions and I don’t see the value add for providing my experience at dell.
good,"In a world where sales teams are looking for some extreme x-factor in their new hires, Dell will take anyone and teach them what they need to learn. It's a great place to get your feet wet in the tech industry but it is a big machine. You can easily become just one of many cogs or if you really want to put the effort in you can push into the higher parts of the company. There are metrics so the job can be demanding but it is pretty forgiving of new employee's which you don't see in a lot of sales based roles. The culture is ever changing but I believe Dell is finding its stride and becoming a better place to work gradually for the newer workforces out there looking for jobs."
good,"Well managed machine.   Driven by metrics and concerned about employee and customer feedback.   Since going private, less quarterly churn and more longer term thinking."
good,"Dell is a extremely fast pace company that expects excellence from its employees.  Departments were driven to improve on processes and key business metrics.  Cross-function communication was key to success.  The culture is very competitive, which drove high performance and results.  I learned a great deal from the high level of talent in every organization.  Great high-tech company."
good,Dell is a great workplace to work at with robust management with new processes and plans constantly changing and keeping thing on the edge every time.
good,"No Additional benefits apart from salary. Organizational structure is very good. Strategies to drive the businesses are well versed."
good,"For engineers, good place to work with ample time off, flexible work hours and WFH options. Good learning curve and competitive work. Great manager. Lot of politics in upper level management"
good,Great company to work for.  A positive experience for a student intern to gain exposure to corporate environment.  Management is helpful and provides solid support.
good,"Putting customer deals together using new technology, global environment added complexity to daily work.  Constant change.  Going private was an interesting decision."
good,In my short time there I found it a very enjoyable place to work. The training was very good and the support of management and other staff was welcome for new starts. Every day was different and it was a challenging but rewarding experience.
good,"Freedom of Work & Job satisfaction lots of training available to improve skill and learn new technologies, Hands on all new technologies with help of training and labs."
good,"Typical day at work would mean that you leave home at home and give you 100% at what you are doing. Customer Service, Great Communication skills, sales, Technical Knowledge etc. The management is good & workplace culture is ethical, not biased and definitely no racism of any kind. If the job was easy, it wont be called a job and sales is not easy. Being there and doing that is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"The QA manual testing and automation with Agile process was interesting."
good,Dell is perfect place where you can manage both work and personal life. I have learned a lot of good stuff from Dell. The hardest part of the job is being a oncall person during the weekends.
good,"As long as you network during your time at Dell/EMC, you can advance BUT many managers do not create advancement paths for their direct reports. I was given latitude in my roles to do what I felt was best for the company, so it is a good place to work in that regard."
good,"Dell/EMC is the most interesting job for those who want to interact with data storage machines.  Your coworkers are awesome and helpful.  However, after the recent merger, downsizing has been happening, stressing many people out.  Definitely apply, because having worked at Dell looks fantastic on a resume.  Understand that permanence is not guaranteed."
good,"Dell wants to make sure it get the product to its customer  working and within an a certain tie frame. It values its customers and staff wages are fair and they got a good package ie Health Care Sports Social and Pension. "
good,"Company is too big to be agile and react to competition of smaller, more agile players in the space.  Overall great work/life benefits.  As an employee, you are just a number at this point."
good,"Friendly work environment. "
good,"Good work culture.We keep creating new values in our society"
good,"Serving as Senior Solutions Architect on a global account with functional responsibilities including Professional Services, Problem Resolution, Project Management, and Enterprise Solutions Architecture."
good,"Overall - I met some great folks at Dell/NTT/EMC/Secureworks and value those relationships today.  We worked hard, made time to ""do some good"" in our local/global community and had fun along the way."
good,I worked on many project teams .  I had 5 consecutive 6 month contracts. The management was always helpful and willing to train new things.There was always recognition programs for employees.
good,"A typical work day would be to come in 30 minutes before the start of shift to count parts (dims, ram and processors which are considered high dollar parts). Also keeping a very detailed inventory."
good,"Very good company to work, great environment, dynamic and there is  a lot of room for career advancement, especially if you are starting your career, this is the place!"
good,"The work culture is great, leadership also considers employee satisfaction as important as customer's satisfaction. They give great opportunity for growth in terms of visibility and value you."
good,I have worked in dell services which is now NTT data. The place is nice with good infrastructure . Have worked with really amazing people and learned a lot
good,"Although the work can sometimes be stressful, the rather flexible work hours makes it easier to balance work/life."
good,"Great place to work, fantastic facilities and benefits for staff .."
good,"Dell is one among the structured based company, management is very strict and very cool place to work. managers are very calm and they dont put pressure on employees"
good,"Although the workload can be pretty heavy at times, it was rewarding to know your work was appreciated and given recognition."
good,"I have been working as a sales promoter or merchandiser almost for a year now. Sometimes, its very tiring as I have to stand 8 hours a day on the floor dealing customers and with the pressure of achieving my target sale. Convincing a person is not an easy part, especially when it comes to buying a product with lot of choices and the pros and cons those choices offer. I am a quick learner so that it helps me to blend in to any kind of people and environment. Along with that, those interactions always helped me learning everything new every single day. Till today, the people who I worked with are really supportive and helpful and I never miss an opportunity to return the favor. In simple words, the advantage of this job is that I get to meet and interact with a lot of people from different backgrounds and diversities and teach me something new where as restless and unhealthy timing makes me sick most of the time."
good,"Big company with many different departments and business units. "
good,"Pay is not the best, nor is it terrible. Just with any other corporate job networking is the key. Pay attention and keep up with policies and be willing to do more than just your job title and you will excel here."
good,"Great work environment if you're a technical minded person. Compensation was very fair for the roles I was handling. I worked for Emc before the Dell buyout, so I can't accurately say how the company is now."
good,"Dell is a good place to work.  "
good,All I will say is that I am blessed to have the opportunity to work there. Work/Life balance is good. I get to work from home 2 days a week and my manager is awesome. There are some downsides but I will not speak of them.
good,"I came from EMC and after merger, the environment changed some in terms overall working experience. Job and management expectations weren't clear after Dell EMC. We didn't experience the Dell culture as much as of EMC has offered. However, I did enjoy working in RTP site and the gym is a good place for a quick timeout."
good,Dell is one of a internationally cultured companies which provide exposured  to the people basis the grounds of international cultures. I didn't love working here and Dell International Services also when I got a chance to learn to win any new technologies and improved my skills
good,"Dell requires more of dedicated employees, if you are ready to work with full dedication you can survive there. Otherwise you will be kicked out. You should have plenty of knowledge about your business."
good,Good place to enhance and explore your Technical skills. The place where you get the work life balance. The Facilities and the projects are very interesting to work.
good,Very well formed organization with good management where in you get an opportunity to communication with people from all over the world and engage with them to share your thoughts on the products you are working on.
good,"We use the incredible power of our integrated perspective to collaborate not only with each other but also with our clients and partners. We’re working across technologies, industries and geographies to make connections others can’t, and to come up with innovative solutions that truly transform businesses."
good,"1. On a typical day everyone is helping each other and just try to achieve the task."
good,"Dell Technologies Inc. is an American multinational information technology corporation based in Round Rock, Texas. It was formed as a result of the merger of Dell and EMC Corporation."
good,"Really good company to work for, with a  lot of challenging projects going on across multiple teams and excellent work-life balance. It is located in Round Rock, a suburb 20 minutes north from Austin, TX."
good,"They do a good job of developing their employees and rewarding success. Overall, a person's career goals can be met at Dell because it is easy to move throughout the company and have many different roles."
good,"I loved working for EMC, but I was laid off after busting my rear for over 2 years. They hired a bunch of us in Denver as it was to be the Dispatch center. After over two years, they moved it to Utah, and started hiring replacements. I just feel the company does not have the employees that bust their rears for them, best interest at heart. They seem not to care at all about their employees. They also basically made the older folks either take early retirement or forced them out, only to replace them with young, inexperience people"
good,This was my first employer right after my graduation. A very good company on Healthcare Front. Recognition's to emloyees were too good. I believe would love to work here.
good,Dell has purchased a number of companies and can offer a truly turn key offering for just about any industry. The aquisitions have created a bit of an unruly situation where it can be difficult to find the correct resource but a good envionment.
good,"Typical day, morning briefing. Due to the nature of my job I can not go into futher details about my work. I work in a high security role and can not tell you who, what and where."
good,Melhor habilidade desenvolvida nesta empresa foi a convivência e aceitação constante das mudanças o que não nos permitia uma situação de conforto em nossas atividades. Sempre estávamos sendo desafiados. Excelente ambiente de trabalho com pessoas divertidas. No entanto prazos complicados de serem atingidos acabavam gerando um alto nivel de estresse. Projetos mau planejados.
good,"Hours were mandatory 8am - 530pm to try to build work ethic - but this can be confining. Micro-managing occurs a lot at this level - but with 150 call/day minimum results speak for themselves."
good,Great opportunity to learn the sales industry. Just get in and get out quickly as things change rapidly at this company. Easy and highly attainable promotions available.
good,"There are lot of training related your technology , you can learn new things every day, work culture is good. Fully supported by management,technically good growth"
good,"I worked at Dell for 14 yrs, great place to work but there was no job security in manufacturing. Was very hard to transfer to another job, it was who u know not what u know"
good,Very good company and the work is quite challenging. The staff is very good and also supportive which helped us in forming good team and the set targets are achieved which personally gave me lot of satisfaction.

I am also encouraged by my direct supervisor to shadow other departments to help determine what my goals within the company are, even if it means leaving my current team.  The down side is that there is a year long waiting period to move into a different role, including lateral moves.  So if you are not happy in a role, you have to wait a year to move, even if you want to do the same thing, just with a different team.

I have acquired a lot of new technical skills and acquired a lot of customer service skills. The management have provided all the necessary tools and training for us to be able to deliver world class support for our customers. You will really love what your doing at work as your co-workers are just like your family and we never miss to have fun at work at the same time. Not being able to solve the issue over the phone is the hardest part of the job as we will require an onsite technician to solve their computer issue but it is very fulfilling once you have resolved the issue or once you confirmed that the resolution of sending an onsite technician have solved the issue.

good,I have been with Dell for about 10 years now and has been a great company to work for.  You are rewarded for your performance and it is a true meritocracy environment.  My management team has been fantastic.
good,"its busy sometimes and others days its really slow, pays good ."
good,"Learn t to multitask and prioritize work. Meeting deadlines is very critical."
good,A typical day at Dell was processing and adjusting medicaid claims. The Management was wonderful and knowledgable and sincere with thier employees. The co-workers were very knowledgable and friendly and helpful. We all worked as a team and all togethere. The most enjoyable part of the job was working and learning together. The hardest part was leaving.
good,"In my last 11 years, I never said to myself that I am bored.  Why? Everyday I had a whole new set of challenges, different types of issues/priorities and customers to deal with."
good,"Dell is a great company to work for, and I very much enjoy the people I work with."
good,This was a contracted position. The pay was decent and my colleagues were fun to work with. A typical day included data migrations and updating OS's from Windows XP to Windows 7. There wasn't a hard part about the job and the most enjoyable was working in a fast paced business environment.
good,Dell has been a great place for me break into the culture of corporate America after serving in the Armed Forces.  I have had spectacular leadership as well as a challenging role.  I am ready to take my career to the next level.

good,"I love having the opportunity to manage diverse groups of people coming to corporate from all over the world.  I have a great relationship with my manager and he trusts my thoughts, ideas and decisions 100%."
good,Busy days in a productive workplace . Open door policy with management. Team environment where coworkers Dev and QA are available to answer questions and chat when necessary. Team members execute regression tests and divide the bug amongst themselves.
good,"Dell can be loved or hated depending on the time you ask someone. A person's future at Dell lies mostly in their hands.  Mentor & Network with the right people and it is possible to go very far at Dell.  At times Nashville Dell does have a tendency to promote and open more doors for a certain type of person. (i.e. people with families or what I call good ole boys or the stereotypical all american guy or if a woman then the sorority girl, cheerleader stereotype or more on the flirty side) If a person is not one of these things it is definitely harder for them to get ahead of the game or to control their own destiny at Dell.  Let me be to the point, right now at Dell I don't see any Gay men in leadership positions at Dell.  I like to believe that Dell is a diverse work environment but being honest, I got far fast at Dell until managers got to know me and found out I was gay and then personally investing in me as a person was non existent.  Knowing this now I have decided to keep things to myself and just do my job and go home.  "

Depending on your position and management you will have the option to work from home and usually have a lot of flexibility.  As long as you are getting your work done, that is all that matters.  Networking is key at Dell in order to advance.  Take advantage of volunteer opportunities as you will meet more people and have a real chance to be ""seen"" by leadership."
good,"Dell is a great place to work. I strongly believe Dell's culture and Value are the best. Dell believes in keeping the Internal(Employees) and external customers happy. The Rewards are not that great at Dell. I am a part of Technical support and a typical day at dell revolves around Calls. Most important point that any employee at dell believes in and ensures to translate on their call is ""Customer is the King"". Every decision that is taken is around this baseline. I started off as a Technical support associate and moved up to a Sales Auditor for the technical support. Work force(Co-workers) here simply awesome, always helpful and full of energy. The Crowd at Dell is lively!!! My Job is easy or difficult based on how i look at it, either as an issue(problem) or an opportunity to learn a new thing. At times meeting time lines gets difficult when too much adhoc work piles up, as key deliverable are high priority but the adhoc work that came up comes with an urgency too, but otherwise its simply a great learning role. Other than my key deliverable, there are many ad-hock activities that i take care of and initiatives i drive like, am part of the Community service group and i try to drive participation from the Tech support when it comes to serving the community that we are part of. We go to Orphanages, Old age homes, govt schools, NGO run shelters and schools to support them. We try to contribute financially or contribute food items , etc. We organize blood donation camps once every 2 quarters. Work life balance is great at Dell!! What i enjoy about my part is that i get to learn"

good,"The company itself has a good direction , but could show more respect to employees . The managers seem to favor some people over others . I was in the top 3 in my department and they took advantage of that . Decent pay but really repetitive and boring after a few months ."
good,"Working from home or in Amman, Jordan, I never had the opportunity to physically go to the campus."
good,"A day at work would be very exciting, especially communicating with american executives. I learnt much about US Healthcare and also the corporate culture in our country. I got my communication improved a lot in a few days of training. The company and my co-workers were all very supportive and willing to share knowledge.

good,Was a fascinating job and learned a lot of new technologies.

I now that this job has made more productive, and I have gained a superior level of customer service skills."
good,Manager technical group working to analyze failure modes and driving any trends that occur. I learned it was a very difficult place to move to another job. Management was Ok but thought there was favortism throughout. They would rather promote from within instead of outside. Felow workers were great. The hardest part of the job was in manufacturing the work in not level loaded and 70-90% of the orders came through in the last 2 weeks of each quarter. A percentage of my pay was held to bonus money. Knowing I was part of a large successful company.

good,"Like any salaried position - Ups and Downs. Constant reporting. Goals were based on traffic and not so much market research. I loved working with my team - energetic, professional, and fun."
good,"The best part of the work is you learn a lot everyday,Its a field work you need to complete minimum of 4 calls a day."
good,The best benefits and they do give you vacation up front because they know how worn people can become. The downside is you're sitting all day long.
good,"Very remote workforce in Round Rock, I often wonder what everyone is working on that they never have to come to the office. Middle management (Director and above) is a log jam, not a lot of movement upward and not a lot of movement outward. I know several employees who get to a certain level and coast for years and years and years."
good,"Uma ótima empresa para se trabalhar, aprendi muito, mas com mudança de gerencia tem muitas dificuldades, colegas de trabalho são muito dedicados uns com os outros"

Hated to be forced out by lay offs because I did enjoy going to work everyday.
good,"dell was a great company to work for. The pay and benifits were great but whe work life balance was not good. we work 60hr weeks on average, and were pretty much told the day before if we were gonna work overtime the next night."
good,"A typical day at work was very high paced and very demanding. I learned that management treated you like a true professional. Meaning you were able to managed your task and make decisions. This is a global company, so it would be very difficult to meet, work with or have a conversation with every co-worker. It depends on the day to be able to tell you what is the hardest part of the job because priorties change so fast. The most enjoyable part about the job was knowning at the end of the day you have postively impacted so many lives by support the hospital and off sites."

good,"I've worked for Dell twice, and in spite of the fact that I've been pushed out the door twice, I still feel it's a great place to work; just a bit too rigid in some things."
good,"This job was very demanding which I liked at the time, but became very stressful with all of the changes that were being made. I worked there at a time where they were re organizing the way they did things in the entire company. They started to outsource alot of the jobs and had massive lay offs. The hardest part of this job was not having security, knowing you are doing a good job but also knowing it may not be enough to keep your job."

Most difficult part of the job is there is a constant change of GTM Strategies on an annual basis(sometimes quarterly) which can make it difficult to project for income potential. Seems to be feast or famine depending on the whim of Executive Management and time of year.

The overall corporate culture has tons of benefits: work remote, flexible working hours, hands-off management approach (role-dependent), etc. But there are also a lot of drawbacks: highly hierarchical and consensus-drive, judgmental and isolating."

good,Dell is a pretty good place to work.  There is always a way to advance in your job and the work/life balance is good.  The only drawback is that they seem to move  people around a little too much and that means you have to take time to get the person's replacement up to speed on what is happening in the department/team.  Having to do that several times in a year costs too much time.

The company is in a building surrounded by other companies. It is very big and is a really good atmosphere. Provides a a variety of work rooms, kitchen area, parking lot and a ping-pong table. A typical work day includes arriving to the workplace at 9 am; having your own way of transportation. Once you arrive, you go to the kitchen area and wait for your supervisor to arrive. Once your supervisor arrives, you will spend the morning half of work learning the basics of the company, what it offers and how you can help it prosper and thrive. For 3 hours you do a couple activities with your group members and supervisor then you go on your lunch break. Lunch is an hour from 12-1 and you are allowed to go wherever you want as long as you are with a supervisor. The company offers 3 floors. The first floor being the entrance, parking lot and a local cafe. The second floor is the office area, work rooms, kitchen and a ping-pong table. Second floor includes some office workers and your supervisors. This is where you will be mostly during the work day. Third floor is the top floor which includes other office members as well as a balcony of the company. From 9 to noon you will work with your supervisor. Once 3'o clock hits you can leave. Your supervisor is the one who helps you learn different tasks and what you will do. Everyone at this company has a different background yet they all connect with similar interests and passions for"

good,"Typical day at work:"

good,EMC was a great place to work.  Very challenging but also very rewarding.  I am not sure how the culture has changed since the Dell acquisition as my division was sold off shortly after.
good,the people there were nice and friendly and I would go back if they called me back. I enjoyed meeting Ross Perot he would come to the company every now and then.
good,"I have been working in Dell for a while, this is an nice computer company in the world. And most of my colleagues they have IT work experience.

There are quite a few experienced mates who have helped me in difficult patches and also in improving my skills.

Knowledge of time management and prioritization of tasks are skills you will learn and master while working at Dell/EMC. The work culture is excellent. The best part about working there is the people, the benefits, and the salary. The most enjoyable part of the job is that no two days are ever the same, and you are always learning and gaining experience. Overall it is a great place to work if you like to work hard with outstanding people, and get excellent  compensation and benefits."

good,"trabajo entretenido, buen ambiente laboral, sueldo acorde a lo que uno trabaja"
good,As an intern you have opportunities to meet many other interns as well as different people in the company. Cost of living is low in Texas. Not sure what it is like after merging with EMC.
good,the new Dell EMC culture is made up of mainly younger people and the older workers are pushed out for one reason or another.  They say they promote from within but they do not.
good,I like to go to work every day because its enjoyable.  The manager and staff are very friendly and helpful. They also take their time to train you and care about not over working you.
good,This was my ideal job. The people were great. Everything was top notch and balanced. They seamed to really care and I would love to return. I have already applied to return.
good,The people are great to work with. The pay isn't very good. My typical workday is fast-paced. I have the learned more about leadership in my position. The hardest place of my job was the pay.
good,It can be a high stress job if you let it be.  It's easy to meet your quotas when you apply yourself.  I was answering double of the quota each day.  Not so bad.
good,I had a contract with Dell to setup computers in schools across NYC. They ranged from elementary to High School. The setups were pretty straight forward but it would take a long time due to the quantity.

Nunca havia trabalhado com notebook, foi muito bom trabalhar na Dell. Uma empresa com ótimas pessoas e gestores, concerteza eu voltaria a trabalhar se fosse chamado."
good,While at Dell it was a good place to work. I would guess that it all depends on your divison and your manager. I was lucky to have a good manager in the division I was in.
good,Great place to work and look at career advancement. Lots of chances to interact and muti-task with several different groups. Chance to work in office or tele-commute as long as work was completed

good,"Dell is a great company to work for. They were very demanding, fast pace and rewarding. They have gone through many changes over the past several years as many IT companies have."

good,You have to work hard to get exposure.    Fine place to be an employee ....  Id go beck if possible .    Everyone can succeed if they work hard.     Yep
good,"Dell as a whole is a fantastic company to work for. I would recommend it to anyone. My organization, not so much. The role I was in, as inside sales, is like constantly being stuck between two different places. The job as it stands is not really a sales role but you are compensated as though it is. That's not to say you cannot make money it's just largely a matter of right place right time as apposed to any real sales skills. You'll see people in higher ranks than you despite you having more experience, lack of consistency in management and desires. One team has a good manager and they do well while another is left in the dust all because the person they put in charge isn't up to the task. Difficult to move up or out without a bit of luck. I'm all for working hard to get where you want to go but hard work doesn't do much in this specific org. I would love to continue working for Dell in literally any other role."
good,Lots of resources available and progression opportunities. Great team and good working mentality. Enjoyed being at the company in small arm of business.
good,It was a good place to work. Room for advancement.  Educational opportunities offered.  The pay could have been better.  Bonuses were offered.  A lot of our recourses were not within the state which was frustrating.  IT was in India.  Our computers were not compatible with Dells.

good,I can't do a review for this company. I never worked for Dell International Services. I worked for Dell Perot Systems. This is frustrating that I'm being forced to do a survey on a company I never worked for!
good,"I enjoyed coming to work and accomplishing what I needed to get done. I interacted with many co-workers and vendors throughout my day. The Hopkinton facilities had everything you needed. I rarely had to leave to get my errands done. They had multiple gyms, a pool, dry cleaning, ATM/deposit locations and onsite vendors would also show up once a month to get things done like insurance and cell phone plans."
good,"The process engineering department is a good place to grow at your own pace; the other engineers were easy to get along with, helpful, and good mentors over all, but I had to go out of my way to find problems to solve and most of the nominal responsibilities had nothing to do with engineering. I know that the internship program has been revamped since I worked at EMC (Now Dell), so maybe some of the kinks have been worked out. The environment isn't overly structured, but there's definitely a corporate culture that I personally didn't mesh with. One more thing: don't be late, that was a lesson I learned the hard way."
good,"Good people working together to solve real business challenges in a fast-paced upbeat environment.  There is a lot of freedom provided each field sales team member to affect their business."
good,Fast Paced company.  Workplace culture is good.  People are friendly and nice to work with. Nice gym and facilities to use to de-stress. Good work life balanced.
good,"Hard to recognize the same old EMC.  Dell has a different culture and approach.  Not necessarily bad, but takes a certain type of fit.  Being private also has that double edge."

good,"Dell is a good company, that gives considerate and equal opportunities to all the employees to grow, has great management. I was an intern there and was treated nicely"

good,"i enjoyed working at Dell computers, i've learned so much in the short time i was there.The people that i worked with were so amazing.If the hours were conducive to my schedule now i would love to return."

good,Dell is a nice IT company to work for. It helped me to achieve my carrier goal. my managers were nice and capable. The HR was supportive and there were several training programs to help emp. develop their skills
good,"You'll have to sacrifice your personal time, health and family's time to get ahead. You're competing with All-Stars that constantly over deliver and are quick to throw you under the bus. Keep your opinion to yourself as politics are what get you ahead of your peers more than anything else."
good,"Management was a mixed bag in my experience, but the people overall have been helpful and professional while still being relaxed and fun. Not a lot of educational opportunities though"
good,"Spent a lot of time on the phone speaking with IT folks about purchasing computers, servers, and software.  There was always free food around somewhere with all the vendors that would come in."
good,"Review Excel spreadsheets, Evaluate and make recommendations.  Hold multiple conference calls for other aspects of the job and to maintain a cohesive relationship with other departments"
good,I worked for Legato Software which was acquired by EMC in 2007.  EMC acquisition was very good as it helped revenue grow and got us into many new accounts.   Our Inside Sales team role was consolidated back to EMC Corporate in Boston

good,"Salaries are good.  Job titles make you sound ""lower"" than you actually are.  Very progressive in terms of being socially conscientious.  Dell technology products (i.e., laptops) are not as good as they used to be, so working there didn't contain as much ""personal pride"" as it used to.  On a couple occasions, I was giving a presentation to the customer and I got the blue screen of death.  That was embarrassing."
good,Working at Dell was rewarding and a great experience.  The workplace culture was relaxed and easy-going but at the same time the job was challenging and at times fast paced.  Being remote from the main development centers was a negative but it strengthened your communication skills and time management skills.  The work itself was interesting and mind stimulating.  The management team was very supportive and encouraging of their teams and always provided the necessary assistance when needed.  Teamwork and working with people for a long period of time was the most enjoyable part as I've worked with the same group for over 15 years.

good,"Begins anywhere from 7-9am. Typically ends around 5pm with at least 2-3 night calls a week with stakeholders in the Asia Pacific region. I have learned the ins and outs of procurement in a world class procurement organization and known for its Supply Chain Management program. My management has been very good especially with letting the commodity managers run their strategies the way the commodity should be run with support from benchmarking and understanding industry best practices.  Co-workers all seem to enjoy the atmosphere and fast paced drive and results.  The hardest part of the job is having the global regions all coming together to support common goals. The time zones make management difficult, but doable with the right approach.  The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing your strategies unfold, work, and provide significant savings for the organization.  "
good,"Given free hand in developing and completing Electronic systems database and inventory for due diligence preparation of Y2K program"

The team that I worked with meshed well and we were able to accomplish many things with a small number of employees. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the constantly changing sales market and the fact that I had to build all of the software tools as they did not exist when I started the job. I was able to improve process time by 68%. I enjoyed the amount of freedom that I was allowed to create new processes and improve the productivity of the business."
good,It's hard to actually review Dell itself as I was working at a remote site far from my Dell management. What interactions I had with them over the phone were good.

good,"A typical day at work is a busy one. It is so busy that we could hardly afford personal breaks."
good,"Review medical claims and process to make payments to physicians. I learned how to work more on a personal goal, versus my experience of working as a team primarily, while still working in the team environment. The managers worked with you whenever you had an emergency and were always willing to help or give you extra training if there was something you didn't understand. Hardest part of the job was maintaining concentration on my claims. Most enjoyable part of the job was the rewards we got for completing difficult tasks and the recognition for individual successes."
good,We are enjoying lot of fun at work place.
good,"Typical day is filled with multiple projects going on always multitasking. I have learned EDI mapping on a distributed platform and importance of understanding the business. Management is involved in providing the tools needed to complete daily tasks. I worked on a team where everybody plays an important role in providing the successful implementation of projects. The hardest part of the jobs is the afterhours “on call"" rotation. I enjoy working with the people on the team and being a part of a successful environment."
good,Long hours but the work is rewarding. I work directly with the Corporate clients. With their input I would architect a solution for their reporting needs.
good,Always somthing new or different which also includes a challenge and ends with excitment. Team work is a must and the individual work load can be difficult but a job well do is very rewarding.

Management has an excellent open-door policy, work hard play hard mentality, and developing others to manage themselves. The environment is directed to expose everyone to each other. No private offices, and much interaction amongst peers. The hardest part of the job is minimizing turn over for hired contract employees. The most enjoyable part of the job is the autonomy; being able to leave the office, no call limitations, and the ability to work to make your business with minimal supervision."

good,Asemble computers and put together different parts to make the computer pass test. I actually learned how to assemble a computer from scratch. management and my co-workers were great.

good,"I enjoyed my time working at Dell and I had pretty awesome mentors and a great manager. However, even though there were quite a few veterans that were always willing to step in and help as much as they could to explain certain challenges, I wish there was a better training program provided  within the roles. Other than that, I think Dell is a great company to work for."
good,"A lot of people work part time or full time from home, which is a nice perk. Most people also get an annual bonus that is based partially on company performance and partially on individual performance"

good,The management in Dell is very helpul and trustworthy... They realky helped me in the time of my need...  The work culture is awesome.... Its a pretty friendly environment
good,Got the opportunity to working onsite with the customer (Microsoft) to perform diagnostic/ repair for purchased Enterprise Servers from DELL.  Performed warranty repair work.  Everyone at DELL works as a team or family if you will.  DELL is all about family and safety while giving their customers the expertise that only DELL provides.  My favorite part about the job was solving the hard to diagnose servers with large storage as there can be many pathways to diagnose a server.  I also became part of 2 different user groups within the company where I seemed to flourish with new ideas and designs.
good,"Great place to work. The people have been great and have enjoyed direct management. The mix of work and challenges has always been welcomed and exciting. Work from home and benefits are great, but the compensation is not as competitive as the rest of the industry."

good,Many opportunities to learn and improve skills. Opportunities to progress in your career. Some flexible working arrangements available. V. good management.
good,I work at Dell Technologies full time. Overall the atmosphere is energetic and engaging. Training is hands on and immersive. There are several different cultures within Dell Technologies and several groups available to join to fit the needs of everyone.
good,"Great place to work for the most part, however they need to find a better on-boarding and training method for their software division."
good,"Praca w tej firmie jest na średnim poziomie według mnie, są pewne zastrzeżenia co do płacy na stanowisku na którym się znajdowały i pracy jaką wykonywalem"
good,Enjoyed my time at (Dell) EMC/Documentum.   It was awesome to work for a market leader selling enterprise software solutions to F-500 accounts.   Virtual teamwork was highly leveraged and we were able to find and apply all kinds of talents to drive value to our customer's business.
good,Dell is well known for its work life balance by allowing employees to work in flexible hours. There is no restrictions on the work hours and provides a good balance.
good,"EMC is good. Dell is just so so."
good,"Very easy learn in dell business process, learn health care process easily. Salary was very low, but working with lot of motivation by others."

good,"was a enjoyable place to work "
good,We worked as a team and competed with the other teams for best production. Great people to work with and training was simple. I think the best part was the comradery.
good,It’s a good company to work with. I don’t have any issues apart from doing sales as I joined Dell for technical support but currently they were focusing more on sales and I don’t want to be in sales profile.
good,"Good work life balance in the company"
good,"My opinion of Dell is that it is a fantastic company to work for. The brand recognition is an excellent addition to any resume and I have enjoyed my time. However, the frontline agent role is one with high turnover due to high-stress workloads and hard numbers based performance. Customer service is not a fun job, but Dell does a great job of filling the cubicles with fun coworkers and truly helpful support. Really won't ever feel like your lost or alone because the managers and supervisors are there to help and make your job easier."
good,As an intern I only had one specific job I had to do but the people were all very nice. I usually didn't have enough to do during the day because I only had one project.
good,I had some of the best bosses while working in Dell/EMC. They were understanding and never micromanaged you. You were able to get your work done and that made them happy.
good,"I may be biased but the teams I worked with and for, were great. I enjoyed work everyday. The daily work was fun and complex at times, and always rewarding"
good,"Dell is full of opportunity assuming you know what you want to do there. If you go in thinking you'll move around until you find something you like, you'll be disappointed. Changing career direction from inside Dell is difficult. That's one of the reasons why so many people come back to Dell in another role and/or a higher level. It's easier."
good,"I'm from the OKC branch of Dell. The culture is the best of any company or any branch of Dell.  The benefits are the best, the call center is like not working in the typical call center envirement."
good,"Awesome company to work for, supporting management."
good,"I was happy working with Dell.  I received recognition and awards and bonuses every year.  I didn't like being on call, as I was supposed to support systems that I didn't know and didn't have access to and I never received training on these foreign systems.  I requested more duties of my manager and never received any additional duties or training and there was never opportunity for advancement and we only received just over 1% raise each year. I also could never gain access to the Dell Portal which was frustrating, but that was a facility issue and not a Dell Issue.  Management didn't seem to care.  But my benefits were good and overall had job satisfaction."
good,"Global collaboration opportunities, learning environment, entrepreneurial freedom and multi-cultural work place are some of the highlights of working at Dell."
good,"I was paid very well. I worked as a contractor for 6 years. I was paid very well, I was paid incredibly well. Can't complain too much when your making very good money $$$."
good,"Building a work relationships with the customer. Implementing new fixes on systematic issues in the PKMS AS400 environment. Great  Manager and excellent support team. Very diverse company to work for with all nationalities. Hardest part is the job is never done for systematic issues. The most enjoyable part is knowing you have given your best to research, analyze, and fix current issues."
good,"Overall this is still a great place to work. Since the merger with dell, the culture has changed, benefits have declined and morale has gone down due to the every increasing change."
good,Interesado en trabajar en la empresa Minsur  con toda las ganas y entuciasmo
good,"Productive and good Job Culture."
good,"As a working mother , I am highly benefited from company providing Work from home option which also saves time in commuting. It depends on manger if you can get Work From Home option or not."
good,"I enjoy working at Dell, they have a good culture of work.  Lots of flexibility, great for working moms. They don't have as many perks as they used to when they were younger but still a very good place to work.  Everyone there is always a joy to be around and respect is given fully.  Career advancement is a big thing for me and not having a line of sight is uncomfortable for me.  Moving up in the hypothetical food chain difficult, you must be in positions for at least 3-4 years to get a decent raise.  Unfortunate because they tend to lose great people to better paying jobs."
good,"the teams are more than willing to assist anyone who needs it and the management will do anything they can to assist you when you need it. "
good,"Good Place to Work,   Work is interesting, management is excellent, work-life balance is good.   Employees can rearrange their schedule to accommodate their life."
good,"Smart people"
good,Dell can offer many opportunities that come all at once. Management works closely with employees to make sure they are meeting goals. employees are pushed to achieve certifications to better themselves and Dell's objectives.
good,The people were all down to earth and everyone got along so it was always a good day. I absolutely miss working at dell. I miss all the people as well as the job
good,"Get place to work if you enjoy a fast paced environment. Pay is great, but you have to work long hours. Constantly learning and able to move up to company ladder quick. Con is that there is a lot of rotation"
good,Great place to work! I started out my career at Dell and from the beginning i had meaningful work with high exposure to executives. The org structure is very flat which allows you access to upper level management.
good,I started as a call taker and moved up to a team lead. was responsible for the training of my team and helped to manager the training cycle for the other teams in my group.
good,As an assembly team lead I had the opportunity to get into leadership and help others grow. I learned so many things myself I like to grow in what I do.
good,"Excellent work life balance and with great opportunity to work and explore more in other fields. "
good,"Corporate benefits are good. Culture is good. But in such a huge place - every team is different."
good,"Dell recently acquired EMC.  While some transitional changes are disruptive, mgt worked hard to minimize.  EMC sales leadership continues to be strong and bringing in additional Dell technology leadership will create a major enterprise player.  Like the opportunities this creates for ambitious sales professionals."
good,"* Good work life balance"
good,Easy to get along with co-works. Most the people I have worked with are here to make Dell a better company and will help out when their skill set is required.
good,"A typical day at work was fast paced and full of challenges which I overcame successfully with the help of fellow employees. "
good,I will miss the wonderful people that I have developed relationships with over the years. I learned a great deal working for DELL EMC. The hardest part of the job was that it was stressful at times.
good,"Met more great people there than at any previous employer.  I always felt that all of my teammates were willing to help each other and a higher caliber of employee than I've seen anywhere else.  Lots of great teamwork.  As a consultant projects move fast, so you have to learn fast.  It takes getting used to but it really makes you strong and ""up for anything""."
good,The company has great benefits and culture. Compensation from commissions and bonuses can be an issue however so make sure you understand completely what you are getting compensated on and how much you are entitled to earn.
good,Dell is a great place to work because you get more than a salary. They do not want to pressure their employees so they put effort into creating a relaxing job structure. They allow for a lot of time off and strongly encourage its use. The work is fast paced and policies change very rapidly so it can lead to a stressful environment.
good,"Working at Dell taught me how to become a strong sales person who worked with a quick sales environment.  We held monthly quotas with reporting every day, week, and month.  Dell is a great place to learn basic sales skills."
good,"First job out of college and was pleasantly surprised by how they treat their employees and how they compensate their employees. It is a vicious environment, however. The phrase ""sink or swim"" can be used without exaggeration. High demand, high reward system."
good,"It is very secure, but not many options when it comes to advancement unless you know someone.  I would stay but they keep giving my position to people who do a poor job.  It wouldn't be so bad if the new people, that support me, would actually do their job."
good,O trabalho é bem dinâmico com cumprimento diário de metas.
good,Highly demanding job but employees are rewarded for results.  Ability to work remote.  Team environment with highly successful people.  Very competitive salary.
good,Great opportunity to have a career where you can move around the company into different functional roles and get a large breadth of experience and learn from some of the best in the industry.
good,"Decent environment to work in, but some positions could be long hours and micro management does happen a lot across the company. Decent benefits, but work life balance does help in your role. Long hours are common if you are salary, but minimal overtime if you're hourly depending upon your department. Good place to atleast learn various skills that could benefit you in the future."
good,Dell is a great place to work.  It plays well and you will be always challenged.  Great management team and sets strategy that everyone can get behind.
good,"Loved my time in Dell"
good,Working for Dell EMC was a very good experience.  My typical day at work was normally filled with a lot of complex issues and many escalations but I always had a great team around me to help come up with a strategy and execute.  They allow folks to work remote and are very flexible when needed but certainly expect a lot of you as an employee which they compensate fairly for doing so.  Benefits are great as well.
good,"People demonstrate winning culture through positive and meaningful relationships."
good,"I was part of Individual Contributor role and had responsibilities of handling customer contracts accounting, which includes entire PnL and BS of such contract."
good,"Experienced professional with advanced knowledge in sales, marketing & business development, creating EoD(end of day)financial reports & closing, Monitoring Sales & CSR metrics and comparing it with the other teams so as to develop my team in certain levels with appropriate training and individual discussions.

good,"A well known company with a casual work environment. Dell was very flexible with scheduling. If you liked coming in early, you could work the 7am until 4pm shift. If there were a lot of personal responsibilities (kids, pets, transportation, etc.) you would request the 9am until 6pm shift.

Het vernieuwen en innoveren van zowel het portfolio als de eigen organisatie is een proces dat altijd voelbaar is en wat elke dag leuk maakt. Inmiddels  is Dell ook een belangrijke speler op het vlak van servers, networking, storage, security en alle diensten en software hierom heen. De breedte van dit portfolio is wat mij heeft aangetrokken en waarom ik het nog steeds een geweldig bedrijf vindt."

good,"It was great while it lasted, the company was bought out by DELL Computers.I don't know what else to tell you. Because if someone looks up this company, I don't think it will be on the Internet, or it will redirect you to DELL, and I never worked for Dell so I can not tell you anything more"

Employees are allow to start work early and leave early,  or even allow to start late if they are taking night conference calls.    At time when there is family /personal issues,   the employee are allowed to work remotely. The pace at work is fast and volatile.   Employees are trained to cope with changes.    Employees work very hard to learn from the job daily.   There is no formal on the job training provided.    Hence,  working as a team is key to success within the company.     Dell is one of the company with no ""office"" for most of the managers and directors.    No barrier between superiors and workers.   Co workers are tie together with multiple ""team building"" events throughout the year.   Rewards are given to appreciate the hardwork of the employees.     We get to work   across department, across regions,  we build networking within Dell and outside Dell globally.   "
good,"Dell offers a great and competitive work environment by and large (every company has its exceptions).  If you are starting your career you will have many paths of career growth to choose from and if you're already matured in your career they also have plenty of opportunities to be a senior leader or sales contributor/manager."
good,"The work from home is great, who can complain about that, the only thing great about this job is the benefits. I have yet to find a company that will provide as good or better benefits then Dell. Definitely the best, but my Pros and Cons pretty much explain the rest of the job."

good,Call center environment. Aggressive sales providing computer solutions to businesses and general consumer. Dell taught me the importance of staying in the loop of technology as it progresses. Coworkers were likeable and friendly competition was always a part of daily life. The hardest part was maintaining quota requirements. The most enjoyable part was the art of building and maintaining relationships daily with clients.
good,"Dell does try really well to take care of its employees, but you have to really be driven and thrive in a demanding workplace. In general they will work you very hard, so you have to be able to take care of your own health and wellbeing.

good,"EMC is a good company if you are looking for work and personal life balance. It is a top listed Fortune company and is a industry leader in Enterprise Content Management software, Storage solutions. It offers employees the option to pursue their interest within the company and has strong industry ethics. It has although slowed down in terms of growth and rigor it had once before, this should change with the recent acquisition with Dell. It should give it a boost it needs and is mutually beneficial."

good,"I have only worked at EMC for 6 months but in the short period of time I have been here. I advanced from Shipping and Receiving to The EGS engineering group actually working with the equipment. Besides having a outstanding facility that is the size  of about 3 football Fields, the moral of the people that work here is just outstanding. Every company has its flaws but EMC is at a bare minimal."

good,"Took anywhere from 15-25 inbound calls selling computers and accessories to US customers."
good,"With Dell, there was a lot of room for advancement. The job was a great challenge and I love working with my peers as well as the customers"
good,"Dell is a great place to work. They give you the opportunity to advance, which I did not do. I should still be working there if I had taken that extra step forward."
good,It is a great company to work for. There are opportunities for advancement if you have the correct mindset and work ethic.
good,"i have been a part of Dell International Services, bangalore for 2 years now and my journey as a oracle apps developer was very nice and challenging. At the starting i joined Dell International Services as a fresher and first few months where very much challenging as everything was new for me. But thanks to my seniors and mentors who help me along and taught me many things. I learnt many things while working under them and was part of a AP implementation project in the starting where i was asked to work on inbound and outbound and few XML reports. Later i moved to an AR implementation project where i worked on conversion and interfaces and learnt few functional things also. Currently i am working in a support project where i work in AP,AR and oracle Projects. The hardest part of my job was when i was asked to replace a 7 years experience professional in the support project currently on which i am working on. I was a bit nervous thinking how will i be able to handle the job role of a 7 years experience person as i was just having an experience of 1.2 years but eventually i handled the job pretty well and with each passing day i gained confidence. Now i am handling all the issues assigned to me alone."
good,The culture at EMC is the best part of the company.  Everyone is truly passionate about what they do and everyone works hard to make sure things are done right instead of just patched for now.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the there is no work pressure and and the environment is very friendly. The day at work usually start with a conference call where everyone update the status of the tasks.
good,"Fun workplace ,"
good,The company I worked for previously was acquired by Dell and I only worked for Dell 10 months as we transitioned. I found the Dell staff to be extremely considerate and understanding of our position. There were multiple departments requesting information from us at once so the days could be stressful but everyone at Dell was extremely helpful and considerate.
good,I am working at Dell for past 2 years. I got many opportunities to play with new technologies and implement on the projects. It is a very collaborative environment where people are not pitched against each other. The lack of performance review encourages team members to collaborate and work towards common goal than compete for individual benefit.
good,"It is fun and learning working with Dell. Good work life balance. Very helping co-workers. "
good,"It asks for 360 degree review for each employee, provide a lot of opportunities to each one, easy to set up one on one talk with your manager. great location, great city to live in!"

good,"u get life here, life is peaceful. Work life balance is good"
good,"I was a trainee for 6 months there. It was a good experience that i got when i joined dell perot systems as my first IT industry. I was given a project ""Learning Log Systems"" which was a web application based on java. I was given a mentor who taught me java and then i learned HTML and CSS on my own to complete the project."
good,"En un día típico, analizaba los reportes de incidentes, cambios y escalaciones por atender. Lideraba los equipos dentro de dell y era el punto focal para quejas de los directores y gerentes del lado del cliente. Lideraba juntas para dar un estado de las operaciones diarias, generaba reportes para ver áreas de mejora, establecía planes y verificaba estados de planes de mejora en proceso. Coordinaba la carga, areas de oportunidad y avances de 2 service managers a mi cargo. Atendía conferencias relacionadas a incidentes de alto impacto."

good,Dell is a great company to work for they have a great life/work balance atmosphere.  They treat their employees to all kinds of possibilities and awards!
good,"The position was created to handle the most difficult issues in a Supervisory role.  It gave the Specialist the authority to resolve any and all issues by whatever means necessary.  The people in the role were not abusing their power for quick resolutions.  It was the lower tiers that made promises to the customer when they could not resolve the issue - then they would transfer the customer to our department without our knowledge that a promise had been given for sometimes a new replacement when it was not warranted.  So because of the breakdown of communication between the lower tiers and the REC department, they ultimately removed the whole division and focused on training the lower tiers to better troubleshoot the issue."
good,"Loved working for Dell, unfortunately there was a huge layoff and the company closed. They had everything you could ever need as an employee working long hours. Good food, internet access, and access to a nurse in the building. This job provided me with many new manufacturing processes that I've taken a much deeper interest in career-wise."
good,Really enjoyed my job at Dell Services and would work for them again.
good,"EMC is a fast paced company with growth ambition, organically and through M&A."
good,Dell has a great infrastructure and supporting tools for remote development and productivity.
good,Every day is a new challenge at dell. At Dell people are independent and have great learning curve.
good,"A a typical day at work in my office begins with me opening up my cases and then trying to check the problems which led to the issue and then call up the customer and then hep him troubleshoot the issue  within a specific time period and then move on to the next,and also maintain a track record of all the cases and then making a note all the issues the the customer had  and then make a note of any unkown  issue and report it t o the supervisor"
good,"Had a strong desire to try and do right by the customer, but the upper management seemed to change their strategy every few weeks. While very nimble, it seemed there wasn't any clear and consistent direction. Major changes would happen every quarter with circling back to the previous setup around 4-5 quarters later."
good,"Until Dell outsourced manufacturing to other companies, it was a pleasure and privilege to work there."
good,"Its always exciting to work with Dell with a good leadership team across the globe."
good,nice place to work if you don't mind about the salary. good place for freshers.

good,Dell was an exciting opportunity and rewarding career extending over a decade.
good,I done my work everyday  as very perfect. I'm only the responsible to my own request. In generally my job is hardest because of i'm doing Inquiry. Co-workers are very nice person's.
good,"I am  happy that i am working with Dell."
good,"Learned the team coordination, mentorship, Leadership skills, Automatiuon skills, soft skills, etc..."
good,"even though I was a contractor, the atmosphere and environment was very conducive to hard work and very family oriented."
good,"People oriented Company with Strong Financial structure helps build family like atmosphere. This culture drives the results at EMC."
good,"As DIS is an engineering services firm, a typical day will vary wildly depending upon your position, the client that work is being performed for and if you are working for the client in an on-site or off-site capacity."
good,working environment is professional and its been nice though i work in shifts and like to continue but the growth factor and role upgrading is minimum
good,"Interacting and helping the customer by answering their queries gives a great pleasure."
good,"Sportive"
good,"Dell was a great place to work with many opportunities and excellent benefits. Typical days in my division were 9am to 6pm, Monday through Friday. We were in phone sales working mostly with US, West Coast customers. Our job was to assist our clients with scaling and planning of their technology needs and providing the best options for those needs. Most of my clients were on a 4-6 month buying cycle, so the projects were managed from inception to installation. Our managers were excellent and provided assistance and guidance as needed. Product knowledge training was essential to completing the job, and Dell was great at not only providing internal training, but getting our vendors to visit and provide first hand knowledge on their products that we sold. The best part of working at Dell for me was the team environment that our managers fostered. We all really worked well together. And I would say that leaving was the hardest part. Unfortunately, business needs sometime require cutting back and I was released in a headcount reduction. I would definitely recommend Dell to anyone that was interested."
good,"Great place to work where you can learn lots of new technologies."
good,"Day usually began at 0730. Check e-mails from day before. Prioritise the most important tasks and continue to monitor emails and various reports during the day."
good,"The position included visiting different kinds of vendors and repairing their Dell computers. "
good,"No task was to big or small, I enjoyed doing my job the best possible way."
good,Dell puts you on a international platform where you get to explore your limitations and strengths. Its a mature organisation and hence innovative thoughts are often stifled in the long approval processes.
good,"Dell is huge yet growing company with a strong reputation within its sector, a company which offers plenty of scope for progression within the hierarchy. I appreciate to work for a company which nevertheless has a dynamic and progressive approach. "
good,Work hard and party harder. That's the motto and the job lives up to it.
good,"At Dell I was a Quality Engineer with responsibility for the Dimension Product line of business. I had overall responsibility for the reporting process. This involved identifying trends using Six Sigma Frames, the investigation of defective product and drive Corrective Actions with the various Software, Hardware and external Business Units. I also managed and motivated a team of technicians and integrated a new metric which significantly reduced customer complaints and enhanced the customer experience."
good,"Overall is a great place to work, but at this time I need a night job."
good,"I truly enjoy working at Dell and have learned so much and gained a great amount of experience.  I am continually challenged, which keeps it fresh.  I continue to learn and develop in the Oracle and business systems area as well as other areas of technology.  Project work provides a sense of accomplishment."

good,"Learned about team handling  , worked as a trainer , was always updated with the latest technologies like widi , optimus and so on"
good,"Joined as Technical Support Associate. Responsible for new customers and handling existing US based Home and Small Office Customers."
good,"EMC has a culture that focuses on a healthy work-life balance. Employees are encouraged to work remotely and engage in flexible work hours. However, performance is extremely results-oriented. The hardest part of my job is managing my interactions with others throughout the company. There are some extremely bright and helpful people that you encounter at EMC, but equally as many who are a challenge to work with. EMC has too many layers of management and is known for awarding management positions for longevity and not necessarily your ability to effectively manage."
good,"In general a nice company to work for, but often offers little options for growth. It is easier for someone coming from out of the company to take a new position with less experience than someone already working there with more experience. The salaries are well below the industry now, so most talented people is leaving the company."
good,"Working with dell is the best part in my life"
good,"Sourced experienced IT professional using social media, direct sourcing and other internet based resources.  Majority of candidates were experienced in Cloud Platform.  Used Taleo ATS ( over 4 years total of experience with Taleo).  "

good,"The company cares about its customers. The initiatives and overall vibe is process improvement and how to improve the customer experience. The hardest part of the job is weeding through the bureaucracy, however. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to work from home. Management really understands work/life balance. The salary and benefits are excellent."
good,"Number one thing that impressed me is the availability of private transportation. They have a small fleet of ""tour"" sized buses that run different routes so it's a great expense saver on gas. Not too mention you get an extra $10-$15.00 in your check for transportation expense bi weekly. Dell Panama is truly diverse workplace with individuals from all walks of life, race and religious preferences. Dell also encourages internal team activities from sports to public service events. Dell management teams are very flexible and work with your needs."

good,"My job at Dell involved call center tech support. It was somewhat high pressure, and required at least some degree of multi-tasking.

But the managers and coworkers were all great people to work with, and the pay and benefits were great."

good,"working in customer service at Dell is really interesting."
good,"It's a big company, so lots of opportunities to explore and match interests. The average age is pretty high in some teams and might get boring. Some teams are not willing to transform to meet current market"
good,"Too good for a first job experience. Glad that I met a very fun and out-going batch mates. Hardest part of the job will be the shifting, since for me I'm not used to graveyard shifts. Enjoyable part of the job is the atmosphere of the office, the happy life that surrounds you, and the people."

good,Working at Dell taught me more about the ethics of time management and collaboration with fellow employees. Each day we have a 30 minute meeting brainstorming and explaining the set goals for the day. It's a very fun and effective environment with all the tools you need.
good,"I worked under the North America team and was very motivated because I respected and appreciated the US Management. My role required me to work with Canadian teams and I found them to be very lax and unmotivated. This goes for 80% of the leadership in Canada, they have been there for over a decade and seem very jaded"

good,"Dell is a good company to work for. the work-life balance and manager-subordinate dynamics, office culture,etc. are extremely nice.However, the constant leadership changes and its effects trickle down and team alignment keeps changing constantly."
good,"Work hours flexible as long as the employee works 8 hours. Ideas progressive, good collaboration. I felt that management did not have a clear idea what is Data Scientist role. This is understandable since especially deep learning is new technology and not everyone has a good grasp of its potential. "
good,"I loved my time at EMC. Great people who become your extended family. The work demands can be stressful at times, but the people make it fun. Many people have been there for their entire careers, and there is a reason for it."

good,One thing Dell guarantees is a proper work life balance. I have learned a lot about Dell's supply chain operations and got the opportunity to work directly with the business. I enjoyed my stay at Dell and my manager was very supportive. He even encouraged me to pursue my Masters for a better career opportunity.
good,My time at Dell was mostly positive. There are great people that work for the company.  There is room for growth and advancement as well I would work there again.
good,"I loved the culture and people that I worked with at Dell. Everyone I met was supportive, even in a sales environment. The only thing that I really struggled with here was the difficulty of the position. Sales is just not a field I believe I can succeed in, but others certainly could."

good,"The job is good, the management is good the benefits are amazing but the pay is low for 2017.  When EMC came to Utah in 2011 they paid very well at the time but now 6 years later they've fallen behind and the raises are a joke (if you get one), when one complains about pay they say that you should have negotiated a higher salary when you got hired, the only way to get a good raise it to leave to another company and then try to get re-hired and if you do manage to get re-hired you will be making quite a bit more than you were before you left."

good,"EMC is an amazing place to learn the concept of hard work and dedication to what you do."
good,A day at Dell would start with a nice cup of tea with teammates and manager and then our work. We would enjoy our work every moment and our manager was very helpful and supportive in everything
good,"The culture is very relaxed and close-nit,  always fun activities to participate in.  Most of the jobs are not micromanaged so you have opportunity to grow and flourish at your own speed. Because the company is so large it's important to stay relevant"

good,Its a nice place for beginners who just graduated as its nice place to learn about new technology. I learned about hardware and software and some knowledge about networks
good,assisted customers with taking their order as w ell as with order issues. I also enjoyed speaking to the customers and helping them make they time shopping as best as it could be

People are good and the politics aren't really obvious, but subtle. Pay is above average in my market.

good,"Work at client premises is challenging mainly the newly on-boarded apps. good scope for learning new things."
good,"Best thing about working for Dell was the meritocracy culture. If you worked hard and performed well you and your team saw benefits such as prime shifts even if you were all freshly trained. If you sat back and rode your tenure you got the bad shifts."
good,"very good team to work with, We can work many areas of software development. But Need to complete the job in time. I have learned lot of things in just few months.co-workers are very co-operative and knowledgeable. The hardest part is understanding the product stack and solving issues related to production."
good,Good experience with great support from coworkers and management.   EMC is responsive and an employee first driven company.    They ensure you have the correct tools and support needed to serve their customer base.
good,"There was really no typical day at work here for me. I was encouraged to spend time on the projects that interested me and I took advantage of that flexibility to try on as many hats as possible. Various responsibilities included designing and implementing new testing platforms and practices, driving supplier involvement, and evaluating the performance and conformance of drives targeted for EMC systems. Management was supportive of accomplishing personal goals and acted as a gateway of communication to other departments. The hardest part was putting in the extra hours to hammer out the bugs that were most complex. However, the best part was the rewarding experience of finally seeing those same bugs defeated."
good,"Great company with a great culture.  Not the best place for Sales Engineers - eventually the expectation is that you will sell just like an AE.    Also, have had 8 managers in 5 years - so there is some churn.  Other than that, nothing really bad to say."
good,It is good to be part of the team where you learn the technology by working in the real time environment. The people around are helpful and we altogether believe in sharing of knowledge and resources.

good,"Eccentric! Great people. Room to grow. Teaches you skills you never knew you had."
good,"Started at Dell as a temp to hire 17 years ago working on the assembly lines as a material handler.  Was hired as a permanent employee within 5 months at the time.  As the company grew, there were positions available for advancement.  There were many good people along the way who trained and mentored me.  The training I received eventually got passed on to the temps that I trained.  It was great to see some of those continue on to bigger and better positions as well.  My managers were all knowledgable and considerate with work/life balance issues.  I was very fortunate I never had any issues with anyone.  We were all feeling sad and morale decreased when we found out our line of business was moving to Mexico (cheaper labor).  Our building ended up surviving another year and half after the news.  It was great until the time I found out I was getting laid off after 15 years.  Some sadness at the end but understood the nature of the beast."
good,Very good company with strong work ethic.  My employees were exceptional an formed a great team.  We all got caught up in a massive layoff as the company went from public to private ownership.

good,"Typical Day:  Sporadic work flow.  Call volume can be quick and fast incoming, or can slow down to where there is high availability."
good,It has been a great learning experience. Within the first week I felt ahead of the game. The team I was a part of was very helpful and  knowledgeable of the tasks I was responisble for. The entire building is very clean and orginized. It was a pleasure contracting with them.
good,Dell is a fantastic place to to learn and grow professionally. It has an amazing work culture and working at Dell is fun!!
good,"My normal day at work would begin with a nice cup of tea from our lovely pantry. On booting the laptop, I will have to work on a number of fresh briefing requests from Sales and resume with the otherwise on-going requests. A lot of mails go back and forth! I would to multi-task with my desk phone & hand held with Sales. Sometimes reports will have to be generated for my internal meetings with execs. Most days would have customer briefings scheduled so walking back and forth to my desk is natural. My feet hurt at the end of the day but I will be glad I kept moving."
good,The division I was in was contract based. Loved working there still hoping for a call back.

good,I enjoyed working there cause it gave me a lot of experience and exposure in field of customer service.
good,"They could improve on the way they lay people off by letting them know ahead of time and giving them help to find another job. The part about the pay, it was good when they did give raises, but when they did not when they were still making a large profit, saying they could not afford it. I think they still could of at least given a 1% across the board raise to show good faith to the employees."
good,"this is a very good place to work in, and even growth is offered gradually. i was here for a year and i enjoyed every single day of my work."
good,"Very professional and fun loving work environment with great people managers and amazing motivation which is the greatest asset in the organisation. Strategic and balanced work life.

good,"A typical day at work was regarding an odd client who was just demanding a new Dell laptop to be replaced with his old Dell laptop as there were debugging issues.The old laptop of the customer is not even under warranty period for availing service on call, however he was very aggressive and not at all exploring what actually was the issue with his laptop though i was continuously probing the issue.I had put him on hold for a minute with his permission and explained the whole scenario to my team supervisor,and upon his approval just went on with the call and assured the customer of resolving the issue however nothing would be replaced as the customer do not avail warranty for his product.I learned that DELL provides Minimal free support helping its loyal Clients even though the warranty service is not renewed.Dell priority is First its customers and then its employees.My co-workers were friendly,helpful as well as knowledgeable contributing to their fullest to our team.The most enjoyable part of the job was fun at work place during recession hours  such as Halloweens day etc,."
good,"Gotta own your own, reliable, roomy car. Packages can get pretty big to fit in a small sedan. I suggest a SUV, CUV, or hatchback. Always keep a set of screwdrivers with you. Attire is dress-casual; jeans and sneakers are good, wear a shirt with a collar on it, and wear them properly. You will be going into businesses and homes, so a good impression will be a lasting one. Do your job well, and each install will last 30 minutes tops. Pay is $10/hr, and it's part-time."
good,Learned a lot apart from the routine healthcare work. Good domain training and various other training's are also provided.
good,"If you love dealing with ambiguity and a challenging work environment, Dell, Inc. is the place to be.  Having worked there for 20+ years, I have the experience of always being challenged and not ever having the luxury of sitting on my laurels.  I've always viewed this as a huge strength as a company, it has enabled me to learn so much over the years."

good,"A well managed and a friendly work environment. A great learning experience that taught me teamwork and ability to perform as an individual too. My manager was a good leader who helped me and other team mates to the best of his abilities in order to bring out the best of all the employees. The hardest part of the job was coping up with rotating shifts as shifts used to change every two weeks, and the most enjoyable part was the great atmosphere at work."

good,"Working at dell allowed me to take additional classes for school, they worked well with my school schedule"
good,The first week on the job was a huge shocker for me. I'm accustomed to an IT atmosphere where knowledge is horded and guarded heavily. Everyone had that area of expertise they want to be solely responsible for in order to feel secure and needed. At Dell I was introduced to a much different (and healthier) atmosphere. Everyone here is quick to share knowledge and listen to input. Cross training is readily available in all areas. I've never felt so welcome to a team! We work together and share knowledge with each other. We are a system of cooperative IT members. It's hard to imagine any IT department ever wanting to be any other way!
good,It is a great place to work with where you will lot of opportunities to learn new things everyday.
good,"Working at Dell was fun, it was a laid back atmosphere for the most part as long as you were getting your work done.  It could be stressful at times, especially in chat support where you had to handle two chats at a time on a consistent basis.  Once you add in the amount of follow up needed on each customer account and documentation of every single email inbound and outbound that needed to be logged, it could be difficult at times."
good,This company is a great place to work. It is a fun and engaging place with great benefits. My day is never the same and things are always changing.
good,"11 days after my graduation, I was hired here at DELL and eventually I cope up working during night time. Everyday working serves as my learning experience because of the callers and cases that I am resolving, I need to work with INTEGRITY at all times and in everything I do Exhibit passion for SERVING THE CUSTOMER"
good,"Dell is a company of diverse people, these people possessed many talents. Fun to go to work."
good,"Free culture a lot, and not much interference from top management in work . managed processed and no flexible structure and policies."
good,Was a good company to work for. There was diversity in the work place and management did a good job of leading the different teams.
good,"This was a great company to work for. Daily tasks included answering high volumes of inbound calls from providers requesting information on patients' claims, benefits and eligibility.

good,Receiving incoming calls-creating orders-establishing long term business relationships. Learned Microsoft Productivity software. Management was solid all the way around. Co-workers were friendly and business oriented. Hardest part of day was cold calling. Most enjoyable part was always completion of the sale.
good,Every one of my co-workers in the Richardson that I came into contact with were excellent to work with. They were helpful when you needed information and listened when your had an idea or perceived a problem in a feature.
good,"Dell is a company which take care of their employees nothing less than there customers. Employees Work-life balance here is topmost priority. That's the reason we at Dell proudly say ""Its Home away from home"""
good,"Every morning I would come in and check to make sure we had all the master keys to the building before the last security guard was relieved. Then I would sign in and call the SSC and let them know I had arrived for my shift as well as signing in on paper. After that I would sit down at my desk and begin to set up all of my programs necessary on the computer including Skype, Email, Internet, Cameras, Badge program. Then from there I would email, skype or call corporate for interviews, or appointments all while stopping people at the door to check their badge if the card reader reads red. As second shift I would walk around the entire facility hitting check points with magnetic strips allowing my managers to keep track of my rounds and making sure I hit all of my checkpoints. You must complete your two rounds of tours before your shift is over."
good,"The management that the sometimes to place in the upper management are either too strict or too laxed and sometimes end up favoring other employees, I have been working here for three years now and almost two as a full time employee and it feels like I am not the ""favorite"" so I keep getting passed up on opportunity and/or raises.  I feel like I have done enough and go beyond my normal pay scale to receive a promotion or a pay raise.  But I feel that management is definitely holding me back even though they claim that isn't the case.  It pains me to say but I am currently looking for another position because of this reason."

good,Great work life balance. Amazing mangers. Worked from home 3 days a week and 2 days in office. Very focused on keeping the balance between work and home. I loved that if I was needing to work extra in the evening I could just log on and work.
good,"I loved working at Dell EMC and would love to work back at this company. The culture was great, it was definitely diverse, and the family and work balancing was just the way I would expect it to be (loose). Everyone wants to see you grow and be successful. If you want to switch positions and try advancing yourself internally, you can do this without a problem after 18 months of being in your present position."
good,"I started out as a SMB sales rep and ultimately became a Technical Sales rep, selling Enterprise level server and storage solutions.  I also became very proficient in the world of virtualization and cloud computing."

good,"I really appreciate the freedom we have working remotely. Being able to start the work day within a time range of 6:30 am to 9:30am... is fantastic! The benefits were great with the amount of PBA / Vacation and holidays given. I had been with Dell for almost 5 years and my part of Dell was acquisition by NTT data. Unfortunately, the contract with the client that we had for all that time ...is ending June 30th! I would still be with them if possible... :)"
good,Training and development is one of the strongest assets.  The people are great and easy to work with.  I have had the privilege working multiple roles in different cross-functional and enjoyed every challenging experience.
good,"The culture working at the OKC campus back in 2008 was pretty great...in Tech support and customer service.  You could smell the stress if you went on one of the sales floors.  However, if Dell liked you, they would bend over backwards for you.  They will train the heck out of you for whatever skills and jobs in the company you want to go into and they will fly you all over the world.  At least back then, they were definitely investing heavily in their employees in America and Canada.  I can't speak to how they treat their overseas call center employees or how they treat any of their employees now...no idea.  I will say try getting any sort of employment verification for past employment from them and you'll basically fail.  Their external HR numbers are dead ends."
good,I worked as an enterprise account executive at EMC before Dell acquired.  I enjoyed and profited from my years at EMC and can only hope that at least some of the old culture has transferred to Dell...I guess we will see.
good,"•	Handling content management in designing Dell Websites for countries Worldwide."

Our Management team always encourged us to get to the next level. The most challenging part of the job was weeding out the right contact to get these complex issues resolved in a timely manner in such a large corporation.

When there little or no orders then you had to keep yourself busy by cleaning, recycling, screwing something together or just organising your area for a busy time coming up.

We would start working in our original work place and then moved if help is need somewhere else.  Got to learn new things in different departments.

good,A typical work day at Dell was very unorganized and poorly managed. My co workers and I barely knew each other and it was hard to work on a team with them when we all worked remotely and no one wanted to do their job. The hardest part of my job was trying to please everyone who wanted me to do what they wanted me to when I only had one manager.

good,"Typical day on the job is busy and critical decisions are made regularly.  Confidentiality is mandatory and second nature.  There were several opportunities to learn new projects and work with cross groups.  The co-workers are very personable and ready to lend a helping hand.  I enjoyed working with the team members at the San Jose office the most.  Even when transitioning from smaller company systems and tools to large corporate systems and tools, everyone was very optimistic and flexible."
good,mangment  is like u have to manage all the things that surrounds you
good,Too difficult to get full-time.  Management and co-workers are great.  They supply the tools to help you reach your goals.  I love the atmosphere.
good,"It's a great place to work if you take initiative. Then, you will get the best opportunities on offer in terms of tools and languages. There is a lot of exposure in terms of recognition of skills and opportunity to share knowledge. The salary is a bit on the down side. A typical day at work is exciting with challenging goals that don't lead to consequences if not met after best efforts. I learned multiple skills, tools, frameworks and languages here. Management and workplace culture are a mixed bag. The hardest part of the job is meeting targets. The most enjoyable part of the job is the freedom given to choose our way of getting the job done and the collaboration and recognition that we get."

The company was well known for its innovations in supply chain management and electronic commerce, particularly its direct-sales model and its ""build-to-order"" or ""configure to order"" approach to manufacturing—delivering individual PCs configured to customer specifications.[6][7] Dell was a pure hardware vendor for much of its existence, but with the acquisition in 2009 of Perot Systems, Dell entered the market for IT services. The company has since made additional acquisitions in storage and networking systems, with the aim of expanding their portfolio from offering computers only to delivering complete solutions for enterprise customers"

good,It was a great time DELL. The IT industry was booming up when i joined Dell in 2004 and was quiet interesting and also challenging to speak with people just over phone..Employees were too good in the means of culture.The hardest part of the job is i would say only thing is that we need to work in the night that's against nature.In the daily life it is common to all ups & downs..The most enjoyable part of the job is Interacting with the people whom we had never seen them & They interact with us as if they know us very well..

good,"This company while it does give the employees free lunches, presents them with awards for jobs well done the work environment is very hostile,  The management team if they do not like you they will give you the worst job assignments and hours while giving the employees that they like the best job assignments and the best hours and if you question this then they will fire you. And the support team that is suppose to assist you with complex issues will not help you causing you to provide a bad customer experience which of course you are held accountable for any unhappy customer and depending on where you fall on the like/dislike list of management will determine whether you get fired or get to continue working for them."

good,"I cannot say that EMC doesn't have good work/life balance, because they really do. However, a lot of old standards from the early culture of the tech boom are still prevalent at EMC, especially if you work in any of the Massachusetts-based offices. Lots of unnecessary management positions, who are NOT engaged with employees day-to-day work, yet make all the decisions for everyone anyway. I worked for EMC for several years in a couple of different locations, and overall they do take care of their employees, but I'm leaving to look for something a little more...of this era."

The only thing is Dell prefers to hire temps and keep them temps for long periods of time with low or no chances of getting permanent positions with no paid time off or benefits.
good,"Work is pretty simple, either you will be an executive and spend a very busy day licking boots. Or you will spend it as a common guy doing a regular days work. I will say that I enjoyed working there, it was a very open atmosphere, co-workers were all mostly hardworking and management was ok, most of the time. What I mean by that, is they have poor communication skills between each other. So if you are trying to get into new areas you have to either know the other boss or network around."
good,Got a chance to work on different areas of both reporting and ETL
good,"It was good place to work."
good,"A typical day in the claims processing/adjusting is fast paced and enjoyable. I put on the headphones and get down to business.

good,The best thing about Dell is work culture. Policies of dell are good and employee friendly. But the management does not follow those policies.
good,I liked it very cool laid back. The employees were great to work with. Only concern I was part of management always seem like we were never on the same page. One hand not telling the other on what policies have been updated. Never tired to give helpful advice when needed. Very demanding due to always short on stuff so higher ups always work more hours then needed to.
good,"tested servers following written procedures."
good,Dell is an excellent company to work for.  I love my job.  The only issue is there is little room for growth in my department.  Someone has to basically retire in order for an employee to continue to progress in their career.

La cultura de trabajo que tiene es mucho más flexible que en cualquier otra empresa, nos fijamos los resultados y horas productivas, este modelo de trabajo es bastante funcional."
good,"Discover client needs and provide innovative solutions while maintaining and building strong client"
good,"Working here I found that there was alot of free time in between calls that would sometimes be a bit dragged out so there was time to be on the internet and for the smokers, you would have enough breaks to fulfill the need.Everybody got along with each other and for the most part very cordial. A real family type environment."
good,As a travel project manager it was awesome. Met great people and learned no much! It was a fulfilling role. Benefits were great. All expense paid housing. Round-trip ticket home each month with rental car.
good,Working at Dell was an enjoyable experience.  I put in a lot of hours to make up for disparaging work requests in different systems. The hardest part was ensuring that customers needs were being supported properly.
good,"It was a tough job and face paced with very demanding schedules and customers, but I excelled without any formal boot camp training and enjoyed the culture and the opportunity for growth."
good,Overall it is a great place to work but hard to get anything done as there are so many layers of management to work through.  People are willing to talk about advancement but not many are actually willing to help.

I was also a sales manager. I worked mostly in the DC area selling hardware, professional services and software."
good,"My first job and full of excitement. We all were the first batch for this new product and had great fun while training and on floor.. Dell, heard us in every way. Management was purely for their employee. Since we worked night shift and office was remotely located at that time, going to a restaurant was not so easy... So we have in our cafeteria great food. Food was simply amazing, this was way back, like 12-13 years back.. and we were served the best food... "

good,"Most of my work was to review engineer corrections to technical mistakes in instructional material. If the engineer's comments were not transparent, there were advisers who could help with explanations. I also did outlines of future training on the SAN hardware, using their SharePoint database. The training manager was very pleased at my research and outlines. the contract was for 3 months but Dell extended me to 6 months, which is the best they could do with their funding. This was a very intense environment, but the people were good team players."
good,"People say Dell is a difficult place to work because of work pressure,but people say anything and everything, there is nothing stopping them. Dell is one of the best places to work, though we might not be heavily compensated or we might not get the perks which are offered elsewhere I must say it has always been fun working with Dell though for a short time.

good,"I liked the workplace and the workflow as well as the work structure however the career planning and career progress felt stagnant in promotion path. I also found that certain managers had their favorites and didn't help or mentor those that they weren't fans of and it was a struggle to get back in the circle eventhough you could've been a decent performer in sales metrics. Dell has always been about ambiguity but, goals/targets change so much that it sometimes made comission and performing hard to hit as they tailored it to the need of the business that even the top performers struggled throughout the flux of change. I really enjoy the overall flow, style, and work regimen and style of things outside of this though sometimes managers focused on managing from their spreadsheets rather than coaching or teaching the ""technical"" aspects of the job."

Although overall the merger was smooth, there were some things not core to the Dell and EMC business that suffered, namely professional services.

good,"I can't say enough kind words about the corporate culture at Dell - they've given money to employees affected by natural disasters, gave me paid leave time when I needed to take the first quarter of the year off to have surgery and recover, and in general are a terrific company. The problem is that within my department it is easy to get stuck in the same position for multiple years. There are few opportunities for advancement and it is difficult to take one of those roles due to how many employees are vying for the same spot. Also added to the mix is the fact that phone support is limited in what it can do with regard to a customer's system. I personally can work with Group Policies and Active Directory, but our hands are tied when it comes to supporting the customer when they have needs related to those areas. We only recently have been able to officially help customers with malware removal, despite every technician on the floor having the skills and the tools to do so."

It was my first real job and I was so nervous but I overcame my fears and took control. Although I wasn't the supervisor all my co-workers listen to the plan and then execute which I loved working as a group. If they had a question I would have an answer. My boss was really awsome.

good,"Any good company challenges their employees to do their best all the time; EMC is no exception. The rewards are there as well. If you work hard on special projects, there are awards given to employees. I have met a lot of great people. We have challenging days, but at times we can sit around after work at a local pub and have a few beers to un-wind."

While we do not complete everything that is requested from us alone, it is our job to make sure that it is allocated to the correct people, and ensure that all requests are completed. This job is also very rewarding because you are able to see all of the positive impacts that you have on the organizations that you provide solutions for, and sell products to. Overall, Dell is a great place to work if you are willing to work hard, and if you can think outside of the box effectively."

People with families, outside interests, concerns about their communities, and our environment. Dell has become a socially conscious, diverse family. Internal support groups are in place to help employees navigate both their jobs and their lives.
