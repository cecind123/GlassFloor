Ran all processes pertaining to billing, payments, reports, printers and backups. I had a very supportive management team. All of my co-workers worked as a team and were always available for questions or concerns. The hardest part of my job was trying to pull information from callers when they didn't really know what their problem was. The most enjoyable part of my job was completing my nightly schedule with no issues and within time limits."

good,Time Warner has helped advance my career and offers a number of Networking opportunities that have allowed me to successfully add to my portfolio.
good,"My current job provides excellent learning opportunity and I developed my skills and experience in numerous different ways. While I already had some technical and customer service skills, I didn’t have any previous experience of operations and project management. When my employer re-established the Tap Audit department, they gave me the opportunity to undertake additional training so as to be able to work effectively with this. I was then able to put this training into practice on a day-to-day basis. I also learned a great deal about project management and teambuilding.

good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"This position was face to face customer service and sales. I liked the fact that there were many people to interact with daily and consistant learning as the industry grew and changed. The draw back was sales quotas. It was an added stress that was often unnecessary as the agents made those totals anyway. "
good,"A typical work day consists of getting to your desk in time to get logged into your phone system and getting all your programs pulled up on your computer to better assist you in your daily functions and then the calls begin,everyday is a new challenge because every call is a different situation so you are always learning something new and challenging to make each and every day different in some way so even though your job may consist of doing the same thing each day your actions are very different from day to day and having a goal to work towards every day makes it challenging and competitive among yourself and your co-workers which helps to keep spirits high and everyone on there toes.The hardest part to the whole job is dealing with customers or potential customers that want nothing more than to take out there whole day of frustrations on you and you having to remain professional and remember its not you personally and may not even be the company that has frustrated them but our dialer system has put us as the ones that called at the wrong time to catch the frustrations at its peak moment.The most enjoyable part of the job is also in dealing with the very same customers or potential customers and you turn that whole conversation around and the customer ends the call with you having made them very happy and maybe even got a chuckle or two from this same individual."

good,A typical day at Time Warner Cable involves interacting with customers who have questions and service issues with their accounts. This involved reviewing billing issues and solving service issues with their assigned equipment. I learned a lot about customers and delivering top-notch service. Management was always willing to help each agent develop to their fullest potential and grow with the company. My co-workers and myself learned from each other. We were always willing to help each other when there was an issue that one of us were unaware on how to solve. The hardest part of the job was learning how to quickly resolve any given issue. The most enjoyable part of the job was the challenge.
good,"I see so many people on here complaining about this job but I love what I do. Very good training and my supervisor gives me the tools and support to help me be successful. Hours are not bad and are flexible as long as you are performing. I get to know some really nice people everyday.

good,"They provided great discounts for cable & internet, 401k, tuition reimbursement, insurance, ect. Typical call center environment, hours were a little rough at first but, over time, seniority and stats helped in getting a better schedule. I didn't enjoy the mandated call flow, but again typical call center."

I've learned a lot about modern MPLS networking technology and Adva and Juniper routers.  The management is great, very easy going as well as my co-workers.  The hardest part of my job is trying to resolve difficult service issues for the customer, but it's a welcomed challenge.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the dynamic team at Time Warner Cable."

good,"A typical day at work usually consists of receiving incoming sales, billing and troubleshooting calls about cable products and services. I learned how to use my multitasking skills to be able to manage several systems and having to type at same time. The management here does everything they can to make their employees successful. My co workers are anywhere from 18-80 years old, easy to get along with and rarely complain about their work environment. The hardest part of my job is having to deal with back to back calls especially when 90% of the customers are upset. The most enjoyable part of my job is the fact that after only being here for 10 months I was able to be promoted to help train new hires."
good,This was my first job out of college and it's been a good experience. Great work culture and you cant beat the benefits.

I am constantly being asked to sit on calls with external clients, pull digital reports for campaigns and manage campaigns on day-to-day basis to ensure campaign effectiveness. My co-workers are a joy to work with. My 5-person digital team is very close and work really effective together. I am constantly learning from the team daily. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I am able to coach the Account Executives on digital campaigns and they are able to walk about with a better understanding. The hardest part of my job is being accountable for 20+ markets across the enterprise including Los Angeles and Hawaii being a huge part of that and not being able to work a full day with the team because of the times zones."

good,"I answered a minimum of 40+ calls per day."
good,I would always start my day off by scheduling appointments. After that i would go to see any appointments i had for the day. Once i finished up with my appointments i would ride around to scope out potential Clients.
good,A typical day at work is non stop calls coming into a que which does not allow you time for anything more than what you can do on a call for 7.5 hours. There is a Issue Trak ticket system for escalations so it does not allow the customer to know the anser right away on some issues and also hurts your FCR (first call resolution score) on your monthy report card. The numbers and statistics change from time to time and it is hard to get at the levels required to advance to another position. Also you are written up and put on a warning when you do not meet the numbers for a two month in a row period which could lead to termination within 6 months. It is a high pressured job.
good,"Benefits are excellent. Basic/classic TV services become are free, and internet gets boosted, upon request, to 2.0. Employees also enjoy a very nice healthcare package."
good,"Took incoming sales calls.Maintained and built our sales funnel with existing and new prospects. Manage communication with customers, schedulers, and construction teams via phone and email and messenger. Contributed in conference calls once a week. My co workers were awesome. No complaints. There was a management overhaul as i was brought in which left us without management for the first crucial month of employment. That was difficult to overcome. Making money working with good people and making meeting and exceeding customers needs is what made me happy."
good,"Working at TWC meant being part of a team.  A team where everyone knows everyone, and everyone helps everyone.  Come to work and be greeted by others in your team, take your seat and get ready for the day which will include fast paced calls from friendly customers, go to lunch with friends from work, then finish up your day."
good,Typical day at work is to be on the phone for eight hours. Co-workers are wonderful.
good,"I was responsible for supervising a team of 15 team-members, dealing with accounts receivable issues.

good,Great place to work with excellent benefits. Diverse work staff who are helpful and informative.
good,"My typical day was between 7am to 5pm. Had certain duties to complete daily which I did with 100% accuracy. My supervisors were great & allowed me to get my work done on a daily basis. My co-workers were also good, if needed help on anything just had to ask for help. The hardest thing about my job was, at times, I would over analysis issues to get them resolved. I enjoyed making sure that customers in-house & outside were happy and satisfied with the resolutions of their issues."
good,"Busy... Busy that was a typical day every day but i like it,working there i learn more how to work with computers and learning diagnostics and different programs. Management was good,co-workers were professional they new their job,real out going and friendly and respectable.Hardest part of the job it wasn't hard every time we get a new program they will train us real good or had classes or one on one training. I had fun working for the company and i do miss it and my co-workers..."
good,I take approximately 30-40 calls a day. I do alot of data entry from setting up new account for customers to fixing a problem a customer may call in for. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I have a customer tell me how excellent my customer service was and they wish I had a direct line so I could help them any time they need anything or had any questions.
good,"Very structured and professional work environment. Sufficient training and information provided to keep up to date. Very friendly co-workers and helpful. For me, sales is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Really a great company for a great sales person. You can make money very easy as long as you comply with the standards. Coworkers are all great.
good,"Company as a whole is a good company to work for, my call center is not very team oriented, although i was told it would be at time of hire. My days consists of using into multiple [order entry] systems while talking with customers. I assist with billing questions and claims, troubleshooting service matters, filing claims for damage reports, as well as organizing/scheduling for technicians to go to customers home. I hardly ever get the pleasure of working with my co-workers, but I am on a team of about 15 people under one supervisor. We have three managers who do not usually interact with the other Customer Care Professionals. The most enjoyable part of my day is knowing that I have assisted a customer through a problem that they were not able to resolve and making them feel better about the company as a whole. Tha hardest part of the day is explaining bill increases and changes to customers who do not agree with those changes. I try my best to assure them that we are not purposely trying to cause any hardship on them, but that we are simply moving forward with the business as a whole."

good,A typical day at TWC is very busy. Materials Management area's is the heart of the company. We supply all supplies that are needed for daily jobs. My co-workers are wonderful and I have learn the different work styles of the different areas. The hardest part of my current job is not having enough equipment to full fill impress levels needed for our install techs and contractors.
good,"It was a very busy work environment, which I loved. Extremely competitive. I learned excellent customer service skills, even befriending a lot customers. Most of my work day was unsupervised. I recieved continuous training. There were times a large amount of equipment had to be handled and inventoried. Mistakes were not tolerated, with cash or equipment. I became very attached to customers and co-workers."
good,"Intense sales requirements must be met in the sales department, even customer service is required to follow sales criteria. Strict attendance policy, High turnover as a sales based position is performance based. If you wish to move departments or positions, the internal recruiting is great, but if you are not on any coaching or documentation preventing progression. NO job matching, so make sure what you apply for is what you want to do for a while must be in position for six months before you can move up or out. Management overall is available with an open door policy. Hardest part of job is not perfoming at your best and no evaluation allowed to change positions to a better suited for where you may be better fitted. Sales department is the best position for upward pay, but fluctuates depending on leads. Money is great if you have what it takes! Company strives to have various opportunities to be involved in community and company functions."
good,"Based on my two year experience at Charter, it was great as far as answering phone calls and talking with customers. The managers and supervisors i believe could have been more helpful. Great work environment as far as the people who worked there. The pay was very good, but i have heard it has declined in that area."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Decent pay and clear paths to promotion. Job is generally easy. Management is very good at communication. Team based success. Scheduling may be difficult but favorable schedules can be earned when metrics are high. Time off is decent.
good,"We often have weekly meetings to discuss how we can better ourselves as an employee, top ranking and what we can do individually to rank as well. How assist customers to better the experiance also."
good,"Everyday you learned something new, especially new troubleshooting skills. Management was by the books, so as long as you reported everything you had nothing to worried about."
good,It was my first experience with the type of work we do at Spectrum but after awhile I really began to like my job and started getting a hang of things. I liked working and helping the individuals with their daily goals and working on their behaviors.
good,"Excellent place to work, benefits are tremendously rewarding. The employees are mostly willing to sacrifice their personal time to take care of the customer."
good,"In comparison to other divisions of Time Warner (became Spectrum after I left),the Hawaii component worked hard to be one of the premier regions in the organization. Very rarely were they at the top of the list with regard to providing funding for new services but always able to find a way to be one of the first to market. The employees are all very dedicated and its one big family. Upper management is willing to lend a hand and always there to have your back. A great place to work"
good,I truly enjoy Spectrum. The salary is impeccable and there are lot of great people to work with. The director is great and full of energy. It helps to lighten the mood
good,Charter Communications is a excellent company to work for.  They really care about their employees and the pay is great.  The leadership team works very well with each other also.
good,Exellent covrage in benefits and cool hardworking people that become like familly to you.good money when you go in with the right mentality job protection sux thoughts
good,Spectrum is a good place to work as far as the position that is was in. But that position no longer exists. I personally have not worked in any other department so I can not speak for others.
good,"My current job requires a lot of focus and attention to detail. It says a lot about a person when fellow coworkers rely on you for answers and resolution, because I am a get it done type of person. I am all about helping  others when I can and still focus on my daily tasks. I don't really want to leave, but I also want to make my family happy, and if moving and starting over is what it takes to make that happen, then I will need to look into another career."
good,SMB environment for supporting clients from Ocala to Pinellas county can sometimes be very demanding. Work with little or no supervision and you will be fine. Just get the job done! Watch out for storm season!!
good,Spectrum is a good place to work. You are able to gain knowledge and experience from your everyday work. The work life balance is good. It is not hard to take off work in advance if needed.
good,I have enjoyed working at Charter as they have provided an opportunity for those who work hard to be promoted within the company. I have also had the privilege of working under some very inspirational leaders.
good,Worked as a contractor. The people here are great to work with. There are a lot of people from different backgrounds. Spectrum has really nice office buildings. It takes awhile to get badge and system access. Old fashion. Parking is strictly enforced.
good,"I got hired on during my last trimester of pregnancy. I was really concerned about not being hired or losing my job due to my pregnancy, however, I experienced the exact opposite. My supervisors were extremely supportive and worked with me before, during and after delivery. I was sad I couldn’t continue there because for the job, the pay was decent and I enjoyed my coworkers a lot. They do have opportunities for career advancement, but it’s pretty difficult for most. There were a lot of amazing agents on the floor who had been with the company for years and knew more than some trainers and managers, however, they were denied promotions due to small technicalities, which IMO, is a disservice to the company."
good,"With all the recent changes with merger of 3 companies, it is still being figured out, but I would definitely recommend someone to work there."
good,Great place to work. Most leadership roles require you to be in Stamford CT office daily.  Lots of travel required as the company is broken up into 3 divisions.
good,"Great place to work, great people, but the work days are long. There is an abundance of opportunity and work to go along with it. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with modern technology, and the talented people that comprise the company. The hardest part of the job is meeting all of the demands within reasonable time frames, but with limited staff resources."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Working for Spectrum was one of the most rewarding jobs I ever had, too bad that I was unfortunate to have to resign at that given time but would love to return. really a fun place to work and make good money."
good,"Different shifts, but most days typically started at 8:00am at the address of your first scheduled job. You either install or troubleshoot the cable and internet services, and make sure every detail is up to spec, then head to your next job and repeat. Free time is spent helping other technicians. Good group of people, interesting work, free training, and promotion progression by taking free classes. Hard work, but satisfying."
good,"I enjoy working for this company. We have the tools we need and support from leads and supervisors to help our customers. The only reason I want to leave is because of the customers, the general public. If you are great at customer service and looking for a great company than this is definitely the place for you."
good,The sky is the limit with how much you can make with your sales. Unfortunately that's not all that it comes down to. You can make a huge income here I've personally met people making six figure incomes.

good,"A good place to work, have flexible hours.  The management was good to let you off if you had to be off or take off early..the management team works well with all the employees."
good,"I loved the company and management, Only left because the compensation was much too low for the responsibilities required to be successful in the role.. Was actually recruited away from them by one of their customers who did realize my customer service value. I Believe Spectrum could be SUPER successful if they doubled the compensation for the tech jobs, it would certainly attract the kind of Techs that would help the company shine.."
good,I really like the culture at Spectrum but the pay does not match the cost of living in Colorado. The benefits are 50/50 which means they make up for the low pay rate.
good,"Spectrum is a good place to work.  Professional, advancement opportunities.  Challenging work but obtainable goals if you work hard.  Great leadership and training/coaching."
good,Best job I have ever had. The people are great and treat each other great. Lots of activities going on for everyone. Management lest you do your job and removes roadblocks.
good,"Customer Service based work is relatively simple."
good,"Spectrum is an excellent company to work with. You got good benefits, grow opportunity, always compensate the hard workers, people is like a family, and always support their employees."
good,I enjoy the environment and team I work with.  My manager has been great assisting me to get up to speed.  My position provides flexibility and work life balance for the needs I have had.
good,I had a tremendously fun time working at then TWC. I had a great team and a focused support staff. The hours were not what I had preferred at first but then I grew to enjoy the shifts that I was on.
good,"It can be difficult to not feel left behind at Spectrum. Expect long hours and low pay compared to other companies of the same type. Their benefit package is fantastic, but the pay is not exceptional. If you like working independently, it can be a great job."
good,"The company does its best to value their employees. It does get very busy some days for the agents. Overall, I feel that everyone just needs  to remember that my office is a call center. The agents get paid to take calls. The leadership gets along with everyone fairly well."
good,Rather not say at this time other than it was very interesting and a experience that will be remembered. I don't have much more to say at this time.  I did learn a lot.
good,"it is a fast pace job you have to have thick skin when it comes to talking to customers. "
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support.

good,It was decent. Great pay & benefits & management wasn't terrible. I worked there right when they transitioned from TWC & left after a bad car wreck. I'd work there again.
good,Overall This is a great place to work. Communication sometimes get lost which makes it very stressful at times. Overall I would work with this company again. anyone looking to start a career  in leadership I would recommend getting started here. This company have awesome opportunity.
good,"Puntualidad, responsabilidad, caracter y actitud ante cualquier tipo de trabajo..."
good,"Working for Spectrum was very fast paced, communication is a virtue due to working with construction projects. Customer service is a must. Making sure everyone to include the customer is on the same page at all times."
good,"•	Handle inbound disconnect/downgrade calls from existing customers"
good,"Typically, I would log into 3-5 systems and then the calls would auto answer in my ear. I would then enter customers information and ask the appropriate questions to figure out the customers issue. Then id proceed to troubleshoot the issue over the phone while explaining to the customer what is needed from them. I would then set up a technician is the issue was not able to be resolved on our phone call. Also rescheduling technician visits if customer requested.Take appropriate notation of what happened on the call and proceed to the next call."
good,"keep you informed on the up to date info within the company. has a area where you can relax and wind down. video games, pool tables and cable television."

good,"The training was very good and informative. The pay and benefits was great including earning compensation. A typical work day is handling calls from customer on technical issues of their cable equipment such as cable box, internet services, and phone."
good,"spectrum is a great place to work, but its definitely NOT for the weak or people who are easily frustrated. This job is very high tech and the training is AMAZING! They will make sure you leave your transitioning class with all the essentials needed to succeed in your career with them.They treat their employees like ROYALTY! you will enjoy everything they have to offer."
good,"Very fun sales job. However, you need to make sure that the assigned turf is conducive to sales i.e. no gates, dogs, no solicitation etc. The technology is definitely getting better, which helps to compete against satellite companies."
good,"The job itself is easy to do once you go through training and learn how to use company software. However it can be a stressful and overwhelming as well. The vast majority of customers just want their issue resolved but you will be dealing with some very difficult customers as well. That on top of the repetition of the job . can really be exhausting mentally, but this is to be expected when your job is tech support over the phone. I was very surprised when I first started (I thought it was going to be a lot worse) but the atmosphere on the call floor was a lot more relaxed and lenient on the manager side of things, they are very supportive and understand  what we are going through because they higher within so %99 of the supervisors you'll have started out taking calls.  Lastly you have possibility to advance in company as long as you work hard and show up."
good,"Pays well, lots of room for advancement. Incentives to good performance, Great benefits and paid time off. Works closely with leadership and has plenty of support throughout your calls."
good,A day at Spectrum is always something new and different. You never know what kind of calls you will get that day but you come prepared to take whatever is thrown at you! The best part about working at Spectrum is the people you work with go through the same thing you do so they are the best support system you could ask for!
good,good company to start out at. has alot of friendly people and alot of help is offered when first starting out on the job. stressful at some times but overall a good career
good,This is my second family after 14 years I am as close to most co worker as my family. family friendly work enviornment. Understanding  management that will work with you. The benefits are great.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Charter communications will be a wonderful place for you to establish a career in customer service.  A company that changes to compete in the technology business is a place that I would like to retire from, thank you Charter!!!!!"
good,I learn a lot  from working here. Supervisor are good people to work with. Everyday working is different and you meet different people everyday.  Good benefits are available

good,"Great work environment, involved management, competitive pay, true team atmosphere, creative thinking is encouraged, great training, amazing benefits."
good,One is able to learn a great deal of the cable industry. A place where there are many different avenues one is able to apply their talent. One can advance at their speed when they have been in a position to show how knowledgeable they are in the position they hold.
good,"heavy call volume mixed with sales related inquiries and customer complaints. Strict guidelines to probe every caller with personal usage questions and pitch product from top to bottom. Strict schedule and break adherence. Hourly base pay plus commission. Good benefits and health coverage. Overall, call center agents seem glum, aloof, stressed and spends most of their break time venting about nasty callers. Occassional employee appreciation days including food and prizes helped the morale."
good,"If you can handle stressful calls this job is perfect. Great pay, great environment, and great training. The managers do genuinely care and the team environment is incredible. Made a lot of good friends."
good,This place is a great location for starting off you career.  Coworkers are always great.  The job likes to reward their employees for their hard work.
good,Great for a low activity person. The place is alot of stress and they dont really have wiggle room for full time hour changes. People will need to be ready to change their schedules to fit.
good,Every work day varies. Some days are busy and fast paced customer traffic others slow. Must be knowledgeable of the billing system and products to meet sales quota and goals
good,"Good benefits, gratis accounts services, friendly pace and professional environment to work,opportunities to grow within the company ,and flexible schedules to choose"
good,"Spectrum is  a great place to work, there is a lot to learn. I love it. What i did not like was the fact that they wanted me to move 600 miles away to do the same job i do right now, where i sit. This is a technology company, Why can't i continue to the same job where I am?"
good,"Working at spectrum as an inbound sales agent is not bad, it's just not something I see myself doing in future.  I am currently looking at other positions that will best fit me."
good,"This position was tough, but good...."
good,working in el paso call center was great when i first started. now the calls are too much and too little agents. pay is about $12-15 starting. other than that if you can handle a call center job its a great place to work.
good,I  would rather not share any of this information. I have only worked with this company for less than one year total so my review is somewhat irrelevant to this type of thing.
good,"I Enjoy my Job at Spectrum. It is a great company with plenty of room for advancement. I get to drive a company car to and from work and the fuel is free. I learned how to run cable, phone, and internet lines throughout multiple types of buildings. The supervisors are really cool. most of them used to be technicians themselves. While at work, if I am not in a customers home then I am usually by myself. The hardest part about the job is the work on the pole or strands 30 ft. in the air. the best part about the amount of knowledge I gained. learning about frequencies, signal loss, building layout. etc"
good,The only downside is you will never get weekends off. Being a parent that is important. You get two days off consecutively. The environment is fun to work in and everyone is extremely nice and helpful.
good,"This is an intense job which includes adequate training and good benefits. There were rewards and bonuses for good performance, chances to advance, and regular opportunities for meeting with those of higher levels."
good,"I absolutely loved working for this company. Though some aspects could be stressful at times like dealing with upset customers, I had an overall great experience. I would certainly consider working for this company in the future if the oppurtunity every arose."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Working here is an amazing opportunity. Great benefits and compensation. The workers and management know you by name and you're not considered a number when you work here. Everything about the atmosphere here is awesome. Plus with working here you get extra perks and they love doing extra curricular activities with their employees to get them involved.
good,Spectrum/Time Warner Cable was a very well rounded company to work for. Offered chances for advancement in employment. Provided educational training for job and resources for doing the job. Offered great benefits as well. Worked with all walks of life styles.
good,"Spectrum is a great place to work with amazing training. They truly help you learn everything you need in order to be successful in what you do. Environment was great, and there was a lot of help when you needed it. Downfall was just that you had to work one weekend day and it was hard to get different shifts."
good,I worked here for 8 years.  I loved this job but so did my managers which made it hard to get promoted.  Most people in management there stay for years.
good,Having worked for the company for 5 years I have seem a lot of changes. While it was sometimes hard to accept the new changes in the end the changes tend to make things better in the long run. The management at the call center is wonderful. Always ones to build you up to make you better rather than tear you down.
good,"My work experience with this company was very rewarding and I enjoyed it a lot. I learned a lot about the telecommunications industry especially that it is ever-changing and often exciting! I was given many opportunities for training and education that greatly improved my knowledge of computers and Microsoft Office programs. The opportunities and experiences that I had while working with this company helped me grow as an individual professionally, socially and emotionally. I had a lot of fun and my job was fantastic!"
good,Spectrum has great benefits and supportive staff that is there to help in any way possible. The management is excellent and the training is non-stop because communications is constantly changing

Since then I have been given the opportunity to learn and develop my leadership skills as a supervisor in  my department, The company has excellent benefits and offers available to employees."
good,the work environment is relaxed with very nice people who are willing to help you learn the job and assist you in any manner necessary.  the supervisors were nice as well and willing to assist you in any way.
good,A lot of work to do outside of school but a rewarding program. Working with the kids are great and a great learning opportunity. Must have initiative to keep up moral.
good,"greatest place to work,a lot ,great management,great benefit great learning experiences"
good,"Most days are pretty standard; taking calls and resolving issues.  Most customers are nice and friendly, but there are some that just like to give you a hard time. Management is helpful, and the other employees lend assistance if possible. Everyone is friendly for the most part. The hardest part of the job is not being able to resolve someones issue. The most enjoyable part is the appreciation you get from a customer when they recognize you've done all you can and they are still happy with you."
good,"-My team (of 5) receives ""cases"" from Sales Reps all over the Country; we go through the cases and either build the contracts that are sent out to the Commercial Clients or we process the orders after the Contract has been reviewed and signed by the customer."
good,Management will help in any way possible to assist you in succeeding.  Benefits are a very generous.  Job can get stressful at times but management has an excellent support system.  Hardest part of the job is trying to learn the system at first but then it gets easier with time.  Also taking numerous calls from irate customers.
good,Company treats employees very well and has wonderful benefits.  Job can be very high stress.  Schedule is pretty set in stone aside from the occasional required overtime.
good,Great place to work if you've had any previous experience with cable technical support. Great training staff & good management team. Overall an enjoyable place to work.
good,A great place to work. Company provides excellent benefits and good pay. Management found many ways to make everyday a fun place to work with incentives by the hour and month. Always a new way to make exyra cash along the way and very competitive commission structure. I would recommend this company to others in the sales field.
good,BHN was great. Spectrum came in and things  started to change. From our pay to 401k to things we could offer customers. They want you to sell on value but the almighty dollar still ruled
good,Education job that allowed me to help and develop a variety of personalities. Enjoyed being able to find a creative approach for each type of seller to be able to improve their methods for selling.
good,Fun work environment. Great for advancement. Great benefits. Medical. Dental. Vision. You can be a supervisor after working there 1 year. This is a nice job.

good,"My tenure at Charter Communications taught me a lot about the customer service field. The training was extensive,(and paid for!) and you always had continued support through management. There were many opportunities for overtime, and the benefits and pay were excellent."
good,"a typical work day would always consist of customer interaction.a technician is always on the move, from answering phone calls to speaking hands -on with the customer. I learned a lot about the telecommunication field such as:hooking up and setting up different TV's ,provisioning modem and routers, installing of cable boxes (digital and non-digital),installation of home theater systems and also security system along with home phone systems.My co-workers were great to work with always upbeat and cheerful.the hardest part of this job was keeping up with the new technology every other month.the most enjoyable part of the job was learning and keeping up with all the new technology"
good,its a nice place to work at with good people just feel like its time for a change in the field to go to a opportunity that will let me progress more but its a great company
good,"Overall management is great, Time Warner Cable has built a great culture for their employees to, learn, grow and advance within their company.  Being a Customer Service Professional entailed working with the general public about various issues including, billing and general troubleshooting of TV, internet and home phone.  Call center life isn't for everyone, so turnover is higher, but the employees are always supportive and helpful."
good,"I loved working for Time Warner Cable. However, we were recently acquired by Charter Communications and my future is very much up in the air."
good,"Time Warner is a great environment to work in everyday. The company really takes care of each employee and you feel at home every morning when you walk in.,"

It is a fun working environment with incentives and rewards for hard work and performance. They offer PTO and Paid vacations as well as wonderful benefits and wellness opportunities. They also strive to have family activities and volunteer opportunities.
good,"I loved Charter, Great people, and Management. I love the fact that you can make your own schedule due to the shift bidding and the performance based scheduling so your performance determine your off days and work life balance. Just wished it paid better, the commission structure changes often so you can perform the same level of expertise but in six months you can be paid up to $1,000 less."
good,interacted with many different culture and langages. spoke with people from nation wide. learned how to troubleshoot cable boxes and routers.
good,"This has been the best job I have ever had! It can be stressful, you just have to remind yourself that you need to remain positive! You do have to be able to multitask and think quick! The pay is great! You get commission on top of the pay!"
good,A typical day at charter was always different. You never knew what kind of people you were going to talk to on the phones that day but thats what made it great.

good,"Fun company"
good,Time Warner Cable is a great company to learn and build a career with. Their direct sales department is built to bring in incremental business and is focused on direct to consumer via personalized face to face experiences. They had a great compensation plan that paid well on bundled products.
good,"Field techs generally get promoted on their own pace. Its a great job, but they may have you working over an hour and a half from home. The one hour arrival time does suck, because even as you drive to your next job, it eats away at that time you have. Besides that, if you enjoy working alone and enjoy the pressure, this place is for you."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Everybody I work with is amazing, Management is by far the best I've experienced. Most days are fun, but some calls do bring the day down depending on how that person treats you."
good,When I say excellent job benefits I am not just talking about cost of TV service.  The health insurance is exceptional.  Fair price and you can go to any specialist and get fixed up.  I wish I was back!!
good,"Assisting customer with payment "
good,Charter is a fast paced competitive employer with tons of advancement opportunities. However the drawback is that in Wisconsin the weather is less than favorable without being 20 feet in the air on a ladder in the snow.
good,Productive and engaging workplace with an employee focused culture. I am happy to be a part of a company that drives employee development and doesn't hesitate to assist with balancing their work/home priorities.

good,The company provided solid management. Excellent benefits. Good leadership and provided direction for growth. The culture was one of family. A days work was structured and strict. Attendance was priority and manning the phones was a strict requirement. They did not pound numbers but they watched activity. Though the company was strict and was obsessed with good attendance they rewarded talent very well in their pay structure.
good,"Working at a Charter School alone was definitely an adventure that I will never forget. Unlike public schools, Charters strive on academics that go far beyond books and lectures. When you are a Charter School Teacher you wear many hats and fulfill many roles. "
good,"This had to have been my favorite job! The people were wonderful, The pay and benefits were sufficient for each position. There were bonuses and sales intensives and a positive feeling throughout the call center. I was advanced from a customer service representative to a call center supervisor within 6 months. I enjoyed helping to reach customer satisfaction with each escalated call. I was also trained in setting up new digital phone lines and worked directly with other service departments. The hardest part was when a customer's issue was not able to be resolved immediately. I enjoyed the follow up but felt bad for the customer that they would have to wait for a resolve."
good,Time Warner Cable is a great place to advance into a decent paying position - good incentives and overtime allowance.  Great training programs and job relocation programs.  Many different opportunities with call centers all over the country.
good,Time Warner Cable remains to be on the cutting edge of technology. Great company for career advancement in all fields. Professional development is highly recommended and promoted.
good,"I've never felt the type of camaraderie in a work place such as this one. Most jobs have a chain of command, as we do here, but the director has an open door policy and I don't have to worry about first seeing my supervisor. I can't say enough about my director and managers as they have certainly made me feel like I am a valued asset to this company. I have learned a lot about data connections and even a little bit about the social nuances of communicating with the customer, as they are proponents of putting the customer first. Hardest part of my job is knowing that I will never move up from what I am doing now. Although I feel very positive about my management here, I still feel there are politics involved to the point where not just me, but other well qualified people (more than myself) are sometimes overlooked for an unknown reason, also with my commute to the workplace, 12 hours of my day is about my job. The part I enjoy the most are the people I get to call my co-workers, and yes, the food. At least 2-3 times a month they will have some sort of event/activity which breaks us from the everyday routine and provide food. Glorious food. ""The way to a man's heart is through his stomach""."
good,"Time Warner Cable				        "
good,Place of improvement and growth within a company. Great benefits and Job functions. Job outings and cook outs. Yearly raises.

good,Great company to work for! Cares about their employees. Very nice work environment. Promotes a positive brand image with the hello friend campaign.
good,"Fast paced, fun and friendly environment. I would say the culture embodies a ""WORK hard so that you can PLAY Harder"" concept. People are really committed to their jobs and this is a place where the job is committed to the people. The hardest part of the job for me was getting over the training curve outside of that Charter was an awesome place to work. The benefits package is amazing & if you're lucky enough to work @ the corporate office, the cafe' is a REAL treat but the work out room is the cherry on top!"
good,"I have learned a great deal in my time here, and there is still so much to learn.  Just a fun place to work with a lot of freedom."
good,"I worked with many people, from sales to administration on a daily basis.  At the same time, I spoke with vendors, visitors and customers.  What I have learned about my job is the many facets that the company is involved in.  Also, giving back to the community was a big driving force.  The hardest part of the job was when you learn something new but the patience and personalities of the trainers made it easy."
good,"Great benefits, great environment, the position itself is kind of stressful. Not necessarily the greatest position for somebody who is an introvert, or has difficulty in situations where there is a lot of pressure from an outside source."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"

good,Solid opportunity for employees.  Excellent benefits to encourage longevity.  Very sound product and lots of chances for advancement.
good,Management here is amazing. At times this job can be difficult and require you to be fearless in sorts. Otherwise was a fun experience. Benefits were also great. My only complaint is the pay is not to impressive.
good,This is an exciting opportunity for any multi-media journalist looking to take the next step in their career.  Alums have moved on to some of the biggest stations/markets in the country.
good,"I liked working at Charter Communications , you get great benefits, some of the staff is unproffesional but you look past that. you also get a company to cater to the employees everyday"
good,"The service that is provided to customers via cable service needs to be updated.  Makes the working enviroment harder for the employees to ease the customers, the pay does not fit for the type of service that is needed for Time Warner Customers"
good,"Competitive, retention, sales environment, Must retain Time warner customers wanting to cancel services, there are a lot of games and incentives going on. Fun environment"
good,"job is excellent, coworkers are good. management can be better. enjoyed working and schedule. i learned a lot took online college courses."
good,"Charter is a great place to work especially if you love working with people. Shift bids determine your shift, but other than that you'll enjoy working there with out a hitch"

good,Great place to work.  Great coworkers as well as management.
good,"Time Warner Cable was a very energetic, fun and extremely high call volume environment. The co-workers were very open and team oriented and great to work with. Management were available, but not very supportive in helping the department meet goals. Due to the extreme high call volume, we were ask often to for go scheduled break times to meet business needs. This often caused issue with meeting personal needs at times. However, we were often compensated with monetary rewards."
good,great place to work if you are a sales person. easy going work environment and great staff
good,"Install, service, and disconnect residential Video, Data and Voice services."
good,"At Time Warner Cable there were tons of opportunities for growth.  The benefits were out of this world.  I have yet to find a company with better benefits.  Most of the management is very down to Earth and they keep you updated on all changes and issues.  Communication with management is great.  I loved working at Time Warner Cable.  Although, the call center environment can be very stressful.  Time Warner Cable tries to find ways to make it more fun and enjoyable with incentives, contests, and prizes."

good,"The job was reasonably fun to work at in the begining after the announcement of the merger with Comcast the pressure on the retail sales personal became very stressful. My co-workers and I got along very well no matter which office I worked in. The hardest part of the job was trying to comfort a customer  who was given bad information from the call center it was very stressful but the end result could be rewarding when a customer was satisfied by your solution."

A typical day would consist of taking inbound calls and assisting the customer base in many different ways. Like a typical call center there are different departments with their respected responsibilities. I learned a lot while working for this company; patients, improved communication skill and many more things. I was able to work with a great team of hard workers and all of them were dedicated to the highest level of support. The hardest part of this job is either receiving billing related calls or helping a customer with very limited understanding of services or computer systems. The most enjoyable would be the people I worked with or the benefits. Bright House has great insurance and perks like discounted services working and living in a service area."

good,"I held many hats during my tenure with Time Warner Cable. I have attained skills that will carry me to my next job. I had done the following during my time with Time Warner Cable: Data Entry, Customer Service both by phone and in person, Record Management, Supervising, Created Reports and started new projects from the ground up. I enjoyed my time with Time Warner Cable but due to my job function being regionalized I decided to move onto a new chapter in my life. I am a hard worker, dependable, reliable, easy going and willing to take on new task. I knew nothing of the cable industry before starting with Time Warner but I have this knowledge but I want to be challenge to learn something new."
good,Working at TWC provided troubleshooting and problem solving daily. I learned how to properly give great customer service and provide a sense of knowledge to the consumer. Management was always helpful and ready to teach when needed. My coworkers were friendly and reliable. The hardest part of the job was making sure that the consumer was pleased when the call ended. Every aspect of working with TWC was rewarding and enjoyable.
good,"Answered calls as well as completed admin task. Trouble shooting, billing and customer service was a must."
good,A great place to work when you need a part-time job or if you want an entry level position and want to move up in the company!
good,"I spend each day installing/maintaining computer network infrastructure, in office buildings. This is professional work environment where quality standards are important."
good,"A good place to work, and they offer free cable. My coworkers were great I'm still friends with many of them. Of course, working in a position where you have phone contact with the customer base has its draw backs that is a small price to pay for this job."
good,Meeting with the team was absolutely nice cause we gave feedback to each other and the company always gave us a heads up with everything new that was going on with the services.
good,"In a place of business where the main priority is providing the highest level of customer service possible, it can get stressful fast. Using that to allow yourself to grow is the best thing you could possibly do for yourself in a tech support position. Luckily, this company and department is there to support you as well. The fair benefits and fun events make it a place where you want to be. The guidance and support from management makes you understand that they do value you as an employee. Use the knowledge and personal growth to your advantage while working here."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Great company just not my idea career. As a computer tech I would rather be hands on with troubleshooting and repairing complex problems. Company moral has been decreasing recently.
good,"I've been working for over 30 years at different places and Spectrum feels like they actually care about you as a person. "
good,"It was a pleasure working there. The atmosphere was very fast pace and productive. Your surrounded by people that enjoy what they do. When you are surrounded by motivated people, it just gives you great energy. Even on a bad day."
good,"The best thing about working for Spectrum is the culture. Everyone is friendly and willing to help, and you will never have a time where you cant get the help you need. Great pay and benefits, and discounted cable services are huge benefits as well."
good,the typical workday is you work 4 hrs a day and you manage to work in rush hours where it is really busy. the culture in the workplace is quite good since everyone is friendly and helps each other.
good,"Spectrum is a great opportunity to help yourself grow as an individual because it challenges you everyday with different unique situations that customers will present and it gives you an opportunity to help make a positive impact for them as well. This job will be easy if you’ve had a history with electronics but it can challenge you with the dynamics from each customer. The hardest part is dealing with customers who don’t understand how technology or electronics work so they can get upset or angry as a result, but you get a fair share of each type of customer throughout the day."
good,I enjoyed my employment with spectrum. If I did not relocate with my family I would still be employed. The work culture was great. You received acknowledgment for meeting and exceeding your goals. The benefit package was great including free services to your home address. The management was very relatable and well respected.
good,"Really great company, you get a company phone, a van to take home daily. Only go to office once a week for a meeting and restock equipment. Supers are good dudes. It’s competitive for rankings."
good,"The company makes an effort to retain employees and keep everyone happy. Nonetheless, this type of job can be stressful and not everyone is suited to it."
good,I love working at Spectrum but when they say the c stands for change they are not kidding. In the time I've worked there we've had extreme changes that have not only changed the way we do the job but just about everything. You get yelled at by customers a lot sure but that never bothered me. My supervisors have always been amazing and I think the people are really what makes the job great. The thing is a lot of the recent changes have changed my outlook on my future at Spectrum so sadly I'm looking for another job. But truly if you can handle the stress of the job its definitely worth it.
good,"The people here are terrific and the atmosphere is great.  They definitely respect the co-workers, employees. You can move up and/or around the company if you wanted.  Laid back atmosphere with structure."
good,My group was very tight knit. I would expect other groups to be easier to integrate into. That being said they absolutely value experience over all. Expect to prove your skills before you are given high priority tasks.
good,"very good job and amazing people to work with and there is so much room to grow in the company. Management was really good to, my boss was strict by very fair and honest."
good,"A typical day for a normal 8 hour shift will include two paid 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute unpaid lunch. "
good,"Good company to work for if you need a job or maybe want to grow with-in the company. The people are really nice. Free Cable, internet, and phone. Excellent benefits. Pay is OK if you are really good. But, only top performers make good money (average probably about $2-3k in commissions depending on your shift; not including any bonuses or base pay). But, much like a lot of other sales jobs, if you are a mediocre or average seller you probably won't make that much money. You have to really hustle. The commission structure they changed to after they bought out Bright House is bad; really bad. They lost a lot of their top sellers because of it."
good,Spectrum was able to give me a wonderful working environment with an amazing super visor. I was always happy to wake up and tackle the word day. Dealing with people daily really advanced my people skills and thats something i am happy to take away working there!
good,I left the company before Spectrum took over. I am not able to really comment on the way the company was ran once Spectrum took over. I was there when it was still Time Warner
good,Independent work environment with a great cast of team members. Long days sometimes but easily to get used to. Work from your van that is assigned to you.
good,it was a great place to work.  financial compensation is not as i would expect for the work and time needed to get the day to day work completed. Schooling is available for job advancement.
good,Spectrum has a ton of great people to work and grow with. The job itself is a bit stressful but with the right people by your side its bearable. I grew more as person and learned invaluable communication skills.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,It was a very well kept place to work the learning curb was there in the time of nee management have an open door policy hardest part of the job was not getting the call done on the first call resolution I enjoyed helping because I feel I was put on this earth to help people jut to make everything just a little bit easier for them.
good,"Spectrum was a cable company , quota was a requirement & the TV was an optional advantage. You have to be able to show the product that you are trying to sell. Benefits & insurance were very good."
good,A good place to work and create a career in within. Good managers and the possibility to learn. Spectrum has a very laidback environment and kind of slow pace environment.
good,"I am enjoying working at Spectrum. However, due to starting Nursing school on September 27th, 2018; they are unable to work with my schedule.  I would need to work overnight to allow me to go to school full-time during the day.  Other than that, Spectrum is GREAT!!!"
good,You can make your own schedule and make your own money.  Management is very supportive when you need help.  Many advancement opportunities is if you work hard.
good,Fun atmosphere with the managers and coworkers..Great place to learn and grow with the company. The company is always giving out prices to their employees.
good,Started spectrum recently and I love it everbody there is helpful when it come to the job they don't play about attendance and the training program is great and not to fast-paced.
good,Spectrum is a steady pace environment with great management. Each call center within the Tampa area focuses on a specific line of business. They also have a great compensation package.
good,Yes the amount of calls and type of calls you receive is a bit overwhelming but you have great support from your leadership and from your peers. The work environment is great.
good,I like spectrum.  They are a good company and they care about their employees.  They have good benefits.  We get 2 weeks vacation to start with and theres always a raise every year.
good,"Good job for young people.  Great for people looking for experience, for those who love to talk on the phone and help people out with issues. Must be willing to accept customers yelling sometimes and being rude."
good,Overall Time Warner Cable was a great place to work. The party and the befits were awesome. It was relaxed. The environment waa terrific. The only thing I didn't like was when they were bought out and switched over to spectrum. That's when things got bad.
good,"Spectrum provides great pay and benefits to its employees. Job is minimal work, sitting at a desk all day. Phone calls can be very stressful along with staring at a computer all day. It takes a while to get a shift that fits your personal life needs. Shift selection is all done on how you rank as an agent."
good,"Month end close was the busiest part of the month with anywhere from 8 to 12 hour days.  However as staff became more knowledgeable and efficiencies were gained, close days were usually only 9 hours.  The culture is tough but fair.  They expect you to be able to work independently, but not spin your wheels.  The accounting management team is fantastic.  Most departments are wonderful to work with.  A definite family environment is created, but there is still a strong expectation of high performance and professionalism."
good,Working at Spectrum you receive the best training before you start even take a call. The benefits are excellent as well and there is also a gym on site
good,Wonderful and friendly co-workers. Fast paced supply chain environment. Great health benefits. Company perks with free cable. Good Managers. Good vacation accrual.
good,Good people. Good benefits. its a great job for anyone willing to do call center work. defiantly a place where you have space to grow and move up in the company.

good,My experience with this company was when it was Bright House Networks.  I was let go when they merged with Charter.  I enjoyed my time with Bright House.
good,As a dispatcher for Spectrum your technicians are expected to meet  hourly time frame appointments. I covered to Ontario East/ Corona truck yard along with 5 other Dispatchers.
good,It was a good place to work. The free cable was nice also. I liked the vans that they let us drive. I did like that we were out there on your own and could work at the pace we wanted to
good,"Time to yourself makes for less stress. Good pay, some days longer dealing with certain conditions and customers. When you get your check, it all seems worth it."
good,"Fun job, unlimited commission where you really can reach whatever goal you set. Competitive and exciting at the same time. Great benefits, free services and discounts everywhere."
good,"Since this review requires my input about Charter Spectrum, I can only say that their acquisition of Time Warner Cable purged extreme talent from the Time Warner Cable leadership which was unfortunate.  Whether that was the right decision is yet to be known."
good,This was a great job. You get a lot of benefits and freedom. You don’t have someone always looking over your shoulder. You get your own work van to take home every night. this is a great career for someone that is self motivated.
good,"I am a former Time Warner Cable employee. We are still transitioning over to Spectrum, I would imagine the transition will be complete in about 12 months. Many things have improved overall, the insurance & deductible is the biggest difference to me. The deductible is high no matter what plan you are on but once its met, 90% is covered by insurance."
good,"I have been with Spectrum (Formerly Time Warner Cable) for 14 years. As Time Warner Cable, this has been a great place to work. It felt like home. A great team of people to work for. The benefits are great."
good,I love working here but the pay is not enough to get by month to month staff and clients you grow and get to love them and definitely a job you grow in
good,"Great place to work with great co workers and management staff, very relaxed atmosphere. Great benefits like free services and very very affordable healthcare."
good,"We used to be a team work, I learn different way to work  everyday was look the same but wasn't  everyday I learn different things  because  was different situation, the management was really good."
good,"Starting as a DSR I made more money than I ever thought imaginable with out a degree, I worked a flexible schedule with plenty of time to spend with my family and had fun closing sales!"
good,management was very knowledgeable and cared about the person. the commission was very good and fair. good breaks good place to work. we had team builders and were always had positive feedback about our work
good,"This is a great place to work and I love it there. Really love working for my manager, but since being bought out by Charter I am not sure of the changes that are coming."
good,I loved working in the fast paced environment. Lots of fun and friendly competition for incentives. Time Warner Cable has been sold to Charter and is not the same fun environment. However it is definitely a great place for growth.
good,Great people. Great opportunities.  Dedicated to being the very best in the industry.  Hire very talented people and continue to grow them and promote them.
good,"TWC was a great place to work as a technician, very competitive and very nice people to work with. I got to meet very nice and interesting people threw out a normal work day customers or non customer."

good,"Good company to grow with and gain many different skills that come in handy, teaches great customer service skills as well as communication and organization skills. "
good,"A typical workday would consist of logging into my PC, and answering the phones to assist customers with various technical issues involving phone, High speed data, modems, routers, and other connected devices. The hardest part would be managing upset or sometimes irate customers. The hours and work days were flexable enough for myself to be a full time employee and student at the same time. I had the option of five 8hr shifts, or four 10hr shifts, and was able to shorten my day by cutting my unpaid hour lunch in half, taking that 30 minutes off the beginning of my shift. Certain technical certifications would increase your pay by $1 per hour each. The benefits are amazing, 401k, medical/dental/vision, not to mention all services are free as long as you live in a servicable area. I eventually quit because sitting at a desk all day is just not for me, but I would jump at the chance to work for this company again, even if it meant another desk job."
good,"Time Warner Cable is an excellent company to work for, with a wide variety of positions to choose from. During my time there, I received the training and professional sales experience to work in almost any industry & developed a multitude of positive working relationships with upper management, coworkers and residential customers. The most difficult part of the job was sitting for long periods of time and working under extreme micro-management. The most enjoyable part of my job was problem solving and helping customers customize the services that best met their unique needs."

good,Great place to work with lots of opportunity.  I have worked here after Insight Communications was bought out by Time Warner Cable and they have been nothing but good to me.
good,"Tons of room for growth within the company.  A typical day at work includes an average of handling 60 unique calls a day. Calls you will experience are inquiring about customer billing, video, phone, and internet repairs. The most enjoyable part of the job is making customers happy and learning more as you go along. One thing that is sure to happen no matter what is that things will change constantly."
good,Working the phones was very interesting how you get to test your listening and customer service skills dealing with all types of customers and focus to get their service back on track.
good,"its was alright to work there work day was hectic but manageable."
good,"Great company! Room for advancement, and growth. Building long lasting relationships internal and external. The company provides great training classes that can be used within the business also in your personal life, Bright house Networks provides a faucet of opportunities, great incentives, and an awesome Christmas party, and an event for both family and friends once a year. The downside most areas of the company requires sales, if sales isn't your expertise and this is an area you know you will not enjoy, make sure you ask lots of questions during the interview phase."
good,"The time and hours you work is based on performance."
good,"Answered phones assisting costumers with their internet and telephone services, I've learned how to do various things on the computer while communicating on the phone with costumers and how to work with different systems."

Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"You go to your first job and install or trouble shoot. It might take you 30 minutes or might take you 5 hours. Its all how you apply your self and what you make of it. It can get really frustrating and hard at times but it a job. You install cable outlets in houses, telephone modems, cable boxes, internet modems or wireless internet. You have to get a pretty heavy ladder and put it up on poles and run cables to houses and it has to be in specification. The trouble calls can be really simple or you might have to call a supervisor to help you. If you love overtime, its not hard at all to get a lot of it if they are allowing it at the time. When I was there they let you test up to a not only higher level of knowledge but pay as well. They pay really good in my opinion. And they had commission when I was there and that was really easy and consistent money to make. Your team members are very friendly and nice, and always usually ready to help you if you need help. The best parts of the job was they let you take the company van home, they pay, the discount on your cable bill, a lot of room for advancement. The worst is working in the very hot or very cold, and in crawl spaces, and in attics."
good,"Bright House Networks is a great company to work for. Benefits are good and compensation is up to par, although one can argue that there is always more to be desired. It can definitely be a fun and enjoyable workplace with fast pace and plenty of challenges along your career path. Opportunities are there for grabs, but must have patience and the will to change and learn along the way. The perks are also great and free cable and internet is always a plus. I give it my two thumbs up!"
good,"I work in a call center so I go to my desk and log into my workstation. "
good,good company to work with miss the people. had met lots of new faces and enjoyed working with the customers.
good,Time Warner Cable values it's employees and the benefits are great! I would have neverconsidered leaving the company as long as I was in an area where they were. They have many LMS courses that keep you up to speed. Management works hard to get you where you need to be to succeed. I really enjoyed working for this company. My co-workers were like family away from home.
good,Everyday is a new learning experience.  Management is great.  The people there are wonderful.  Its a family-oriented environment.

good,My current job isn't an easy job and it takes a lot of hard work and dedication. It does has it's good and bad side about it. I love going to work seeing my co workers. I learned how to sale and assist customers for what it is they are wanting. The hardest part of my job is not being able to close a sale when you know you did you best. The thing I love about my job is how it has so many discounts and benefits to their employers.

good,"If your not up for selling products not the idea job. The benefits and career advancement options are great. I wasn't happy with doing schedule bids and working til 11pm and on Holidays. Scheduling days off no later than two weeks in advance, sometimes emergencies happen. Secondly having to schedule your sick time. How can you plan when you are sick?"
good,"Typical day on the job, Starting between 7:00 & 7:30AM, taking care of customeer, both internal and external. Making sure my teams needs were taken care of, meetings until about 4:00PM and then resume my normal duties until about 7:00PM."

good,"Great place to be. Always busy and on to the next call. Co workers were friendly,and there were always ways to earn bonuses"
good,"Free food almost every day, excellent health care. The compensation was average, but the health care, vacation time, tuition reimbursement defeintely makes up for that. The attendance rules are too strict. You will get punished if you are sick even if you have sick time. So you have vacation, but it's hard to use."
good,I really did enjoy working for Time Warner Cable and am very upset that i did leave and go somewhere else just was a bad and worst decision and i was put into and just felt i had no choice but to leave.
good,"A typical day at work is ok. Every day is honestly the same, which, gets boring at times. The days just blend into each other. The company is great all together. Everyone is cool to work with and even though there can be some agitating customers there are always more good ones than bad ones. The hardest part about working here is having patience, sitting down for hours, its so easy to get frustrated but I always bring a book to read or something to draw on.

good,"I really enjoyed working at spectrum, great management and work culture, if possible I would love to go back there and be able to be successful again, love it!"
good,"Spectrum is a very busy call center that involves sales from the moment you clock in to the moment you clock out. You quickly learn sales tactics, and learn how to persuade customers as to why they should buy from you. Management is very strict on attendance and hitting specific numbers for certain products. Sales is not option you MUST produce!"
good,The company has been very good to me and it is a great place to work. The culture at the Zanesville Call Center is the best I have ever encountered. The people are all willing to help.

good,A typical day would consist of chatting with various customers modifying the order or setting up new services.  The management is great here they go out of their way to make sure you are taken care of.
good,"Awesome place to work if you can handle stress from people over the phone. Easy all you do is take calls and make a sale. Basically if its not a sale; get it off your line ASAP. Problem is: a lot of junk calls but you have a good opportunity to make up for those trash calls if you have a silver tongue."
good,Time Warner does a great job in training and preparation for their employees. Promotes within first. Professional environment. Straight forward on polices and proceedures
good,A typical day at work is busy helping other reps and sometimes customers with frustration but all in all a great team environment with lots of free food and other incentives as well as outstanding management.
good,"It really is a fun place to work if you can separate work and personal life. Also if can handle irate customers and not take the calls personally then you will be a good fit. It is fast paced so you got to be quick, but you have the support of your team and managers which is awesome."

Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Of course, if you have a personal connection with someone you trust who works at a company, you might wonder whether you still need to look at employee reviews. The answer may be personal and depending on the relationship you have with this contact, but at the same time, it can't hurt to get a sense of what others say. If for no other reason than to assess morale and the overall feeling of others you'll be working with, it's helpful to get a sense of what other people are saying."
good,"The job had to many variables where I was not able to make contact with most people and even attempt to make a sale, Getting chased by dogs and having guns pulled on you just wasn't for me."
good,Culture is great with good leadership you can advance quickly to leadership positions. The workplace culture makes you want to work everyday and the pay makes it an enjoyable place to work.

good,Working outside was new for me but I figured I will give it a try. I didn’t know what challenges I could face until the first week of working there. It was TERRIBLE for me I hated every minute of the job. I am a customer service person I love interacting with my peers as well as customer and I was working alone. I didn’t under what I signed up for until I worked my first day outside. It was referred to me and my husband so I gave it a try. I loved one of the ladies I worked with. She was the one who referred me but if you are not an outdoorsman don’t do it. Management was good and understanding.

The main feature of this site is that you can compare prices from other travel booking sites, and see how much you can save. They offer savings up to 65% and it’s no joke: our staff stayed at the Marriott in Omaha, Nebraska for 5 days for just $600 per person, which came out to be about 60% better than what Expedia offered. Our company saved thousands of dollars through this site in one trip. For small to medium-sized businesses, these kind of savings can mean the difference between thriving and only getting by."

I was thoroughly trained in a classroom prior to stepping foot into the call center. All members of management are incredible, and do nothing but strive to get the best out of each employee.

good,"Dealing with a large number of angry customers over service or billing mainly. My position was to maintain current customers, listen to their complaints and help them with their concerns. Upselling other services offered within the company, cable, telephone, internet. The hardest part of the job was to find you aren't always able to please the customer as much as you try. The most enjoyable part was when I was able to keep the customer who wanted to disconnect services and have them smiling before call was ended. Co-workers, worked with many employees, but being in a call center, most time was spent answering phones so you never really deal with co-workers as you would normally."

good,This was a great place to work. The calls are challenging yet possible. There were great benefits and free cable. I would suggest working here. The hours to start are hard.
good,Working for both of these was great. Management needs more training and consistency on the floor. So people play favoritism. Supervisor don't know much. Most new area ask senior how to do the job. Great benefits. Great paid vacation. Time warner had a lot of sponsors and free food not so much with spectrum. Commission was great if u work the right hours.

good,"Great Please to work, people are very nice, everyone is so helpful, learned alot, especially in areas I was not experienced in.My Supervisor's were great, very helpful."
good,I recommend it to others. It was overall great experience working at the arena. You only work when there's events so can possibly have a lot of time off although I would recommend this a part time job rather than a full time.
good,Great company as Time Warner Cable as the merge of the Spectrum we where unfortunately left out of the plans for Spectrum and our department was downsized.

good,"They take care of their employees very well. The work was very strenuous and at time can be very challenging, but they always offer ou assistance when your in need."
good,"log into computer, read emails, we were updated mostly by email, and learning portal was offered once a month, Management was amazing always willing to help and if had to ask another employee they were willing to go above and beyond to fix the problem.

good,"Due to more competition this company is going through major changes.   Expect more RIFs, not as much job security and just more stress in the work place.  It's moving from a decentralized  to centralized company.  Management is disappearing at the local level so unless you have a skill, be wary of job movement."

good,"discrimanation plays a role in this place"
good,"A good place to work, good people, etc., but don't join a cable company expecting technical or process rigor.  Their history is to innovate as needed, when needed, and rely on the brilliantly robust hybrid coax-fiber network to absorb the impacts of mediocre engineering.  "
good,"This job is only available for part time, and is almost always at night. Day time shift, which I work, is much easier than the demands of the night time staff that works the various events (i.e. Basketball games, concerts, etc.) It is usually very fast paced at night, due to customers wanting to get into the event. The managers help to assist and handle any problems that occur effectively and quickly. The hardest part of the job comes from the kids events, when there are dozens of coupons floating around that can be used and must be entered properly for every purchase."
good,"From the moment you login at work you start getting calls and are responsible to keep yourself updated with most recent changes in technology, system and promotions"
good,Decent place to work. Management is engaged and dedicated to training. No job security. Pay is competitive. Hours are long. If you are in management the expectation is to work long hours.

Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"

Out doors a lot but that can be good and not so good. Always had team member or group leader to call for help or with questions. Helped me get on with life in a whole new direction after empty nesting and completing associates degree."
good,"handling Customers complaints & Escalations"
good,Overall the company was a good place to work. It was a Fortune 150 company and therefore had all the complexities that go with it. The people that I worked with were terrific.
good,"I review resumes all day to find qualified candidates for hiring managers."
good,Time Warner was a wonderful part of my work life.  I learned so much from my co workers and formed a bond that will last a lifetime.  My customer service skills were greatly enhanced during my time at Time Warner.
good,"Its Great place to work, I worked with Multiple Departments of Top Management VP's , SR.Directores and Directors. "
good,"Professional co-workers and technical teams."
good,I am not sure why I am being forced to write this review again.  Good company.  Company policy is like a flavor of the months.  Lacking real direction.
good,"This is over all a good job, there are just a lot of changes going on with the merger. I like the job, I just am not sure that Time Warner is the right career choice for me."
good,"This organization is a diverse group of individuals where management and administration work diligently to meet you where you are at.

good,"* Meeting with customers"
good,"Inbound sales, selling products to customers, hardest part of the job are the hours, loved talking to the customers, management was fair"
good,Early morning review of quota and tech force.  Forecast days out to ensure quota is built and available.  Review time off for technicians.  Review quota requests from customer and schedule accordingly.  Very much a team atmosphere.  Co- workers were a solid base to work with.  The hardest part of the job was that management was not always prepared.  The most enjoyable part of my job was that I was comfortable with what I was doing.  The technicians had trust in me.
good,A day at work consisted of daily production meetings with a sales environment. Management provided the necessary tools needed to meet our sales. Interacting with my coworkers made the day enjoyable to me and others. The hardest part was assisting irate customers which in time became not so hard. I learned how to listen and provide a solution the customers needs. I became proficient in sales as well.
good,Although the job is a good job there are some problems like security if your not a supervisor or higher then you have to constantly worry about your job. If your going to apply for this company please apply highest job you qualified for.
good,"you will get what you put into the job. Job changes daily, metrics change monthly. Easy to move up when upper management wants to move you up."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Exciting company to work for, keeps me tuned into the media and the current events."
good,"It was a great place to work! They work around my school hours and when your not able to make it in, you can make up your hours so you wont get a point. But the one thing I didn't like about it was that they didn't care if a person told you they couldn't afford to upgrade with us, sell to them anyways"
good,Very good company with a lot of diverse projects to work on. They took good care of my accommodation since i was not leaving there. They need to improve on the carreer advancement of employees.
good,Work environment was nice with supporting management. Worked with several different groups and room to learn and opportunity. My coworkers were always helpful.
good,Unlimited advancement oppertounity.  Some positions require less than ideal schedules.  Industry is constantly changing and it can be difficult to adapt.
good,Great job freedom never have to talk with anyone more then once a week. Good customer face to face experience. Tools and everything needed is provided on time every week they are fairly understanding people to work for.
good,The Spectrum brand is an overall pretty secure job and allows some flexibility during the work week. Trainings offered on job are specific and aimed to better equip employees for job. Company does value employees and displays it through support for advancement in education.
good,I had the opportunity to help the techs and the customers. Waiting for calls was the hardest. I found it a challenge at times to stay a wake. I begged for work often.
good,"Freedom to do as you please, limited client base making referrals extremely important to maintain consistent success. "
good,My job title was a service tec.  I went out on calls to do repair work at a residence to improve or install cable and internet service.  My day was based on the types of service calls that I received. The hardest part of this job was when there were no cable drops previously instilled and I have to dig a trench from the pole to the customers home to make the connection.
good,Spectrum is great for the money.  I think everyone that works their is there for the money and benefits.  The work environment leaves something to be desired.  But to that I say everything is not for everyone.
good,There was always something new and exciting to learn in different programs. Nice facility with their own cafeteria. Excellent healthy foods.The hardest part of the job was not knowing when we would have a supervisor that would assist us with any questions.
good,"Spectrum is overall a good company to work for, management was my breaking point. The location I was at my supervisor was very engaging and worked hard with team building. The manager at the time made it difficult to enjoy working there."
good,"Enjoy the local office and coworkers, learn alot about the technical side of the business. Also did not mind working with the contractors, and other Departments and offices. A normal smooth day would consists of making sure all the work order was closed from inhouse tech and if not calling tech to find out why or close job out for tech. Go through emails, and reports to see what is open and research to find answer on them. Once the contractors had all work orders in go through each job and made sure it had the correct codes and times and then sign off on them. Then scan and download orders to the website for future use."
good,"Good Staff, Always ready to help. Great coworkers. Great work environment. Very friendly. Managers make sure you are prepared and ready. A++ Would work again"
good,"A typical day at Spectrum is very cut and dry. As soon as you clock in your on the phone taking calls. There is no time to chitchat if you insist on chatting come early. You are on back to back calls until break, lunch or it's time to go home. You learn a great deal on how to de-escalate a call not that management isn't available it's just we can offer as the reps the same solutions. The hardest part of the job is getting the customer to understand the survey is about you and not the company. Other than that the work isn't hard at all it's just the same thing day in and day out you have to be the type that can do call center environment."
good,"I was fortunate to work for Time Warner in 3 different locations. I did customer service for them and enjoyed my teams, management, and job. It was a fun place to work no matter how hectic it could be. I found myself very loyal. I had worked for Adelphia Cable years before as well. I started my telecommunications journey here."
good,"Excellent place to work, Great Management and career advancement. Business casual dress code, Fun place to work, excellent benefits, PTO, Vacation and sick time."
good,"With Time Warner Cable I was very happy with the culture and benefits that we received as an employee. When the company was being sold they were changing benefits and structure to a line with Charter Communications the owner of Spectrum. Benefits and position were being released from the company. I can't comment on the new structure.  I wish them well,."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"The position has very flexible hours including having mornings off. We are encouraged to treat it as our own business. Given tablets that have our assigned leads, generally about 500 per month. Overall the position is very difficult being that its door to door and have about two minutes to try and open and close a deal."
good,"My only reason for looking elsewhere is that I work an hour from home so my work life balance is currently non existent. The company does not have any work from home options and in order to move closer my salary would have to be doubled. Other than that the pay is great however our most recent leads are 90% unworkable (disconnected numbers, unservicable addresses ect.) My only advise would be to put yourself in the customers shoes and ask yourself what incentive are we giving them to buy our services? Does it make sense to raise a customers bill by $90 before you even add a product? Because with the leads we have that is what we are expected to do under the business rules. Most Businesses are only worried about their bottom line so this does not work."
good,While the company is very good on the whole I was very disappointed in the management once I got to SC.  The management here as opposed to TN is very poor.  The people and environment are very good so I would still have to recommend the company.
good,"take 30-60 calls a day, verify demographic changes, help in retaining members by reminding them how good our services are and all that we have to offer, once member is retained offer to upgrade their service and also add missing product. Assist members with technical issues on TV by trouble shooting, assist with billing questions and make adjustments to the bill when needed. meet the score card each month and resolve issues in a timely manner by using all your tools and resources."
good,"Working for Time Warner Cable was much better than working for Spectrum. Still not a bad place to work tho. Good pay and benefits, and never have to take your work home with you, it all stays at the office and on the phones."
good,"Working at Spectrum overall was quite an adventure, I gained a lot of customer service knowledge & how to be patient with customers. Also working at Spectrum help me succeed with other positions I've obtain."
good,"You get out of it what you put into it, and I'd like to think I always brought my ""A"" game.  I'd study, make phone calls and prepare the same for a St. Francis HS football game, University at Buffalo basketball game, or an NHL Buffalo Sabres game.  It's a team/staff effort with a number of different people making contributions!"
good,"I love the pay and co workers at spectrum, customers are very abusive, n, management tries to make it a fun environment ot all though. livable wage and benefits"
good,"Spectrum is a very competitive place to work. Not so much with other employees but with yourself. "
good,"This is a great place to work with so many great benefits, its just too many to name, however, sometimes, management, who everyone knows is stuck in the middle of politics between the upper management and field techs, can make the workplace culture very intense. There is nothing hard about the work here, and the most enjoyable part of the job in my opinion is the positive response from the customers after serving and doing the best job possible. Plus the comradery among co-workers, and meeting people from all walks of life, from the super rich, to those living in the projects, they all want the same thing.....working tv, and internet."
good,"Overall a great place to work with a competitive salary, benefits and great work/life Balance. You have complete autonomy on planning your day, meeting with potential clients, and walking door to door in your given territory."
good,Was a very fast paced job - it was never boring.  You have the opportunity to learn many new skills and meet and work with hundreds of people who will go on to be great contacts to have in the future.

good,I worked for Time Warner for 3 years.  My job was eliminated when it became Spectrum.  I worked in Direct Sales then was promoted to Field Representative.
good,I loved my job and the work I did. I loved the benefits that we got. I despise the pet promotions and putting your family first preventing you from advancing within the company.
good,Working for Brighthouse Networks (now Spectrum) was an interesting and engaging opportunity. The atmosphere is bright and inviting. The benefits given to employees is incredible. They really have an absolute open door policy. While certain regulations are strict they are absolutely amazing. If you have an opportunity to work for this company you won't regret joining them.
good,you are able to help customers with the fullest customer service possible and make sure all customers are satisfied with the services that was provided.
good,"Your work ethics and days are rated by points. As an installers, customer service is high. Installers are the representatives of the company. A typical day would usually start at 8 AM, I am routed to visit my first customer's house. As I arrived on the premises, I would always do a perimeter check on my vehicle and lay 2 safety cones. I then walk to the entrance of the house and greet myself to the customer. I usually go over the order of how many devices did the customers requested, and explain to them how I would get the cable installed into the home. Be sure to inform the customer for time estimation! I usually shoot to 3 hours or more, depending on the sizes of the homes. Remember, customers come first and sometimes they are on a time limit to run errands, go to work, etc... After the installation has been completed, I would take extra time to walk my customer's through on how to maintain their devices and let them test on their own before I leave. Management was a bit of a mess, but this was during the whole process of the convergence with Charter and Time Warner, management was still young so it caused a lot of trials and errors. The hardest part of the job was when I encountered lots of errors that were out of my hands, for example, sometimes the signal would be bad located at the tap. Customer's own devices would not function with the service occasionally. Lastly, there would be some obstacles that would prevent installers to install new home run cable from the tap to customer's homes. The most enjoyable part of the job was everything seemed easy since work was repetitive,"
good,I had enjoyable co-workers who enjoyed selling and working with the community. We ate lunch together and a nice crew. I like the information.
good,I process advertising campaigns for local businesses for cable and online.  I provide feedback for the client to see how their campaign is running.  I have learned a lot about cable and would like to explore other opportunities to enhance my knowledge.
good,"A typical day at work is challenging physically and at times mentally also. But I have learned that the only way to succeed is to give a maximum effort. When you can walk away from a satisfied customer time and time again, knowing that you helped another person is the biggest award one can receive during a work day. It makes it all worth it in the end."
good,Courteous environment with exceptional leads and trainers. Fun events that keep the staff engaged in the company. Great benefits
good,I had a great experience working for legacy Time Warner Cable and would welcome the opportunity to work for them again. I wish them all the best as Charter Spectrum

good,I learned how to become a more efficient leader over my peers. My co workers were very helpful and I enjoyed bringing on new customers to the company.
good,"Like many call centers, this one was rather stressful to work at. Residential tends to be more stressful than the business department, but both have their ups and downs. Overall, they do tend to treat you more as a child than as an adult when it comes to their attempts at increasing morale, and they tend to not reveal a lot of information about the future, and just simply expect you to be blindly loyal to the company and to never, ever be rude to a customer no matter how much they may insult you, your job, or the company. Overall it can be rather trying on your mind if you aren't used to it."
good,meeting new people on a daily basis and helping customers. Climbing poles and wiring houses and troubleshooting problems that were hard at times.
good,"Spectrum is a good company.  My typical day includes fulfilling requests, making sure the grounds are clean.  Inspecting the building to make sure there are no safety hazards."

good,I really liked working here they were very good to employees. was a great place to work needed more money but over all it was good .
good,"Throughout my almost 9 years with this company, I worked my way up from a basic technician, to a System Technician, to a Supervisor.  I normal day in the life of cable is starting at your first job, you get as many jobs as you can do in a day, and sometimes more.  They supply all of the training to do the jobs you get hired for.  The management is generally good, but like any other job nothing is perfect.  The company is very employee friendly and the benefits are great.  Co-workers are great and always willing to help out.  Hardest part of the job is, it's only cable, there is no really hard part to the job.  All you need is a good work ethic and the want to learn and enjoy work.  Most enjoyable part is meeting new people everyday and learning something new everyday."

I learned the value of quality customer service, being a team player, and the importance of the sales/saving mentality. My co-workers and I were extremely focused on reaching daily, and monthly goals. The hardest part of the job was, the overcoming of objections presented by our customers with uncontrollable circumstances. The most enjoyable part of the job was, getting the hands on experience in training, and developing new and innovative ways to keep our services at the top."
good,"I was part of a team and would answer phone calls from clients and troubleshoot there problems and get them resolved as fast as possible. I would take payments, make changes to accounts and provide a great customer service experience."

good,Brighthouse Network provided great base of my technical knowledge and was able to train new members as they joined our team.

I've learned how to communticate face to face or via email. I work in a small group of eight including myself. My co-workers are like a second family. The hardest part of my job is not knowing about every policy change. Ther most enjoyable part is the way this can and do change in a blink of an eye with the policy and purceedures. Plus it's close to home"

This process can be applied to a variety of business parameters when applying the principles to another line of industry."

good,"I enjoyed my time at Spectrum when it was BrightHouse. I was on maternity leave when the merger took place, so I am unsure of how the company work as Spectrum. My position was eliminated during the merger. I have since applied to go back and am awaiting a response. Over all it was a very good experience. I moved up quickly in the company and they constantly encouraged me to apply for my next promotion. I was promoted 5 times in only 3 years. it was a great place to work."
good,I would recommend this job to someone. advancement is pretty hard to accomplish but its not impossible. management is good and everyone seems to get along. a lot of team players.
good,Lackluster management but good starter job with many opportunities for advancement. you deal with lots of crazy people who want cable installed but otherwise its a good place to work.
good,Spectrum is a place that is pleasant to work for and the enviroment is team based and metric oriented when it comes to sales and as well as customer needs.
good,"Spectrum is a good 1st time job, but wouldn't make a career out of being in a call center. Advancement is hard, especially if you get screwed over by a mistake on their end."
good,"I was always comfortable being at Charter Communications. The people there were friendly and informative (in fact, I still email the manager today).If you're looking to start a career in television, Charter is a solid bet."
good,"There are great teams of technicians from different supervisors."
good,"Tiemw Warner Cable as it was called back then was a dream job at first. They had various shift openings and let you chose your own shift. There was also free internet and cable for employees.But within a year's time they began to overemphasize statistics for everything, that is everything that didn't matter, such as having customer's evealuate your performance and to force us to read a scripted set of questions to every cusomter s whcih sounds robotic and inhuman to most , anywa."
good,"Great cable company we deal with customers daily by reseting their modem and cable issues, high impact lot of calls per day. Always on the phone. no advancement in company"

good,"I enjoyed the work environment, the people I worked with and the job itself. I went to work in a good mood and usually left at the end of the day still in a good mood. The worst moment was when I received word they were consolidating my department to another location. "
good,not a lot of flexibility in working schedule even worst if you have children. be prepared with tough skin and a whole lot of patience because those customers aren't friendly. being computer savvy and a quick learner helps as well
good,"Great place to work, just going through a lot of changes. The great thing about the company is that they are located everywhere, which means there is great opportunity to relocate across all markets."
good,Call volume is high but the calls are repetitive. The computer system used for technical suuport is great because it provides how to assist the customer step by step if your are not familiar with cable equipment yourself.

Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"The job itself is pretty stressful.  You have to listen to lots of people calling in and getting mad at you over things that are generally their fault to begin with, or at the very least completely out of your hands.  But the management team and other employees are very supportive and will help you get through it.  Very understanding and uplifting job culture, despite the angry calls we get all day."
good,I really can't say much. I enjoyed my time while employees there although the I worked there it was Bright House. Very good working environment just not enough pay for what I was used to or wanted.

good,"Typical day at work is fast paced especially the mornings when all the e-mail seem to endlessly come in."

good,fast paced and high volume...........They kept up with technology and had events for employees to keep motivation high.  Offices organize and clean.   Great benefits

good,"This was a seasonal freelance job working for Spectrum. I would travel around North Carolina to high school sporting events and be utility as needed. I ran live camera, I was grip and I would also be a time out coordinator for lacrosse games. This was a great experience working in television.

good,"We have a quota that must be met daily in order for us to make production and ship the product to our consumers in a timely manner. Which means dedication to the job at hand and team work. As well as a strong coordinator to make sure all the lines are operating smoothly. Although the pay could be better, the environment and overall vibe from the company can not be beat. This is one of the best positions I believe I will ever have the pleasure of experiencing."
good,its a competitive environment and the supervisors train you the right way so you can be successful in your position. I learned how to convey empathy to my customers
good,"My experience has been excellent. Not all locations are the same, but where I am at I found a real team environment. Some locations are overly competitive and stressful. But the if you can make it here you will love it here."
good,"The job I loved, I like going to peoples houses and helping with their problems. But the equipment was refurbished to heck and I could not honestly recommend it. Local management was stuck with what they had and could not get higher support for changes. Anyone above local management is out of touch with its employees and customer base."

Nothing I did pleased her and she was not honest.  I had to get HR involved.  TW had a no retaliation policy and they were true to that.  The remainder of my tenure at TW was awesome.

I also made sure that all new employees for the agencies had access to necessary websites within the company, or were removed at the time that they were no longer employed by the vendors.

good,"Day was filled with taking calls from customers, assisting them with all their answers and helping them resolve issues. Answering all their questions and educating them on other services they may not be aware of. "
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Time Warner is a great company to work for.  They offer great benefits, stability and areas to grow."
good,"I do all data entry which I have been doing for years so its already everything I know. I was trained on ICOMS billing system, I do credit card updates, mail and check documentation.  My management are awesome I am comfortable going to them for any help. Co-workers are all very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is when we get a heavy load of work with a deadline. My most enjoyable part is when we meet our deadline. Always feels like an accomplishment"
good,"A typical day is knocking about 100 doors per day"
good,Working for Charter is a great chance to show what you are made of. It challenges you and keeps you on your toes. 
good,"Very wonderful place to work for, I would love to work for this company again. I had previously registered for college classes before getting the job so my school and work schedule conflicted which resulted in a lay-off until I was stable to work their required hours."
good,"Time Warner has great benefits from medical to discounted services, but you must be prepared to be in a high stressed environment. There are many challenges associated with a communications company and it is very competitive in salary."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working with AT&T and would welcome the opportunity to rejoin the team.
good,Managed a dept of 6 hard working employees. Learned to delegate so I could learn and do more. Worked well with co-workers and were like one big happy family. Hardest part was employee evaluations and the most enjoyable part was seeing someone I hired go higher and higher in the company.
good,This job I really liked because they gave the freedom of not standing over you shoulder while you work just was giving customer request to feel and you had your work day to complete them all and if you need assistance then you could call your supervisor. You had you own van and choose when to take a lunch.
good,I absolutely LOVE Time Warner Cable! I truly Miss working for them. I loved this job.
good,had a good experience besides the management isnt what they should be. A typical day at work would be taking calls and helping customers with their bills and needs. I learned what i needed to do to help the customers with their problems. The co-workers were great. The management would do alot of things that they didnt expect you to do. The hardest part of my job would be thing such as dealing with hard customers but it was worth it in the end. The best part about my job was the people i worked with.
good,The most enjoyable thing for working at Time Warner Cable was the ablility to handle more of the complex troubleshooting. There was much appreciation in putting all the pieces to the puzzle together.
good,"Time Warner Cable is a great company to work for ... day to day activities include but not limited to.taking customer service calls for our customers who subscribe to internet , phone and cable television.."
good,"Provided specialized customer service and sales support that results in a positive experience for the customers. Provided timely resolution to customer inquiries by giving appropriate billing, service programming and/or maintenance information. These transactions included, but were not limited to: the scheduling of appropriate work orders, establishing new services through up selling, setting up changes in service, special request orders (maintenance issues, equipment pick up, etc.) and disconnection of services."
good,TWC has been a very positive learning experience. I can honestly say I enjoy going to work everyday. I have learned something new everyday with each different customer experience.
good,Nice place to work if your trying to start out your career.I love my coworkers we are like family.
good,"spectrum has various jobs in various outlets,not overly demanding,very pleasant helpful staff,relaxed atmospere easy to contact and no problems with pay,quick to dispatch clothing and utilities to each place of work"
good,"When I worked there, it was Time Warner Cable. Secure environment. Great incentives and plenty of prizes, discounts, food trucks and public events. You'd probably end up on  commercial."
good,"Spectrum Networks is a place with great culture and people.  With an open door policy, ideas are easily shared and heard, and there’s a feeling of inclusiveness not just with employees and employer, but also with customers."
good,this was my very first inbound sales position and I really really enjoyed it the bonuses were excellent and the people that are worked with and worked around we're absolutely wonderful management was also on top of things anytime there was an issue they always take care of it nice job spectrum
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Handled customer concerns or complaints with product as well as attempting to up-sell them for additional product. The Hardest part was attempting to sale to an upset customer. The Most Enjoyable part was the competitive nature of selling units to new customers.
good,"Truly fulfilling work.... Learned about the industry, cross-selling and up selling- techniques.... Very competitive but highly rewarding environment!!!! Great"
good,"Spectrum is a place I enjoyed working at. The management was always hands on, supportive, and available. The goals were realistic and gave me an outline as to what is expected as well as the motivation to achieve my goals. Benefits were also amazing and pay was generous!"
good,I really enjoyed working for them when they were Time Warner cable. They really showed a natural caring for their employees and a desire for front line workers (csr reps) to feel motivated and appreciated.
good,"Handle a high volume of inbound calls. Utilize problem-solving techniques to resolve customers' concerns. Responsible for troubleshooting cable, internet, and voice equipment issues. Perform multiple duties within the same call while maintaining a positive attitude. Create contest reporting to drive business performance."
good,"Great company. Benefits and pay is good. The work environment is actually a great environment to work in. As an employee, the benefits are actually great as well."
good,"I love my job but there were plenty of days in training that i was so overwhelmed that i didn’t know if I’d make it. I’m glad i did. I’ve been on the floor for about 8 weeks & everything is finally clicking. The job is challenging if you aren’t tech savvy. Tons of info thrown at you in training but once youre on the floor, they make sure you have lots of ppl & resources to go to for help. I work with the best people & most of the customers and fun and friendly. Lots of focus on metrics...almost a little too much i think. That’s the only negative i think. Great benefits & pay - I work w/ the best people- I love my job!!"
good,"Benefits and services make up for stress  Getting off of a later shift is hard. That is the only draw back. It is a call center for helping people with cable issues, so it can be stressful for unhappy customers. But every call is a new call."
good,i love working at spectrum however it is hard to get a morning shift i have . a daughter and working 1-10pm does not work for me. i have to pay for childcare plus pay for someone to watch her in the evening along with not being able to see her often.
good,Working here is great when you have a good customer service background. Customer relations is very important and always be aware that customer satisfaction is always our mission
good,"it is fun the enviroment is friendly and they pay you ALOT of money some months I came home with 10k+ but it is alot of work and they expect that you make sells... but besides pay you can win prizes like TVs, Fridges, computers, Gaming systems, spurs tickets, and it is fair everyone has a chance to win if you work hard"
good,"Staff support from training right on into On the Job training"
good,"Biggest complaint would be the schedules and how they're chosen. You can get a nighttime shift even if don't want one. Other than that, not many complaints. They pay very well and the benefits are amazing. 6% 401K match, vested at 3 years. Overall, great company to work for that really does take care of it's employees."
good,No room for error. Would have liked more room for advancement.  Shift coverage would lack at times. Overall compensation was great and rewarding great sales was very impressive.
good,I had finally found the perfect position for me when to my shock my departwas being laid off. I still recommend this company to anyone just stay in customer care to keep your job.
good,"Good work environment that gets easier with experience. There was always work to be done and no problem to be solved was ever the same. The work was demanding but rewarding, and the friends I made in coworkers will be long lasting friendships."
good,Business Class department was like a close knit family. I loved working with my colleagues until they changed the department to residential and cut commissions.
good,"I love working for spectrum. I do think you should be paid more considering how dangerous the job is.. We get a lot of bad reviews but in all reality the company, as a whole, is a great company to work for."
good,Spectrum is a brilliant place to work with great working conditions. Pay is very good. Job satisfaction is really good. Great place to gain experience and improve your career.
good,"Busy times at most to assist customers with resolutions for billing, technical support on equipment. Would play games when the weather was nice outside or walk. Co-workers were  fun but under a lot of stress to make team numbers."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Spectrum was an amazing company to work for. Management was fun and enjoyed motivating sales reps and customer service agents. The month always consisted of contests and prizes.
good,"Work hard play hard. Opportunities and career advancement. Great benefits. Supports employees with education reimbursement. Values employees input., makes sure employees have tools to do job."
good,"Pay is great for students, benefits with the job are even better. the bosses are sound and chill. Can be late with your wages at times but if you message them they send it straight away."
good,"Good company, room for growth within company, Health insurance, Paid time off, Overtime availability, management at times could be poor, and technicians would be overbooked."
good,"No two days are the same. Fast Paced work atmosphere with different challenges each day. Great people, great benefits with opportunities for advancement."
good,I love working for this company. Good morale and great amenities in majority of the buildings. They promote career advancement and provide education assistance.
good,"My buddy had been recommending me Spectrum for months, and he's guaranteed me a job there.  I was like, call center, I'm better than that, I work in labs (work i hated doing, btw).  Anyway, long store short, I took 5-0 on a tour of my neighborhood, and was about to the get the textbook takedown.  Fortunately we were close to my house.  Anyway, I realized thousands of dollars would be needed and the wheels of justice turn slowly, so I gave my buddy a resume, took like 4 days from interview to drug test to them delaying my start date by two weeks.  Anyway, great company and I should never have accidentally quit."
good,"Field tech's in my region are fairly paid, fairly treated, and pushed to do better. I feel very at home in the atmosphere, but wasn't able to personally keep up with the pace of the job."
good,"Spectrum wasn't a bad place to work, I was just looking fro a career that would fall in line with my educational goals.  It provided a lot of benefits."
good,"A typical day at Spectrum is to review and process orders accordingly making sure each contract is complete in full detail. "
good,"it was a great and fun place to work I planned on working there for awhile more but it was not my decision to leave as they closed the center. They offer free services,"
good,"i really enjoyed working for spectrum friendly environment , enjoyable if they didn't relocate my department so far i would of never left a lot of opportunity for advancement"
good,Not sure about this particular organization because I did not work for them.  Sorry for the inconvenience. This is most likely technical issue or computer software glitch.
good,"This is a great company with incredible opportunities and benefits.  However, the outside sales department is a little rough going.  It certainly offers great earning potential, but the culture leaves a little to be desired."
good,Attention to detail. Quality Customer service. Work well with others. Willing to be flexible with my schedule. Troubleshooting skills. Always willing to learn and try new things.
good,I had alot of fun with talking to customers and getting them to buy Spectrum services. I was not too happy for the compensation plan. We weren't getting paid until we meet a certain threshold. It's a good job but I wish that there was more so that I could be motivated to stay.
good,"I don't understand why this is mandatory to be completed to sign up for this service. I worked every day, then I went home. They paid me in American dollars in which I spent it on other goods and services which made me happy!"
good,"At the call center I worked in, the biggest negative of the overall work environment was that it had clearly changed a lot in the last year or so. They went from casual dress to business casual, which was frustrating as in a call center no customers are actually going to see what you wear, they would constantly need people to work overtime on weekends (especially during the NFL season) and incentives went from appealing (free pizza, prizes, casual dress passes, etc.) to lame (free fruit and stale popcorn in the break room). The hardest part of the job is just the monotony of calls - yes, you get some angry callers, but really the problems are the same over and over again and it can be hard to stay positive about the service. You are closely monitored and they are good at recognizing good performance as well as improvements in individual and team performances. I felt I could easily advance at the company and that my hard work was appreciated and noticed."
good,Compensation was great. The work culture co workers the directors trainers were the best part of my experience at spectrum. I jad mu complaints but atill enjoyed mu tenure at spectrum
good,Company strives to be the best in a dying medium. There are lots of opportunities for advancement if you are willing to put in the  extra hours and relocate every few years.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Organize your leads , go in for motivational meetings once a week. Brush up on new ways of selling . keep good accurate track of people you talked to and highlight the objectives to overcome.  Call leads and knock doors 6 to 10 hours a day.  Hardest part of job is staying constantly motivated and getting both decision makers together during to close the sales.  Most enjoyable part was being your own boss and working your own schedule.  Management was good and motivational.  The workplace culture was competitive and easy to get along with, you can collaborate with your work associates to stay motivated.  ."
good,"Very faced paced,  a lot of cold calling, implementation of back office requirements such as installations,order entry was the hardest part of the job very time consuming  after you spent a day of cold calling and uploading your signed documents and then creating the order, you work from home and you have to get all of that done before you start the next day or you will get backlogged ."
good,Excellent place to work with interesting projects.  Very talented work-force.  Excellent compensation and benefits. Must be a self starter to thrive here.
good,One of the biggest learning workplace I've had the opportunity at working with. everyone is literally treated like family. i loved every moment of it.
good,"Spectrum is a great place to work, as a rep. Once you start to move up the money doesn't justify the work. High end reps can and will make just as much money as a supervisor who is there way more and who has way my duties than the regular reps."
good,"I enjoyed my time there at Charter. I was and still am a huge people person. The hardest part is meeting the quotas and goals and during my latter time there that became very challenging the people weren't biting the bait. I couldn't understand that. Although, most of my coworkers made the work day fun and enjoyable."
good,"Free Cable, 401k , benefits, health insurance , must be available for overtime, weekends, nights. I would recommend working there. Flexible, friendly employees"
good,work environment great great. great compensation within the sales dept. scheduling not great a lot of late schedules but overall great company. incentives offered regularly.
good,Very stressful job. However the pay and benefits are amazing if you can handle the metrics and micromanagement. They want you to follow thier script and say what they want you to say. Very hard for technical people.
good,If you were willing to learn and work within a call center culture Spectrum offered different ways in which to advance an be successful.  As in most call centers change was constant and you had to be able to adapt.  Spectrum offered training and support through stressful days (billing center so the calls could be a challenge).
good,"They took care of me, I just cant bare the winter time anymore. Great employees to work with and great supervisors to work for. they take care of employees in any way they possibly can."
good,"Time Warner is a great place to work. "
good,Awesome and  professional place to work. Never intended on leaving the company but once changes were made my department was moved out of state. I am grateful to have been a part of such a company.
good,Multitask in most of the important thins on my job. Based on the staff scheduled I decided where it will be focus during the day. The most enjoyable part of my Job is to be able to work with communicated with my leaders and management to a better services for our customers.
good,"Managing to the daily and Monthly sales goal, coaching, developing  and motivating sales employees.  Call center metrics daily and using e workforce to manage employees available time to maximize sales contacts and closing time."
good,Overall the outcome of having the oppurtunity to work for spectrum was amazing. The pay was good the only problem was the environment and employees. Some workers showed lack of respect of the work place. I see there was no effort put in finding more work driven people.
good,I was able to manage my by own day. I had an uncapped ceiling for commissions for Time Warner Cable. I was able to manage my own properties to successful businesses.
good,This was an excellent place to work at the opportunity is very well worth the while. The growth was awesome. The way they show appreciation is very nice.
good,Great place to work. Need to work on raises and technology. Has stability and ways to advance. I only recommend upgrading there technology so they can compete with others.
good,I love being able to go out and interact with the customers directly. Going out alone and completing tasks givin for the day. Meets thatkeep is well informed of recent changes. Trusting superiors.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Being a large company, Time Warner Cable/Spectrum gave me the opportunity to branch out and explore fields that I was not used to. I was able to thrive in the great work environment and I was able to do well given the tools to do so."
good,"it awesome if you are good at sales, people are great, management is friendly and fun place to work they have a lot different activities through the year"
good,"I liked my job with Time Warner, they worked with my schedule."
good,"The company has good benefits and pays well. "
good,Love what I do and my favorite part is meeting and inter acting with new customers its amazing how by teaching and knowing that my knowledge can help the customers life easier.
good,This facility has very hands-on sr. Managers and supervisors. Everyone here does their part to make you feel appreciated and knowledgeable in our position. Even the sales agents express their appreciation even though charter communications is eliminating our department.
good,"TWC was a great place to work. Management was always receptive and maintained an open door policy. Compensation was fair. Training needs some work, but support from peers was second to none."
good,I enjoy my work and the benefits. TWC is going through some changes and is difficult at this time.  I enjoy all the ppl I work with and the work that we do with customers. Every Job has it difficult parts.
good,I worked with Time Warner through a temp agency for about a year. The job was an easy job. I was not able to obtain permanent employment. I wasn't very happy because I knew more than the people they chose to hire permanent over me.
good,"This job prepared me for better opportunities, easy to advance and move up. Very fun work environment, opportunity to connect and meet new people of all different backgrounds and lifestyles."
good,Time Warner is a very good company to work for with lots of opportunity for growth. Compensation and benefits are very fair. The work environment is full of diversity and inclusive of all.
good,"Typical day at work involved taking a very high volume of phone calls, but every call was an opportunity to make sales commission and to take care of a customer. Breaks were enforced. This company has many benefits."
good,good place to work  bonus and such added 401k benefits lots of technology. exciting and fun 24x7 was required working weekends
good,"Not the best job for me. I quickly found out that selling was not my best attribute. No knock to Time Warner, great company ""if"" you have it in you to speak about cable, internet and phone all day. You better like/love it because selling products is tide to your pay."
good,I enjoyed working for Time Warner Cable. It had a friendly environment and promoted lateral movement internally. They also provide many benefits and help you learn better ways to interact with clusters on the phone to ensure success at their company.
good,As a teller I handled many different people's banking needs and was able to help them.  I learned a lot about banking while running your own business and how important your credit is.
good,The most enjoyable part of the Job is the costumer experience and knowing that i am making a difference. The culture at TWC is great and I am pleased to work with some amazing coworkers.
good,"it was a Calling Center so i was on the phone most of the time"
good,"What I've learned working for TWC, now Charter since the merger, is that you can turn your job into a career there. You have to ensure you work hard to get to where you want to be in the company, but it can and will happen."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,I have enjoyed this job.  I have learned the inner workings of network devices.  I have great co-workers and leadership.  The hours are long and sometimes the work has its tedium but I have learned a great deal.
good,This company has been great to me. I do not need much to be happy so maybe that's why. The culture is great! The company shows that they care about their employees. We have so many fun little events that they feed us at :)
good,Charter was such a great job. It was always busy. I loved it. I moved to Tuscaloosa so the travel would be too much for me. I learned a lot from Charter. It was a call center so people did get pretty rude. I enjoyed my co-workers.
good,"management wants you to succeed, there is always someone there for assistance.  You can climb the ladder as fast or slowly as you want to.  Culture is great!"
good,"I really enjoy working for Time Warner Cable, but it isn't my passion.  My passion is programming and computers, and no matter what else I do, I always come back to it in some way, shape or form."
good,good company management could use some improvement. information is not relayed properly or in a timely manner. fun environment.needs to create more innovative ways to assist their customers
good,"Good place to work, talk of merger creates some uncertainty.  Management could do a better job of keeping work informed of recent developments."
good,"great  workplace and great co[workers ,minimum supervision and very nice team, winter was the hard part of the job specially when ladder was required"
good,"Learned a lot about business and residential installation of cable, internet, and telephones. I highly recommend this company to the community. Employees will be trained for any aspects of the job."
good,"Fun work place, alot of changes. overall good company to work for.Very fast past. Have to keep up with your metrics. Can quickly move up, supervisor helps out as well."
good,This company gives good direct benefits and the managers are willing to help if you are willing to listen and apply yourself. This is a company I regret having to leave. Make the best of where you get with this company or try to get here you are comfortable. They treated people very well when I was here.
good,My day normally starts off with making sure I pull up all my systems and make sure to check my email. Once my team and my supervisor comes in there is smiles and laughter and stories of the night before. My supervisor is the leader of the laughter and the fun enviorment. While working at Time warner I have learned to breath. What I mean by that is with taking phone calls some arent that great and I have learned to just take a deep breath when it gets hard and continue going. The hardest part of my job is that I cant help everyone even though i try.
good,"This company is fast paced and intense at times. They treat their employee's very well and are always advancing with the ""times""."
good,Fast paced work with a lot of multitasking. Same tasks done everyday. Lots of talking on the phone. Amazing free service if TWC is provided at home location.
good,"Time Warner Cable had a good benefits package with paid time off. Holiday pay, 401k and a pension plan.  The company offered shifts that covered twenty four hours a day, seven days a week and three hundred and sixty five days a year."
good,superior benefits. friendly staff- desirable salary. best part of the job is the benefits and the hours. hardest part are the unsatisfied customers.
good,wonderful place to work...always some challenge game that motivated us to strive better in our profession...there was all the ot hours and extra makeup hours one could want and there was good pay in the catalog ordering season.
good,"• Provide customer service, Assign employees to specific duties, Direct and supervise employees"
good,"start work with coaching and sales goal with team. learned about new and upcoming offers and promos, management was great and very informative, also couldn't have a better co-worker environment we all worked as a team to help one another the hardest part of the job sitting down 8-12 hours. the best part of the job really was knowing you helped improve a client life."
good,"I currently love my job.  Although it can be fast-paced and even hectic at times, it is a challenge that I love.  I enjoy working with people and always try to let my smile be seen or ""heard"" at all times.  I am willing to help co-workers when needed as well as accept help from them.  The hardest part of my job is not putting too much pressure on myself, while the best part is setting goals and being able to achieve them due to a great support team and reliable management.  I love helping the technicians to have the best and most productive work day they can have."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,The part i enjoy most about a day at work is being able to satisfy our customers and keep smiles on their faces. My co-workers and i get along very well so that is no distraction or any problems.
good,"started review daily sch of appts and meeting with clients, reviewed and verified install orders that would be installed that week"
good,"Cable television advertising did a complete technological, societal, and internal transformation during my 18 year career at TW. The growth of cable viewership, the advent of digital technology and multiple consumer platforms, along with the challenge of developing advertising product to meet these changes meant we were constantly developing, training, revising, prioritizing, and focusing salespeople on the next big thing. It was a great experience, but there was always pressure to stay ahead of where the market was going."
good,"Great place to work, great environment and the management is stupendous.  Hardest part of the job is answering the phones and getting to know everyone's personalities.  I learned how to interact and coach all 200 agents and made sure that they were performing."
good,TWCM is a performance-based organization that rewards employees who meet and exceed goals.  Management is approachable and the work is challenging.  Teams are provided many resources to complete goals.
good,This job was pretty straight forward when comes to troubleshooting their three lines of businesses . Run diagnostics on all equipement and check for updates for latest signals . The hardest part I would say would be major outages of the services .
good,Take cable calls and trouble shot Cable boxes and Internet and Digital Telephones. Also helped customer with cable box activation and scheduling technician and resetting cable modems helping customer with routers.
good,"good job, benefits great sales 1st driven customer service 2nd"
good,"My role was in retention and saving clients from cancellation. My department was the last straw effort for charter to maintain ultimate customer satisfaction. If anything needed fixing, it was my job to try to turn things around for our customers. I had a 90 percent sucess rate and not only saved our customers,but upsold products and services to them after gaining trust and ensuring customer satifaction."
good,Learned a lot of skills. learned how to manage my work load and meet deadlines.  Learned how to set my own goals for myself and how to manage a team or 12 or more.
good,"A typical day would begin with me checking emails for updates making call backs then logging in to receive inbound calls. I worked for Time Warner Cable for a little over 3 years and the entire time I was evolving and learning new ways to handle different types of conversations with customers whether it was inquiries on company products or a sales conversation. During my 3-4 year tender I was introduced to 3 different managers with different management styles I can say that I enjoyed them all but I also learned from them all because when I joined there teams I did so with an open mind. I can defiantly say that we were all a team the entire call center, anytime there was an unanswered question you could find it by sending an email or tapping a shoulder, but only after you completed the proper research to find it on your own. The hardest part of the job was not always having an immediate solution to a customer’s issue because I want to have that first call resolution on every call and sometimes that's just not possible. What I enjoyed most about my last position was the competitions it made the job fun kept the call center energetic and kept everyone focused on their metrics."
good,"Of all the Call Centers I've worked for, this is one of the better ones.  They constantly have incentives and activities going on, and do a good job developing employees for future positions.  Expect high call volumes, and irate customers on a regular basis, as this is a retention role so you will be working on saving customers.  My only real gripe with the position is that the focus tends to be heavy on upgrading customers, even though they're initially calling in to cancel, and your upgrade metrics are weighted heavily.  This can be stressful for some, if they're not ready for it.  I chose to depart this company due to MULTIPLE issues with payroll, and not receiving all of/the proper amount of compensation across multiple paychecks, but apparently that's not that normal there."
good,I love it here just relocated is all would recommend this job to others. Lots of great benefits also.
good,"I adjusted and adapted quickly from being a phone agent to becoming a back-office supporter. I've learned a lot about Excel in my current role which I haven't had to use since high school. The supervisors come to me with special projects and rely on me when there is a deadline on an error report. My co-workers are great and come to me quite often for help with reporting, and now even Excel. The hardest part of my job is getting the recovery agencies to correct their invoice errors. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help co-workers and other employees confidently."
good,"A typical day was me going into the contracting office, picking up my equipment for the day, and going to the homes to install the products."
good,"Not for the sensitive of faint of heart. You will get stressful call that will leave you flustered and unable to think straight. But once you do, you'll realize you can do it w/ your eyes closed."
good,"I loved this job!!  I dealt with customers that were unhappy, and I was able to turn the situation into a positive experience for them."
good,its ur typical call center with the normal calls about ur billing must be self motivated and lots of incentives
good,"enjoy working with my team on a day to day basis"
good,"A great team environment. Everyone on the team was friendly with each other, and very helpful."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Alot of information to learn, strict work environment. It is only a retention call center"

We also are introducing new items and ways to save your bill and each bill and bundle is perfectly tailored to each household and perspective needs.

I'd volunteer this type of work just to get outside and help maintain the telecommunications backbone."
good,"good place to work ,"
good,While I was there we were handled with care and treated as though we mattered as employees and people. We were driven to not only develop as professional but as individuals as well.
good,"Your day to day can be stressful but Spectrum is mindful of that. They were fantastic about providing lunches, snacks, customer service week, holiday/seasonal parties etc to incentivize you to relax and unwind occasionally."
good,"A great place to work, I just was not happy with my pay after being there so long I was not making enough money.  I have heard that since the merger with time warner the pay and advancement is a lot better."
good,"Spectrum at the Riverview location is secure as far as your job.  The atmosphere is laid back. Management doesn’t bother you and everyone is willing to help. The only con is this location is 24/7, so you will have no weekends off unless you are in management. You will also, as a new hire have to work a evening schedule. This is all based on working within workforce, not the company as not every department has to work weekends"
good,Great benefits. Great incentives to work towards. Public facing job. Fast paced and aggressive sales goals. We work together as a team. Have elearn classes to educate.
good,"I enjoyed working at spectrum, everyone got along with each other the vibe was great and if needed help someone was there. Management knows what they are doing."
good,Overall I work there 10 years and I think Spectrum was a great company to work the manager was the great manager was good and then sometimes you had your bad ones. but mainly the main thing is to not give up and to realize the people on the phone are just you and me..so you have to have a thick skin at times because people can be mean.
good,"The goal at Spectrum is to always make sure the customer is satisfied. To go above and beyond to make sure customer services are up to par. Your customer is your actual customer and for supervisors, your technicians as well."
good,The company overall.   There is a breakdown in communication in the higher ranks and lower ranks as can be expected from a large company and policy seems to change frequently.   The pay is a tad low compared to what you actually do as a tech but you don’t have issues with pay.  Pay is consistent and work life is honest and they work well with family life as long as you follow procedures. Keep open communication with your supervisor and do as you are told and you won’t have any issues. Work hard and honestly.  That’s all they require
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"

good,Spectrum is a cutting-edge organization with many advancement and educational opportunities for those that would take advantage. Spectrum endorses the promote from within policy for qualified individuals.
good,When we were Time Warner Cable we had much more direction than Spectrum. I lost my job due to moving of the work to another location. Less local staffing was a not a good move.
good,"I absolutely enjoyed the opportunity and time spent working on a daily basis with co -workers and internal and external partners. It was a great experience from beginning to end and definitely improved a lot of my office and business skills, willing and open to more opportunities to advance with this company!"
good,"I appreciated them very much! They have great benefits, and I would have stayed had my father not get into a bad accident. loved it loved it loved it loved it"
good,They have a lot of meetings that are honestly just common sense for sales. The supervisors are okay but once they have an eye on you expect so a lot of pressure and yes I mean an overwhelming amount.
good,"Good advancement opportunities, fun people to work with. Management allowed you to make your own decisions and would back you up on them most of the time."
good,"Spectrum workers are bound to their policies like a duck likes water. Speaking generally, less that an average amount of customers will be outraged at the notion of following company policy and, for no just cause. The office atmosphere is nice, including the overabundance of snacks and refreshments for morale, I guess?"
good,"Being a people person a typical day allowed me an opportunity to work with all members in our community. I've learned a lot over my 29 and 1/2 years about people and company cultures. Management is young and the culture is changing, I still believe in caring for the customers needs to grow our relationship long term. Workplace culture is one of excellence. There aren't any aspects that are hard. Assisting customers and solving their problems having them leave happy and appreciative of my efforts."
good,"low pay while i was there fun job fast paced safety oriented. only issue is low salary.  good management quality control is strict they make sure the job is done right,"
good,i would take 80 to 120 calls a day on services issue and billing and payments  also for credits on acct i learned how to read billing statements and deal with upset customers over the phone also how to be professional with every call and relate with each caller and situation differently the hardest part of my job was the switching of management and supervisors every few weeks instead of a established team the most enjoyable part of my job was the free cable and internet and phone but also talking with all kinds of people from all over
good,"A typical work day includes interesting interaction with coworkers, prospects and customers in a highly competitive sales environment.  Managing a team of tenured and successful sales professionals, I'm always looking for ways to inspire and motivate my team to achieve all sales goals and objectives.  Leading by example is the highest priority when managing a top performing sales team."
good,you can always start carrer as inhouse is a better chance.. but for  a contracor theres not much of opportunities and theres no benefit when you join the contractor company for spectrum.
good,"Company as a whole takes care of it's employees and makes you feel appreciated. Cons, pricing and inability to due whats right for the customers. Pricing is always changing on customers"

good,"I've working with Charter Communications for over a year now, and I'm honestly happy with the company."
good,"I love my job, its challenging and rewarding at the same time.  Its exciting as a Supervisor I am able to coach agents to succeed daily at work and in their personal lives"
good,I admit they have gotten very strict on the employees. But as far as a company and employer itself. Great place to work. You can't beat the benefits and discounts.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"I have always been in retail or telesales.  So door to door was new to me.  It is definitely a HARD job.  I learn each day.  Wish the training was better, the whole elearning and virtual learning is not for me.  I like contact and the ability to ask questions right away."
good,"All in all, it is what it is! You must be prompt and aware of deescalating all calls! Some calls are quick and many are LONG!"
good,"Honest, Reliable ( right up until they were forced out of business )"
good,Enjoyed my first sales position and the awesome commission structure. The Supervisors and Management team were great.............................................
good,I was employed at Time Warner Cable before it became Spectrum.  During my 11 years of employment I excelled and exceeded expectations of sales goals.  I advanced my position from residential sales to business class sales after 9 years of loyal hard work and dedication.  Once in business class I was able to grasp my new positional duties very quickly and became one of the top sales people for my team.  I appreciated how helpful and involved in the success of myself and my team members that my manager was.  Unfortunately my position was cut short due to the merger of Charter and Time Warner Cable.  My entire department was laid off.
good,"Great support, leadership and job growth. Good environment, a growing company that is expanding all over the company and becoming one of the largest service providers."

good,"great pay, must work hard, Management is a little tough, very competitive which is a good thing. had a lot of incentives if you and your team did a good job"
good,"Working at spectrum was sometimes very intense. I learned new deals, upselling, and keeping customers happy. Management was ok. I say this because he wasn't overly friendly. However it was a lot of fun there. We had potlucks, movie days, as well as played games."
good,"unload  new  units  for  testing,  run  test  benches  to  keep  up  with  "
good,"work days are busy but relaxed. the management genuinely cares about the employees. career advancement is a little limited in the technical areas outside of video unless you work in CO, TX, or OH."
good,Growing organization with the acquisition of TWC. Multitude of career paths. Once of the best benefits package and generous matching 401k plan up to 6% dollar plus company paid RAP plan.
good,"Great company, but sometimes you had to travel too far a distance from the office.  Management sometimes treated you like a child.  There was too much Micromanagement."
good,"Spectrum invested a lot of time and money into their interns. Not only did we get the experience of working with a team in our desired position daily, but we regularly had luncheons with our fellow interns. During these luncheons Spectrum would provide us with guests ranging from public speaking coaches to reciters revise our resumes. These are very soft skills that I feel did not always apply to my success at Spectrum (they could be taken anywhere). Anyways, it made me feel that he company we investing in me personally and I really appreciated it."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,New Professional Services offering focused on Cloud Computing.  Two initial service offerings include Cloud Assessment and Cloud Migration in the Navisite/Charter Spectrum company.
good,I loved my team environment and the culture they provided. I was compensated well for my hard work and always recognized for my achievements. I would recommend this job to motivated sales individuals looking to enhance their sales background and career.
good,"It was a demanding atmosphere, but the team members treat you like family. It was very easy to communicate with each of the teams because we all were looking to achieve the same goals"
good,We had a great manager who gave areas to work close to home so we didn't have to travel too far.  Everything was great until our commission was drastically reduced.  We had a 60% reduction in pay.  That was unacceptable.
good,As long as you do your job its a good place to work not to much micro management. free online training. School reimbursement  as long as its cable related. some jobs have progression plans so you can grow within the company. almost free cable
good,"I love Spectrum and all the awesome opportunities it brings. With benefits of having the service, medical benefits, and a great deal of workers creating a fun productive enviorment."
good,The job itself isn't the most amazing thing. What made Spectrum great was the people you worked with. Everyone I encountered there was in a good mood despite the nature of the job.
good,"I have only been here since the end of April. My opinion has not been fully developed. I am pleased with my manger, my team and the entire Dayton Sales staff at this point."
good,"My job was very fast pace working in the Telephony field.  The benefits itself that they offer is more than any other company I have worked for and heard about.  Also working for this company you always have chance for advancement,"
good,"Overall great place to work, but they short change you on starting pay, make you jump through hoops to get pay boosts. Give an annual raise but you have to be a top performer to get a decent raise. They have recently changed metrics to make them harder to attain, so most of us never get the bonus."
good,"I have to constantly be asking about my schedule for the week, since I work out in the community with clients. The case managers have people bouncing around and then they can't find coverage last minute. It's not impossible but it can be a pain"

good,This company has a knowledgeable and professional training department. Great work environment. Open door policy. My supervisor wanted me to succeed. Several opportunities for advancement. Also sale/customer driven people will make good money working here.
good,"Work place equality, fairness to all, opportunity for growth is very good right now with all the changes taking place within the merger of the three companies."
good,"Working at Spectrum has been interesting, Management is awesome and my teammates are all great people to work with. Love working here but not challenged thats the hardest part of the job not being challenged and what I enjoy the most is interacting with customer and giving them a real good experience as I install service at there location."
good,I enjoyed the  time that I was at Time Warner. The work load and job duties were easy to follow and the environment was fun to work in. There was no real downside to the job.
good,cool place to work just not enough money. Perfect for someone straight out of high school. I really love this job but just not enough money due to me having a family.

good,"TWC had a great working environment.  Enjoyed working there and made some lifetime friendships.  Found it people oriented, inclusive and progressive with good employee benefits."
good,"Charter Spectrum is a fine company to work for as the role and co-work environment plays an essential part in your own personal development and progress. Spectrum has highly trained and dedicated employees that respect and honor the company the work for and can best be depicted in our customer service. Being a long time employee with more than 20 yrs there, I find it still to be my home away from home where I am not micro-managed or hassled by management. The pay is good eventually if you stick around long enough and the people you will meet become friends not just co-workers. I have had a great experience at this company and would recommend a position in any sector to most anyone. I feel like this company deserves an excellent review and no, I am not in management or was paid any $ to say all these nice things about a company I feel very grateful towards after all these years of service."
good,installed and repaired cable and internet for people. learned alot about low voltage electrical work. co-workers were friendly and helpful. hardest part of the job was climbing the poles in the winter. best part was working with customers and making them happy.
good,Oceanic Time Warner Cable is a great place to work. I have very high regards for the company and our Executive Staff. Learned a lot about the Cable/Internet/Phone business.
good,TWC is a wonderful place to advance your career. Training is extensive and detail oriented to prepare you as much as possible for the numerous scenarios you may encounter while dealing to customers.

good,Best company I've ever worked for.  Great benefits.  Lots of room to grow within your career.  Nice breakrooms.  Good incentives.
good,"Time Warner Cable is an excellent job for this area in WV. The compensation is nice, and the local management is very caring. TWC also offers high end training. The only complaint i have is the work is not about quality, it's all about numbers. Corporate is constantly changing policies and monitoring a flawed number system, which, if you aren't careful, can lead to disciplinary actions."
good,Time Warner cable has a great work place environment very diverse people and presents itself very well. They have many amenities wonderful benefits and an overall great staff at all of the locations I have been to and visited across the US.
good,"I actually looked forward to coming into work.  My co-workers are my family.  Yes there are days we may not agree on issues, but most of the time we all get along, help each other with the work that needs to get done.  We are there for our co-workers when personal issues come up (surgeries, deaths in family, weddings, etc).  There is alot of work to do.  Each day is different but we work together to get what must be done by the end of the day done.  I enjoy staying busy, I like goals and working with others.  My management team is always willing to assist you with issues that come up, their goal is our goal, get work done on a time table.  They are always available and don't hide in a back room they are right there with us."

good,"Time Warner Cable was a great company before the merger regarding maintaining positive employee to employee relationships.It was a lot more structured than the new company. The work environment was less stressful. The only downfall was the reputation TWC had with its consumer base, and the lack of being able to advance in the company"
good,"The Hello Friend was more than a marketing campaign, it was a culture how employees took care of their customers. Room to advance and learn new things while having fun."
good,"As a Sr. Network Engineer, I dealt with L3 issues. Before installing anything I should need to inspect,configure and troubleshoot the devices. I work mostly on routing and switching. Sometimes on load balancers as well. "
good,"I found Time Warner Cable very considerate of their contractors (of which I was one)."
good,"TWC is a great company to work for. I have been in several positions within the company. You always have opportunity for advancement even if it is not directly associated with the work you  currently do, training is available. Management tend to go by numbers (quantity vs quality) In most cases quality is a major factor. There is no real hard work with this job or anything it entails.I enjoy the fact that you always can learn more with the way the job flows. I have learned since working here for almost 9 years that you have to separate your outside activities from work. Co-workers can be good and bad depending on your choosing. A positive strong family environment is what makes the day go by smoothly."
good,"wonderful management,free internet and tv....very knowledgeable management and senior installers....always willing to help if you couldnt figure out a problem"

good,"I have worked at Charter for about close to a year now. Pay is great, benefits are amazing, and the job.. well, it depends on how you handle stress. I have worked in residential, and have recently got promoted up to business. The promotion process is 50/50. When I say 50/50, it depends on 2 things: performance, and attendance. Attendance is definitely one thing that is heavily looked upon at Charter. While the job is somewhat easy, it is extremely time consuming. However, there is a vast availability of schedules and management is always willing to work with you if something comes up. For promotions, in residential, you have to work extremely hard to make a jump. It is do-able, however. I know a person who has been there for a year, and jumped to being a supervisor within the same year going through mentoring (CSR's that get put into a project to train a team of new hires) within 6 months after his hire date. The job can sometimes be tedious, but you do have to look at the bigger picture. The atmosphere is great. People will always be there to support you no matter what. A lot of this job, is what I've never had at any single job. I'd recommend it to anyone."

good,"Customer Support Agent. Call Center. Typical day accepting calls from service subscribers, for a variety of issues, like outages, billing calls ranging from non pay disconnection to requests for credit. To be successful at this type of position you need to have some thick skin, as when customers phone in often they are presenting the kind of day or life they are experiencing with the problem they are calling you for regarding TWC. You must control the call resolve the task at hand and move on. Metrics based on call time and upsells are crucial. Shift bids occur every 6 months,your metrics play into the schedule you bid for, if other agents exceed you, and you don't get what you wanted, you learn quickly that you are responsible. Don't acquire a bad attendance record, it will effect how you are treated and while performance is the pinnacle, if you are a great agent, but unreliable it will hurt the teams your assigned to."
good,My co-workers were top notch and i enjoyed working with them.  There is a team spirit and level 3 techs are helpful to each other.  Great company.

good,"Fun place to work, with very supportive management.  Good team atmosphere.  Opportunities for advancement, but not always in the departments that you are looking for."
good,"This place takes care of you completely, problem is that if one customer complains and uses your name youll be lucky to keep your job. Actually it doesnt even matter if they are a customer... If anyone calls a complaint about you for any reason there is a good chance you will be unemployed by the next day."
good,"Going to work was exciting, fun, knowing of the unknown servicing customers day to day made you stay on top of your business daily.  I managed up to 20 employees, contractors and performed daily inventories of supplies and equipment issued.  Provided training assistance in the field, training environment, and in the office.  Being able to train Direct Sales representatives in the field kept me fresh and on point with the new challenges with fresh rebuttals to counter their rejections."

good,"With the guest coming for events the staff has made it a pleasure to work here. The staff is great, the lay out is wonderful and the guest make everything better when they come in with a smile, hello, ask questions and I can help, but the most of it is when the guest leave and they say to me personally by name thanks and see you next time.

Call volume and sales opportunities are consistent.  The management is friendly and caring.  The hardest part of the position is following the TPG compendium and making sure to hit all of the appropriate marks. The best part of the position is the paycheck.
good,I feel that the working environment is far better than most call centers in which I have worked though at times the mass group mentality common in any densely populated facility begins to rear its ugly head in the form of favoritism and high school drama.
good,"This was a challenge. Every call was an irate customer because something is not working. Rather it be cable, internet, or phone. Troubleshooting over the phone was a challenge but fun."
good,"Great week end job, always meeting people, selling time warner products, and working alone. Learned alot about how to approach new customers, how to get over negative responses and how to work hard for commission. hardest part was trying to convince customers to buy my product, most enjoying part was working on my own."

As a Supervisor daily huddles, weekly team meetings were required to keep phone representatives aware of any and all industry changes along with product knowledge training. Daily review of teams time cards. Daily review so schedule adherence. Daily review of e-time to correct any missing time card punches that my reps may have. Hardest part of the job was meeting daily staffing challenges based on the number of representatives that called out on a given day. The most enjoyable part of the job was the daily interactions with the phone reps and being able to teach them about the business an watch them grow and develop. Fellow Supervisors were outstanding."
good,"I never had any complaints about this place besides job security. My job was to up sell clients meaning even if a person called to disconnect their service my job was to try to sell them extra products. Sometimes customers already knew the drill and would start the conversation off by saying ""Please do not try to sell me anything I'm just calling to cancel my service"" or ""I'm just calling to lower my bill"" and we would still have to try to sell them or lose our job. Can you imagine someone telling you they want to cancel service or lower their bill and you have to still say ""Well sir/maam this bundle would be great for you!"". And during the slow times of the year when the college students weren't moving into town majority of the calls were to cancel service which impacted your numbers thus impacting job security regardless if the company knew that majority of the world weren't buying the service. That was my only issue. Other than that the pay was excellent because you got paid hourly at $12 plus commission. Healthcare benefits were also spectacular and the company would randomly bring the whole building lunch at least every other week. They also held contest to motivate and promote productivity by giving gift cards ranging anywhere between $20 to $100 to employees who met the challenge of the day/week. You also get an employee discount on your cable service. They also have their own personal cafeteria with chefs who cooked you whatever you wanted from breakfast to lunch. A very good company to work for if you can get past the mental breakdown of your job responsibility which"
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company. It has decent benefits, and as a customer service representative you can make decent commission."
good,"In this position is really about discipline and self management. I learned to be focused, organized and keep a schedule to consistently remain productive. I learned how to schedule and keep appointment times, effectively conduct sales presentations and identify customer needs by asking lifestyle questions and the customers body language buy in signs. At this job I learned to be a team player and assist my co workers in best sales practices and role playing. Providing a solution to the customer needs and painting a picture for them and creating lasting relationships with the customers was rewarding. Becoming the go to person and being able to lend a helping hand to my co workers help me to discover my leadership skills and was rewarding as well."

Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Reviewing and receiving items at a rapid pace with the supervision oversight of a line leader. My job was to make sure all products were sealed correctly, dated correctly, and no body damage was done. I also was under rotation where for 2 hours I might pack the boxes and stack them or simply place bottles on machine where they can be filled. When staff was short I drove forklift where each line would stack there boxes and I would deliver them on forklift to stock room so they can be shipped off."
good,The Company is generous but strict with the attendance policy
good,"Everyday at Time Warner was always busy ,which meant getting the work done in a timely and orderly fashion. The experience of working with the public is a plus in this field of work which helps you with each customer and with cable / internet and phone service. Every part of Cable is changing from viewing movies on a smart phone and tablet to recording a show and saving time just by going online. This information given to customers helps them choose the better package that is custom fit  to whats best for them. So the more I know about my job the more a customer benefits from  my service. Working at Time Warner I met many co-workers who loved their job just as much as I did which made for a good work environment. The hardest part of being a cable tech is bad weather but that's part of the job which is not a issue. At the end of the day knowing that I did a job well done was the best part of my work day. "

good,"Plenty of career growth opportunities, benefits and pay are ""top-notch"", a very stable and secure career."
good,"Working at Time Warner Cable you must be open to changes everyday. This is not an environment that stays the same. The benefits are excellent. Management is not very interested in what the employees have to say about improvements that are needed, but they do surveys to get the big issues resolved. Time Warner Cable is a large company that has many advancement opportunities, as well as may departments that you can move on to. Over all Time Warner Cable is a great place to work"
good,"Worked for years as Senior Technican..just burnt out..worked for a couple years of retention agent..again...easy to burn out on. The company itself had an awesome CO that comcast hired. Not sure about current upper management. Local managers were highly competent. Local teams were fun, family like and competive. A great job or career for someone wanting to raise a family where work was important and they needed decent pay and benefits."
good,"Taking calls regarding billing, Trouble Shooting, and Sales was fun and challenging at the same time."
good,A typical day at work was answering the same questions from one call to the next till it become repetitive. I learned how to take each call/customer as a brand new call for the day and not concentrating on the prior call. The hardest part of the job is when customers are down and you don't have favorable information as to how soon they will have their services restored or a tech out when it is a major outage. The most enjoyable is when you hang up the phone and the customer was happy with the results of their call.
good,my typical day of work consists of assisting customers and doing the best that i can while taking calls at the same time i can say ive enjoyed my time since ive been here ive been helped by time warner in so many ways that i am more then greatful.

My co workers are the best i consider them more then friends there family to me we have gone through alot in this compan. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that i did the best that i can do on a daily basis.

They invest quite a bit of time and energy into training their employees and consistently review and praise any progress that is made. They were always constructive with any criticism they needed to address and would make many possible suggestions on a personal basis for improvement. The most difficult part of the position was dealing with the extremely irate customers which we were requested to refrain from transferring to other departments unless it was completely unavoidable. The skill of customer pacification combined with active listening skills were the best additions to my skill set that I drew from my experience working there.
good,Very solid corporation that is easy to begin a career at. Upper management is exceptional and very helpful to you at improving as a professional. Great benefits package as well. Many different departments make for lots of different opportunities within the same company.
good,"Time warner cable is a great company to work for. Benefits and compensations are where they should be for the work that you do. Tech Ops is a very reliable job that you know what to expect day to day. Great team environment. Direct Sales is time demanding but you are fairly compensated for the effort that you must give. Must be good with customer interaction if you want to work for this company. unless you are a supervisor, any job requires some form of personal interaction."

This organization will not spoon feed you.  You will need to take ownership of your own development and through this you will create your own future.

good,The job is fast paced and labor intensive but good company great benefits and low stress! Tow motor licensing and CDL is an awesome bonus to have skill wise.

good,Fun environment. Easy job. Can’t change your schedule until you’ve been there for 3 months and you’re not guaranteed to get the shift you pick. Management is awesome!
good,"Working for Time Warner Cable was an ideal job. It saddened me when the company was bought out by Spectrum because you could see the changes in management as well as the work force. When the company was under Time Warner, it was a great place to work for. If the call center was backed up with calls, the supervisors AND managers would jump in and assist with taking calls. If upper management realized that the there was stress on the floor they would create fun activities to brighten everyone's day or boost their spirits. They truly had an open door policy where a person can go an express their views and not feel like they would be targeted for speaking out or expressing their thoughts."
good,"A typical day at Spectrum was going in and getting bag of money of $150 to start my drawer and getting everything on my computer that I would need to start the day. Worked with walk in customer to add cable, phone, internet, security to their account. I also changed rate plans and took payments and did the deposit daily.  I have had a lot of training on customer service and sales experience.  Work culture was busy from the time we opened the door till the time we closed so working together as a team was the best way to help each other thru out the day.  The hardest part of the job was when buyout was done everyone quit and had to work a lot alone with out any support.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with coworkers to get the jobs done."
good,Great company to work for. Must have all your focus to be successful. Awesome employee resources for help when needed. Great training classes to support your job roles
good,spectrum is a great company to work for! so many work perks and benefits. depending on the department stress is low. people are friendly and always willing to assist. spectrum even caters to their employees. especially on inclement weather days. so many good thing to say. the only bad thing are the office politics but if you do your job well show up and mind your own business this company is good for you!
good,"Great company to work for. Advancement opportunities available with self driven career path with company provided training."
good,I worked here as an intern in the summer of 2017. The atmosphere was definitely very conducive and my team was collaborative and very supportive of each other.
good,"your quality of life at Charter is based completely on the quality of your manager, otherwise it is a very fun and interesting job if you can get over working outside year round. highley recommend if you are interested in this field."
good,The experience I had with Charter Communications was a wonderful one. I was able to build the model for their network operations infrastructure nationwide from 2006-2011. Some of those practices are still in place to this day.
good,Great place to work for if you're good at What you do. Very competitive. Not as much help if you have a question. However they are getting better at that.
good,"In the mornings I would conduct our morning huddles to discuss with my team any concerns, ideas or anything on my team's mind. I would thank them and we will get our day started. We had days when we planned an diversity day in which we all would bring a dish from our culture and enjoy each other's food. We also kept the moral going by recognizing each other's birthday. We did our work but at the same time we was a tight team. We helped each other with anything we could. The hardest part of the job was when we watch our fellow co-workers one by one being let go by the company. Our most enjoyable part of the job was celebrating Thanksgiving. I was the one initiating our yearly pot-luck day. I would go around the building asking who will be participating and what dish they was bringing. That event was outstanding. We had so much food. Food that we was able to leave for the evening techs when they came for their evening shift. Food to save for the next day and food to take home. We really had a wonderful time. I was the organizer!"
good,I really like working for Spectrum - great culture and a great environment to work in.  After training and some time on the floor you are able to bid for the shift you really want - it might take time and seniority to get those traditional weekends off but its definately worth the wait.  Other perks include free internet cable and phone.  Looking forward to my career path for this company!
good,"Our department took billing calls, which is the hardest to take.  It could be stressful but the leadership is very supportive and there's a great team atmosphere."
good,"Very fast pace in the work place.  Always growing to meet current needs of internal and external customers.  Work environment is friendly and welcoming to all that join the team, even from the original interview."
good,Very realistic targets and very rewarding commissions for doing so. The company does a lot to make sure that the reps are incentivized but the culture within the company is almost non existent.
good,"Starting out in Retention, it may seem like it's pretty rough.  But if you follow directions and use your training, you can make it.  The commission is great but it can be stressful if you are not used to a high call volume call center.  There are opportunities for growth within the department and company if that's what you want.  It all depends on your attitude and determination.  Stay positive!"
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"

good,"I extremely like Spectrum. The only reason I'm thinking about leaving is because of the mileage on my personal vehicle. Other than that, they're a Great company yo work for and I've been impressed by the management which I've had the opportunity too work with."
good,"Great teamwork, good place to work and great benefits.  Enjoyed my co workers now friends, incentives and allows you to be your own person.  Fun place..."
good,"This review is really about Time Warner Cable, which was acquired by Spectrum. I don't know enough about Spectrum to say whether it is good or bad. "
good,"Fruit is free, they pay 50% of healthy meals and 20% of everything else. Catering once a month and pizza randomly ordered. (It seems like they provide food every other day). Free Starbucks coffee, 117 pto hours every 3 months. Casual wear every day. (T-shirt and jeans if you want. Management is all amazing, open door policy, pay is good, benefits are amazing, you get $240 a year to spent on anything you want"
good,"Great company with great people and great benefits. Excellent product and services for the customer. Customer service is key. "
good,A typical work week is working in a team of professionals working together for a common goal. We focus on the customer experience and try to make sure they are happy with their service.
good,"I got to go on so many trips, to train others on how to use our system. Days went so fast, lunches seemed longer.  I did customer service for five years, then went to train others in others cities, I did almostly, everyone can learn how to do there."
good,"For the short time that I have been here, it has been very enjoyable. The training period was also very well done. I enjoy that I am being challenged and full utilized in my daily role."
good,"this was a definate customer service job where being good was needed regularly people always had service issues, billing crises, needing to have their pay per view rate raised to get shows ect"

good,"Time Warner was a great place to work.  Unfortunately, Spectrum removed almost all IT positions from Central NY and moved them to Denver and Charlotte."
good,"The first 10 years with TWC/Spectrum was mainly in an Assistant role where I was the right hand to Directors in 2 different departments. I was then promoted to an Analyst position and once the merger took place, I was then transferred to Retail Administration since my old department was dissolved. "
good,You get job listings in the morning and finish each one through out the work day. Based on what is assigned determines your work day but all in all its a pretty nice job.
good,"As a test engineer, I write scripts and code for automation using JavaScript and WebdriverIO.  I have grown exponentially in the years working there building upon software test engineer.  The management is open to advice and understanding of personal needs.  The culture is very exciting and always evolving with technology advancements.  The hardest part of my job is not looking at my monitors for 8 hours.  Must take breaks to give my eyes a break.  The most enjoyable thing about my job is the Director I work with always being motivational and the possibilities of working from home.  Overall a great place to work!"
good,You take in daily tasks and learn constantly applying new techniques. A great place to prove your tenacity and resilience. Hardest part was to overcome your own opportunities but build on your strengths.
good,i had a blast working here. i learned the in's and out's to this business and learned how to lay cable. other stuff too but mainly i had fun working with my staff.

good,"You take about 40-50 calls a day"
good,"Great Job but highly stressful. As a CSR you have to answer 120 calls a day if not, you are reprimanded. QA is unfair. if you fail to meet goals all spiffs/incentives/sales are stripped away from you."
good,Great place to start off a new career. Customer service and a smile is a must. Understanding that patience is a part of the day as well as the occasional mental math in order to quickly and efficiently solve trouble.
good,"A high paced atmosphere with room for advancement. Great health benefits and 401k. Long, high paced  hours to work with plenty of overtime opportunity and on call pay."
good,"I would associate with customers and do installs, installing cable boxes and modems. Also  did disconnects where I would pick up boxes and climb polls cutting cable off for the ones who didn't pay there bills."
good,"This job is great. You MUST have the mindset.. You definitely get out what you put in and as long as you do the work, you’ll see it in your compensation!!"
good,"I love this job, I only wish the schedule lined up better, this job has a great benefeit plan, competetive pay, and the most friendly and supportive management I've had at any job I've ever had."
good,"I was hired in as a Tier II Network Engineer.  Troubleshooting skills were required.  Then they acquired TWC and BHN, changed duty positions so now instead of being a Network Engineer, I'm an Incident Manager, basically a secretary for people actually troubleshooting.  I still get paid the same, but this is not what I'm trying to do with my career."
good,"A typical day at work at Spectrum consists of interacting with customers by phone, while maintaining metrics as according to company policy. At times, strict policies and rules are enforced, and monthly meetings take place in order to keep workers up to speed with the status of their team rankings and personal rankings. This is an excellent place to work if you are someone looking to develop technical, and business skills, and it is also a company which promotes from within. The most enjoyable part of working for this company is the fantastic benefits that are offered, and the opportunity to develop new skills, while working closely with team leaders, and members."

good,I enjoyed my time at Charter. It was a very great place to work and I believe I learned a lot from it. I was on there staff as a contractor and unfortunately they didn't have any open positions once my contract expired.
good,"I've been on a contract assignment here for a few months now and everyone has been absolutely wonderful! If there was any way to stay I would. I feel challenged and it is a rewarding job. It's definitely stressful at times, but I feel like my voice is heard and I feel appreciated."

good,This is a brand new company with Charter taking over. With 3 companies merging it is yet to be seen exactly what the end results will be when it's all said and done.
good,"reasonable goals, less pressure to upsell customers compared to other companies.  nice facilities.  The billing system was tough to learn and training was not long enough to cover everything, also was a virtual training which was tough to get help when needed. great 401k match at 6%, but not vested until 3 years."
good,"Customer Service is high priority, making sure you answer all question and fix all problems to the best of your ability. Management is pretty understanding. Hardest part of the job is getting yelled at about something you can not personally fix and try to give them alternative options until issue is resolved. I loved helping people secure their homes and have access to the internet. Fantasic benefits and 401k options."
good,"A great place to start your career. The benefits are second to none, and the stress level isn't very high. I met a lot of really great people there, and I recommend it to anyone. The managers treat you like a real person. I moved from a night shift to days in the first 6 months."
good,One of my favorite jobs ever. Great benefits and excellent pay. Set schedules. Health benefits. Lots of incentives and rewards. Room for advancement. Job itself is stressful but company makes up fpr it.
good,Spectrum has good job security. With great benefits and Vacation/sick time. The hourly pay is low for the industry and raises are very low. Spectrum also has great training programs.
good,"Answering inbound calls of customers and soon to be customers assisting with cable internet and phone issues or signing up for new service .Ive learned how to troubleshot issues concerning Spectrum Services ,how to calmly and respectfully deal with  upset and irate customers in a call center setting.The hardest part of the job was the hours that kept me away from my family.

good,"Your day starts with preparing for your staff on latest updates and preparing daily essentials for staff. Very faced paced environment and there are endless amounts of information to learn if you enjoy the challenge.  The culture is open and management works hard to make the environment enjoyable for all. The most challenging part is learning the software and using your analytical skills to work through sometimes tough situations.  The best part of the job is the great people you work with, even with such a large company you can get recognized for your hard work."
good,"Really enjoyed working here the pay was good and I learned a lot from other coworkers, the management was knowledgeable the benefits were excellent it was an overall great place to work."
good,"I felt confident going into work each day feeling I could handle any issue that came up.  Management was very supportive and would give extra and refresher training if needed.   The hardest part of the job was new product roll out.  Even though new products were tested in small geographical areas first ...the kinks were never ironed out and new products would take some time to run smoothly.  I like the team building efforts this job has ...they give surveys to try and improve.  Management is motivational, but there are not many chances for advancement or lateral movement in the Media Dept."

Each job required to drive to a different location, but every job had the basic requirements. the requirements for each job was to take signal readings from one point of the coaxial cable to another and the end result should be a signal within very specific parameters in order for the customers equipment to work. This job involved climbing telephone poles, running cables through crawlspaces, and much more. I encountered a lot of different environments, and during the blazing sun, and cold rain is when this job has its worsts."

good,"I provision and trouble shoot routers and switches along with assisting field technicians."
good,"A typical day at work is dealing with people hands on with every single problem you can think of. I've learned to multitask a lot throughout the years. One of the hardest things for me starting at Time Warner is the the different task you have to handle at once. My co-workers are great I define us being a team. The most enjoyable part of my job is events that happens everyday. Meeting different people from different countries, the celebrities and famous people I get to meet and movie screenings."

good,"A day at TWC is never bored or the same.  Typically one wakes up to phone calls and emails to start the day off before going on your route for the day.  My day may consists of installs or property visits most of the time both.  That's where I'm able to showcase my many talents by providing excellent customer service whether with the customer or with leasing agents. I enjoy the face to face interaction because it is gratifying to see when a customer is truly satisfied and understands the products they just purchased.  I have  learned several sales approaches and techniques thru TWC University, in fact, my most used is the top-down approach.  The support system of TWC is more like a family network that works together and supports each other to accomplish one goal.  I've really enjoyed working for TWC!!!"

good,"A typical day in my current position is assisting the Business Sales teams. I geographically view the land around each potential customers property to determine serviceability for cable services. My recommendations of each property holds importance in determining the approvals needed/cost of construction. I work within a small group consisting of different strengths and back grounds of the cable industry,so learning from each other is constant. Working with my team for the last 3 years has been life changing especially coming from a call center with 300 employees to now being behind the scenes in a specialty department with only 13 employees was quite like a culture shock almost. I received all of my hands-on experience in leadership through successfully training 7 new hires along with successfully leading two projects as the project manager of Charter Offices/Easments. I have expert experience in streamlining company processes and researching leads to serve the companies bottom line. The hardest part about my current postion is not knowing the changes that lie ahead being that my team just transitioned into the Business Serviceability roles in February,2016, but I certainly can handle a challenge. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with. I'm one of the youngest on the team and respecting my team members is a must. We are the definition of true team work. We take constructive critisizm well and understand our reputation and quality of work relflects us as a team and not just one person. We are very interpersonal and we care not just about each other as co-workers"
good,"I enjoyed my stay at Charter Communications very much. Management wasn't perfect but they did their best to make the work life a simple endeavor. They treated us well.  The benefits package was phenomenal.  My portion of the payment for full benefits was very low compared to what Charter was paying overall to insure us. Why others didn't understand this I couldn't comprehend."
good,Time Warner Cable has opened my eyes and shown me the vast industry known as telecommunications. I've learned a lot about technology present and innovations coming in the near future.

good,"I loved working for Time Warner, it is a stellar company. We began as KBL Media and Time Warner acquired us.

Leaving was hard, but I left to stay at home with my first child."

good,"Much of the time the set top boxes are garbage and don't work. The cable is exposed to high heat and changing climates, so the cable will start to break down and fail. When there are hundreds of thousands of houses that have old failing cable replacing it all can be an extremely daunting task. Usually this causes late appointments. Also all animals love to chew on the cable so water gets in and starts to corrode it. Attics are extremely dusty, full of cobwebs and sometimes dead mice. Crawlspaces are the same but much cooler, the only downside is it can be wet and lurking with black widows."

good,A typical day at work would consist of me coming in to review a pool of work orders for technicians to run on. I then would route the jobs to the technicians for the first 2 time frames of the day for the area I was assigned.  I really miss working at spectrum. The company atmosphere was very warm felt. The people were nice. We got along like family. I enjoy how the management would engage with employees to know what was going on. The most dificult part of the job is finding a place for the jobs to go when the technician could not make a specific job.   The most enjoyable part of the job was the people and the company.

The hardest part of the job is to maintain the companies and the customers integrity when technical problems are out of ones hands; and maintaining technical difficulties with proper procedures even when it involves the customers time and expense.

The saying is true, you are never to old or to smart to learn something new.  I also had the opportunity to assist Operations by conducting sight tours of the facility to possible new hires and giving them a general idea of what we did and the different departments within the company.

good,"Best position ever held, love the flexible schedule but personal duties can sometime interfere especially if an emergency comes up. Management team is top notch! Always willing to help make the job easier, respectful and honest."
good,Manage the budget and the resources and allocate to the CapEx and OpEx projects and track and monitor the progress along with spending on those and the quality of the products delivered to the customers.
good,"This is a great position, the environment was friendly, competitive salary on who gets more payments and professionalism over the phone. Great start to incline into a higher position"

good,"I loved every moment "
good,"A typical day of worked required me to check on users, check in on tickets, and as long as the queue was empty I was free to ask questions and strengthen my skills in IT."
good,"everyday of work gave a satisfaction of a good days work."
good,Great Organization to work  with. One of the top organization within the North Carolina. A+ organization!
good,"I worked at Charter Communications for almost 8 years and I really enjoyed my job. My typical day was running the AP department with my Co-Manager we had a total of 28 employees and several contractors.  We processed a very high volume of invoices, maintained balance between each group within the department to make sure the work flow was smooth. Through my years at Charter I've learned a load of information and wonderful management skills. The most enjoyable part was the challenges, I loved having changes for the better and make everything in the department more main stream. I believe the Management team needs to be a united front and be on the same page at all times."
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Great company loved the job excellent coworkers wished i still was employed never had any problems with the company.
good,"Worked here since before college, and the company has been absolutely wonderful to me. "
good,"They always have events for us wether its to check our health, help with our future funds, or just have cook ots to show their appreciation for us. I enjoy the people I work with they always will lend a helping hand. Great benefits very affordable. They want to see you make money at all times."
good,"A typical workday with this company would be to drive to various sites and locations in the Dfw area. Co workers as well as management for the event that day would meet up and set up tents. We were responsible for setting up a time warner tent, make sure we had plenty of leads for the potential customers. We made sure the customers were prequalified either at our tent or when they went home to call customer service for any of their telecommuication needs through the company. Got along with all my coworkers we learned valuable tips as far as sales strategies from each other. The work environment was sometimes intense but always worth it and fun in the end. There never was a hard part of this job. The most enjoyable part of the jobs was the incentitives and meeting different people from all walks of life."
good,The work is challenging. Able to work on your own with constant supervision.
good,"For working in a company as large, It sure feels like a small group. I mean that in the best way possible. Everyone, from Entry level to the highest local executive are very friendly. You are taught everything you need to know about the job on site. This company really cares about their employees. Free cable, internet, and discounts on everything else. The first two months that I worked here, they bought everyone lunch. There are Xbox, PS3, Wii everywhere that you can play. It is one of the most hands on place I have worked. The hours are very random, but that changes after time (a year or so) So don't expect the time you want off to be off. There are so many benefits, but a few cannot be used until after a year. The worst part of the job is always the angry customers. Again great company, as long as you're willing to put in the time!"
good,A typical day brings me to houses of different cable subscribers... The problems ranged from customer education all the way to running new cables from the service pole.
good,Our call center was divided into several teams. Coworkers had friendly competitions. There were company incentives and as a customer service/sales agent I stayed busy.
good,"Bright House Networks is a great place to work offering excellent benefits, outstanding job security, many opportunities for advancement, and most of a fantastic work environment."
good,The CEO I had for the majority of the time I was there moved to Comcast. I am intentionally leaving out dates/times. I will say the the local people I worked with were... perfect. The managers I reported to expected you to meet metrics and at the time I worked there the metrics were reasonable and if you didn't meet they provided the training to do so. The pay based on the region you worked was also good. The benefits at the time I thought were o.k. but since leaving Charter I am thinking..holy **** no wonder people support Obamacare. If Charter has similar pay/benefits/metrics for performance than they did 3 years ago...I'd say...don't leave unless you have a really really good reason. The peeps I worked with were by all measures the best friends I ever had. If you are comparing compensation in the same industry..I can say from experience if I max out my performance metrics I'd make my hourly pay at Charter...thats right....... If I max out my metrics I'd make my hourly pay before boni.... which with these metrics I don't even make my hourly salary at Charter!!!!! The Healthcare is a joke compared to Charter and you have to pay for it...I don't think (un-named) even chips in.
good,Taking incoming calls to get information about cable or company products.Team competitions. Upbeat workplace.
good,Typical Day - Working with Field Management and Corporate Office on creation of Field Contracts.
good,"Answer phones, imput dropbox payments,troubleshoot equipment, ability to probe and correctly identify customer needs and /or concerns about custsomers cable, phone and net services. Learned exceptional sales skills and how to save and upgrade customer services. Great managers and co-workers. The hardest part of the job happened in the winter months when extreme weather hit and all techs had to be in call-and in the summer when utility companys accidently cut fiber optic lines. I enjoyed traveling to different offices for in-service trainings."
good,I have enjoyed working for TWC for the last year. My coworkers have been very understanding and the environment is very open to changes that I need to make due to my personal life. There is a strong sense of work/life balance.
good,Time Warner Cable is a great company to work for. The culture is positive and career building oriented. They treat people fairly and have great benefits.
good,"Time Warner Cable is a great place to work. I have learned to function in an ever changing environment while still retaining job knowledge. My co-workers collaborate as a team when necessary to assist the subscribers. The most difficult part of the job is keeping abreast of the ever changing technology, but luckily we are provided the tools we require to be sure we stay informed. The most enjoyable part of the job is the family atmosphere. We work together assure each person's success, and therefore that of the company."
good,"trouble shoot cable, phone and internet"
good,My days are always different and rewarding. I am fortunate to work for a great company and I cant say enough about the people. The managers are always open for new ideas and willing to meet with anyone to discuss tier ideas.
good,"Time Warner Cable is a great company to work for, a typical day at work is like walking into a room full of friends ready to have fun but at the same time to take care of business needs."
good,Charter Communications was a very fast pace enviroment and I found it to be very exciting. I was able to help many people with different issues when it came to internet or cable tv.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Employment was brief but enjoyable. We all took turns in different locations I recall working in a small office located behind a restaurant hidden yet patrons knew we were there. It was quaint but effective. A typical day incuded telephone inquiries, receipt of cable equipment, payments,drawer tallying and Bank Deposits."
good,Learned various ways of providing customer satisfaction.
good,"I really like being able to help people and I got lots of opportunity to do just that. Many people want to call into the call center and complain about their service, but when they got me, they may have come in like a lion, but they went out like a lamb. My co-workers became like family because we spent so much time together. The hardest part of the job was when customers didn't give me the opportunity to help them as much as I could have."
good,"A typical day was to follow up with current book of business/clients and making sure their advertising needs/goals were being met. Aslo, on top of keeping those current clients happy, we were responsible for looking and seeking new potential clients. It was a great company to work for, from learning all of the endless amount of audiences we could reach to learing the terminology in the advertising arena. I had several different managers, while I was at Time Warner. Some were great to work with and other were a bit more challenging. Either way, learned from each and every one of them. The hardest part of the job, was to convince companies to move or give us a part of their TV Advertising Budget from our competitors. However, with the affordability and various audiences that we had, we had a lot of happy clients advertising their products and services on Time Warner Cable."
good,I'm seeking another position so that I can further my career
good,"This is a great company to work for, and retire from if you get the chance. Promotional opportunities are always available, just remember to stay current with broadband/cable technologies by enrolling in NCTI. I worked in a customer service role in the call center. At times the beaurocracy was difficult to handle, but the overall mood of the center and having great co-workers helped dispell a lot of that politicking. If you ever get a chance to get your foot in the door here, take it. Ever since leaving I've regretted it because the comraderie and benefits are (so far) unparalleled."
good,Typical workday was very enjoyable for the most part. I had a great team that took a lot of pride in delivering superior customer service to our subscribers. Management was very open and team oriented. Nothing seemed hard about the job because of all of these factors; although there were many very challenging obstacles to overcome as is with any leadership role. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a great team that always went above and beyond for our customers.
good,I worked for Time Warner for a year then I went back to school. But I learned a lot working there and its a great company to work for.
good,"A typical day at work taking care of customers making sure everything that they need will be taken care of , mainttain a positive upbeat attitude and inage at all times, interact positively to a variety of co-workers and customers , willing to assis co-workers , willingle takes on new responsibilities the hardest part of the job is trying to find out why something happen ad no one can explain it the most enjoyable part of the job is when everything works out ok and the customer is happy"
good,"My days involved finding interesting human interest stories in Southern California for Time Warner Cable's ""So Cal's Best"" broadcast. I would travel to the subject or story, shoot video and interviews and occasionally record a reporters stand-up. Back in the edit bay, I would write the story around all my footage and edit together a shorter and longer version of the story for air on channel 101 and Video On-Demand. Management and co-workers were always very helpful and supportive. The hardest part of the job was finding those little ""gems"" in So Cal that no one knew about. It was very rewarding when a story was finished and aired."
good,"TWC is a great company to work for with excellent benefits and wages. I've been employed with them for 17 years and they have been ,overall,great to work with. Training in some areas or positions is lacking greatly while other positions training is way overdone. If I had it all over to do with I'd still work for them again."
good,"Bright house is an amazing company to work for. They focus on making sure that the employees are not only up date on product knowledge and training, they make sure they offer competitive benefits and a caring workplace. Rewarding those impact players for the above and beyond work while still showing appreciation to all employees."
good,I am very productive. My coworkers are fun. We use to get free lunches.
good,"Free cable, discount for other services that time warner cable offers. Great benefits. Pays well."
good,This was a great company with regards to the value of believing in its employees.
good,Really great benefits and a great company. They pay really well and offer raise with preformance.
good,only left because i relocated. great company to work for.
good,"Not sure why, but after working 11 yrs for Time Warner and 32 years in the industry someone just decide that my time was up. Not sure what went wrong or just that I was at that age and they though it was time for me to leave."
good,"Time Warner Cable in Charlotte, NC is a great place to work.  In my role there I was collaborating with Security, Management, Facility, vendors and fully supported the onboarding and Visa processes with hiring contractors. It was a pleasure to work with everyone there.  I was highly trusted and well-liked here. People depended on me everyday and I truly appreciated each person and the time I had been employed with the company right up until it was sold to Lighthouse and Spectrum."
good,Great company to work for. Great benefits and rewarding work. Colorado has limited job advancement opportunities in the Denver area. Most of the jobs are related to Engineering with the exception of the billing center in Colorado Springs.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,A typical work day would be very productive and challenging.  I learned a deeper of knowledge of customer service.  Learning customer Satisfaction and how to trouble shoot customer issues.  I learned some aspects of installation and customer support.  Learning to use other types of computer programs such as on a Ipad as well.
good,"Good work place, good team work and good management, had to leave due to a relocation of the company, otherwise I will work there for while. Very decent pay for the job market."
good,A great place to work. Always had fun activities to keep the staff engaged and happy. The benefits are great too. Halloween was fun. There are opportunities to work overtime and earn much more.
good,With a difficult call type spectrum does a great job of allowing its supervisors to create their own dynamic. By doing so each team is different and culture/ people working there make the job that much more enjoyable.
good,"Great place..great health care pricing, lowest medical deductible (they pay 700)..very friendly environment. Full cafe.  They work with you till you succeed. Definitely move up in higher rolls."
good,"Charter is a great place to work. Great management, Leadership and people. Only down fall i see is having the ability to hold people accountable and very little testing of new systems expected to us. "
good,"Very pleasant environment.  Everyone willing to help you which interms make you want to do your best.  Best job I ever had......Loved, Loved, Live working there!"
good,"Spectrum will give you all the tools and training you need in order to be the best trained professional... In other words, you will become a professional in your field... You will get full benefits from the moment you start working... You will get monthly bonus and yearly raises... You will get free college education if you wish to advance in your career..."
good,Loved working there very fast pace. Competitive and works hard. If ut not fit for the job or scared of hights dont go for it bc that is 99.9% of the job.
good,"The management team is very helpful, the workplace culture is relaxed and the hardest part of the job is the repetitive calls everyday. The benefits offered by the company are very competitive."
good,"When I applied to a call center I was nervous since I had no experience in this, but the trainers are great and made learning the curriculum fun and easy."
good,"Overall, the best job I've had.  This job does require teamwork.  If you're not a team player then please don't apply.  The team out of my office was great!  We had each other's back.  Occasionally, we had to work over and if another guy was free he'd come assist you.  Overtime is required, usually, only (after bad storms, fires, etc.). You will ride with someone until a training date is setup for you.  Training was 3 to 4 weeks, I believe with free lunches at nearby restaurant.  It can be fast paced at times but, do each job right the first time and move on.  Management was great!  They've been in the field doing what techs do.  They know how frustrating and dirty it can be sometimes.  If you get stuck at a job scratching your head, call them.  Usually, they can help you over the phone, if not, they'll drive to you and stay till the job is completed."
good,good place to work for would very good manager and supaviser and co workers like being out by self some houses were horrible to go into some was great
good,"I left Spectrum for another job and it was a huge mistake. I wish Spectrum would reconsider me for employment, the best job I have ever had."

good,"Is a good enviornment supervisors will help you a lot specially when you are doing your job. The rules is no gossip if they catch you gossiping you get a verbal wich prevents drama and bigger problems. Yes, like any other job they're some favoritism but you can't tell that much in any place you will find that. Overall is a good pay for the right amount of responsibility. Is sad that I had to leave love working there but it was due to medical HR help me as much as they can"

good,Spectrum has a very supportive management team. A typical day of work would consist of reviewing current promotions and implementing strategies for reaching personal daily goals.
good,Spectrum provides a great work experience. Although the call center floor can become a bit loud it is the norm of a call center in my experience. They definitely like to promote from withing however positions rarely open up.
good,Great job with awesome job opportunities and pay. Advancement  and pay is in your hand.  Your performance and customer satisfaction will dictate on how fast you move up and how much you pay will increase.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,"Great company to work for to include all the benefits. Typical work day included self managing Salesforce funnel and appointment schedule. Would call in and check in with management on any issues, otherwise, it was primarily maintaining relations with customers and current on going projects to include current project manager updates. The workplace culture and atmosphere was up beat and quick pace with short term periods to cover many on going projects with construction and the installation teams. The hardest part of the job was the multi-tasking of sales and installations and multiple departments. The most enjoyable part of the job was the completing task of an installation and the commissions."

I loved everything about this job, I only left because I wanted to advance to a higher position within the company, but the school schedule interfered with the work schedule. Decided to leave, in good terms, so that when I get my degree I have the possibility to go back to Spectrum."
good,At Spectrum you feel like you have a professional family. The environment is very laid back .I love competing against other teams. Always making sure I'm the best on my team.  Fastest AHT while still taking as much time as it takes to upgrade or retain customer. Some think its all about the number of calls you take. I think more importantly Its what you make out of the call your on.
good,"The training is very therough, fun place to work and make lots of money, it is aggressive sales, so you can not grow a conscious about selling an 93 year old woman high speed internet or this is not the job for you."
good,"Great company to work for free to discounted service. 1 hr lunch breaks, holidays, sick days and vacation days. Benefits start the next full month from when you start."
good,"New experiences , get to meet  different people, great job experiences. hours of operations are great and they do offer overtime when available. great leadership."
good,"I've started with Time Warner Cable before they merged to Spectrum. The company offers excellent benefits to all employees.

Overall, the best part was working with the customers."
good,"Spectrum is a good job or career to get in we work 4days on 3 days off usually work outdoors sometimes it’s hot or cold could be humid and dry or soaking in the rain, we deal with dogs,cats ,rodents, spiders and wasps daily, big attics to crawl space attics, and basements.

good,"I loved assisting customers with there problems and resolving their issues.  They would call to ask for an explanation of their bill.  I had to assure an verify the person calling was authorized to access the account before releasing information.  The company would reward your if you met your metrics by hosting a award ceremony monthly."
good,Great company to work for with even better coworkers. The most enjoyable part of this job for me is creating a excellent experience for each and every customer.
good,"Following the Merger of Time-Warner Cable, Charter and Bright House Networks, the new Spectrum Enterprise organization has worked to standardize our products over the national footprint and bring value to our clients.  Some practices have been re-defined to bring consistency to employment and client experiences.  Overall the new organization is a stronger company and is highly competitive across Residential, small business and Enterprise customers."
good,"Being a part of the cable industry there were lots of opportunities to travel,relocate and to enjoy some of the benefits associated with working for such a large Fortune 500 company."
good,I enjoyed my nine years at Spectrum.I was able to grow and see growth within myself.This place seemed more like a home for me and some of my peers. Thanks
good,"I worked with Charter Communications and focused on Spectrum (formerly known as Time Warner Cable). To be honest, I loved this job. Sure it was stressful at times, but the pay was fantastic, the benefits were unbeatable, and the supervisors did all they could to build success and team building. I regret that I had to move out of state and leave this company. I highly recommend them. The only issue I ever had with them was struggling as a single parent and balancing shift schedules/options with babysitting hours. You are able to change your schedules once you have met certain criteria and out bid others that had been there longer. It took time to obtain the shift that fits your own personalized life."
good,Spectrum is a well developed company which offers many jobs and is great to their employees over all I would recommend this job to anyone. Spectrum keep it up.
good,"The job involved troubleshooting video and internet equipment remotely, Other duties were involved as needed. Company provide excellent training and management support. Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,Great company I just didn’t enjoy what I was doing. I didn’t have any bad managers but call center work was just not for me. Also getting yelled at by and get customers all day sucked.
good,Chater spectrum is a phenominal place to work the people are informative and helpful in helping co workers understand all the fundamentals of being an employee very professional in a nice setting
good,"My Supervisor is the best in the world, she genuinely cares about her team. Everyone looks at each other like family, very supportive and friendly. Amazing company to work for all around."
good,"in bound sales position-very easy work selling communication services within the community/keep abreast of weekly, monthly goals. Team meetings are essential to keep motivated in fast paced environment. Incentives and goal orientated task keep the money flow accomplishable."
good,It was a good work place and relaxed with great co workers It was a outside job with I worked as a helper to my boss I would work on power lines mostly for example strapping the latch on and pulling the line is what I would do mostly
good,"I like Spectrum and I would recommend to a friend or family, Customers calling in about their billing and i would be the department that customers will speak to about billing, I will go over billing with customers and explain it and also apply credits as needed"
good,Working with all men is easy. I was the leader and I was in charge of 10 guys. Any problems they had with customer I had to resolved them. Collecting payments and dealing with customers was a lot experienced.
good,The Management and Colleagues are always so helpful and easy to approach.  They definitely had an open door policy which made the office atmosphere a great place to work.  They compensate well and overall great place to work.
good,very great place to work mgr where all very nice food in cafe was always good. i still conversate with mgrs and employees. the only thing i would say need changing is hours.
good,"Spectrum was a fun place to work. It was sometimes stressful, but what job isn't? I enjoyed taking to different customers everyday from all walks of life. The managers and supervisers did a great job in making sure all employees felt appreciated. We were always rewarded for our hard work."
good,I am really going to miss my job at Time Warner/ Spectrum.  I have grown to love my co-workers as a family.  My boss is very sweet and understanding.  I wish I was able to move with the company.
good,"Culture is the environment that surrounds you at work all of the time. Culture is a powerful element that shapes your work enjoyment, your work relationships, and your work processes.

good,"Es un ambiente agradable, proporcionan el material necesario para completar el trabajo"
good,Loved it. Everyone works together and problems are resolved in a timely and effective manner. So much to learn. Everything is always changing with new technology.
good,"Time Warner Cable by far was one of the best employers in western new york.I was employed 14 years in the tech support role.I don't know how the changes are with spectrum.The compensation was decent.You will make appx $14 to $15 per hour but they will train you for positions that make the $18 per hour. so you will do more than you are paid for but the upside are the benefits.The courtesy cable and the paid time off are exceptional.The ability to post for job advancements anywhere in the world is mind blowing.You literally could post for a job in Italy, Puerto Rico or in California.The key to this job is  Come  To work and you won't have problems.No bonuses. your raises will be about 22 cents per year but in buffalo, you are still making above the poverty line."
good,"This is by far the best group of people I've worked with while it was under the Bright House name. Had an atmosphere of fun and family, supervisors were awesome."
good,"Charter Spectrum is great place to work with opportunities to make a lot of money, great experience to meet all kind of people, some good some bad, mean dogs and loving dogs, rainy days hot days working for this  company is cool, of course you have quotas but one they have been met the money is great."

Management has been extremely positive and want to see and help people succeed."
good,"My typical day at work was fully of excitement, You didn't know what type of customer you were going to encounter next. I adapted and excelled. I learned that you cant take anything personal when it came to dealing with the public. I like the management a lot the were very understanding and very helpful. I loved the environment I worked in. The people were great no time of work place issues. The hardest part of the job was, if you are thin-skinned, dealing with the public. Customers can get harsh but they are only frustrated with the issue not you. As soon as you realize that the job will become easier. The most enjoyable part was the commissions. Knowing that you are getting paid extra to better assist a customers internet and cable services by giving them the upgrades they needed made the job worth it"

I learned new systems such Icoms, OMSE, Remedy ticket system, ServAssure, Nyroc, Unified, and many other applications to monitor networks. management is empowering, they always looking for a ways to make things easy, whenever you are in acall for long, they approach and offer assistance. co-workers are upbeat network professionals, each brings a different strengh to the team, that in turn, it is what makes us strong.

good,"Management and supervisors are involved with employees to ensure their success. Teamwork environment. A lot of incentives to motivate employees. It's a longer work day, 9 hrs, but you get 1 hr lunch. I'm currently seeking employment because it's not a good fit for me. The technical aspect of the job, troubleshooting equipment, is not for me. I am very grateful for the opportunity they have given me but in the long run I would thrive better in a career providing medical support services and benefit my employer more as well."
good,"As corporations buy out others, policies change and management get scared and think they will be punished for not exceeding max sales in order to remain employed, thus making life harder on every frontline employee. As these fictous fears become reality, they lash out at each other and create social barriers between their local company to improve productivity. This is what happens when the enterprise becomes competitive instead of casual, creating war between two. If these factors didn't exist and pay was shared equally and as fairly as possible we would last forever"
good,Everyday a busy day at work at time warner cable. Great knowing on a daily basis I'm educating customers on new things they never knew.
good,"The typical day at Time Warner Cable consisted of taking at least 80-100 calls per day. I learned that you can be efficient and productive at the same time.

The best part of my Job is the ability to assist people in doing theirs, training and support. I have learned so much about the IT world, I would have never thought I would have learned.

good,I loved working for TWC. The pay was great and the hours were amazing. True sales environment. I learned how to sale and compete with the best in the nation.
good,"A typical work day was coming into work about 10 to 15 minutes early. There was a time to settle in and supervisor would inform us of any trends for the day or any issue's we would possibly have to deal with. Great co-workers as there was a family vibe and everyone was easy to get along with and especially management as they were fair and understanding. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers when there was a issue with a hub which hampered service for some areas. This was called outages and they could last anywhere from 4 hours to 24 hours, and usually affected a large area. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping a customer lower their bill or set up new services tv, phone, or internet. Speaking to different people was also enjoyable."
good,Management takes care of employees.  Benefits package is top notch!  Never a dull moment.  Charter is very supportive of keeping current with technology and stresses the importance of maintaining certificaitons.

good,"Like any call center a typical day at work starts with taking calls all day and ends the same way. The management is excellent! They always showed that they valued they're employees and their hard work. The atmosphere was always fun and management worked hard to keep it that way. So all the employees got along and worked as a team to give each other pointers and help each other succeed. The hardest part about the job was of course it was repetitive. And management was always pushing for more, naturally. As far as sales go to them there are no such things as slow days. The most enjoyable part of the job was all the games, bonuses, and prizes. We were always having pizza parties, provided by management of course, cookouts, and days where management provided lunch. The benefits of this job were great. Since TWC teams up with other companies you are given discounts from places like att on your bill, or at golds gym, just to name a few. Since of course TWC is a cable company the floor has several tvs on each wall. They encourage that you watch tv while you work. They consider it on the job training since you're learning about the products you're selling. Lastly you get everything free from TWC. You get cable, tv, security system for your home, and internet for free!! So where as most people would pay around $150 for the cable and all that comes with it like all movie channels TWC employees get it free."

My fellow Co-workers were great to work with, we all worked as a tight unit. Our supervisor was always willing to work with us and listen to our concerns.

It was enjoyable to complete a job and give the customer satisfaction, either and install, T/C, Upgrade or Downgrade."

In the retention department it would overcoming objectives and giving a good understanding on the services and the reason why they should stay with us.

Serving employees and vendors can make a difference in how they view the company/management and the HR group . I had a great boss, she was my mentor. Every time you stepped in her office was an opportunity to learn something. Because it was a small group in HR we always had to work together helping each other out every day.

We all depending on each other to deal with unhappy customers to the best of our ability.  We did not have steady management during my 4 years of employment, however, whomever we did have for a manager, we made them apart of the family.  The job itself was not that hard at all and because I viewed my co-workers as my family, we had our moments where days were challenging for us to get along. At the end of the day, we realized that we had a job to do and if we valued it, we needed to buckle down and do it."

good,it is a great place to work I was paid right and received goo pay and discounts the call from the customer can be difficult but its easy to learn how to manage

Hardest part of job was meeting all metric levels consistently and still effectively assist customers, The best part of job was helping said customers and receiving thank you,"
good,I really enjoy working at spectrum there is a wonderful management team my supervisor is great sup he is always be willing to work with you and teach you anything you need to know. The progression system is great and work at your own pace. I highly recommend working at spectrum.
good,"Spectrum is a great easy company to work with. Billing deparment is very chilled back. Very good pay and no comission needed, but if you make a sale kuddos to you!"
good,"You make your own schedule and it is up to you to hit your numbers. You get a newly assigned territory monthly, which you are to go door to door and sell internet, phone, and cable services."
good,I have enjoyed working at Spectrum. I have had wonderful management. I have learned that you can work with people to reach end decisions by listening and expressing empathy. At the start of my career I worked with customers. Through the years I have moved through the industry working one on one with techs and support with management and supervisors.

good,Amazing I had a fun time hours sucked. I don't know what else to write but that and they gave me minimum idc about the job. im not missing out on my child life.
good,I wish I could relocate and go back to work there. I think being in a call center environment can be stressful.  However Charter gave us tools and even had employee week where they would feed us lunch and we had time off the phones to play games. All the tools were there for us to do our jobs. When I was hired  we had 2 weeks paid vacation accrued.  and after 90 days you can sign up for their benefits packages. I loved the ability to have a flexible schedule. Lets say I had a doctors appoint on a day I could do a shift swap with  someone who had the same credentials.

good,"Working for spectrum is great if you are looking for a reliable steady paced job, I would definitely recommend this job to someone looking for and is okay with sitting in an office. Great pay and GREAT management."

good,"The culture and the pay at spectrum was great. Management needs work. Very picky supervisors, and also unprofessional as well.  Just need to be a little more transparant"
good,they are lovely. they have a great staff and a great build behind the company. there is so much support behind the company. if i wasn't let go i would have never of left.

My experience had been primarily customer service, and data entry; so I wanted to expand my experience to gain an advantage. Within just a few months, I was promoted to a Subject Matter Expert, and I assisted frequently with new hires and team building exercises. I was considered an expert in Video Repair even though I was only a tier I. Management was wonderful and understanding. They pushed and supported me into more Supervisor type roles, and trained me to become a Supervisor. I only left the career due to family medical issues that required my attention in another state."
good,"A typical day at work would involve me getting to work earlier then shift, to allow  me time to log into all systems.  First i would check my email and then start taking incoming calls. the workplace environment was call center with minimal supervision. The most enjoyable thing about working for spectrum was helping the customers solve there cable phone and internet problems. The hardest part of the job was getting customer to purchase more services during time when there services where not working due to outages."
good,this job is wonderful. the pay is great and the people are nice the only real downside is that the customers can be nasty. I have dealt with very irate customers but as long as you know how to work them down its not that bad. the job is great.
good,I enjoyed the traveling and working for Spectum. I had a lot fun meeting new people and helping them get there services. The pay was good too. Good place to work .

You also get to take the van home on a daily basis. The workplace culture is great. The hardest part about the job is that you have to deal with different  elements of the weather and attics. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting the free cable services.
good,I have no idea who spectrum is. It may be the workers comp company from O’charley but doubt it. Again I have no idea who this is. If this is turner broadcasting it was the best job I have ever had. I worked there 11 years and loved it. I was promoted to supervisor after a year and would have stayed but moved out of town for family.
good,My boss took a risk on me and he gave me the opportunity of a life time when he offered me the position. The company has great local leaders and the company is constantly experiencing good change for the better. I am a happy employee and I am extremely satisfied with my leadership.
good,Spectrum allowed me to realize certain talents that I did not know I had and I am really happy I said yes to Spectrum. I love my co-workers we are one big family.

I learned how to not take it personal when customers call in irate, because their bad mood isn't towards me; but the situation.  Learning that was the hardest part of the job.

good,A typical work day at Spectrum is basically interacting with customers and doing installs of cable and internet. But you should always make sure that the customer is happy.

I told my supervisor when hired that I would be one of his top three performers, and I was chosen as one of three people to be able to work from home after a period of time due to work performance. I loved my job, but after they relocated, they took away the work from home program because we were too far away and I could not relocate at that time."

good,"Spectrum is  a great place to work if you don't want to talk to your customers, if you were on the phone for more than 10 minutes management was coming over to you asking you if you needed help with something and to get your customer off the phone, we were working with elderely people and sometimes they didn't even know what a router or modem was, so they couldn't get off the phone."

And in doing that time I will travel to the main  office downtown to take files down to those guys. Also did a lot of answering other phones and filing.
good,great place to work and tons of growth great benefits loved training and the trainers and staff are amazing...........................................
good,"I have worked here for over 3 years,  I love the people and the team I work on under Field Operations.  I have had 2 or 3 new bosses over the years and I will love coming to work daily"
good,"this is by far the best job I have ever had. the pay is lovely, while the dress code if strictly business casual, they are pretty forgiving in other areas such as hair, piercings, tattoos."
good,"Charter/Spectrum sincerely cares for their employees, and they show it having one of the best benefit packages I've seen. Low cost benefits, free cable, internet and home phone services, $5k a year for college, and outstanding 401k and retirement package."

It was a career that I enjoyed going to work every day and would not have changed one minute of it. The education and independence of the job was and amazing life experience I will always cherish.
good,Really hate I had to relocate to an area that does not have this company. They put their money where their mouth is and value their employees.The day to day work environment was like no other place i've ever been employed. This is a career company. Not just a job

good,"This has by far been my favourite job,  the calls can be stressful at times how ever the assistance from team members as well as managers makes it much more tolerable"
good,"The day to day is generally about the same, call after call of internet or phone related problems. The customers are unique and you should have a flexible personality. Meaning you should be able to adjust to just about anyone. Management is an open door and is always tentative to agent needs. Every day offers new challenges with the issues that arise and the changes in the workplace. Even after 2 years there is still more to learn. It keeps things interesting. Most of the agents seem to be very nerdy and get along very well. Its a great place to meet people and make new friends. Expect the culture to be very positive. Its very rare you'll hear of an interaction where someone was talked down to. If you are good at the job, you are rewarded for your efforts, if not there are always people willing to help guide you if you are willing to put in the effort. Mostly show up to work on time, everyday and do your best, you'll be fine."

For those who want to be part of the telecom industry in a way that matters this is a great place to start."

good,"Charter Communications is a telecommunications company, and can much be compared to Comcast. They both provide internet, phone and cable service. I worked at one of their call centers for about 6 months, in the customer service department. When first hired you go into a training class, and you are in training for about 5 weeks. There, you learn to answer the phone with a script and you learn about various services that Charter has to offer. Then after 3 weeks you actually practice taking live calls. Of course, the first one call I ever look scary. But after a few days it was a breeze. There is definitely a lot of different reasons a customer may be calling in, so there is a lot of ""learn as you go"". Overall pretty easy job, all you do is answer phones. You have to have a thick skin, as there are just unbelievably rude/angry people out there that may call you names. However, always remember to try put yourself in their shoes, try your best to help and it's not always your fault. Charter offers really great benefits, they really take care of you and there are plenty of  perks to take advantage of."

The management requires a large amount of trust to be built between them and the techs, but when that trust is built, they don't micro manage and they encourage employees to grown and learn. However, if you misuse that trust, they will make life tough, as they should. They are perfectly fair and I've never had a bad experience with any of them. The hardest part of the job can be the customers. There's 1% that are simply impossible to satisfy and that one or two instances can sometimes ruin a day, but typically it's not as bad. Often, the job can get extremely complex for anyone who's new to the industry.

One of the most important things to do is listen and ask questions that are key to resolving any issue or concern and be honest. If you don't know, advise you will find out. Even though I was not the technician who installed the service, I can still help them. The hardest part of the job is to remain professional when they approach you on your lunch break, but rewarding when the customer you follow through with will stand in line and wait for you to be one they prefer . It was very common for us at the front counter to build professional relationships with our customers."
