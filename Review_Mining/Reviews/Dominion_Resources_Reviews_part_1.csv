bad,"Get job assignment, review work package. support craft on QC hold points and enter into logs for notifications."
bad,"All promotions are based on budget, and not on production abilities and accomplishments.  Annual bonus is rarely provided at the contracted amount.  There are no team functions, no holiday parties, or any other company wide events provided to employees."
bad,Would not recommend this place to work due to ethics and moral behaviors. CEO had mood swings and outbursts. Employees had concerns with being paid for work completed.
bad,"Nuclear plant - good place to work. Strong Values, good comp/benefits."
bad,Was a great place to work until parent company came in and decided to outsource the Pittsburgh Division of Dominion Retail. All Pittsburgh employees lost their jobs.
good,"Doing daily checks of power plant systems, co-workers were great management was ok, the hardest part of this job was trying to balance work and family. The best part was the daily challenges."
good,Relatively boring job with great training and compensation.  With all security boring is good.  I worked alongside some great people who worked as a team to see theirs and my success.  The hardest part of the job was ensuring you were alert and ready for anything and nothing.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the great pay and many days off.
good,Hard to maintain a good work/life balance in the position I held.  After hours work expected.  Be prepared to live on campus during any major storms due to power outages.
good,I would recommend Dominion to others. There is plenty of opportunity to grow. Most of the careers are fun and you look forward to going to work every day.
good,Dominion is a great company with that values their employees and a work/life balance.
good,Good company but room for advancement is limited.  The company is very high on safety and family life.  Work environment is very good but some of the management is much to be desired.
good,"Bad situation - lay offs and the lack of opportunity for career advancement.  At that time, the organization was down sizing, laying people off and advancement was non-existent."
good,Great place to work with executive management that knows what needs done. Great culture focused on safety and teamwork. My typical day involves fielding calls and emails from users having issues.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was creating customer/client added value and to be effective in assisting other organizations with reaching its goals and objectives.
good,"The people in the IT department were great to work with."
good,"Dominion Resources is in most cases a fast-paced, safety-minded place to work. One never knows what to expect when he/she arrives at work. The jobs are extremely diverse, including: Electrical, Heating and Air maintenance, mold removal, painting, laying carpet, and even animal control. Generally, the Chain-of-Command runs very efficiently. Only on few occasions did it go way off course, Education is highly stressed, time-in-service is not even considered in job promotions no matter how good a worker is. Management, as a whole, is excellent. They know their jobs well and it shows by the productivity of those under them. Again, there are exceptions. Most of the time they will leave one alone as long as the job is being done safely. Co-workers usually work well together with only a few altercations. For the most part, there were no real hard parts of the job other than occasionally having to fit into extremely tight spaces to accomplish a job. The location of the office building on the James River was the best part of the job to me with a close second of the kindness and support of the executive staff and the other employees at Dominion Resources/Dominion Virginia Power. I learned a great deal at Dominion. Not only in how to perform my job, but, also on how to interact with people, both at and away from work."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at Dominion.  Being electrically oriented, I felt that this was a perfect jobfit for me.  It was very enlightening to see the application of the technologies used in the Industrial World to the Power Industry."
good,Dominion was a nice place to work at. They treated everyone fairly. Family meant a great deal to the company. You were paid well and the benefits were good. It almost felt like you were working as a family.
good,A great Company to work for. Professional Management and Employees. Team Work is a plus with this Company! Every Day a new Challenge was faced and met!
good,"GREAT.  I enjoy the contact with the tenants and solving problems.  Arranging for repairs and working with many schedules can be complicating sometimes, but work the results."
good,"Recommend working for Dominion. Great people who work together well. Forward thinking management, providing interesting work and opportunities to grow and advance in the company."
good,"I work in IT and have seen the company go through many technology changes in a short amount of time.  We have a dedicated team of workers in a variety of different IT roles.  IT is one of the main core departments that is always on the leading edge of technology.  Our mission for our internal and external clients is to always keep the company and all it's data safe, secure and available.  There are many policy compliance rules we must follow on Company, State and Federal levels.  NERC & FERC policies are always creating secure guidelines to keep all data safe & secure.  We always have to be on the look out for vulnerabilities or cyber attacks.  Our team plans and works together to meet all customer expectations in a timely manner.   My current role allows me to analyze what hardware and software our employees need.  We must utilize existing equipment to save money, but also, keep all hardware and software up to date.  Overall, I love being in a position where I'm always learning about new technology."
good,"I loved working here. The atmosphere is great for fostering productivity as well as friendships. Everyone is happy to be there, management was great. I learned that organization, punctuality, and reliability will go a long way."
