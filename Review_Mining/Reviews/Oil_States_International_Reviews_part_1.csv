bad,Don’t come here if you don’t want waste your time . They have a team and they are very lazy .You will the one is working hard but you get nothing to return . Manager always want you make more but the team will kill you down . You don’t have much choices. Because you are just one person .They can make more but you won’t.They try many way to break you .
bad,Would not recommend anyone to work here if you have a family if your single and want to make some “some” money ok might be alright but for what they want you to do it is way under pay also good place to work if you love drama because most of what I seen in my years there was drama for being such a big company it is ran like a mom and pop shop where left hand doesn’t know what right hand is doing also if you love new rules and SOP every week or two a great place for that they say one thing then a week later want you to do it this way
bad,"I would not recommend this place as a permanent job unless you don't mind only being home 2 hrs a day, never seeing your family, don't mind others raising your kids because you don't have time to, don't mind that the pay is way under what it should be for the amount of work they expect from you, with constant changing rules (daily)"
bad,Management only cares about them selves. You will get laid off at some point. Very poor communication. If thing are good they love you to death. When they are slow you get treated as if you are a bourdon to them . Lots of dead weight.
bad,"This place is a total joke! Corporate and district management is horrible. The pay sucks, the schedule sucks and they treat there employees like trash."
bad,"I seen first hand if your not part of the click then your just a NUMBER!!! They put procedures in place to be followed only when it benefits the managers!!! Asked several times for things to be changed, so I make the change to accommodate what equipment is needed and get canned for it. And the sad part is that I was not the only one doing it and management knew about it!!!"
bad,You'll be promised the world at the interview then you'll come out meet all goals set in front of you to move up only to be told they are working on getting you a raise then you'll see new employees with no experience come in and make more then you there is no room for advancement I was there 2 years and never seen a raise until the day I told them I'm quiting because of that situation
bad,The work is easy and the heat wasn't to bad. The problem with the company is you are not nobody unless you are up top or family. Its like the saying goes its not who you know its who you blow. Management sucks and so does HR.
bad,Layoffs without warning even though they are aware. Only concerned about manager bonuses.
bad,They do not care about their employees. You are only a number to them. Upper management will lie to you and HR will always side with them. Pay is low and not enough hours and lack of communication is horrible
bad,"Benefits are amazing but, the management in the machine shop is nearly impossible to work for. Management is constantly putting down employees and refuses to be honest with employees. Machine shop manager is trying to force out the machinists to hire less qualified buddies at higher pay."
bad,"People I worked with were great, very large company. Managment is inexperienced at what they do and show alot of favortism to friends. this is at the Watsontown, Pa facility. other facilities may be different. No matter how good you are at your job or what you do, the company don't really give a s**it about you !!!!!!!!!"
bad,Too many hours then all of a sudden there are no hours.  Management is terrible.  No one knows what any one else is doing in management.  Not enough policy enforcement
bad,Your Day at work is long hours and you learn to be very attentive all day and learn how to make crucial decisions after being awake long hours. The work environment is very Unforgiving. A mistake can cost peoples lifes. The most enjoyable part of working for the company was You make your own decisions and are basically your own boss while on the job.
bad,"For what there looking for the pay scale is too low you might get $20hr to start but you won't be getting any raises . "
bad,"I do not wish to elaborate about this company i just thank this company for the opportunity and the experience that came along with it.."
good,You will be working 50 hrs a week minimum. They will pressure you to work more than the 50. Also the hottest time of the year they go to mandatory 6- 12s. Plus a required 15 min meeting every morning . Clock in before 4:45 am clock out 5 pm.1 Break 1 lunch. It is always hot. It will be even hotter in the summer months . Much hotter inside than out even when it's 105 outside. It's hotter inside.
good,They do not appreciate hard workers . They will work you to death . It doesn't make sense to work so many hours in a week . It's no wonder why they have a big turn over .
good,The only reason i'm not still working there is I was hurt on the job by another employee.  I was on workmans comp for a year and when I cleared to come back to work they was having layoffs.
good,"For the most part this is a pretty great company to work for.  They really do care about their employees (at least it seems as much) and they promote the family atmosphere.  However, when it actually comes time to paying a competitive wage, they'd rather beat you out of it."
good,"I learned that no one customer wants anything the same. Every crane i designed was completely different electrically. "
good,"Work life is not so great, but the benefits are good. There is not advancement in any field in the company. People are great, but management needs improving."
good,i have been there for enough time to know what im suppose to do every day. my day goes fast there because i like what i do. some people might not like it

Reviewed analyses of activities, costs, and operations data to determine division progress toward stated goals."
good,Hay trabaje hace tiempo solo que no me gustava el orario
good,Same company as OSES.  Oil States International and Oil states Energy Services are the same conglomerate.
good,"Vast resources, structured environment, many different divisions for business expansion. Opportunity to grow or move between companies within Oil States International. The hardest part of the job was response times to customers needs was hindered by management channels."
good,When they cut salaries for corporate gain it is time to move on.they lost alot of good employees.management got taken the worst.
good,This is an overall good place to work. I didn't like the fact that it utterly consumed my life. Some of the managers especially the upper management need lesson of compassion.

good,enjoy the time I spent working there. This is a very competitive place to work. would love to be employed there again one down
good,"I currently travel all over the world maintaining, installing and repairing the products our company manufactures.  The people here are great to work for and will help any way they can with anything they can.  It is very demanding with a lot of time spent away from home and family.  They pay is unbelievable and I get to see the world at someone else's expense but I am looking to spend more time at home."

good,"I learned a lot working here and the more I learned the more I was respected and treated very nicely, The hours kept me on the road a lot but the managers were lenient and understood that I had children so they tried to keep me close to home whenever possible, and if you needed time off it was given without question.
