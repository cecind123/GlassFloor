rating,review
bad,I love my job as a Machine operator and every day I look for to going to work. It is a very stressful job and the supervisors I work for are very hard to work with. I am a very strong person and operator with high productive outcome but I feel the way they do things can be unfair to many including myself. It is a very unorganized company. But I love to operate.
bad,"No benefits, they have their favorites there and if your not one of them you will know it a.s.a.p, breaks are not long enough, lots of drama with the leads and managers!"
bad,"Used to be a great place to work--- Employees benefits are being cut more and more, work is being shipped overseas and layoffs have begun. Temps are replacing full time employees for lower pay. Terrible morale among workers, depressing atmosphere--all about getting the numbers for no compensation. No future here!"
bad,The worst place I have ever been. I relocated to daytona at my own expense and lasted 1 week as a tech and I am a degeed engineer !
bad,Energizer is a great company to work for and it I had not bee laid off I would still be there
bad,"While most employees at this company are ""very good people,"" unfortunately some in management and HR are extremely unethical, and will lie to you! This has created a toxic culture thus violating their company rules! There's no excuse for lying to people. Period!  I've never worked with unethical people in my other workplaces like this company."
bad,"a typical day at work  is getting up 4.oo every morning shower,fix my lunch. crank up my car.clocking in see where i am on the schedule.put my lunch bag up and get where am suppose to be.to get along with others, poor management, getting up 4.00.coming home4.oo every day."
bad,"Horrific, toxic work culture and environment. Micromanagement from above and fearfulness in making decisions due to retribution. No autonomy given for decisions -- everything must be reviewed and approved by upper management."
bad,Energizer bought us  from spectrum brands and it went downhill from there. Started paying a whole lot more for less benefits. Point system was horrible if you were legitimately sick or just missed. Management there never made sense and was firing people were very minor offenses. If you gave a 2 week notice they walked you out the next day. I quit just in time don't work there!
bad,The most toxic work culture I have experienced in a very long and productive career. Micromanaged work force and a very distrustful upper management. No autonomy given to the workforce. Very demotivating and terrible place to work.
bad,"good job to make some quick money"
bad,"my experience  was pleasent but my Position was outsorced "
bad,energizer a acheter johnson et johnson pour fermer montreal
bad,Lot's of opportunity but poor leadership and commitment from senior mgmt.  As such there is little progress on needed operational improvement initiatives
bad,"Poorly managed, outdated machinery, 0 loyalty to employees. liked the people I worked with and got to like the job until being layed off because the company decided to farm out the 4A battery lines."
bad,"The past several years have been one round of layoffs after another.  With declining category sales, the only way to make profit is to keep cutting their workforce and replacing people with lower salary alternatives.  They no longer invest in innovation nor colleagues.  Don't plan to ""keep going"" here for long.  People who end up being successful are only those who can play the political game."
bad,"Una excelente escuela "
bad,"I worked there for almost one year and was so busy I never got anything accomplished. From what I could tell all the jobs there was not like this though. When you are responsible for 2 plants it is impossible to ever get caught up. I don't want to talk bad about the company, but I could never for the life of me figure why anyone would think the job I had could be done even half way with only one person when just a short few years before there were at least 5 people doing the same job, and had all the same responsibilities. Most of the people I worked with or around all were good people and for the most part laid back. Honestly I wish they would have realized that no one worth much would have continued in the position I was in for too long, because no matter who you are or your work ethics, you will burn out when you are constantly stretched very thin. I still talk to the person who took my place and they feel the same way and looking for something different already and they have only been there a little over 2 months. However I did gain some very valuable experience and used that to land a MUCH better position with better pay and I am able to actually get things accomplished. "
bad,"They give you a written over anything. They don't explain more than once what you have to do on the line so what that means is that if you don't learn fast this is not the job for you. Everyone tells you what you have to do, their isn't a leader watching over you until you learn. If you are good enough you get to take training on a posicion, that means more money ohh but don't expect to be paid when you finish your training. You will get paid when the leader remembers to sign the training and this other persons that certifies you in the position decides too as well. Benefits are really bad. No paid vacation. Not enough time on breaks. And some people are really rude. I don't recommend working here."
bad,"Flat rate pay and very rude people. No chance for career advancement or raises, nobody cares about you or your family. Your nothing but a number and that's how your treated, your easily replaced and they let you know it."
bad,In the beginning I worked on an assembly line and stood in one spot for long periods of time working at a very fast pace. My last position I operated 5 different machines so I moved at a fast pace as well but covered a large area where my machines were located. I learned how to work as a team player and to multitask at a fast pace. Management was fair and reasonable. My co-workers were willing to help. The hardest part of the job was doing change-overs and getting machines adjusted properly and when jams occurred cleaning up the mess that was made.
bad,This company is okay to work at while your trying to get a better job or just get by for now the management is terrible if you have an issue with something and bring it to there attention they don't like to help or try and fix the situation other than that it's okay some of the shift leads are pretty good.
bad,"Very low pay,  Management / Supervisors are always too busy and are very condescending.    The actual work is just fine.   They wonder why they cannot get most techs to take the jobs and or stay."
bad,"A traditional company with some aspects showing innovative idea's, but at the other end of the spectrum the company shows no initiative for company advancement, training or collaborating staff to provide a collective environment."
bad,Worked through a staffing company. I rode my bike down the dark highway for three hours to get there at 5 in the morning!! I got a toothache and had to go to the hospital and they took me off the schedule like I was noone to them
bad,Most of the IT management is not qualified for their positions.  There is a serious lack of integrity in the environment  and HR if clueless and useless.
bad,Energizer is a company dedicated to the wellbeing of their shareholders with a very rigid and antiquated operational structure. Employees at Energizer are disposable and not a priority.
bad,My co-workers at Energizer were one of a kind.  We worked hard together to get the job done.  This was an enjoyable place to work until they implemented 7/24 operations.  This really took a toll on colleagues family life and morale took a hit when this happened.  I worked for Energizer for 24 years until corporate decided to close our facility.
bad,• Successfully complete all jobs by time requested.
bad,"Energizer could be a good place to work IF they spent more time training employees and providing guidance. Very little diversity, with very little effort to improve"
bad,"Well if you had any issues with someone and you told the management or a supervisor they would just shrug it off and act like whatever is going on during you being at work didn't matter. "
bad,"Agree with previous reviewer.  Energizer is a sinking ship and you do not want to work here.  They are only staying in the US until they can get their overseas plants beefed up, then you will be without a job.  Marching like Sherman to the sea, Energizer is going to temp help  and outsourcing everything they can.  There is no job security at Energizer."
bad,"I worked at Energizer for two years, and during my time there I ran machines, input all the information into a computer, fixed jams in the machines, and unloaded all the batteries.I would get moved several times a night just because they didn't hire enough people for a shift, and  management never knew what they were doing. Even if this place opened back up I would never go back."
bad,"Great pay for the amount of work that you do and the air controlled environment you work in. Its clean and its typically cool in the building. Ever since the switch from rayovac to energizer the management staff has been writing up and pressuring all the staff under them. Moral was already low when it was rayovac due to the front office issues, but now that its Energizer their new people coming in are making the old employees nervous and it seems as if they are trying to prove their worth."
bad,"Energizer only cares about one thing, THEIR BATTERIES. They do not care about the wellbeing of their employees. We stand there for 12 hours and do the line and when the line is down you are not allowed to sit down while making boxes. They do not have any air circulation either."
bad,production line style work slow and steady working with small parts and ensuring quality. Independence is a must along with accountability in the workplace
bad,If you come in as a temp don't hold your breath. If no one likes ya you'll be on the outside looking in. Breaks ain't worth going to as it takes a min to walk to the break room(9 min) then wait to get you a drink (1 min) then leave 2 Min early to get back to your line. So basically only a 6 min break. Lunck time consists of eating fast so you can get back to work before they write you up when you're not at the line . then sometime they forget to call ya off so you waste your time and gas which you're not gonna get paid for. But don't worry the management friends gets to stay.
bad,The hours are long the pay remains the same know chance for advancement.It is for the lack of other words a dead end job that's why Im looking for a more fulfilling job
bad,A setup Mechanic for production equipment/with PM scheduled work/ trouble shooting equipment problems also processing.
bad,good work place a lot of work to do at times fast paced everybody was easy to get along with
bad,"It is a very testerone heavy environment.  The training is literally non-existent.  The CEO rules with fear.  However, the PTO & flex-time are the most enjoyable aspects of the job."
bad,"Work-life balance will vary by functional group.  Marketing & Category Management carry the organization and work longer hours.  Sales is pretty relaxed with less expectations and less expertise.  As a result the culture and productivity suffers when you don't have the same focus and accountability across all functions."
bad,"Relance clients et impayés, Commercialisation et proposition des différents produits auprès d’une clientèle de professionnels. Gestion des commandes, des reliquats, des retours et avoirs."
bad,"Good company to work for.  The plant that I am at now, management is only worried about cost savings. The higher ups don’t listen or do anything about problems with machinery that are brought up from employees until it’s too late and causes a panic to be replaced or fixed.  The employees do take care of each other and the pay is good. Health concerns due to air exhaust fans not running."
bad,"I've learned how hard it is to live on a small amount of pay per hr. The work is tolerable but the money is not worth what was paid. I think we ought to be paid more than what we were. Making money was the easy part, the hard part was being broke and working paycheck to paycheck."
bad,"Bonne entreprise, mais le travail déborde souvent le soir et les week end."
bad,The hardest part of the job with this company was if you are a hard worker they would work you harder to make up for the other employees who were not up to a task. The company had many leadership courses but leadership skills were rarley used.
bad,"No diversity if you know what I mean... don't like outside the box thinkers. ..that's why I look elsewhere"
bad,"Trabalhávamos sem sistema de MRP ou ERP, tudo era feito no excel, o ritmo era bem tenso e muita pressão."
bad,The  practice deception! They bought the company and are laying everyone off that makes a decent amount of money on the hour. Supervisors  putting their friends in positions that everyone else is applying for.
bad,if you start out a hard worker forget not being told if you have a bad day. You are making up for all the slackers that they hired over the years and have let get away without working hard. Very much into reverse discrimination but not ever willing to admit it. If you are a white male forget about an honest promotion! If you're a minority you have plenty of cards to play. HR is not there for the employees but seems to only be there to support management.
bad,I worked at energizer for 2 days I was on a belt putting battery packs in boxes it’s to fast paced they said speed up or we fire you I left the next day .
good,"Typical day would include a lot of uncertain scheduling, drama and long hours. Clean work environment a plus. Training is nothing short of terrible. Safety is stressed but often overlooked for production."
good,"Great Company to work for but the lack of job security is not ideal for parents. you could be working for a week and they will lay you off. there will be a holiday coming up and they will send you home early (within the last four weeks before the holiday) so they don't have to pay you for a full 8 hours for the holiday you have off. "
good,Excellent pay but 12 hour shifts leave little to no time to get personel every day things done as well as maintain good sleep habits.
good,"We get four 10-15 lunch breaks. There are several lines to work at. The operator makes sure the employees on their line are doing their job and doing it right. If the main machine on their line breaks down, they have to fix and get back to work. It gets hot during the summer which is not good, because it gets really hot. Friends are easy to make. Management bases off of favoritism at times which may not be fair but we still have to work to get a pay check. Its an ok job but its a temp workplace and can be laid off anytime or called out of work for months."
good,"Buena empresa, ambiente hostil algunas veces. Buenos beneficios"
good,"Energizer in Asheboro isn't terrible. You don't get paid a whole lot but it's better then minimum wage. You also have many opportunities to train in a higher paying position. During busy season you have mandatory overtime which puts parents in a bind, during slow season you get sent home a lot or called off. Gas and child care isn't worth working there during slow season."
good,"When I first started there this was a good place to work. Had great benefits and for the most part good people to work with. Now they have contract with smx leasing company and there's no good work ethic, people are never on jobs, always goofing off and producing bad work. Some people have been threatened by a couple of people and nothing is done about these situations. I don't feel secure in my job nor do I feel safe working there but I have to work and do what's necessary in this work place"
good,"I loved working with Advantage Sales & Marketing as A part of  the Energizer Direct Sales Team Because I love promoting American iconic brands. Typical day is promoting, selling, and Merchandising Energizer products as an ASM Rep.  The job can be overwhelming at times with Tasks and Priorities you have to accomplish with short deadlines. Just like with retail things are and always changing. My Territory was very large. My District Supervisor was great, unlike some others and the ROM's don't care about you one bit.  But I did enjoy my Position with Energizer/ASM when I was with them. I learned a lot and you are expected to show and get results and successes.  My district team or coworkers I worked with were great, everyone was treated like Family in my group. But with the way the economy is people get laid off.  When Retail is down then territory's are eliminated. So job security can be scary at times."
good,Working for SMX is something to me stable for a teenager. You will have to have a working phone because they call you and tell you whether to report to work that day or not.
good,"The Energizer Household (i.e. batteries and flashlights) is a dying business.  There is no effort made to innovate or grow in order to save the business.  In fact, during the most recent re-organization, forward-looking projects and strategic positions were eliminated.  In terms of the Energizer Personal Care business in CT, this is a kennel of brands that is consuming management's time and money.  The Board views this part of the business as the future, the growth engine; however, this part of the business consumes more capital and effort than they must have originally thought plus they have strong global competitors (P&G, K-C) who will deny them any opportunity to grow."
good,"The pay at energizer is decent, however since the company is publicly traded now they only really care about the share holders and making them money.  The management at plant level is a good ole boy network and they will not fight for the funds needed to repair equipment."
good,"Poor upper management in Westlake OH. They saw nothing, and had big jobs keep follow trends. Most employees did what they were asked to do. EBC was a well run company, the battery business has a dying product."
good,"A typical day at work goes very well. When the line is operating very smoothly, the day goes by so fast. Ive learned how to operate heavy artillery and manage to be safe at the same time.Management is constantly around the line to make sure it is running properly and more importantly the workers are safe. My co-workers are awesome, they love working with me and if im having a bad day, they cheer me up. The hardest part of the job is maintaining a productive day bc of the machine maybe have a malfunction of some sort."
good,"Good people, very flexible. Unfortunately, categories are in decline. Bottom-line focus is eroding morale. Little opportunity for topline growth."
good,"Energizer Battery Company was one of the best companies to work for until 2009.  Then the CEO and Board of Directors started letting the stock market run the company.  Until 2009 they ran the company in what was best for the company in the long term, now the company is ran with only short term large rewards as their focus.  This has resulted in Energizer becoming a company with a very short term future."
good,"Temp placement for the Energizer Manufacturing plant in St. Albans, Vt. Energizer went out of business here. The on the job placement required physical and active employees while running their manufacturing lines."
good,It was an okay job the management sucks. Working at engizer battery company was okay it was the SMX temp service that was not okay.
good,"Typically it was a very fast paced environment with a lot of demand on the crew leaders and operators to preform. I learned a lot about how to properly run very large machinery, and how to multi task efficiently."
good,"I work as a contract, i want find a job by under company.  My work time 6.30am to 6.30pm. One week 4 Day work overtime 1 Day and off day is 2 day. I learn how to handle machine EDM and how to handle machine material. Management this company so far good but sometimes cut more overtime. Workplace culture good, very friendly in a team. Always want get the target output. And because me contract that why i want resign, no benefit to me."
good,"Decent workplace, reasonable benefits. Some flexibility in work hours. Management seems knowledgeable. IT and computer systems as well as HRIS systems challenging."
good,Enjoyed the fast paced working environment. Not much advancement in the company. Was trained in line management and the use of electric pallet jacks.
good,"15 years ago, it was a great company.  But, recently, it had gone through huge changes.  I hope that they can become better."
good,"Formally  committed to Lean Principles, but that is no longer a priority..."
good,"- ran batteries through the machine to be sealed in a pack to be shipped off for sale"
good,"The job was more of a factory style environment, it was steadily fast paced based off of the type of work."
good,"The job is easy, but you don't know when they are gonna let you work."
good,"!0 hr shifts Hardest part is keeping everyone focused and getting the job done, co-workers are pleasent and most like family. most enjoyable is feeling like family with each other and getting a good days work done."
good,"The flexible working hours is always the first preference! Provided with superb understanding from the management team who always support 'family first concept', this tied up the good relationship among the job hierarchies."
good,"Forward Thinking company, Flexible and Mission can spin on a dime. Open to free thinkers and Team Work. Slow on Hardware procurement Great on personal time off."
good,Great fun company but we were under capitalized and did not achieve all our goals.   Hopefully they pull through to have the success we all thought possible
good,"Nice place to work they use a temp service ..low pay no place for full time employment with energizer, when a long time employee retires they replace them with a temp with a lot less pay and no benifits"
good,Energizer was a great place to work in the day.  There were lots of experience people and the culture fostered technical depth and investigation. That has changed a lot for the worse since I left.
good,Energizer Argentina es una gran compañia que desde hace años viene atravesndo  por una transformacion que ha afectado el nivel de compromiso de los colegas a nivel global y que ha hecho que deje de ser el liugar ideal para trabajar.
good,I enjoyed my time with the company but looking to peruse growth and opportunities for advancement with another company where I can make a career and better atmosphere.
good,"They are assign ok company the management could be better, they're attitudes are very nasty other than that if I didn't get laid off I would still be there."
good,"This work place was a fast working environment, kept people on there feet. hard working people. long days. a bit underpaid"
good,Las promociones al ser realizadas en las dependencias de otra empresa como me sucedio en Casa Royal da la sensacion de que se tienen dos jefes y mas compañeros de trabajos con los que hay que relacionarse y por ende intentar entenderse.
good,"Great colleagues, terrible senior level leadership.  Very conservative in spending on travel and expenses. Pay is competitive. Lack of development opportunities."
good,ok cool bonne place pour travailler et pour apprendre
good,"Poor management at all managements level .. "
good,They were awesome they just didn't have enough work. I didnt work with the company i was through smx. They were cool when they had work. But when they didn't have work they sent you home.
good,"The people at Energizer are sweet people, but trainers are unclear about some things that I needed to know. I work 12 hour shifts of mainly battery inspection, so the days feel long."
good,"Typical day at work was calm, fast pace. Certified Forklift Operator, opportunity to grow withing the company. Very kind people to work with and calm enviroment."
good,this company dose not care about its employees because at the expense of laying them off just so a CEO can keep more money in their pockets the people were ok just not very respectful
good,The people are fun to work with plenty of ideas each day on how to meet the goals required by the management. Very relax and have a nice ambience in the office.
good,The job is easy but jobs are going overseas and they're not scared to cut your pay.  They have cut my pay twice now from $19 an hour down to $12 an hour that's why I am finding a new job
good,Working at Energizer was very challenging and exciting. The pay was good but management was difficult to work with at times. Employees worked together to solve various manufacturing problems.
good,Energizer was a great place to work.  They really treated their employees well and I enjoyed my time there. I would recommend this employer to others.
good,"le poste que j'occupais auparavant demandait de l'autonomie, de la rigueur , de l'organisation."
good,a typical day of work was stacking boxes in appropriate order for a number of 10 hour or 12 hour shifts and being able to stand for long periods of time.
good,"This was overall a good company to work for but it was very evident that the majority of people that work there are from the area and will never leave. This in itself is not a bad thing but when that causes cliques to be formed unfair treatment of outsiders, it becomes a problem."
good,"I enjoyed working here for the most part.  I met a lot of good people working here.  I would have given them a 4 star rating if it wasn't for the fact that they closed the plant on us, and lied to us during the entire process."
good,"Things have changed over the years, but the people are great."
good,"Learned carrier-warehousing-manufacturer relationships. First experience with transportation. Great chance to get in with a large company with many different moving parts. Was able to sit in with customer service, accounting, human resources and obviously transportation. Met with and participated with carriers in rate negotiation."
good,temp work doesnt pay well slow pace not alot of work managment was horrible and the hours worse temp agency was understaffed and the workers were well trained
good,"Maintaining internal/external relationships by acting as the liaison between the Sales Team and the rest of the company, I have had the experience of working with a variety of Customers, Forecasting, Finance, Credit and Transportation.  I have a proven track record in exceeding customer goals including On-Time Delivery, Fill Rate and EDI proficiencies.  Some of my many accomplishments with Energizer include Lean Warrior, SharePoint Expert, SAP Instructor, Presentation Skills and Project Management.      "
good,It is difficult to relay my experience as a security contractor. The overall culture of the company was fast-paced and exciting. It appeared to be a fun place to work for the employees and other contractors. Security was excluded from all events. That makes it difficult to give a unbiased review.
good,"I started at this company a month before I turned 19. I advanced thru different roles in the company and worked there for almost 13 years. Yes they did always ask more more more, but I did like that. As a 3rd shift MOM, I absolutely needed to be on the go all night. Pay was very good, racked up some good vacation time. But in the end, if you disagree with the wrong person that's that. ""X"" person did NOT like me, because I stated a fact about their position, and their lack of the knowledge they should have had in their role. Person X then got promoted, into a position of power and from that day forward I knew my days were numbered. Overall, my production was amazing, I was filling multiple roles above and BEYOND my actual job with no additional incentive to do it, I just did it because I truly cared about the company. "
good,It is a warehouse job so don't expect much. Fast-paced environment with interesting people to work with. Offers overtime and PTO. No real problems while working there.
good,"Nice work culture, two times travel for all employees per year, and good bonus at the year end. Working in the nice building of good location in Shanghai."
good,"Energizer is a brand focus organization. The company has a strong global marketing strategy team that focus on the long term growth. "
good,Great place for entry level. Many opportunities to learn many things if you put yourself out there. Very lean work environment. The people are very nice as well.
good,I work directly with the controller who is consider my mentor. The company is trainning and lifelong education oriented. I learned about  Corporate Taxes were I was in charge of completing them. Mayor interaction with all departments. Being able to liderate monthly closing meetings with all departments. Being in charge od the financial reporting not only gave me exposure but also gave me experience and visibility of the company.
good,"Superviseur technique "
good,Energizer was a good place to work. Employees were good people. The company always followed through on promises.
good,"however, Energizer Holdings in USA is into buying companies in the consumer industry, also outsourcing, Thus, job security is quite a dilemma as global downsizing (retrenchment) is happening like every 3 years."
good,"Arrive at work, shift meeting, go to your work station and perform your job, union environment, pretty laid back, mostly older workforce, 12 hour rotating shifts."
good,Overall good company. Definitely a shareholder company with a great work life balance culture. Great collaboration in my experience with Sales and Marketing. A lot of legacy upper management who have been in power for a while. Not as adaptable as I was would have thought them to be. Overall enjoy going to work everyday.
good,"A typical day at Energizer is very face paced. I've learned that one must be multifaceted in skills prosper. The managment has great tools and uses them but perhaps is not very good at prioritizing and lacks in foresight. However, I have never met harder working co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my job was the diversity of tasks over a spralling buildings & grounds. I was kept busy. It made the day go by quickly and excercised my mind and body."
good,"Energizer Battery Corporation is a portion of the Household Products division of Energizer Holdings, Inc. I enjoy being a part of product development for a large, worldwide known brand. They truly embraced the 'keep going' attitude. As this is the global technology center, many different groups were working on the latest up-and-coming product developments related to batteries, flashlights, and portable power. The best part of the job is the colleagues - a blend of all generational age groups, which was embraced. The toughest part was that there wasn't always the best strategic alignment between groups and business areas, which could often cause confusion and duplicated efforts."
good,"I looking for a job, who help me spread wings. So, my experience can be use in different fields, like: business general, advertising, etc."
good,Packaging batteries and running the 9-volt tester machine the machine would discard all bad batteries. Also used the hand truck to move the batteries. My favorite part of the job was knowing that everyone would benefit from all my hard work.
good,"A typical day starts at 8.00 am, there is a lot of learning as the team is young and energetic, with great new ideas."
good,"Good pay , good benefits , good people to work with , unfortunately the management begin pushing and micro managing the employees. It went from great to a poor place to work , to much stress !"
good,"I worked for Energizer for over 11 years and enjoyed, aside from the occasional management challenges which happen in large manufacturing companies I would recommend Energizer as a place to work."
good,it is really nice place with nice collegues.
good,"Large multinational well known organisation"
good,"Clean, safe place to work. Management was very professional. Work was easy with minimal lifting they did everything to try to make our jobs easier. Clean environment inside the factory in most areas. Air conditioned facility newer up to date equipment to operate. Machinery was very operator friendly. Overspending and mismanagement led to the downfall of Energizer Maryville Plant."
good,"When I started with Energizer most of their employees worked their entire career there. I thought that was what I would be doing."
good,Coworkers are the highlight of the work environment. Shift supervisors are easy to get along with but upper management often loses touch with the difficulties of day to day operations.
good,"selbstständiges arbeiten, positive als auch negative Erfahrungen gesammelt"
good,Energizer has been a great learning experiance. Currently they are in the process of laying people off. Which forces everybody to start looking for a new job.
good,"The global battery business evolved recently, with much of production going offshore, and the quality of product improving. "
good,"Learned SAP and felt very comfortable using it.  Also SharePoint which was new to me.  Ran many different reports for several managers, designing many to meet the needs of upper management."
good,"good management because they appreciated their employees ,when it comes on the work , also they provided good salary weekly,  no deduction and they get your reports"
good,Fun workplace good people to work with co employment some nights better then others machines don't like th mint but once your trained to work on them there not to horrible
good,"I through SMX staffing to work in Energizer for a long time, this is very good place to work. people are very friendly and nice, the factory is very nice: it has air conditioning."
good,"Everything was great about this job, but they started laying off and moving machines out of the country. Without job security, employees started leaving."
good,"It was good company, Unfortunately, for business decisions the company decided to closed the affiliate in Puerto Rico."
good,Company is financially stable and committed to share holder equity.  Company has continued to work to cut expenses to improve ability to be profitable.
good,My boss always challenged me in my work area. Thanks for that I was never bored. Always had something new and learned new things.
good,"Mild work hours"
good,"when operators are having problems with keeping machines running, I would figure out what was wrong with machine , make small adjustments , or replace parts. other things I would do would work on work order. we had hard working operators , willing to learn about there machines so they could help me to troubleshoot the machine. the hardest part of the job was some days nothing wanted to run because bad material. best part of the job was working with everyone , laughing , joking , we where all like a big family just being there for each other."
good,I prepared batteries to be packaged for hearing aids. The job was fast paced and was enjoyable. They have great people working there and management knows their jobs. Didnt want to leave but the temporary contract ended.

I had a great time working in this company , employer to employee relationship is good as well as the working environment. This company have given its employees competitive benefits and training which made the company earn a good reputation on employees relations in our region.

Thus, the Company have resorted into cost cutting measures which later on resulted to the closure of its manufacturing plant in our region."

If any of our equipment broke I would call the mechanic if it was not something in my power to fix. every hour I would record our production on the dry erase board and at the end of the shift I would fill out the required paperwork. I learned that not all work places were drama filled, some have a professional environment and I like that. The management was very professional, one supervisor raveled in drama like a teenage girl but I choose to ask her supervisor questions if I had any to avoid problems with her. Most of my co-workers were pleasant and those who weren't were into drama like the drama crazed supervisor so they got along, I stayed out of it. the hardest part to do was fixing the tray maker when it really jammed up, and the best part was working the BP4 and working the Douglas (machines)."
good,"My job was to sell batteries to Wal-Mart and Sam's Clubs exclusively. Had I been selling batteries to any other company, I would have loved this job. On an average day I would visit 4-5 Wal-Marts and grow the Energizer brand through sales, merchandising and stocking of displays. Wal-Mart employees and buying practices proved to be difficult and depressing to work with. What I did enjoy was being on the road and being solely responsible for my work-load and being managed with respect."
