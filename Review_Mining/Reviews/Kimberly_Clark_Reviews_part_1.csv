bad,Desorden total en el área de ventas falta de criterio
bad,"swing shifts will end you almost as quickly as the incompetent management. four paid breaks are really nice, although it's hard to appreciate that when you're racing the clock and utilizing an outdated tracking system that checks your productivity"
bad,Worst company to work for they cut your hours and the pay sucks for how hard you work. They send u home not giving you your full hours they work you to death to where u pass out or faint and become dehydrated often
bad,"For someone looking for a asap check, but not long term, but if you kiss some butt it may take you a little further. When i started i knew the first day i was not gone be there long"
bad,I was fired cus my mom got into a car accident and I stepped out side to check on her & my brother that has stage 3 cancer. First time in trouble and I was terminated. My mother picks me up from work and with her being in and accident my other brother texted me to find my own ride home. I been a temp there since 2017 and got hired on this summer and I worked very hard to get there. Stayed when the work got slow and when people wouldn’t show up. Trained people without pay.So for them to get rid of me like that without asking what was going on was disrespectful. If my mother or brother would of been killed in the accident I bet they would of still fired me. They let me go for stealing time. But when I mentioned my family they still didn’t care. The work environment is the closet thing to modern day slavery. They don’t care about their people just about their numbers.
bad,"If you where not conceived in a plant bathroom. you will be treated as a outsider. This company is very clannish., and plays a lot of games. It told the employees it was closing. Just so it can have way with the union, and receives state benefits."
bad,Once great company but the new management team is a bunch of micro managing control freaks. Mill manager runs the operation through fear intimidation and threats. Team members are so terrified of the safety program that they conceal injuries in fear of being fired. They have cut our maintenance budget to nothing so machines are falling apart and equipment is being destroyed all so they can make their numbers green and get a good end of year review. They are stripping this place dry and taking out all the money and codes so they can shut it down.
bad,Started off as a good job to be at until they threatened workers to close the plant down. As a worker we lost a lot of benefits so the plant could remain open.
bad,"Place is ran with stressful constant berating environment. No safety culture just a list of rules used to harass hourly workers. 70% of the people do nothing, hard workers are rewarded with more work, more responsibility, and same pay."
bad,I can't really say anything about the work place. It was an okay job working on the line.. Some of the people there was not very work friendly... Didn't work there very long.. Overall nice environment..
bad,This company scammed the state of WI to give them huge tax breaks to keep them in WI but are now trying to use a 3rd Party company called MAU to hire people to replace all the forklift drivers who load the truck at a much lower pay rate! I can only hope the Mayors of Neenah and Fox Crossing find out how the company scammed them for the huge tax breaks
bad,Some people are decent here but most of the Kimberly Clark employees act like the rest of us are scum and treat as that way. Enforces rules on contingent workers but they don't follow their own rules. It's no wonder they are closing down.
bad,"dark and dingy, felt allergic to that place, most boring people ever, progress is so slow it drives me crazy. Now on the forefront of any new technology."
bad,It was hot & very stressful really no help u was just there. It’s not a good place to work so unorganized Kimberly-Clark need a whole lot of things done
bad,Very unhealthy place to work - cut throat and negative.  KC used to be a company that cared about employees and the culture.  Now it is all about making the quarter number for investors.  Short term decisions cloud long term strategies.
bad,It was very hot in Kimberly Clark. Pouring sweat as soon as you walked in the factory. Very humid. Hard to breathe sometimes. I did not like the way we were treated. Couldn't be friendly to others.
bad,Every 2 years like clockwork it's 2018 they just announced another.  So many jobs cut to be moved overseas.  Would not suggest to anyone that wants to have anything more than a career starter.
bad,No hay crecimiento laboral para subir de puesto tienes que ser amigo del supervisor
bad,working here i had the worst experince and i would not work for them anymore they dont treat you fairly and you will do more than what your paid for and they are just unprofessional
bad,"I learned a lot during my tenure at KC, and overall enjoyed the time in my career.  However, advancement is not open to the average worker and advancement is based on who likes who the best instead of performance and true best fit for the role. "
bad,"Pagan poco, descansas poco, te explotan mucho y te tratan de la patada y según por las utilidades que dan"
bad,Management is an absolute joke. Always looking to get after someone and if one person doesn't like you then you are made a target. Saw this on a few occasions. Go in with eyes on the bavk of your head and steer away from the days people as they're on the hunt.
bad,If you are looking for a job that does not pay well for the long hours you put in or the hard work you do this is the job for you.
bad,"Did not like working at KC, the employees were lazy."
bad,No longer in business as Fort Howard. Bought out by another manufactures
bad,"Worked for KC for ten years. Watch your manager! Saw a lot of good engineers get the $haft, some 23 year plus tenure. Cannot recommend this company. If you work there and like it then you are the problem. No real "" security"" ."
bad,This company isn't around anymore. They left and fired all of the employees so that they didn't have to pay a union and take care of the workers.
bad,Empressa com grande comhecimento mas com pouca possibilidade de crescimento proficional
bad,"A backstabbing culture- worst place I ever worked!"
bad,If you weren’t used to fast paced jobs then Kimberly clark wasn’t the job for you. You would have to ignore some of the co workers but most were pretty cool and were just trying to get the day over with.
bad,Tough place to work. The management cares very little for the employees. I would not recommend this company as there is a lot of favoritism. The existing team makes it hard to fit in and so information sharing is not in abundance. The rules put in place by the CEO are set up so that the new guys will never get a fair deal. New guys always get the night shift work.
bad,No me gustó trabajar para ellos porque peliaban por los bonos y los turnos no me gustaron mucho
bad,Horrible place to work as a contracted employee through a cleaning company called Compass Group. The actual Kimberly Clark Corporation is okay...the people are okay...complains a lot but it was okay. They pay is terrible...so is management. I would not recommend working for or through this company.
bad,"De 5 años trabajados. 4 y medio pensando que me echaban. A los 6 meses de entrar anunciaron una reestructuracion y me sacaron del puesto al que hsbia entrado que era implementar un software por otro puesto que no tenia nada que vet con mi carera profesional en el area de soporte de redes. En la que era mi posicion pusieron a la esposa de un gerente. Despues me maltraron durante 3 años exigiendome que aprendiera sola mi nuevo puesto de redes cuando no estudie sistemas soy ingeniera industrual y me desarrolle en Sap. En mi area anterior entraron dos contratados. Dicen que les importa el desarrollo de carrera del empleado pero a mi me sacaron del puesto al que me postule y todas las veces que me sente a hablar sobre el desarrolo de mi carrera que era volver al puesto del que me sacaron de prepo la respuesta era nada arreglate solo aprende solo. 4,5 años con miedo permanente. Finalmente me echaron. De 7 empresas que trabaje la peor de todas nunca respeyaron mi carrera de 20 años. La unicaempresa que de undia psra el otro se le ocurre csmbiar a tofos de sus trabajos. No tiene sinducato ni nadie que te defirnda. Ye obligan a viajat a paises de ruesgo como El Salvador viajando todo el fin de semana y no te pagan extrs ni te reponen el sabado y domingo. Un dessstre, sufrimirntp condtsnte"
bad,"The teach their employees to tell on everyone.  They treat everyone differently, it just depends on who you are. Department leads sleep behind closed doors."
bad,"Do not work here if  you want a life they make you work at least 5 12 hour shifts with 24 hours off week after week."
bad,Not a good environment nor any leaders worthy of leading people.  The primary leadership team has very average skill and are good at pretending to be important.  The culture is very much about back stabbing and doing anything to move up. A very sad place to work indeed.
bad,"Local management has several managers who were promoted because of who they know, not what they know. "
bad,"Pesimo ambiente laboral, acoso. "
bad,"They pay you only $9.50 to $10 per hour. Management is rude and they don’t know how to talk to people. Very stressful due the fact that no one knows what to do or where to go. One lead was actually stealing from peoples purses."
bad,"The culture looked good from the outside but the banners didn't match what was going on inside.  Poor Leadership, unrealistic work expectations and a team leader who didn't understand the category.  Team members leaving and were not replaced continued to make work life balance more difficult."
bad,A empresa aparenta ter uma dinqamica saudavel porém mostra que o cenario é adverso a isso.
bad,The company won't be around long.  They shutdown plant that provides material for the other.  Upper management are horrible.  People don't want to teach you anything.
bad,"I was a long term employee of Kimberly Clark and with the  new  way the management team is now, if they suddenly get one of their favorites ruffled, you can lose your job. I am 58 and not far from retirement, but now out of a job because the pets get mad when you tell to do there job.Just not right, or a good way to operate a business."
bad,"I worked at the Fullerton Mill for 1 1/2 years. Putting in 60 hours a week was the norm with no comp time, pay, or appreciation. I had to work holidays since that is when the machines were down. Over thanksgiving week I worked 96 hours with no comp time, and my boss decided I was responsible for being 1 day late in getting a major overhaul done."
bad,"I worked in an environment where senior leaders would often scream obscenity at you in meetings, mock people because of their disabilities and cover up serious leadership issues that jeopardized the safety of employees."
bad,"Too much in the way of doing a your job effectively: disconnected management, too many HR tasks, political.  KC is riding the coattails of excellent people, not excellent policies and structure.  Managers are hyper focused on appeasing their superiors and handling their own accountabilities - they pretend to promote building talent but its all faulty HR policies that make things sound nice on the surface but EVERYONE is stressedl and trying to do more work than they can handle.... and then they force rank you against each other every year.  KC has gutted the integrity of its infrastructure.  People are not valued for experience anymore - only ""potential"".  This was openly stated by leadership.  The company is not growing and has little reason to expect it would ever come up with any new innovation to generate any growth though they pretend that it is the main focus when speaking to employees.  It's NOT the company it used to be.  Stock prices are overvalued and it won't be long before the house of cards topples."
bad,"Unethical place to work they manage you strictly by numbers and not including performance, cost savings, or other positive factors. They look for a way to make the numbers work in their favor regardless of the impact on the employees or the community. They breed a culture of false hopes and dreams to try and inspire you to work harder for no success."
bad,"Kimberly Clark was a very good company and very diverse in terms of culture, I have learned to respect and understand other cultures. the most enjoyable part of the job was when we had to come together as a team form the administrator to sales Team in order to push for our monthly targets. The hardest part when a client or customer is not happy."
bad,"Although from the outside KC might seem like an open, female-friendly workplace, in reality, mainly if not all men make business and hiring decisions, and either hire their friends or ex-colleagues to continue the all-male, all-white culture. "
bad,"Kimberly Clark is very big company, BUT"
bad,Records various correspondents.. Answer phone calls promptly. Serve our customers right. Learn to practice teamwork in our company.Promoting our products
bad,It’s a night mare. It’s very stressful with a lot of people competing each other. You need to be a good friend with the Management to be considered. If you like to be in any party with the Management this is your job but if you are a family person don’t.
bad,"PROS:"
bad,"Me hicieron laburar como perro 12 horas y cuando me preguntaron sobre cambiar de horario, cai en una trampa y me pusieron en un horario que estaba lleno de gente ya, me dijeron que sobraba y me echaron como si no fuera nadie"
bad,"They spend all their time trying to keep thier jobs, and very little time actually doing their jobs. "
bad,The twelve hour rotating shifts is not good for you! No time for a normal social life.
bad,"Senior mechanic were able to slack off work while junior or other department mechanics filled in to get work done. They were allowed to pick & choose their tasks. Focus/area mechanics would hide parts for themselves & not mention where there were. then later while the jobs are waiting to get done, they, the senior mechanics would come up with the parts to finish the jobs & take the credit for getting them done."
bad,"Eu aprendi bastante trabalhar em equipe,porquê sem a ajuda do meu colegas, muitas coisas não poderiam ser executadas."
bad,"Como empresa es :Excelente empresa únicamente puedo decir, Pero en este país Costa Rica tiene una Pésima administración, Un ambiente de completa hipocresía de parte de los jefes hacia sus colaboradores sintiendo un completo nerviosismo e inseguridad en toda la jornada laboral y teniendo un comportamiento de acoso laboral constante y hablo de mi propia experiencia en la bodega de producto terminado, es lamentable tener que hacer un comentario de esta clase a una empresa como esta."
bad,"trabajo bajo precion ,aprendi a manejar montacargas de clan,a manejar la computadora y a saber relacionarme con mucha gente,lo mas dificil fue q ya no hubo modo de seguir creciendo cosas de la nueva jefa con su gente nueva"
bad,"busy non stop ,safty pays ,take your time ,dealing with people who have been there years not fun to work with"
bad,Company runs extremely lean with little regard for life work balance.  Constantly under the gun to meet sales plan with little communication from senior management.
bad,It is a typical factory job. I came to work everyday and worked hard and got alone with others caught on with instructions easy
bad,"Great organization.  Lots of history.  Smart management, amazing benefits, great pay.  "
bad,The job was horrible. The managers were insensitive and the hours were never stable.
bad,"Good pay and benefits, but 6 bosses for every actual worker heckeling you while you are trying to do your job. These people complain everyday about how much the workers are paid! The salaried bosses were in the way, and often carried laptop computer which they used to re programm the software based machinery to malfunction!"
bad,"Minha rotina se baseava em bater meu ponto logo ao chegar no mesmo e ir para as maquinas de empacotamento de fraldas visando a sua qualidade antes de fechar um lote pois caso haja algum defeito o lote inteiro teria que ser levado para o laboratório analisado e descartado para realização do mesmo processo até sua perfeita qualidade. Aprendi a ser mais responsável, pontual, a respeitar o tempo de cada um."
bad,Need to pay more money and make some adjustments to the point system if your one minute late you get a quarter of a point when they should actually give you a grace period.
bad,"The work place was very chaotic. Co-workers rather gossip than do their jobs. The supervisors were unprofessional and played favorites. Constantly being rushed to perform tasks that I was already in the middle of doing. Inept people who can't accomplish simple tasks who have been working there for years, requiring the line worker to constantly complain about their mistakes and send work back down the line. Had my food stolen out of my lunch box twice. Overall poor experience, wouldn't recommend working here temp."
bad,Stressful environment. Workload extremely heavy consistently.  Complicated to balance life and work.  I would not recommend any one to work with company.
bad,Well the management wasn't the best. They had a new company that took care of their cleaning & I worked through a Temp agency. I never knew what they wanted me to do.
bad,"Worked here for 10 years. Paris plant has reduced machinery/lines to 1/2 of their output 5 years ago. No raises for last three years. Paris has little to offer young families. Would be ok for a ""experience"" position. Would not consider long term."
bad,"Skvělý kolektiv, jednoduchá manuální práce, 12hod. provoz."
bad,its OK but I think they can do better with the work they do out there ...the bosses are rude & disrespectful.I just don't think people deserve the way they treat people they treat you like slaves
bad,"I had three internships with this company while in college. Once I graduated, there was a hiring freeze (which is actually very common here). I was not able to be hired full time, but currently work as a contract for K-C. My coworkers are great and wonderful to work with, but the company as a whole is only focused on profit and their shareholders (along with bonuses for the CEO and VP's). I want to work in an environment where I feel adequately compensated for my skills and am contributing to something worthwhile. It is not right for a company to ""save"" money by keeping on their contracts (seemingly indefinitely by renewing their contract) without paying them as much as an intern or any benefits."
bad,"Too much work put on too few people.  "
bad,The people that actually works for KC and not MAU is very pleasant and they have a great work relationship with the temp service workers.  MAU on the other hand likes to slave people with little advancement and little pay for the amount of work performed by their employees.
bad,"harassment, micromanaging,  and racism.  Bad language, terrible management . They had people working there for less then others. they would say one thing and mean another. Felt unsafe"
bad,Bad management team. Good place to work for hourly people. No much advance opportunity for engineer. Coworkers are good to work with.
bad,the managers and the job is ok its not a palce of employment that I would go back to.
bad,Vedení neakceptuje názor podřízeného . Jasne dá najevo ze jen vedení má pravdu i když se to neslučuje s chodem linky
bad,"They did not recognize when managers were in a position they should not be managing and constantly bringing on inexperienced people doing jobs they didn't understand, and not providing adequate or even clearly defined training."
bad,"Too much stress for the position as I was the Subject Matter Expert due to the length of time I was there; the request form process began with me and I left the knowledge I had built when I left the company; didn't care if the team I left behind used it or not as I was constantly fighting with the other team members to follow the request form process."
bad,"The culture has really declined since early 2018. Global Restructuring leaves most employees under constant stress. The pay and benefits are the only perks, but honestly not worth it."
bad,"employees would not train you, based on what they thought of you. so your advancement would be very slow, if you advanced at all. They had a pay scale starting at level 1 thru level 4, with pay ranging between 13 dollars an hour to 20+ dollars and hour for level 4. I stated out with 13 dollars an hour, my partner had been there for 9 years and he only made 2 dollars more than me, He was a level 4, they just didn't pay him for it."
bad,"There are limited opportunities in the engineering dept."
bad,Very fast paced environment with an evolving culture. Great opportunities provided for self improvement through onsite classes and seminars.
bad,"Stressfull and under pressure 24/7"
bad,"Kimberly Clark has gone from a highly competetive, fast paced skilled workplace where everyone worked together and helped each other to succeed, to a stressful slow paced factory where no-one cares about the job anymore, all they care about are themselves and playing on computers or cell phones. People no longer care to learn and advance."
bad,Management waste time idling  too much and had no knowledge of unfolding boxes. Always rushing to meet expectation just before the closing of the day and did not want to pay for extra time.
bad,"After the merger with SCOTT paper the direction was simple and full of common sense.  In the last 8 years KC has forgotten what made them successful.  STOP trying to cut cost and save money.  Drive productivity and sales.  High volume productivity will get us where we need to be.  When a company allows themselves to get caught in this LEAN trap they will eventually have to cut jobs, facilities or fail. Continuous change in leadership creates constant change in direction, confusion in staffing and chaos.  STOP....this nonsense and drive sales and volume."
bad,"They do not care if you sick, or if you have family issues. They do not want you to have a life outside of work. They do not care about people working there."
bad,"Always busy days which was great; however, too many shortcuts and workarounds performed and standard work/processes were not followed; No Mgr. support"
bad,"Tiene tecnología de punta, especial para aprender durante la carrera laboral"
bad,"If you can get used to an insultingly low pay structure, promotions based entirely on political correctness, management that neither listens nor otherwise takes the experienced advice of the people that work for them and rotating 12 hour shifts. Otherwise- if you do get hired- just keep firmly in mind: that you will never get any rest until you quit or retire."
bad,IT department has been decimated multiple times and have a slightly shady reputation when it comes to staff appointments and reward. They have a great code of conduct document saying what is acceptable practice and whats not. You might be able to find a copy of it in the fiction section of your local library.
bad,"Most outsiders find it difficult to survive the culture.  I learned that if my boss retires and the CFO and VP Controller don't care to hear what you are working on, feed it to them anyway so they can't say you didn't know what you were doing."
bad,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, relación con compañeros estupenda"
bad,"verificar que no pare si no hay mucho estrés"
bad,I need a change because i'm not going to go anywhere just working at a dead end job there.
bad,"With the need for cost savings at an all time high, managers are looking for any way to cut costs, and they are doing it most strongly by outsourcing jobs and kicking employees to the curb. The employees remaining are taking on two or three jobs and being penalized for not getting the job done."
bad,Kimberly - Clark makes tissue and hand towels. You don't really want to know what i think about this messed up company.The pay is good. They should have random drug testing.
bad,"IT management is poor. Job titles, responsibilities, reporting relationships are so often in flux that it's hard to ever be on a solid footing in your current role, let along having any hope to advance. Most managers are invested only in keeping their position and reputation. K-C in general loves to downsize and ""create churn"" in teams to keep things fresh but they tend to get rid of the wrong people."
bad,The employee's are just waiting to be let go or shifted elsewhere. No one feels safe. It's like constantly walking on egg shells always. The work is always changing so you don't know what to expect from day to day.
bad,After dedicating almost 10 years to the company (some upwards of 40 yrs) the company lied to its employees and shut down the facility after being promised that they would keep this plant open if certain things did not happen. The CEO and upper managers do not care about the workers and their livelihood.
bad,I don’t have very much to say. The management makes it impossible to enjoy your job. The stress level is out the roof. And do not get hurt on the job. They just fire you!!!!
bad,Management is poor because they have poor understanding of their products and of the technology involved in producing them.  Agreeing with the boss is the requirement rather than doing the right thing.
bad,"I worked at Kimberly-Clark for five years as an executive assistant. I absolutely enjoyed my manager and the teams that I supported However, upper management did not support middle level and the  dysfunction that trickled down from corporate leadership created a toxic environment between coworkers and departments. Many in my office were promised advancement to no avail. Executive assistants  that were supporting the sales teams did not receive bonus for their efforts but rather 2% each year. Not much of an incentive to drive business for a support person. The back room corporate politics of releasing long time employees was corrupt. Very cutthroat at that level. The CDA program for young people  brought incredible talent to Kimberly-Clark however many of them leaving was due to non-advancement. Lastly,  I and many others recently lost their employment due to restructuring.  The restructure had nothing to do with ability in any case.  K-C only wants to employ talent that does not come to work, spend most of their time watching sports, reading books, going to lunch, painting their nails,  having absolutely no experience in the roles that they are in and so on. Any young person coming out of college that wants a career with Kimberly-Clark should look elsewhere. It's a waste of your time, talent and  prolongs the progression of your career."
bad,i enjoyed working here and would have continued if they didn't shut the plant down displacing over a thousand workers.  during poor economic times making it difficult to find jobs with equal pay benifits.
bad,"The company stresses how important the positive K-C behaviors are to include in your every workday. This is just talk. I have seen many unappropriated behaviors, several from senior positions. "
bad,The management is horrible and hours are always being cut. The working conditions are somewhat acceptable. I would not recommend anyone working here because the pay doesn’t match the work.
bad,"the job was an okay job to have out of high school."
bad,"Kimberly Clark pays good "
bad,The  people you work with are rude. And. Lot of people take longer break then they  was supposed to and a Lot of people  do not respect the superviser
bad,"I only worked for KC last year  for a month and I did indeed, expect much better from such a global company. They expect you (at least in Brighton office in Credit control department) to work overtime - unpaid. They hired me because I could speak 4 languages. I had no clue about credit control part of job, but I did enquire about training when they interviewed me. I was told I will be given training but in my first week of working as a  'credit control' I was already expected to maintain, manage large number of accounts. What's more, I was expected to produce analyses and financial forecast! Without proper training. Their salary is also not that great (think about all unpaid hours they expect you to do). For all of these reasons, I left the company after a month of working for them. When I told my manager I'm leaving, she said: ""Think about it, don't make a mistake - this is Kimberly Clark ... """
bad,"Directed a full spectrum of trade professionals, vendors, and contractors for the purpose of designing, manufacturing, distribution, and maintaining a vast array of custom instruments globally.  This $18M asset base ensures consistency in the quality of FDA regulate devices.  "
bad,Management puts to much emphasis on subjective performance evaluation behaviors.
bad,"3 years ago I genuinely enjoyed working here, it has gone down fast in those 3 years.  They've undergone multiple restructures in that time, losing a very large portion of their longer tenured employees, then laying off ones that did stick around, leaving a lack of experience.  They value ideas over productivity, ideas that don't necessarily have to be realistic or work, those people get promoted before the failure happens and don't face the fallout.  People are overworked due to the layoffs and unhappy.  Leadership changes direction very frequently without concern to the work done under previous paths."
bad,"I worked at KCP for 6 years and perhaps a year too long. Management was awful and out of tune. They pushed experienced employees out the door, pushed folks close to retirement to retire early with fewer benefits and instigated the evaluation process to limit salary increases. In the meantime, only management ""favorites"" were promoted and more responsibilities were added to everyone's desk without any incentives. They think that employees were blind to what was occuring, One time they tried to improve our departments morale with stale croissants, popcorn and pretzels and cheap brand soft drinks. When the bean counters took over in early 2000's company just has gone downhill."
bad,"Kimberly Clark has initially given me a great opportunity and experiences in a big company with high responsibilities. I have learned a lot through the company."
bad,"Very demanding business that measures success through metrics. "
bad,Worked as a project engineer and asset engineer in manufacturing facility for 2. Engineers are spread thin compared to work load. Long hours during project installs (12-16 hour shifts days/weekends/nights) with no additional compensation. Job is very demanding and leadership will not hire more help. Work/life balance was not good.
bad,"it was a fun work environment dealing with customers which taught me to be more customer friendly ,also I learned people skills. management was good just felt the pay could have been better considering our responsibilities ."
bad,"Go in at 7am or pm and work 12 hrs. Nothing but stocking. Didn't talk to management much. Co-workers stayed to themselves for the most part. I hated the alternating shifts. One week you'd be working days, the others at night. It was very boring and repetitive. It was very easy to do though."
bad,"Re-organizes every 4-5 years and always state that ""this one is the last one"".  "
bad,"a gerencia deverias participar mas das reuniões  diária, muito tranquila e e com boas pessoas de se conviver, ou masmo tempo pessoas que poderia passar mas experiência."
bad,"they knew about the contaminated tampon products before the recall; they would just rather market product for profit rather than do the right thing."
bad,"My role requires me to be in a couple of meetings a day, in those meeting I have to deliver actions. You are required to be always on your feet, which is great because you always have your ducks in a row."
bad,I worked for this company for 5 months. was very good in the beginning but there were lots of complications around the managers and money problems work ethic and job security. they paid me a basic salary with no UIF or unemployment fund. no medical aid and no PAYE. Also facilities were not so up to code.
bad,"Es una Empresa muy importante a nivel nacional e internacional,con ambiente de trabajo bueno,pero creo que tendrian que valorar mas al personal e incrementar la remuneracion de los empleados"
bad,"CAD data base a mess with many erroneous drawings. Very often the engineers can't be bothered to revise documents when changes are made. Many good people in the rank and file working there but didn't like the elitist attitude from the ""engineers club"". If you're in the clique you'll do well, if not then not so well."
bad,"Kimberly Clark lacked transparency between Leadership and employees regrading objectives which were unrealistic and constant moving targets."
bad,The company does not encourage thinking that does not conform with senior management.  The culture is to critique the person not the idea.  If you get sideways with senior management there is no return for your career.
bad,Nice place to work but with the downsizing of KC job security is always a possibility. There is little room for growth as most employees are long term contract workers.
bad,"Salario arriba de prom, no hay pago de tiempo extra para ingeniería, te exigen quedarte 1 hr (sin pago extra) hasta que las máquinas se vean estables aún si tú no eres el responsable de la falla. No hay horario claro, en proyectos te hacen trabajar 12 X 12 hrs sin tiempo extra condición que puede ir de 1 semana a 1 mes.No puedes planear fines de semana ya que puedes o no trabajar el fin de semana según te digan. No hay capacitación. No pagan teléfono o equipo pero exigen que tengas datos porque lo toman como medio oficial de comunicación."
bad,"Kimberly Clark is a great company but it seems to be losing it's ability for solid growth.  There are obvious market impacts but the inconsistency in management and employee development is a more serious underlying issue.  "
bad,"SCM reporting to CFO may not be the best idea. Lot of valueless activities leading to no where. Lack of long term vision."
bad,"Machine Operator responsible for the production, packing, and distribution of products. Technical knowledge necessary to make minor repairs and perform basic mechanical tasks. Perform work in a safe manner and exhibit appropriate interpersonal skills necessary to work as a member of a high performance team."
bad,"Entry level in unarmed security. No room for advancement. Management was learning on the fly, there was 3 Security Managers during my tenure. Nothing was hard about the job. Typical day check about ten building, report to the control room."
bad,Very fast paced environment with an evolving culture. Great opportunities provided for self improvement through onsite classes and seminars. Great co-workers.
bad,No good reviews. Arms where all cut up from boxes. No safety material was issued. You have to buy your on protection. I don't recommend this job at all.
bad,"The pay is decent, but the swing shift is not for everyone. If you have a family, it will stress not only yourself, but your familial relationships. And this schedule has been shown in numerous studies to be detrimental to personal health"
bad,"Different people diversity  good learning environment"
bad,"Pay wasn't good at all, they worked the employees like it was a $10.00 an hour job. Normally worked a 6 hour shift. Lunch breaks weren't paid. Lack of help."
bad,"despite being a multicultural and leader company in the sector, the management of the factory was very narrow mind and there were no chances of improvement for somebody coming from production department."
bad,"Too many managers, engineer who was extremely qualified but was fired because he was not politically correct."
bad,"the only good thing i really have to say about kimberly clark conway is that the pay and benefits are very good, everything other than that is bad"
bad,"I would work in an enviroment that was hot and sticky running machines."
bad,"As a contractor, I never felt like I was part of the Kimberly-Clark environment. Essentially, as a contractor, you are required to ""do your job"" and not interact with the permanent employees. Very little opportunity for ""outsiders"" to obtain permanent employment."
bad,"As a clamp truck operator, my job was to take raw materials to the lone to be processed. After the raw material process was completed, it was my job to then take the finished product and stage it to be shipped out to the customer."
bad,"Diversity is supposed to be a strong hold of this company. But what I quickly learned it is not. I was not expecting this from an international company, but I quickly realized that the culture even in their central office is not very open to diversity"
bad,"K-C has very experienced and caring senior leadership. They're in a transition phase so the culture is a bit unsteady for the time being. However they will succeed in executing strategic growth plans and continue to be a viable player in their marketspace."
bad,"Si planeas entrar en una posición de analista o un cargo de nivel inicialmente bajo, te recomiendo negocear muy bien tu plan de crecimiento."
bad,Friendly and good company to work..weekly pay easy work and the  way they help you get the job done.very helpful people to be around and work with i love the company.
bad,"I was in the accounting department. I felt training was poor. I noticed how management gave someone a promotion who was easily controllable, not because she was truly the best person for the job."
bad,"preform duties as asked , also load an unload trucks , clamp is what they drive,  dealing with tissue, diapers, baby wipes. Inbound and outbound. Good 10 - 12 hour shifts. Good job!"
bad,Standard factory job. standard work schedule. no phones allowed. not very busy. no social life. no home life because you spend all of your time working here.
bad,"Busy days, something always broken. Negotiate with union to get things fixed. A lot of time spent training and retraining operators. Environmental issues drove a lot of the behaviors at the mill."
bad,My experience with management was negative.  Very cutthroat. There were several occurrences where manager played favorites to the detriment of others on the team.  There was no accountability for bad management behavior.
bad,It's a job until something with better pay come alone everything is easy there the only thing you work 12 hours and work every other weekend it's alot of smiling face in there it's boring due to you working 12 hours and can't listen to music on your phone some peoe work better listening to music and it would make the 12 hours go by a little faster
bad,I have had a fulfilling career at K-C. I have learned a lot in my time on the Network Operations Team and as a Network Engineer.
bad,the typical day i packed boxes on the conveyor belt i stood in a line with about 24 people and worked an over night shift. the job was pretty laid back coworkers were very nice.the job is very hard on the back.
bad,"I highly recommend working at Kimberly Clark. Lots of great perks, great culture of coaching. Lots of opportunity for advancement within. Love the environment and the supervisors."
good,Ok place to work but benefits and insurance are severely overpriced. Not a lot of family time with shift schedule. Management is inexperienced and the mill is in need of serious changes.
good,12 hour day high speed manufacturing no advancement opportunities always adding to workload constantly micro managing
good,It is a temp job so my views could be different from a fulltimer. It is difficult to get hired in unless you hold a college degree in anything. Even if you are doing the job already
good,"You never know what to expect when you get to work at KC. Some days are easier then others. The people can be friendly and the atmosphere is pleasent. You recieve training all the time, rather its on the computer, off the job site, or training on your off days. "
good,"The IA department was not what I expected. There was not enough employees to cover the number of countries that should have been audited every year. Many of the audits were not comprehensive. There were no company cell phones to communicate with each other while traveling. Relationships with my coworkers were often contentious, with no real management intervention. Management was not effective in communicating expectations to staff. They changed their minds constantly. As a result, staff (including me) was made to feel belittled and humiliated oftentimes publicly. While pregnant I almost went into labor 3 times from the stress. Then I was told that I had to leave my job if I didn't want to travel. They wanted me to say I quit. I've never been tbe same."
good,"I enjoy the worksite at Kimberly Clark as my interest in how paper is manufactured for daily and personal use.   A typical day at work is to always think and perform my duty in a safe manner,  to keep good housekeeping,  and to watch for the safety of others.  Management can sometime be bias.  All rules does not apply to everyone.  I  have gain a lot of information on the steps taken to manufacture the company product, what material are used to make to products  as well as how the products are distributed. I take serious concern about how incidents are handled and how they way they are handled jeopardizing your entire livelihood.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and working with others."
good,"It was a job your on your feet for 12 hrs the machine broke down a lot it was frustrating people at Kimberly  clark were not friendly "
good,Don't get trapped by the money... this place will suck the life out of you. I've never been trapped with so many miserable two faced people for 12 long treacherous hours each day. Taking this job has been the worst mistake of my life and I hope to God I find a way out soon. Don't sell your soul for money.
good,Typical day at work was operating rewinders. Cutting material into specified widths and winding the new sizes onto spools to be doffed and shipped.
good,"As a process engineer at Kimberly Clark, work was challenging, but mainly because the equipment conditions change from day to day with the raw materials.  Many areas of the facility were run down with equipment rusting in place at the time of my departure.  Very few opportunities for advancement beyond the Project Process Engineering Role existed for technical individual contributors.  Union environment also led to conflict between management and the labor force forming a ""we-they"" mentality and culture. Overall, not a bad place to work, but not the cleanest location and job expectations, either.  Work life balance was also a consideration as operators are on a rotating shift basis and engineers are on call frequently nights and weekends."
good,"Picking andpacking was my job. It’s easy  work but the management is not always trustworthy. There was several situation where the managers didn’t properly manage the problem and also they can be very unprofessional at times. "
good,"The job itself isn't hard to learn, its dealing with the people.  The corporate side and manufacturing side are two different worlds. No one upfront cares about what problems happen on the floor. In training it's set up to look like everyone gets along, they have a culture that they go by, and everyone is like family when in reality that couldn't be further from the truth."
good,I don't have much to say about them... If you enjoy working 12 hr shifts then this is the perfect job for you. I honestly didn't like the work atmosphere
good,Kimberly Clark was an unexpected job. I knew it was in the last care business but I didn't think it would be so simple yet tiring job. Putting tampons in a box is all I've done there other than operate machines and clean area.
good,It was ok. Poor senior leadership but great hourly and mid level management teams. They do not respect the work / life balance. But otherwise it was an ok place to work.
good,"Organization is out of touch with employees. Used to be a great culture but now management is only focused on shareholder value. They are driving out a lot of knowledgable, motivated employees to cut jobs. Entrenched management who say that they want new ideas but then only respond if the idea promotes their personal agenda."
good,It is hard to watch a great firm that used to value talent and initiative get taken over by cost cutters with only short term incentives and golden parachutes.
good,El ambiente laborar ha cambiado bastante apuestan más por nuevo y poca experiencia
good,"As a Quality Inspector I learned to manage time wisely when multi-tasking. Co-workers were friendly, team players who always loved a challenge and willing to learn."
good,There was a lot of walking to get to your area in this job. Never seemed to be anywhere close to the parking lot. Always really loud just about anywhere you were besides the break room. The shift rotation was not consistent at all.  Very disruptive.
good,"Desenvolvi habilidades na área da promoção (merchandising), na logística pois fazia pedidos, acompanhava o recebimento dos produtos até a armanezagem."
good,I drive the forklift to move materials from one part of the plant to the other.  I have become a certified forklift driver since being employed here.  The hardest part of the job is organizing the break schedules so that everyone can go to break on time.  The most enjoyable part of the day is when the co-workers all work together to accomplish the tasks at hand.
good,"It started out fine.  I was getting good hours.  But, after a while, they changed the hours, from 12 hours for 4 days one week and 3 days the next to 8 hours for 5 days a week to back to 12 hours for just 3 days a week.  And, there would be times when I didn't work the full hours I was supposed to, which made it hard to get 40 hours or more.  "
good,"Company is pretty much aligned with market-based pay compensation... 2012 rolled out grade levels and eliminated haypoints (so there are less ""rungs on the ladders""/promotional opportunities) to climb."
good,"Work was always low had to many days off, the management was good at the time all he did was watch and never show hands on what need to be done at the of the shift, It was like we were out there on our shift with our head cut off.."
good,"Clocking in, daily plant checklists, plant health analysis, corrections on faulty equipment. Working on Worl's Orders and fillng in job cards. As a senior maintenance person assisting junior staff on breakdowns and planned miantenance."
good,"Many K-C people are great to work with, and then there are others who notoriously throw colleagues under the bus and even call their managers.  The culture is cult like and valued more than objective results"
good,"Uma boa empresa, porém o crescimento profissional deixa a desejar, os superiores conseguem desanimar seus funcionários. plano de carreira muito longo e extenso não tem programa de treinee, então no caso se você não consegue um estágio antes de trabalhar na empresa lá dentro você também não conseguirá."
good,I was hired for 6 months contract and really enjoyed working there.  Business partners are exceptionally nice people.  Unfortunately I was hired as a temp supporting the applications during the period the company was outsourcing.
good,Hours are great and fun people to work with. They do have special days where we get food for job well done. They are very into safety which to me is wonderful
good,"12-14 hour shifts consisted of monitoring and maintaining machines with all learned codes and alerts.  Productivity, safety and quota was top priority.  I was hired through a staffing agency so the pay was minimal with a heavy work load.  Hardest part was the hours.  Most enjoyable was the supplied tampons and quitting time."
good,"night shift is very cool , but at times slow paced when the product isnt finished. they will literally hire anybody at MAU at KC. Hardest part is not using your phone"
good,I enjoyed working with all members of team assisting and providing my administrative skills to allow them to be more productive. I enjoy being the gate keeper to the executive and team members.
good,"12 hour rotating shifts with normally at least 8 hours on your feet with steel toes on a concrete floor. Turnover with other shift, get setup and checkover everything that was turned over to you, usually having to fix setups and centerlining. Load materials and coordinate changes with the distribution team and the change crews. Run the materials through the machine focusing on quality and safety and troubleshooting problems while getting the numbers for the shift. Management was hard to deal with unless you were part of their family orientated clicks. The hardest part was the rotating shifts and getting over looked for other opportunities because somebodys family member put in for the same job. The most enjoyable was the people on my crew and that we had a company provided gym to go to on breaks."
good,"I worked 4 , 12 hour shifts. Hard work and worked mostly independently. There was always something to learn. The management was good to work for and the same with the co workers. Hardest part of the job was working in the heat. The most enjoyable part was the good pay."
good,"I enjoyed working the 4 on 4 off shift work. I learned a lot about valves, steam, paper, and physics. My co-workers were probably more close to each other than in a usual work enviroment, on the flip side, there was more drama. 12+ hours a day together will cause extremes in work relationship. Management was not the best, as they were moved so often, they were not familiar with the equipment in each area, causing them to expect things to be done that was not possible to do safely. The hardest part of this job was trouble shooting why paper would have streaks, creases, holes, spots ect.. in them. Overall It was not too bad of a place to work, the pay was very well compared to many jobs avalable now days, and 4 days a week without loosing full time pay was awesome."
good,"The support/engineering team is severely understaffed and horribly overworked.  Engineers of all levels work minimum ~50 hr weeks and when needed 13 hr days 6-7 days/week with no additional or extra compensation outside of their normal salary, not even comp time.  That being said the teams of engineers and operators are great people and truly do their best to work well together."
good,Not much to say about the job it was for okay but like all factory jobs the work is not easy and the work is tiresome. Also i would like to state that after working there for as long as i did that this job was not the job that i wanted.
good,"Managers only focus on the people they deem ""important"" and treat everyone else like they are replaceable. It wasn't always like this but with the new management team the company has gotten away from caring for the people that keep the business running."
good,"THE"
good,"In retro specific K.C. is undergoing some plant changes overall, management and employee transition. In my life time I have held a few positions either I was already inform of the position and what would be excepted of me. This position at K.C. is the only one where training was provided but never followed thru. The only company I have ever worked for that employees are on there cell phones, tablets, etc. In asking what I needed to do/, what was the next step I needed to follow?, Why is this and why is that!!!!?. I never receive a  response. If I did receive one it was very ,very, vague to say the least. If it wasn't for the fact that I have been expose in the manufacturing and paper industry a lot of what I knew with skills and training that I brought to K.C. Was my only salvation for the period that I was there. Employees were more focus in keeping there jobs let alone train someone that might be there re-placement."
good,"Day starts early due to global role.   Lot of meetings with various areas.   Traveled limited due to budget.  this hurt project rollouts"
good,"As far as factory jobs go, KC would probably be at the upper echelon versus its peers. The money is good, but the hours (rotating shifts) are somewhat detrimental to maintaining a healthy body. Also 12-hour shifts are very taxing and often people who work there for extended periods tend to have negative long-term effects to their joints, muscles and nerves (due to spinal compression)"
good,Large company in the area with several different fields available. Current reorganization leaves much unknown but also presents opportunities to develop and expand skill set.
good,"This is the second time in 9 years KC has done a major restructuring and downsizing. KC has not been able to consistently grow the top line and continues to squeeze the bottom line.  It has created a difficult cycle to get out of, hence the second restructuring."
good,"Kimberly-Clark is a good company to work for but be prepared to juggle a lot of balls. Also, there is quite a bit of churn in leadership. This can lead to conflict objectives."
good,Good environment. Clear area. Work slow down. Being transfered to other department during slow down. Chance department could be shut down. This has happened in the past. All workers in department shut down laid off.
good,The company was in the process of outsourcing many financial positions to India. Therefore moral was very low among employees. There was a lot of turnover and having to meet/train to new people.
good,Overall the pay is not just great but its a job. It gets the bills paid. The people are friendly.......................................................
good,Worked the 12 hour weekend shift for the friday saturday and sunday shift and ended up working every day of the week as overtime. Did not like that overtime was required. Work very repetitive and safely operated.
good,"Not a very flexible job hard on anyone with a family"
good,Real Estate Department layoff of over 100 employees this May.  Facilities and real estate department downsized.  Good package received with benefits for six months.
good,Supongo que fue buena porque solo embolsaba el producto y luego quede como maquinista en la linea de produccion de pañales paras adultos
good,Good Culture. Excellent products. Discount for employees.
good,The corportate atmosphere of a large multinational company was present everywhere. It was a strong independent work place with little help or training.
good,"Not a good place for a career , it’s just not a place you would like to start your career at. The hours and the pay just don’t match and you are constantly are on your feet."
good,Tasked to keep the machine running at peak performance.  Analyze data and write projects up to 5MM to keep the machine up to date on the latest technology.
good,"Kimberly-Clark, (KC), used to give a sense of security in return for hard work and commitment, but within the last four years, this has changed. Loyalty and delivered performance can be trumped by middle management decisions to replace any team member at anytime. Cost savings is now the clear key objective, even at the cost of product quality. "
good,as a company goes t was a grate place the hours where the hardest on someone that has a farm. But the people where sweet and nice  and willing to help.
good,It was a good place to work decent benefits compared to most other places and decent compensation. hardest part was rotating shifts. Fine job for labor working but it just wasn't for me.
good,A lot of my consultants have left. Only had two options for work and after a few weeks there was no work. Have not heard from them since. People were lovely but could not provide on going employment.
good,"Due to the small city where KC offices are, the decisions and networking happen outside the office among local people"
good,"An overall plan in consumer goods was never clear.  It always seemed we were catching up to other competitors.  After the recession, most salaried employees had 2-3 times the workload placed on them but we were lucky to retain our jobs.  It was not sustainable.  It's a company that I feel is harder on the people and not on the process.  The great people made this place.  Some I still keep in contact even though they have moved on."
good,"My experience at KC was mostly positive, but I was definitely disadvantaged by the platform to which they assigned me. I didn't feel like it mattered to them that I was in a declining category. "
good,Is ok place to work. I would recommend to work here to anyone you can make a living been part of the company.  Specially if you enter from straight from school.
good,"I developed and executed all trade marketing activities for the Caricom region in support of the marketing department. the culture at Kimberly Clark is all for themselves. the most enjoyable part of this job was being able to travel, although it was too much, and meet new people in different countries."
good,"Give us your opinion about:"
good,"En mi caso la empresa se manejo muy mal tanto en lo laboral como en lo personal ya que cumpli con cada una de las tareas asignadas en tiempo y forma,Nunca falte a trabajar bajo ningun modo y mi puntualidad siempre fue buena"
good,The job itself is great. Great benefits. Not worth working through a temporary service. The management can be a little over the top. It's a very fast paced job..
good,My typical day is great and i have learned how to packing the product manually and try as best as I can to fulfill the target of the organization.
good,"Great Company but lacks diversity."
good,There are a good company they pay well have very good benefits and 401k  a great place to work I just didn't like being in side all the time.
good,"It was a good, reasonably eel paid job to work while also going to high school."
good,"en esta fabrica todos te saludan."
good,"Function	Activity"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job the ability to ch be creative and watch learning occur and demonstrate measurable performance improvement.
good,"A typical day at work is pulling car parts. Customers order them and I pull them. Ive learned time management. Every part that was ordered had to be pulled by a certain time. The management was excellent. My co-workers were definitely hard workers and I enjoyed working with them. The hardest part of the job was pulling the heavy parts such as car hoods and bumpers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people, I enjoyed working with them"
good,"Typical Day at work (12 hours rotating shift day to night) "
good,Working with this company I’ve learned to have patience. Also working here has taught me the skills I need to get other job opportunities as needed and to work well with others.
good,"World Class company but the culture in the Cape Town plant compared to other plants is very toxic and politics in senior management. A certain group makes all the decisions for the plant and drives their own culture which is demotivating to the staff."
good,Rotating scheduling allows for time off but days worked are 12 hours. The rotation is 2 weeks on days then 2 weeks on nights.  Low pay and benefits are average.
good,Climate controlled in some areas . Not controlled in other areas making it very tought to adapt to. Fast paced self managed facilitiy with a tough rotating schedule that makes home life very difficult.
good,Goo place to work good pay and good people. A safe place to work..The twelve hour shift two days on two days off work every .Other weekend three day weekends when your weekend come
good,"I loved working at KC, but as a contracted employee you receive very little respect. I worked there for 5 years and was the last person in my department to know that I was being laid off."
good,"Reorg every 3 to 5 years, but no substantial change in employee opportunities for advancement."
good,"Classic ""What are other companies doing? We must do the same!"" culture. We're all ""family,"" until VSP's start up. All in all, good work while you can get it, just don't think you'll be there forever. Not personal, it's just business..."
good,"attend meetings starts the day followed by mechanical line rounds."
good,Working for my company has been a worthy experience that has broadened my way of thinking and of doing things. I have tremendously grown career wise in Kimberly-clark thus showing talent development as one of the critical pillars that the company prides it a self with.
good,"Work was balanced, benefits were very good, working conditons were also good.  Most all management needed improvement / training in people skills and employee valuation."
good,Management can be very unprofessional especially when It comes to patients with new hires. Noticed they can be very rude to the outside contractors that they have employeed on site. Jobs not bad just bad apples in parts of management. Avoid working here if possible.
good,"At Kimberly Clark you're giving 1000 things to do, then you have 2000 meetings to get no where working on them. The company loves having their meetings, which is great if you don't like to work very much. The advancement prospects are particularly bleak. Don't come here expecting to make a career out of it, unless you're okay with relocating halfway across the country every 12 months. The company is too cheap to even provide coffee."
good,"Working for Holman Distribution was like a reality show. Everyone was in other people business which was not a requirement of their job. During my employment I worked under 4 people who showed favortism to some and misery to others. I was constantly lied on, written up for whatever reason up until my discharge after a girl tried to fight me."
good,Friendly environment.  Hard work is appreciated and compensated accordingly.  Employees are treated fairly by management.  Company events for employees were welcome relief for the hard work.
good,Lots of great Innovation and opportunity providing fulfillment and training. Rotating shifts combined with overtime creates negative culture concerns.
good,When I worked at Kimberly Clark I met a lot of people. The work was fun but also serious. When times got hard other employees would come to your machine and assist with helping you get your job done. As well as I would move if I was not busy and help with others.
good,It was not a hard job. The management was nice. The environment was clean. We worked 10 hour days. My most enjoyable part was that it was no stress on the job.
good,"The company has changed over the past few years regarding the employees. I enjoyed my job duties of uploading slides to ChyTV program, providing security ID badges to all employees, I was the advisor of the Social Committee and liked to plan events for the site. Administered work direction to the janitorial staff, and kept conference schedules for the site. I created a sharepoint site for our team to use in their daily task, and was very knowledgeable of the facility and what it took to administer."
good,Worked around 40-45 hrs a week in a international position. The people were friendly but I did not enjoy the type of work I was doing. Learned how to plan studies and run a trial in a mill.
good,I enjoyed the perks and the people i Worked with. it was a good company to work for
good,"Una empresa de la cual aprendi grandes cosas, desarrollando talent y entregando resultados de manera sostenida"
good,"i played a very important role at this job, so i had to stay productive at all times."
good,"If you would like to live in a remote, very cold, small town and work in a business with little upward mobility, a culture of passive aggressivism and modest compensation, this is the place for you!"
good,bom ambiente de trabalho  mas não oferece folga todos os fim de semana
good,"despite being told you are special, you are just another number."
good,"Kimberly-Clark is a good company for which to work. At the site for which I worked, safety was #1, even over production. For Electrical Engineers, a typical day would see one overseeing contractor installations or tweaking new HMI systems with existing PLC's (mostly Allen-Bradley/Rockwell Automation). I met a lot of true friends in many of my co-workers, which was probably the most enjoyable part of the job. However, the hardest part was overcoming negative perceptions brought on by a couple of malcontents, a situation that was completely mishandled by those in the management. Again, this was site specific, and nowhere is perfect, but be prepared for style to be rewarded over substance..."
good,Kimberly Clark is a factory that produces Huggies Wet Wipes. It is a friendly environment and also a clean places to work. The hardest part of job is having to work the long hours.
good,Boa só os líderes tinham que saber mais sobre o chão de fabrica
good,"More than a maker of products"
good,It is a good job. They have really good pay and vacation. It’s just the hours are not working out with me having children. Rather work 10 or 8 hour shifts.
good,This job has a lot of benefits as well as not so good management.Working here for me was a starter job which the job consist of details to products.Also I worked in more then one area helping other co workers when behind on work.
good,"falta mas comunicacion de parte de sus jefes, lideres hacia sus subordinados, para poder apoyar a encontrar soluciones a problemas."
good,Little home work life balance.  Good and competitive compensation.  Good atmosphere. Management changed a little to often.  Good people to work with.  Would recommend
good,"12 hour shifts (7 A.M. to 7 P.M.) or (7 P.M. to 7 A.M.) rotating every 3 days with 3 days off. Tough job mentally and physically, hard to assimilate days to nights and vice-versa. I made a lot of good friends in my 29 years."
good,"PROS: KC is a good company to work at, they provide comparable benefits to other companies of their side. "
good,"Before every shift there's a mandatory team meeting to discuss the details of the work ahead and team goals for the shift. Depends on the availability of the forklifts (there isn't many) you would either be working consolidating paper products or housekeeping. Fast paced working environment but some workers do cut corners, hardest part of the job is the long hours (only 30 min lunch)."
good,Kimberly-Clark is a good place to work.  A person can be fully responsible for their job.  A difficult part about working for Kimberly-Clark is the review process.  The whole review process is basically a justification on the small percentage of raises given.  It was not motivating.
good,"Working in Kimberly Clark Bolivia may differ a lot from working at Kimberly Clark US, I believe that corporate culture may not translate in the same way to other countries that is why my experience there may not have been the expected one."
good,A lot of move and a lot of Responsibilities i off load trucks and drove Forklift  and I supervisions some times  it waz a nice place to work  I learned a lot from this job
good,I work there for almost a year -- just not a work environment that worked well for me.  Plus you have to stay in a position 2 years before you can move to another area / promotion.
good,Enjoy working at the plant and knowing different peoples .also getting to find out about differt promotions and meeting new faces.working on different wips and to set the merchandise up for displays.
good,Good place to work and build a career.  Good benefits.  Strong management.  Not enough resources post re-organization in 2018.  Results have been challenged.
good,The job was through a now defunct staffing agency that indicated the position would be a temp to permanent hire. After being there for some time it was decided that they were eliminating the entire department.
good,"I worked as a contractor.  Typical large company, not much else to say.  I believe the mission was to assess a lot of applications that were largely for Marketing, many sites, multiple countries.  It was challenging work as well as rewarding, however I was not there very long and had no intention of relocation."
good,la empresa en general es buena lo que afecta es que no hay mucha calidad de vida
good,its a ok job for someone with out kids or many bills I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there temp. the managers and lead are oka but could be more professional sometimes
good,"Kimberly Clark is a good company to work for even though it has some problems. The work life balance within Kimberly Clark is the best I've seen. Unfortunately, to advance you have to play a lot of corporate politics and your manager plays a huge role in whether or not you excel in your career."
good,Es una empresa agradable laboralmente...con excelente clima
good,"This is a great job. Loved working here with everyone, the management only came and talked to the workers when they needed something. Training went good"
good,"it was not for some one who could not handle the cold or the heat "
good,It's a job but not for everyone. It's easy work I always get there a hour before . Because of they point system I thought they was a good job but they're about self been there for over a year +
good,"A typical day at work is a fast paced environment depending on the number of diaper products the machines must cut, make, and box"
good,"Kimberly-Clark has been a great company for many years.  I really enjoyed working there for the past 23 years.  However they have become to layered and does not promote an entrepreneurial spirit.  They have lost focus on what really matters, which is developing and keeping high quality people."
good,"To much buddy system to get jobs that others are more qualified for."
good,repetitive work. a lot of standing. machines can be extremely dangerous if not paying attention. must pay close attention to the details of the order to make ur day run smoothly
good,"Sound company, culture is easy to get along with, more incentive compenstation is needed, as well as less upper management. Depending on division of sales is whether I would retrun"
good,This company is no longer in business. I enjoyed the work and full time benefits. There was mandatory overtime to complete projects. We refurbished and built new interiors for airplanes.
good,"- Difficult culture"
good,"I did enjoy my job at Kimberly-Clark and had no plans to leave.  I was only 60 when they let me go with 48 years of service.  I wanted to work till I was 65 and then retire but that wasn't in the cards.  They said they didn't need me anymore even though they had two buildings that needed to be maintained.  So, I had no chose but to retire."
good,Great company and enjoyed most of my time there.  It truly depends on the manager to have a successful career at Kimberly-Clark. Benefit package is comprehensive and comparable to other companies of its size.
good,"The company had excellent products and personnel.  Unfortunately, the company was in a state of trimming down personnel over a period of 3 years so that the workplace became a bit cutthroat.  Employees became insecure."
good,It was structured and well organized so every one new their jobs how ever the chief was not always on the same page as the rest off the staff. This made for an imbalance in the flow off the kitchen.
good,"Indeed is a seriously great place to work. Product teams are really close and tight-knit and there's very little friction across functional units. Management takes a very dedicated - yet weighted and scientific - approach to employee feedback and really listens to everyone at every level. The degree of ownership and impact you'd like within your product team is very flexible so everyone can easily find his or her comfort zone. There's an open culture that strongly discourages immature, ignorant, intolerant, hateful, or negative attitudes. The food at HQ is amazing, and the work groups and events allow you to meet a ton of people. Desk space is ample and collaborative while allowing for flexible environments (go work at a couch, a conference room, or the kitchen if you want.) Hours are flexible as long as you're around for meetings."
good,not for me we the people there are just a $ to them.they will fire you for anything they can fine you doing that dos not fit the way they like it. but its good money
good,"I do not have a typical ""day"" at work.  I work 12hr nights, and have for the last 8 years.  The overall culture here is good and is a very safety oriented company.  The hardest part to the job is staying awake during ""normal"" sleep times.  the most enjoyable times here would be, some of the interactions with other employees and of course special events.  If you need to work in a manufacturing facility, this is the best place to work."
good,"They are an awesome company but difficult to get your foot in the door."
good,unless It was the area I was in I wouldn't SUGGEST anyone to work there. simply because the communication was terrible. The management at the time I was there was not professional .
good,Ambiente de trabajo bueno pero deberia ser mejor con lideres compententes que estn empapados en lo que concierne con el negocio gente que sepa lo que estan haciendo y para donde va el negocio.
good,Work 12hr shifts change from nights to days every 2 wks. It is hard to go full time. Great breaks. Everyone stand off. If you are not full time you treated differently.
good,"Everyday we are required to be clocked in by 5:45 a.m."
good,"The machine operator job is a good job, but the biggest down fall is the schedule. We work 12 hour rotating shifts, and we do not get much time at home with our families."
good,Not good for long term. Most of the projects are legacy no growth for learning. Work life balance is good. You can spend time without working much.
good,"productive and simple with a nice environment I really enjoyed working there. Ive learned a lot and I met some new faces. the management was good, and I could get along with all my employees."
good,"Execute assembly sequence duties while meeting productivity and quality standards"
good,"A Typical day was, walk into the warehouse, around 1:45 ish, stretch, go to a small circle with our lead person, then our lead person would tell us what line we was on, then after that we would go to our line and work. Around 6 our manager would call for our 30 minute break. After break we would go back to work until 9:30 ish. Thats when we start to clean up to go home."
good,"I trained with people on the Echo re-winder, where I learned more about it, as I already had some experience."
good,"this was a good work environment, but they closed the plant and moved to Mexico. The local management was a good group of people. they did everything they could to keep us alive and going."
good,"I already provided a review for this company.,.... what do you want me to say... I enjoyed my internship and was grateful for the opportunity to work for them for 8 months"
good,"adiquiri experiencia com uma nova função receptiva com atendimento ao publico , ótima convivência com meus colegas de trabalho ."
good,"The money is good but the people and the shifts are hard to deal with.  If you don't mind working all night and dealing with gossip, then this is the job for you."
good,"Thirty-seven years with the same company, seen many changes, variety of work is great, no two days are ever the same. Not sure how much more I need to add."
good,"Competitive, Challenging but rewarding sales team environment.  Sales team responsible to deliver budget and brand initiatives by working with customer and providing story supported w/ analytics."
good,"Uma empresa com muitas estrategias, mais com algumas dificuldades para executá-las mas eu tinha uma equipe maravilhosa que sempre alcançava os objetivos propostos."
good,"KC is a great company for some people but it was not for me. The work-life balance was terrible in my department and I felt misled based from the job description I was given. I would recommend getting your job description in writing and a clear designation of what you will be doing, otherwise they will do as they please."
good,"I had this great opportunity to work in Kimberly Clark in an international environment which I really like, here I've learned /improve my working skills and I've learned credit management"
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo, buen horario, paga rasonable, lo mas dificil es cuando se te junta el trabajo es complicado terminar"
good,the hourly rate with this warehouse job was good. The worker's morale was almost always down due to constant union threats of jobs being laid off by upper management.
good,"There is never a dull moment, my advantage is I am highly adaptable, manage stressors well! and get on with it.  I have learnt to be aware of planning my day but there is always something that's going to come up to change your scenario for the day!  Awesome c-workers locally and abroad.  The hardest part of my job is to get some of my co-workers to plan their days and week, and that is sometimes challenging!  The most enjoyable part of my job is learning something new every single day!"
good,The main roles within this position were working on a busy production line and keeping to a set schedule. I had to report any faults with the products to the team leader. Making sure the production area complied with the Health and Safety legislation by keeping the area clear or any waste materials.
good,"This role has provided a unique opportunity and insight into the supply chain as a whole.  This combined with my previous buying knowledge, has better equipped me with understanding the role of both the supplier and buyer and how they best can work together to ensure targets/ deliveries are met."
good,Buena empresa pero tiene que tener asu trabajadores de planta
good,"Regular dependiendo de los problemas del dia"
good,"Great company to start career out of school, but can easily bog down an individual's personal growth outside of work. "
good,"I shipped supplies to 70 branch offices nationwide.  I was responsible for purchasing, storing, and retrieving all supplies.  I was employed there for three years before I returned to college."
good,"dinamico muita cobrança, não olha para vida pessoal do funcionario."
good,"Gostei do ambiente de trabalhante, dos colegas, a gerência era ótima, não dava para ficar parado, e boas oportunidade de mudar de cargo mas baixos salários, clientes muito chatos e estressados."
good,"Great trend setters for its industry. Opportunity to move around to various departments and channels of industry. Management can be a bit inconsistent and favortism is a factor as well within some departments, but not all. Unfortunately, the company conducts lay off quite frequently."
good,"Typically, I walked to different departments and interviewed employees and documented their jobs into standard operating procedures for the Baby Child Care division. I took notes and photographed tasks and equipment to incorporate into the procedures."
good,Kimberly Clark is a very good place to work and provides good benefits.
good,"Supported IT Department providing computer support to 300 users in Global Nonwovens Product and Technology Development. Monitored and Supported hardware/software, storages, technical tools, database management, printer support, solve problems, infrastructure, application development, Web development, Networking and Systems Administration. Managed inventory of new and existing equipment. Working with vendor services. Knowledge of methodology, tools, standards and procedures. Research & Read the vendor specifications."
good,"Doing morning rounds, checking levels of chemical tanks, looking for leaks, spills etc. Then tranferring the information I've collected into the computer based data. Hardest part was the machine blow-downs, high temperatures, and dust. Most enjoyable was being able to relate to my co-workers and learning new skills."
good,"the job isn’t what they make it seem to be, if you haven’t been working there for years already you basically only have a chance as an extra & I feel like they play with peoples checks a lot"
good,Great job and friendly co workers.They hire you on fast.As long as you do what your supposed to do they keep you working.I recommend this opportunity to someone looking for great work.
good,"Managers look out for themselves while attempting to maximized associates productivity metrics."
good,I enjoyed my time working for KC the job was very challenging. Planning and maintaining a paper machine day to day. Working in SAP setting up parts and spares. Making sure outages were planned and parts were available. Planning using Micro soft Project.
good,Everyone is friendly and nice. Everyone works well with each other. I don’t like how we have to walk a somewhat far distance of where we have to clock in and out at.
good,buen ambiente de trabajo solo que en cuestión de promontorio son por outsorsing y no contábamos con alguna antiguedad y ninguna prestacion superior ala ley
good,"Wasn't a hard working job, never alot to do. Very bland. But my co workers made the day go by a lot faster. Breaks could have been a little longer. Always felt rushed to eat."
good,"Buena comunicacion con las areas, aspectos a mejorar en el liderazgo en el caso de marketing"
good,"Busy but always challenged and given diverse opportunities.  Work/life balance was difficult to achieve."
good,"The company has a great culture and has come great people.  However, the company also has been facing challenges in the last few years, which has made career advancement almost non-existent."
good,"On a regular day we come in and wait till 5:45 for our manager to place us in our position on the line. I've learn to keep everything work related and not open up to everyone. The management could be a little more professional and less drama. Its beautiful at my job its a nice area to work in. The hardest part would be the long hours, i really do not get to enjoy life outside of work. The most enjoyable part would be working with someone you truly enjoy being around."
good,"For my experience, combined with the expected work load, the amount of time alloted for overall assimilation, minus adequate training- the pay was not very good indeed. Acknowledging a rural setting, I found nevertheless, a fair amount of stress with twice the work at half the pay I earned previously. Daily meetings seemed more of an opportunity to prove one's relevance and share low brow humor than a necessity, trimming time from a heavy workload. Management was very nice but did not provide solutions, so much as meet continuous deadlines imposed on a small department, where help was usually changing hands."
good,Everything was based on seniority.  You had to wait for someone to retire or get fired to be promoted.  They keep lowering the starting wage and the promotion pay scale for newer employees.  Way too many lazy people in charge and working there.
good,"-lack of innovation "
good,"Learn 5S "
good,"KC lacks career planning and clarity on progression for the marketing function.  They recruit a lot of great talent from outside, but later questions external experience when being evaluated for a promotion. Also, higher level positions are often filled with KC employees from oversees, creating a bottleneck of talent. Lots of great marketing talent very few leadership opportunities."
good,"Essa empresa é muito boa um local muito bom para se trabalhar,alguns líderes e gestores poderiam ter um método diferente para cuidar de sua equipe prestando mais atenção nos seus funcionários."
good,"Good Platform to Lean new things an implement and get the output results, good in Business Planning and Execution ,  Good Products in Pipeline to get the Maximum Market Share."
good,"Bueno un dia de trabajo es muy traginado pero a la vez es agradable, aprendi mucho a conocer personas de diferentes personalidades, y tambien comprenderlos que su dia de los clientes son estresados y tengo que entenderlos. Mis colegas fueron muy amables."
good,era bueno este trabajo porque te relacionabas con pura gente de esfuerzo gente con familia y todo
good,"*A day at work starts out busy with meeting in the morning and having solve some of the previous day problems. but as the day progresses, things tend to be at ease as most issues have been dealt with in the morning."
good,"one of our press machine streched all the bolts and fell down."
good,"Fault finding and inspections using centre lining targets, daily safety inspections. "
good,"Kimberly Clark was a great place to work until they exported our jobs overseas. The training they offered has been a great benefit to future careers- lean manufacturing, people/business skills, SAP, and the technical aspects of the job, such as working with high pressure vessels, chemical and steam systems, and a team environment."
good,"The days at work were bery busy making the days fly by.I learned how to manage my days. Most of the management was easy to work with. The best part of the day was my co-workers, The hardest part of the job was keeping all of the jobs on time. Working with all of the people in the mill."
good,Very clean and professional workplace also safe and climate controlled. You are able to sit or stand while you work. Showing up on time every lady is rewarded with new positions and usually a pay raise
good,"Kimberly-Clark is a good company to work for and values work/life balance as well as a safe working environment. The new CEO is encouraging innovation, as well as, a simple, leaner, faster working model."
good,Great company overall however matrix environment and inconstant leadership makes it difficult to learn the business and tools necessary to perform job quickly
good,En muy poco tiempo aprendí y valoré mucho el orden y el ritmo de trabajo.
good,I went to another company due to my commute.  It took me 1 1/2 on some days as I came from Clearwater Minnesota.   My co-workers were very nice to work with.
good,"el lugar de trabajo era cómodo pero con falta de mantenimiento, no tenia ventilación alguna."
good,bastante produccion buen ambiente productos continuos gente amable y solidaria completa fiestas para trabajadores y prestamos para sacar productos
good,Great pay and Benefits. great work/life balance. Slow moving. everyone has to be in agreement before any decision  is settled on. Great company for the right personality type.
good,"Overall, K-C is a good company to work for. It comes with the typical large company problems and advantages.  I found advancement opportunities to be very limited for skilled professionals."
good,"A Kimberly Clark é uma ótima empresa, o salário e seus benefícios são ótimos porém no Centro de Distribuição Mata Atlântica a possibilidade de promoção é baixa."
good,"IT department goes through a re-org. about every 5 years. Who is retained is not based on performance (good or bad)."
good,"es una buena empresa pero no existe estabilidad laboral por lo que el personal trabajo al tiempo con desmotivación."
good,"day at work is same day same work. i've learned a lot from my workplace, trust is earned, and to gain respect is hard. i've learned also to cover yourself at all times, as to your co-worker is the closest you will have to be your back-up. working as a team is more important than anything. the knowledge i've learned i can use in the future. management is management, leads to were they need to get. hardest part is to get support to reach the targets you need to get. most probably the most enjoyable part of the job is that with all the hard work of each shift, that you have reached your goal even though the following day will be exactly the same. co-workers is your team, if you don't have them, you can't get any where."
good,It was ok.   Great manager but overall company was disjointed
good,"Me gusto mucho trabajar para esta empresa"
good,The Company is good to start the job expirience. Also provide a good compensation and benefits.
good,"Kimberly Clark is a good company as there is opportunity within the company to grow, there is a lot of experience which can be acquired due to various department."
good,Work may be easy to some and the hardest part for some is trying not to fall asleep. Paid over 8 an hour. Good food for cafe though you have to pay for the food.
good,I will not disparage KC.  I had a good long run there but outsourcing is fact of life in the Information Technology world.  I learned a lot while working there and I was afforded many opportunities that I did accept.
good,Kimberly Clark is an good company to work for I  feel they should give raises strongly . Kimberly Clark should  continue to managing there safety     rules and principles.
good,It was my first experience so I have learned a lot. I think the company believe hardly in the power of people. I like that I have a lot of activities.
good,"I worked as a Customer Service Rep, for one of the companies and it was very stressful, and they would knitpick at everything. It was many management and/or auditors not doing their jobs and would get mad if you didn't do their job. They sometimes would take their authority and abuse it and it wasn't all bad. They would buy lunch or breakfast once a month, and sometimes get free samples or products."
good,I was hired through a temp service so there were days that we wouldn't have work and we had to go home and that was not a good thing when you have bills to pay.
good,Une vraie culture d’entreprise est le fondement d’une équipe solide. La culture d’entreprise permet de créer et de rester soudée au travers des difficultés.
good,"Great company to work for, but rely too much on peer reviews to determine advancement.  12hr shifts, 3 to 4 days a week, working on an assembly line with anywhere from 2-5 people on it at all times.  You spend at least 9 hours per shift on your feet and moving the whole time."
good,"Kimberly-Clark is a company that provides very competitive wages and benefits to its' salaried workers.  It's also a very safe environment with a great culture related to safety."
good,"KC es una empresa importante dentro del medio, te brinda un grato ambiente de trabajo a nivel local pero a nivel corporativo tiene muchas oportunidades de mejora especialmente en los temas de liderazgo y delegacion de funciones. Localmente funciona muy bien, la experiencia de trabajo es agradable aunque no todas las areas tienen un balance de vida adecuado. En mi experiencia en area de IT teniamos horario de entrada pero el horario de salida es incierto en muchas epocas del año, sin embargo el crecimiento y el aprendizaje profesional es muy bueno si uno se autocapacita, ya que la corporacion no capacita a los mandos medios o jefaturas, solo a partir de las gerencias y posiciones claves."
good,"waking up early,learned to be patients,,tehe bondin or the get together with my co workers,to get the monthly sales,to get the incentives."
good,"Fast passed organization that priorities shift weekly. I learned to cope/adapt with different personalities and styles of working and thinking. The hardest part of the job is trying to let employees understand importance of training and development initiatives, importance of attendance and keep learning. The most enjoyable part is finding new initiatives to develop employees and keep growing the business due to new knowledge and competencies."
good,overall its a good place to work.co-workers are fun to be around and makes the day go by .There was nothing really hard about the job at all.
good,"In general, the organization was overly reliant on old sales tactics vs. evolving their approach to better align with the times. Largely a byproduct of the same people having been within that KCP bubble for so many years. On the other hand, great work/life balance and stability."
good,L'ambiente di lavoro è multiculturale e stimolante.
good,"it was my pleasure to work in Kimberly-Clark. Very nice work culture, good management, learned a lot of skill in SAP Basis Administration."
good,"I would love to still be employedd by this company, and if given to option i would gladly return. the job was a good place to meet new people and learn new things when it came to a prodution line based job."
good,"In Neenah, if you like little to no movement in work and enjoy Management by committee this is a great place to work  zero risk taking, its foreign to this culture, also, if you’re not from Wis. Then you are an outsider. Smile to face but watch out, no loyalty, and especially if you are good at what you do, others on your team will feel threatened… if they grew up in the surrounding areas, and work for KC there’s a good chance most people are lifers their."
good,We normally would work to gather as a team at this company we were like family we all would eat to gather and we would celebrate our birth days and sickness with cards. The company would give us towels paper and paper towel for there appreciation.
good,go to a meeting get our machines and be on the floor by7:30 then we work until 7:00pm. Theyhave 12 hour shift.
good,I don’t like how you just get one break after standing so long doing one thing and rarely rotating. The best way to motivate yourself to keep going is bathroom an water breaks I took when I got the chance
good,Kimberly Clark was a good place to work. The twelve hours shifts took some getting used to but eventually pulled it together. They enforced cleanliness and safety for the packaging of products.
good,"Kimberly-Clark is a great place to work for those who are looking for a company who is dedicated towards their employees happiness inside and outside of the office. They are very flexible in terms of work/life balance. The management is very focused on driving your everyday career growth. However, as an industry, Kimberly-Clark is not the leader and has put in place measures to increase their P&L statements. These measures have brought down morale and, in some cases, have frozen advancement opportunities. If you're looking to drive your career up the ladder at a fast pace, this company is not in a great position to do so."
good,The workplace is not a bad at all to work. The pay is pretty decent but the hours can be tiring because they are 12 hour shifts. I enjoyed working there.
good,"fue algo muy divertido y con facilidad de promosiones, y mis ubicasiones de trabajo me las asignaban cercas de mi domicilio,"
good,Keeping machines up and running the production for the day. I learned to be a team player as well as being a team lead. I was certified to drive four different fork lifts.
good,"A decent place to work, most of the other employees were ok to get along with, others took an instant dislike to some people and made their life difficult. As I worked via an agency, sometimes the shift patterns were ridiculous ie 3 a.m. starts etc, and if a particular line was down, some agency staff sat around and chatted, while others kept themselves busy sweeping up, yet nothing was said to the lazy ones! However, this was mostly down to the agency, not Kimberly Clark."
good,"My typical day went go to the machine relieve my partner then figure out what they did or didn't do to make my day easy.  I would watch the line and the machine to troubleshoot and fix problems as needed.  I would also quality control the process for the product coming out of the machine.  This would be entered into SAP."
good,"Not the company Kimberley Clark but mau at Kimberly Clark sucks "
good,"Corporate structure is to top heavy all the money going upward only"
good,It was my first Job in town and had a regular time working there. Neither hate it nor loved it just needed it. I would recommend it as a starter up job not one to see as a career unless you are a secretary or office personnel.
good,trabajos pesados poco descanso y poca paga lo unico bueno las utilidadees
good,Agencia de colocación por lo que la empresa nos mantiene a la distancia
good,"Uma ótima empresa, bons beneficio, bom salario, bons encaregados, Gerente."
good,I learned a lot from my job at Scott Paper/Kimberly Clark. I worked rotating shift work so my co-workers became my family. I knew my job very well and could trouble shoot paper machines very well. It felt very good to be called in when other shifts were in trouble due to my knowledge of paper making.
good,I enjoyed the staff that I worked with. I was working 12 hour rotating shifts which took some time to get used to but after a while everything worked out.
good,"Depois da mudança da liderança de 2013 a Kimberly Clarck ficou pessima de  trabalhar, aonde entrou lideres com pensamentos retrogados(pre´historico), infelizmente é uma otima empresa, mas com liderança  que não sabe ter a equipe  junto com eles, somente com ameaças de demissões se não fazer isso ou aquilo, Espero que a diretrizes da Kimberly começa a ouvir mais  a operação, principalmente o setor da CDMA."
good,"Packaging product from lines, I had learned about varying packaging set ups."
good,Lots of opportunities to learn new skills and to be involved in new projects.  Constant downsizing makes work/life balance a challenge.  Great team mates
good,Used to be KC met customer expectations while being safe.  It appears now KC is more about the profit margin with the expectation of cheapening the product while charging the customers the same.  KC focuses too much on profit margin which in return does not drive sales up to expectation.  This is not a strategy I have faith in.
good,"hardest part was grade changes in the middle of shift. It was something that happened quite often due to orders. We were timed for the change, but nothing ever happened to the section of machine that wasn't ready to change over."
good,Ok place to work. will only move up if you know someone. sometimes they will give products to employees. i worked through a temp...if you are not a kc employee they don't really care about you
good,"Good place to work, friendly people and good culture. Company not doing too well in US markets. Growth as engineer is not well defined. Enjoyed going to plants that make diapers."
good,I worked as a temp. I worked at the loudon plant also after working in the Knoxville office. Friendly people to work with.
good,"es una excelente empresa,el unico problema es la inestabilidad de los empleados,"
good,"Rotina diária de liberação e acompanhamento de trabalhos de alto risco, em função das minhas atividades aprendi muito da NR18. Liderança e diretoria sempre atenta aos detalhes de segurança e pronta para ajudar. Parceiros de trabalho atuam de forma bem clara. Um dos maiores desafios foi o acompanhamento de montgem de dois manta cargas com altura total de 12 metros de altura. A parte que mais me agrada é que tenho total liberdade de expressção."
good,empresa precisa de uma estrutura melhor na região e
good,"en esta empresa aprendí demasiado ya que entre sin ningún conocimiento sobre ese trabajo, tuve buenos compañeros el ambiente era bueno solo que  para mi forma de ser los supervisores no eran personas capacitadas para desempeñar esas labores ya que sin estudios los ponían en ese cargo, muchas veces no se ponen en el lugar de los operadores y se sentían como si fueran los dueños de la empresa"
good,"Super competitive and extreme office politics, but the pay was above average. Corporate Code of Conduct is exemplary, but there is somewhat of a ""live in fear"" mentality."
good,"Kimberly Clark was a good warehouse to work for, a day to day there was always work to be done, there was always great team work when things needed to get done. Sometimes the work load was way greater than what the set amount of people could do, therefore you were overworked to the point of passing out. management was not bad, but they weren't great either, I guess professional because they were just looking to meet quota."
good,Nice working environment people are nice at time things can get a little flustered management is in order pay could be a lot better and room for advancement could and would be nice without having to wait 2years or more
good,"Se fue perdiendo poco a poco el interés por las mercaderías, es decir en su vida privada ya no se podían pedir permiso por que a todo le ponían peros. Cuando la compañía está súper bien las mercaderías son lo mejor, pero como últimamente se han bajado las ventas en los PDV ya es culpa del  mercadeo que no hace nada es algo que no me gusto en vez de ver de verdad el problema. Y hay es donde deciden cambiar todo el personal como si cambiando el mercado van a ganar más participación en los almacenes o van a vender más."
good,"Overall, K-C is a good company. However; opportunities for advancement are quite limited. Advancement opportunities are usually reserved for millennial employees who rarely stay with the company for more than 5 years,"
good,"a typical day of work is quit busy need to arrange and refill the stocks,make stocks inventory for preparing purchase order"
good,it's great job to have but poor manager's.all day its work no play and the managers harass you on break.co-workers some of them is laid-back.no hard part on the job.its just the managers delete them and this company would employee loving to come to work!!!!
good,"cumplimiento de la rutina diaria de tareas y responsabilidades del área."
good,Es una empresa muy Dinamica pero con muchos candados para crecer.
good,"captura de ordenes y revision de inventarios, manejo de lote por lote en sistema SAP, aprendia manejar SAP, Tress y MS office ademas de trabajar en equipo con co-trabajadores, la gerencia no apoya al personal en los problemas con los jefes inmediatos (supervisores) los cuales son autoritarios y anarquicos, mis coleguas apoyan en el trabajo y compartimos las experiencias en el trabajo, lo que mas me gusto fue aprender a manejar diferentes sistemas y formas de trabajo"
good,"I would recommend working for Kimerly Clark. Their location in Roswell, Georgia was a beautiful complex. Great benefits."
good,Empresa con buenas bases para crecer estratégicamente y conocer el 100 de la operación de la empresa
good,Good pleasant environment team work supervisor always helpful. Easy to progress and move up in the company benefits were good aim liked this company very professional and safety number one
good,it was fine. it was fine. this was a fine job with fine pay and fine responsibilities. some days were not fine. some days were more than fine. the average day was fine.
good,Fun team and nice boss. Working here was a great experience overall and I would recommend it to anyone.I learned a lot about how a group worked in a business environment.
good,"This is a really great company and I love that they pay every Friday. It gave me a new experiences , neetinf new people and learning new things. I wojld definitely work with them again if possible."
good,They treat employees fair for the most part. Could be more competitive in there wages. Need to be prep as red for the tour schedules. 12 hour shifts either 7am-7pm then switch to 7pm-7am. Also be prepared for mandatory overtime.
good,"Working 12 hrs shifts 3 days on day shift then 3 12hr shifts on nights and 24 hr turn arounds with mandatory overtime, sometimes up to 8 or 9 days in a row, in a very physical job can make this a very trying vocation. You're either made for it or not. Personally after 6 months my back and knees have given up. That being said I'm moving on. I am looking for a regular all day or all night job with regular hours."
good,I enjoyed it while it lasted.... I liked some of my co-workers but the rest are ok. It was a lack there of there and really no one to talk to to get everything back to flowing. It was more horseplaying than working supervisor and all
good,K-C is a good company with lots of good people. Products are tops in the category for quality and value.  There are down sizings every 2-3 years so plan on starting your career here versus finishing it.
good,"I believe the company is pretty good but the environment changed once my manager was let go.  Unequal distribution of work was my major challenge and new management showed preferential treatment to others in like role.  "
good,"Kimberly Clark is a stable, consumer products company that has been in business for many years.  They have global offices, so the chance for relocation is available."
good,"I appreciate the opportunities I have had to grow my skill set through the education, experience and exposure I have had at Kimberly-Clark.  I am proud to work for a company that is a partner to the communities we operate in as well as those we do not."
good,"It was a very new division at that time in the country I was in but with very solid intentions to be in that market and invest."
good,"i enjoyed working at k/c all employees and management were great to get along with.  Rotating shifts were nice as well, training was outstanding.  opportunities for advancement were also great"
good,A leader in their industries. A great group of people to work with and definitely opportunities for advancement. A reliable company that offers great benefits.
good,J’ai acquis une bonne expérience professionnelle en effectuant mes premiers pas dans l’industrie chez KC.
good,"KC is a structured, risk adverse company. Highly collaborative but not a place for out-of-the-box ideas. Need for buy-in at all levels and functions makes for long decision-making process. "
good,Organizacional multinacional con buenas oportunidades de aprendizaje
good,I am not impressed with the work environment. I'm used to working outside and this is an issue factory job. I'm just not interested in the factory work.
good,Kimberly Clark provides excellent salary and benefits.  There are many opportunities to advance and move around the country and the world.  They also provide structured career development planning.
good,Most of the people was ok. Good pay. Good learning experience. Good pay. I think you just have to be somebody of real interest when it comes to working there. But overall good company.

good,Kimberly Clark has some of the best personal care machines in the world.
good,"Me gustó mucho el ambiente laboral que era bastante relajado ya que la mayoria era gente joven y dinámica con ideas frescas. Me daba la libertad de gestionar mi tiempo para entregar a tiempo cada proyecto que me fue asignado pero a la vez tuve la oportunidad de trabajar en equipo. Una de las experiencias que más me gustó fue la convención rompiendo barreras que se hizo en calatayud en donde hicimos dinámicas grupales para establecer los objetivos para el 2015 y lo más interesante de todo es que cada miembro de la empresa participo para forjar esos principios. Nunca había trabajado en una empresa con tantos valores. La parte que me se me hizo más difícil, fue la burocracia que tienen las multinacionales, que muchas veces necesitas la aprobación de muchas personas para lanzar un producto nuevo o un empaque nuevo y por culpa de esa burocracia no se llegaba a tiempo a las promociones en tienda."
good,I really loved having this job. If you are able to work rotating shifts and 12 hour shifts then it is perfect. I would love to go work there again.

I made hourly rounds and documented operating conditions of Boilers, Turbine Generator, steam turbines, heat exchangers, pumps, valves and air compressors"
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo , mal manejó de repartición de categorías"
good,"At times it seems that they care about you as a person, but when new leaders move in, they do not notice you until you do something wrong. They do not inquire about you to get to know you and can ne cold at times. Sometimes you will get a manager who genuinely cares and tries to help you succeed."
good,"The current pay is not enough for the amount and type of work u do especially for 12 hr shifts."
good,I like constant hours love to have or get over time whenever it is available to me and I strive myself to be early never on time if I’m on time I feel like I’m late
good,"cultura,llegar temprano para recibir el turno, y asi enterarse le lo acontencido en el turno anterior"

good,"Kimberly Clark is a safe place to work, and makes you hold yourself and others accountable to that safe standard.  When you're there you are there too work. Everything that could sound negative about the job they let you know before hand. It is a positive working environment that allows for teaching on the job, and there is no punishment for asking questions."
good,Great place but unfortunately Corporate decided to pull the plug on the Fullerton facility so I had to jump ship. The Pay was great and people where cool.
good,The days were long because it was 12 hours but it was worth it and everyone was nice and I enjoyed it. The training was great as well as the work it was fun and kept me active
good,As a safety professional no two days are the same. It is important to be flexible in this role because you never know what you will walk in to every morning.
good,KC offers a leadership team who are comfortable and open to conversations with all levels of the company.  KC drives strong accountability particularly at the business and marketing function.  KC is challenged by resource management and the ability to hire or promote from within.  Most senior leaders are from McKinsey and they hire outside McKinsey colleagues instead of promoting internal KC employees.
good,"The employees, you work with are some of the best around, and yet very under appreciated by management. Managers are for the most part good, they drive results, but some that cycle in don't have a clue and typically don't last long. The overall corporate leadership is lackluster. They don't give any assurance of the companies future and don't inspire any confidence. Overall it is a great place to work, if you're not concerned with trying to retire from there."
good,This was  a fun job to work. everyone worked together to achieve the goals set forth. Everyone was friendly and always willing to help each other. Enjoyed this culture.
good,"A conservative company that is trying to be better in terms of growing and changing with the generation and times, but we just have not been able to turn that corner yet. We are a public company, so we make decisions based on our stakeholders instead of business beliefs and strategy and thinking outside the box. The culture allows us to be flexible with our time and day, which is nice. It's overall a good company, happy to be here, but I'm looking for growth."
good,Great place to work. Was able to work remotely several weeks throughout the month. The downfall was that this was contract work that didn't become a corporate position until after two years.
good,"Great company to work - Fox Valley location in Wisconsin. Good culture, good benefits, and favorable leadership options for women. I recommend Kimberly-Clark as a good place to work."
good,"The work was slow paced and advancement opportunities were very hard to achieve.  Benefits were great, working conditions not so much.  You are on your feet constantly.  It takes years to advance to other positions."
good,typical day is very busy getting material for production. putting finished product away for picking and preparing for shipment.packing product for shipping loading trucks
good,"Son ordenados, pagan antes de quincenas y velan por la seguridad de sus empleados. Tienen dispensario medico y un bonito y gran comedor."
good,"El trabajo el bastante satisfactorio (para mí) el problema son las personas, que no valoran las capacidades de las personas y contribuyen a desarrollo personal...."
good,Además de poder aprender mucho y dearrollar muchas competencias la cultura de empresa es ejemplar
good,"You join based on company reputation, you plan to stay a few years and without realizing it, you've been there 15 years. People are great and want to help one another succeed; understanding that when we lose, we all lose and when we win, we all win."
good,"E uma ótima empresa, em termos de benefícios, salário, planos de carreira,e um ambiente que oferece segurança no local de trabalho porém a gestão nova  de uns 3 anos para cá e muito ruim, desde que  foi trocada ficou um ambiente muito carregado para se trabalhar devido as injustiças cometidas pelo gestores prezando sempre o favoritismo."
good,"Kimberly Clark offered me a sales trainee experience that derived on knowing every retail environment in a short amount of time. The hardest part of the job was my adversity to work on something different than my career (chemical engineer), but later I enjoyed every aspect of it, working outside an office, and meeting a lot of people."
good,"Ótima empresa para iniciantes, fácil aprendizagem. Aprendi ajustes em máquinas, embaladoras, etc. Devido o grande número de analistas e engenheiros na área sentia que os mesmos ficavam perdidos e não delegavam tarefas corretamente.Mas era agradável trabalhar com a equipe, pois todos trabalhavam na igualdade."
good,"Es una empresa donde existen muchos beneficios para los empleados (flex time, family friday, oferta de productos para empleados)"
good,Regular. hacen mucha diferencia a los contratados y no tenes estabilidad laboral.
good,"Excelente ambiente para se trabalhar, empresa investe em capacitação de seus funcionários constantemente. Cultura institucional muito difundida entre os colaboradores."
good,"muy buena empresa, buenos productos, buenos compañeros de trabajos, cada uno sabe que hacer y nos enseñan a cubrir a los compañeros."
good,"empresa boa de trabalhar, resultando na satisfação da maioria dos funcionarios"
good,"Kimberly-Clark has a really good culture.  They understand the importance of family and work-life balance.  Kimberly-Clark also has begun to focus on helping develop each employee down their desired career path.  The one downside to Kimberly-Clark is the location.  Kimberly-Clark may have many locations, but the majority of the opportunities are located in Neenah, Wisconsin.  Neenah, Wisconsin is a small town with very long and cold winters.  Other than the location,  Kimberly-Clark is a great company."
good,Worked on the family care team providing customer care to the consumers that called in.  The team lead was very and helpful and the co-workers were friendly and made work enjoyable.
good,Didn't work for the company just through temp. but it was still a productive workplace with a safe environment. Not much stability at the time but i still enjoyed working at the Kane warehouse in Pittston.
good,staying awake at night hardest part. enjoyed the crew and management
good,"Sur le plan de la gestion des opérations et de la gestion de projets, Kimberly-Clark est vraiment exemplaire."
good,"My experience was positive.  I worked with great co-workers and felt that I learned a lot about production as our goals were met regularly.  I felt that my job came easily to me because I enjoy this type of occupation.  There were times that were challenging when things didn't run smoothly but for the most part, I was extremely happy."
good,"Com o contato direto com as diversas áreas e colaboradores, proporcionou um grande aprendizado no planejamento, recebimento e entrega de materiais, contato direto com os gestores e colegas de trabalho, os inventários periódicos foram as tarefas mais corridas e o contato com os clientes internos e fornecedores foram as tarefas mais agradáveis."
good,a typical day is 8 hours long
good,"it made me the best i am today,taught me how to be best in different cultures i worked with,gave me extensive training both personal and work related"
good,"Good Place to work just very few oppurtunities to move up. It has given me a lot of different experiences though. Like Safety, Training, Computers, Machine Process Knowledge, and other skills that will be helpfull at other jobs. My job changes from time to time all of our Jobs are mainly Temp as far as staying in that job they range from 1 year asignments to up to 5 year assignments. The job I am currently in is in Waste reduction. I currently check the top 5 waste areas on 8 diaper machines every morning and work on those areas till the root problem is resolved. Then when they are resolved I start over on new problems. The hardest part of the job is to put standards in place and the substain them. Waste has not been something we have really concentrated on in the past therefore it is hard to get the buy in of the operators that have been doing it for a long time that way. With the economy like it is though it is important to save in all areas. The most enjoyable part is the challenge and the results. It is awesome to go into a meeting and show the numbers of what a 1% reduction in machine waste actually adds up to in real money."
good,i was a temp working on the back of the machie and it was long hours but it seem to go by fast so you hardly new about the hours
good,"Ambiente laboral, regular, oportunidad de crecimiento poca, sueldo bajo pero utilidades muy buenas en general buena empresa para iniciar en tu primer trabajo"
good,"Good employer. fair with good contracts and nice central Brighton offices"
good,"Muy buena empresa en cuanto a prestaciones, de muchísimo prestigio en el país"
good,"8 happy years, sadly had to leave due to redundancy."
good,Great job good hours great pay fun to meet new people and drug free zone I’ll love to go back and work there again but kinda out of my area and can’t dilrive that far again
good,Good place to work with good pay. Pay increases dependent upon passing certification test . Involved management that stress safety. Also very engaged with employee development.
good,"Great place to work. Job is relaxed if knowledgeable about task. Great atmosphere, positive people, great pay. Huggies is a strong brand and being apart of the process has been wonderful."
good,Was a great place to work with very good benefits and opportunity for advancement. Restructuring process currently ongoing leaves people wondering if they will have jobs in the future. Possible plant closures still looming always have you wondering if you made the right choice.
good,"Good place to gain experience. Company is happy to invest in the mill, so there is always a new project coming in or new machinery being installed. Solid company financials and they take stability seriously"
good,"Kimberly Clark is a good company to work for. The career advancement is slow, managers have tight budgets to hit. Your raise is biased entirely off of how your manager likes you and not the work that you perform."
good,"Great people to work with. Great atmosphere. "
good,"Some day good but steady, hard work."
good,"Kimberly-Clark has really great brands and had been a company based on a culture of trust and respect built with a great-midwestern feel. They offer tremendous flexibility in your work arrangement - as long as the works gets done. That said, there is a lot of work, and now more then ever less people to do it."
good,"KC are a very good company to work for, incredibly supportive and generous salary and benefits. Unfortunately am being made redundant however I have felt well looked after during the process. Regrettably this will affect my career advancement within this company"
good,"It definitely has its own culture. Safety is our #1 value. There is room to grow from within & it is highly encouraged. Management takes a role in the day to day with its  employees, but it is a company that is out for profit."
good,"Lots of benefits for full-time employees, but as a contractor I saw none of them.  Very supportive of parents and people with chronic illness, on-site healthcare and workout facility."
good,"I have the opportunity to work there ,fast pace ,but safety first place great company for me to show off my skills ,lots of overtime ,good place to work ,"
good,"Empresa en constante reestructuración, ambiente de trabajo agradable."

good,Muy buena empresa con buenos turnos de horario tenía problemas para el trasporte de madrugada pero era lo único  en lo que no podía por que no entra transporte a esas horas
good,"Overall I really enjoyed working at Kimberly-Clark.  Most of the people I worked with were great!  I typically worked 9 hour days, but there were certain days of the monthly cycle in my last department where it wasn't unusual to work 10-12.  I learned a wealth of knowledge about Supply Chain (customer service, distribution, transportation, planning, forecasting) and Customer development.  My favorite part of the roles was working with the customer teams out in the field.  The hardest part of the job was changing and sometimes unclear objectives and team vision.  It was nice having perks like working from home one day a week and Friday afternoons off in the summer.  There are many diversity groups like Women's Interactive Network, African American Employee Network, etc that were great for learning and networking.  The benefits were pretty good, although they have been declining over the years.  There are plenty of roles for career advancement, if you know what you want to do and are willing to work hard to move up."
good,Allowed to set own work schedule and objectives which supported overall team objectives. given freedom to adjust as necessary to get the job done. interacted with team members around the globe
good,"Friendly co-workers with a common goal who are willing to help out other team members. People are always willing to answer questions. Direct managers are approachable, but sometimes hard to get ahold of due busy schedules."
good,A small close-knit family atmosphere where everyone looked out for each other. The safest work enviroment you could ask for. Plenty of opportunity to learn and expand your skill sets.
good,It is a good place to work. The pay in alright and benefits are good. The people there are typical with a few exceptions and the work conditions are suitable.
good,"At the beginning, the great work-place promises didn't seem to live up to expectations. I then learnt that my team was going through a rough patch. Once the initial stressful, competitive atmosphere passed, the job became a lot more satisfying."
good,Nice place to work. Decent wages and benefits. Employees were very productive and enjoyable to work with. Climate controlled working area. Learned how to operate several different production machines and daily tasks of warehousing. Management was easy to talk too.
good,KC has been a staple in the Fox Valley since it's inception. Many of the jobs are now moved to outsourcing. Look at each opportunity on its own merit.
good,"Trabajar en KC es trabajar rodeado 100% de equipos de alto desempeño. Es el perfecto escenario para encontrar personas retadoras, cuestionadoras y constantes agentes de cambio.Te enseña a balancear tu inteligencia emocional y pensar continuamente en el desarrollo."
good,"Although I only worked for 15 days per month in order to reach my total amount of hours required  to work per month,I never had time for my family cause you always needed to be available when they call."
good,"Everyone was very helpful in the individual departments and friendly. They choose to keep you on as temporarily and not hire permanently."
good,"Great to be able to work from home and be in a self-motivated work environment.  Able to work with salesmen from all over the US and Canada.  Worked closely with customer service, marketing and government bidding."
good,"KC is a great company.  I learned a ton about doing business globally.  Unfortunately, in a global role, you were time zone immune, and always on...Leading to late night/early morning meetings with offices in other parts of the world."
good,"Overall the work life balance and culture are great at KC. If you are looking for your ""forever role"" you can be very happy. They seem to only hire externally for job openings, and have no focus on developing or promoting internal talent."
good,Working as a consultant.  Generally good place to work with smart people and a good culture.  They treat their employees well.  Most people I meet have a desire to do things right.
good,Plenty of hours fast paced good benifts cafeteria on site chances to move up operation pf lift and palletizer snd unloading and loading of trucks. Receiving finished product and non finished product
good,Good team and good experience where learn how to work in team and under pressure. Salary was perfect and contract was sure.
good,Over all working with Kimberly Clark was a great experience.  Co-workers were some of the most enjoyable people to work with. Just knowing that you always had a helping hand near by made the work much easier and I always tried to do what I could to return the help. My manager was always on point with all co-workers and helped when he could as well.
good,"A day of launching new product involving process improvement and settings on machine and still stay in line with safety and quality, productivity."
good,"Kimberly Clark is a great place to work.  They value diversity and leverage it to make their company world class.  K-C employees often stay for the length of their career due to the world-class atmosphere, benefits and values."
good,I have had an amazing time working with and for them. They were very great working with a flexible schedule and when I had my accident. Even still insuring I have a job.
good,"The people at KC are very caring about each other, very much like family.  Overall, work life balance is good.  Management is generally caring and helpful for those with personal or family problems.  "

good,Good place to work.  Great growth opportunities available for employees.
good,Dias são previsíveis e estáveis. Aprendizado técnico muito bom. A direção/ gerência aplica a política global da empresa. Meus colegas de trabalho são interessados. A parte mais difícil é a previsibilidade e a mais agradável é o uso de alta tecnologia e controles de processo avançados.
good,"typical day at work, would be to get your job duties, whether its unloading or loading trucks with your forklift or delivering material to machines. I learned a lot working for Kimberly Clark, warehouse forlifting and production wise, got familiar with using the forklift and liked it a lot, working as a team in a safe manner,to me,there was nothing hard about this job,maybe the hours some days but nothing major about being hard"
good,"muy buena lastima q por corto tiempo ya q era contratado .excelente horarios de trabajo muy buena enseñanza ,excelente compañeros de trabajo."
good,"Packed Tissue,paper towels, and Diapers"
good,"daily work, learned alot of new things , managment was the owner very nice peple. My coworkers were nice but not so motivated as me. The hardest part of my job was trying to have people be as motivated as me! i loved the work!"
good,"al ingresar fui operaria en linea de produccion a los 6 meces fui capacitada parar ser control de calidad del producto en este caso (pañales), seguido de esto se me capacito y califico para ser inpectora de calidad que aparte de ser control de calidad me comprometia y responsabilizaba en otras operaciones en sist de gestion SAP. por ej. aprobaciones, liberaciones, contabilizaciones."
good,pues es un dia de trabjo es bueno pues aprendes y estas en movimiento todo el dia
good,"KC changed over the 20 years I was there. At first I had many opportunities and I actually enjoyed various challanges there. Over the years I noticed a shift in their values and everything moved towards money money money. We used to partner with our vendors and it changed to us being dictators. Then in 2003, KC downsized and eliminated my position. I was still in the partner mode and no longer fit the new culture."
good,"Ive learned alot of my technical skills, and manufcturing training abilities while working her."
good,The work was as expected and I was doing the pretty standard stuff. The hours were good and the rates were great. The people were nice and they are big on the safety of their employees
good,"Technical individuals are skilled and work well as a team. There are also new projects and challenges that keep the work interesting because of the various business units Global Nonwovens Supports and supplies materials."
good,"Estupenda empresa. Recomiendo buscar tiempo para conocer gente y siempre tener en cuenta la visibilidad de tu trabajo, u otros se beneficiarán de ello."
good,Large company that takes care of employees. Many long term employees that retire after many years of service. Safety in workplace is important to them.
good,"KC is a good company with decent work life balance. Most managers are flexible with work schedule but not always possible. There is cafeteria on campus and engineers eat lunch together which is cool. Regarding actual job, it can be frustrating at times as certain projects can take forever to implement depending on resources available, agreements with other plants, and cost issues."
good,"The thing that most people should get used to first is the heat and heavy lifting. However, it doesn't take too much to get used to the manual and once you do, it's fairly easy."
good,"Tiene muy buen ambiente laboral sin embargo, el salario podría mejorar."
good,Like most companies K-C has some great people and some not so great people. The not so great people made it an unpleasant experience. It's sad when a few bad apples have such an influence.
good,"Công ty KC là một môi trường vô cùng năng động với những phúc lợi vô cùng cạnh tranh"
good,"Es una empresa muy bien organizada, el ambiente es tranquilo."
good,"I loved working here!  It as a great place to work with great people who genuinely do the right thing.  Sometime though, good talent tops out too quickly with little to no movement in career.  There are career managers (20+ years at the same manager level) there that have little to no motivation to do anything for their employees and they aren't willing to get out of the way for others to be promoted either.  In the end, good company and has potential to turnaround."
good,"Es buena empresa, pero es demasiado que no tengan hora de salida."
good,"Great company, cutting edge technology , abreast of current trends in the market place and adjusting when needed.Provided great coaching and room for growth and opportunities."
good,"Site manager was an excellent mentor.  "
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es bueno, los horarios son flexibles."
good,"KC is a great company and offers many benefits and perks.  The people there are great and the talent is solid.  However, I am concerned about the company's future growth and the career development programs and plans are very weak.  Basically you can sit there in a role forever and not much advancement or opportunities for advancement.  Also, the company is very poor at allowing cross functional experiences."
good,I loved work there the pay was great the management there was excellent my only complaints were that the hours seemed slow and some of the employees were hard to deal with for attitude reasons
good,I was there as a contractor and would go back if given a chance. Work life balance is maintained and consideration is given to the employees' personal needs.
good,Team oriented and employees are recognized for their work. Great company to work for. Compensation was fair. Great programs for employee development. Healthcare was one of the best I have ever had.
good,"Long hours but rewarding experiences working with talented professionals in a results-driven, respectful culture.  Deeply disciplined in Lean thinking."
good,"Cette entreprise dispose de plusieurs équipes qui sont toujours présentes pour participer à la formation des apprentis. "
good,Good place to work if you can handle rotating 12 hour shifts. KC is a very focused of the safety of their employees. They take the time to train their employees and to equip them with all the knowledge needed to do the job safely.
good,The jid pays great but you sacrifice a lot of time away from family.you get good training. Its a fast paced environment. The retirement isn't bad at all. But as you get older the work rotation gets hard to deal with. I learned a lot while there
good,"Productive, fast paste Also a nice environment. Friendly workers. Very careful forklift drives coming at all times. Steady walking. Twelve hour shifts"
good,"We worked as a team, everybody was committed to give their best, think out of the box and take projects as their own building empowerment and accountability on a daily basis. I learned how to manage people locally and in other geographical areas. I also learned to build talent and learn from my subordinates.

good,temas muy complicados en lo económico y el ambiente se me tornaba muy gris

good,"Um empresa que dava liberdade de trabalho, com um bom gestor, sendo atividades de visitas a clientes e acompanhamento de trabalho da equipe de excução"
good,"Enjoyed colleagues.   HR systems appeared antiquated and opportunity for growth among the operators was limited due to lack of motivation and drive.  Efforts made for development and growth, but day to day got in the way.  Ultra safe environment created hindrances at times."
good,"It is somewhat difficult to progress within the company.  Otherwise, most of the people are good and friendly.  There are a lot of changes within IT."

Cerca de las 8 teníamos 10 minutos para ir a tomar un café, te, etc. Luego volvíamos a la cinta hasta las 12:30 donde íbamos al comedor por 40 minutos para comer y después volver al puesto de trabajo y aguardar a que llegue el reemplazo cerca de las 13:30, 13:40."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the people, costumers and colleagues, they make the office the perfect place to work."
good,"J'ai commencé au poste de chargé de clientèle logistique pour la France avec un niveau d'anglais moyen. Au bout de quelques mois, j'ai pu participé a de nombreux projets et missions tels que des workshop sur l'amélioration des processus interne ou l'implantation de SAP dans l'organisation fille en Arabie Saoudite. étant en relation direct avec les client, ce poste peut être assez stressant si les produits sont en retard à la livraison ou détériorés."

good,I have met so many good people at Kimberly Clark. Personally I have a hard time with the 12 hour swing shift that we work. I have total respect for all those who have worked shift work for 20 + years.

good,"Empresa muito boa, porem não cumpriu com o acordado no contrato de trabalho, levando ao pedido de demissão"
good,"Excelente horarios para trabajar, un poco movido pero gracias al grupo que tuve fue muy llevadero y hasta entretenido, excelente relaciones laborales."
good,"Overall, Kimberly-Clark provides an awesome work environment.  The management and leadership teams foster and encourage growth and have a knack for pulling out potential that you didn't even realize you had!  However, their performance process leaves much to be desired.  Never should you be rating employees that haven't even completed their 90 day probationary period with people that have been there for 20+ years!  Their performance process follows something similar to a bell curve and seemingly is more based on who you have gone to lunch with than the work you've done.  They are very much into the corporate fads and jump on every fad that arises in the industry and expect their employees to follow suit.  First it was the ""Who Moved My Cheese"" fad, now they are beating their employees over the head with ""Culture of Accountability and The Oz Priniciple"" much to the point of brainwashing.  They have lost many talented employees in their quest to move from ""C1 to C2"".  (Google it.) :-)  Great company at the end of the day but if you're not savvy with corporate strategy and politics, you will fall flat on your face here!  Buyer beware!"
good,"Worked within a team of seven colleagues which included Mechanical and Electrical Technicians. Maintaining the process by managing downtime and grade changes.

Mas quando chegamos no final de um ciclo percebemos como é gratificante ter feito a gestão certa faz toda e diferença para atingir os resultados."
good,"Work on a rotating 12-hour, compressed work-week schedule. I learned how to use computer systems (MS-Word, Excell, Power-Point, etc), learned how to become proficient with logistics, as well as the operation and maintenance of a wide variety of mechanical and electrical equipment used in the mass production of pulp and paper, working safely with HAZMAT. I got along well with co-workers and management. The hardest part of the job was meeting deadlines with production demands, but this was completed successfully. The most enjoyable aspect of this job was the efficient processes we developed, using communication and experience, to keep a very safe work environment."
good,"The fact that I have worked for over 20 years at Kimberly Clark speaks volumes. I have always found it to be a pleasant and above all safe environment to work in. I have had various roles during this time both days and shift based. Roles have included being a shift electrical technician responsible for immediate breakdowns, performing standard work and machine operation. On days I have worked as a niche technician responsible for spare parts, documentation, specialist support and development of various areas.

good,"La manera de trabajo es turnos rotativos mañana tarde noche, se aprende bastante si se nuestra interes, los jefes se muestran preocupados en caso de no ir bien las líneas de producción, la parte mas dificil es llegar al nivel exigido en periodo corto de tiempo"

good,"Una empresa estable, leal con sus empleados, con amplio conocimiento técnico al alcance de todo el personal."
good,"I love KC as a company. Pay and benefits are above average, and there is a very focused effort on taking care of KCers. However, promotions are given based on seniority, not performance. To get promoted at KC you have to leave and come back. All the top performers know this, and decide to leave."
good,"Unfortunately, the department I worked for was outsourced to India.  Everyone was super nice and cared about each other. It was the best place I have ever worked!"

good,Has great benefits and the people for the most part are okay. Depending on what department you are in the walk and designated route is cumbersome.  Always serves breakfast and lunch
good,a lot of hours and weekend work. I worked there for 8 years and think the company is a good place to make a living. Unfortunately with the good money and lots of OT comes little free time. If you NEED weekend time for other obligations this is not the place for many of the positions there.

good,"Buena empresa falta liderazgo de gerencias"

good,l'impresa si preoccupa molto nella sicurezza del personale
good,Co-workers and the company leadership were great to work with. The overall nature of the consumer care industry can make the business somewhat unpredictable and subject to the ups and downs of the global economy.

Have to be at my work station and discuss any problems with night shift.  I learned about the five s project.  I learned how to have a board meeting to communicate with all management teams and associates to discuss issues and safety in the work areas.  The hardest part of the job is working with product that was not coming in correctly on the machines. Also the warehouse and the heat.  The fun parts of the job was when we had three days of activities and every shift participated.  It was called safety days.
good,Good culture of work hard and get rewarded. Great people to work with/for.Management is very hands off as long as work is being done and milestones are met with your projects.

good,"I had my most enjoyable and fulfilling part of my career at K-C. In my near 20 years at K-C I can say that I was most satisfied 95% of the time until about six months before I left. The caring culture started to deteriorate and was replaced by a cut throat and aggressive approach that valued uncaring consultant types from outside over experienced long term employees. This change resulted in my decision to retire. That said, I would be forever grateful for the amazing opportunities I was given at K-C and my only wish is that it could have continued."

good,"KCC's culture revolved around what you accomplished and not who you knew or who you chatted up during the day.  They had good benefits, typical of a Fortune 100 company.  The leadership had an open door policy and were willing to understand that their were project that may sound good on paper, but were really not cost effective or could not implemented.  They listened to and valued the input of their employees and there was always room for advancement both laterally and upwardly.  Sadly, even though Gartner rated their IT department as right sized and highly effective and performing at below average cost, Tom Falk decided to outsource.  This was announce almost 1.5 - 2 years prior to the actual outsourcing took place and after 1yr it became like working in a morgue.

Management was very supportive, but only worked business days - nights and weekends were left to us, but we had numbers to call if needed. Co-workers were well trained and overall they were good operators. Hardest part of my job was working in a central control room located out of my area and in a different part of the pulp mill.

I enjoyed learning how to drive different styles of forklifts and working closely with customers."
good,I thought everything was pretty great about working at KC but as a contractor I did not feel like I was part of the team.  It was also pretty apparent that they were not in a hurry to convert me to a permanent employee as I was led to believe in the interviews.  Contractors are coming and going out of there all the time and it can be disheartening.I believe it is a much more stable environment for permanent employees.

You can move up in pay grade pretty quickly certifying on different machines.

My co-workers and I got along very well we became a family in our different work areas. Our motto was ""be your brothers keeper"".

My co-workers are easy to get allow with no problem at all in that catergory. The most enjoyable part are the three day weekend. And, those are every other week. The hardest part about the job is the long drive that I have to take to get to the job. The management is very good also no complaints there at all.

Fantastic work-life balance at this position (work from home one day a week and half-day Fridays during the summer months). It was stressful at times, but there's a great support staff to help get things done in a timely manner."
good,"Great place to work, the management at Ogden plan were awesome to work with, plus all Sundays worked, were paid double time. The ONLY reason I left, was cause of the rotating days, nights schedule."

good,I operated a fork lift. I was responsiable for empting the recycle bins of every machine.
good,"Its a great company, but unfortunately their CEO was not, because of him we all lost that good paying job."
good,"A very challenging and rewarding job. People were awesome to work with. Like most places it was work, so work isn't always fun. We worked rotating shift work 12 hour shifts. We had overtime opportunities all the time. Hardest part of the job was trying to break in the new people. Our machine was so massive that people were intimidated very easily. Breaking them of their fear so they can focus in actually training was the most difficult part of the job. There was physical work aswell but that is just part of it."

good,"I worked in two locations and the locations differ completely. While working in Roswell, I enjoyed being an intern and had a lot of fun while completing my tasks without being micro-managed. While in Neenah, WI, I felt that there was a lot less of work-life balance and didn't enjoy all parts of my job. Two different views of a company that I loved so much. The type of work environment differs based on what sector of the company you are in. Loved working for KC, just didn't really love the work that I had in Neenah."

good,"Empresa agradável de trabalhar"
good,"Ótimo salário, ótimos benefícios, permitia uma boa mobilidade de se trabalhar e estudar, ótimos gestores, uma empresa que não tem muito a dizer além de dizer que era ótima de se trabalhar."
good,"Por conta do negócio,as mudanças nos produtos são frequentes, o que requer versatilidade e agilidade para atingir (informar / treinar)todos os níveis que têm envolvimento com os produtos. Aprendo sempre sobre as características dos produtos. A gerência apóia bastante a pró atividade, os colegas são prestativos. O dificíl é conseguir a participação de todos em eventos importantes, por conta da alta demanda de produção. A parte mais agradável é a receptividade e educação das pessoas."
good,"I enjoy my job, and i think its a great place to be employed. i would like to add more skill set to my Resume so i may be looked upon for advancement. KC's management team in Lagrange, Ga are some of the most down to earth , intelligent people i have a chance to work for."

good,"Working for KC was one of the best experiences of my life. I worked there for almost 19 years and would still be there had it not been for an off duty accident. I found that if an individual wanted to advance in company, all you had to do is work hard, take advantage of any opportunity to train in any area that will help you meet your goals, and always do your job with an attention to detail along with an emphasis on excellence. I see some of the complaints that some people convey using this format, but not until you go out and work for other companies, do you truly understand what a great company that you have worked for with Kimberly-Clark. I owe this organization a lot when it comes to my overall development as a productive member of our areas workforce. It all began with KC when I was 21 years old. I also made some life-long friendships while working there. I guess that I don't have to end this review with how I feel about KC, but here goes: I LOVED IT!!!!!"

I learned everything about driving the forklift from these swift, very well trained, full-time company forklift operators. I wasn't making much money, but the hours and environment was great. I had a chance to work up to 18 months there for the Temp Service. However, a full-time job was offered to me at another company, after my working there for the Temp service for 11 months.

O ruim se é que se pode colocar assim é quando aparece um problema que atrapalha sua meta de produção,  um problema no equipamento que não depende de você para solucionar, e tem que passar o turno com a máquina parada mas é relevante pois eram poucas vezes em que ocorria este fato, mas o melhor é a satisfação de dever cumprido com louvor e no final do mês o pagamento no dia certo e as premiações que tínhamos em forma de dinheiro."
