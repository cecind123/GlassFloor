rating,review
bad,they have favorites and if you are not one of they they don't go to bat for you ...I was never on final on anything but had a incident and they walked right out the door and that is after having a promotion with the company
bad,"Contractors are treated as second-class citizens. On boarding is a joke. Management and full time employees are entitled. People spend most of their time on social media, engaging in loud side bar conversations and shopping online. A terrible experience"
bad,"These people do not care about you, or anyone else. They care about appearing not biased, but not about actually being fair. They will not protect you from biased people. They promote losers instead of smart people to pander to losers, which are more numerous at the company, so they let losers abuse you to protect loser morale. They will not protect you if you're too smart for your manager to have self-esteem anymore or if you don't flirt with your managers. Do not trust them with anything. This is the only warning you will get. If you're a loser who hates excellence or virtue, you'll fit right in."
bad,They only promote White people and middle Eastern people. The environment is negative and they have departments competing with other departments so people are slimy and stressed. Their metrics are insanely unrealistic and you get blamed if a customer fails to make a payment. They took overtime away and gave us more duties without the pay. WORST COMPANY EVER.
bad,"Good benefits, managers stick together to get associates fired. I highly dont recommend working here. Manager was racist. Be careful working here. They will keep you from receiving unemployment benefits."
bad,"Need more opportunities for advancement in the future, and more policies in place, to support work life balance. "
bad,Management hates their roles and jobs you can tell by just talking to them. Most of the higher title management is all white males /females look down to diversity. Even though I had the highest credentials education and experience wise but they still think and act if they are superior species. Hated it not recommending any one. NO one last their more then a year max do your own research by auditing this company.
bad,The culture was not fitting nor was the Management helpful. There are no processes and procedures in place for associates. The training was not educational.
bad,"You would think in a call center where providing excellent telephone etiquette was a priority, being pleasant and mannerly would be a plus.  Not so at this nuthouse!.  The only people that seemed to advance were the employees that sang and danced at the town halls. The mostly female managers were the stereotypical back-biters where everything was personal.  When only 50% percent of your annual review was actually based on your metrics (objective) and 50% was your supervisor's opinion (subjective), you need to understand how this back biting culture was exceedingly difficult to thrive in. They didn't fire the bad girls, they just moved them to other departments so they could torture others.  I didn't leave because I wanted to get a new job, but to get away from the teen mean queen atmosphere.  Do not Capital One, just run!."
bad,It was nice to wok there. I would say the best place. I am looking to work in  companies like that. So I would recommend to anyone for working in  Capital One.
bad,"If recruiters from Capital One reach out to you: don't do it! Only do so if you actually apply."
bad,"I've never worked for Capital One, but would love to from Atlanta, Ga. I think Indeed should make sure you're posting jobs for the correct cities where the jobs are located. I was all excited to apply only to see that you have to live no more than 100 miles from the nearest Capital One hub in VA or FL."
bad,the worst place to work if your looking for a chance to grow. management look out for management employees are not a treated fairly based on race!! Yes I said race there is a systematic issues for those who are not liked or show that know more than management when it comes to the day to day work management having affairs with agents! Yes I said it again. all they have that is in place to make employees feel comfortable is really to push you out on infractions they say are legal compliance such as not say Mr. or Mrs. above all gossip is a huge matter there that includes managers engaging with agents etc. as far as when agents bring up concerns be it personal or work related matters don't get looked into frontline managers are lazy vindictive abuse their position cater to whom they like fire those they don't typical call center my only suggestion is not getting comfortable there if you find yourself in the same roll and you have applied for a different roll there and don't get then its time you seek a job else where cause you will be stuck in the same job until they write you up for infractions as a way to dismiss you
bad,Capital One was a good company in the beginning. They offer PTO and 401k matching at 100%. They offer paid maternity leave but they will fill your position therefore leaving you without a job to return to.
bad,To much favoritism.  Management found a way to take your monthly bonuses.  Never could take additional bathroom breaks without a doctors note for medical reasons. The last goes on.  To long
bad,If you are able to be one of the “chosen” you will do well. If you enjoy being “micro- managed” you will do well. The people are a great team. Need better management.
bad,"No regard for employees other than those who look a certain way and are well connected to management"
bad,Capital One has gotten rid of any opportunity for growth or advancement in their company. They are quickly downsizing and have made their employees feel at risk of losing jobs at any time.
bad,"monsters, a figment of are imagination or apart of are immediate reality. well considering every one of us creature looking humans are more or less savage monsters who are capable of some of the worst atrocities imaginable im thinking we are definitely monsters of the worst kind. we act as though we are altruistic when realistically there is something we are trying to gain."
bad,Not a good work environment.  Was very unhappy with management and how the overall bank was run.  Did not reward hard work and achievement.  Very inconsistent management.
bad,fake. did not like the people.did not have best interest.was not good enviroment. compulsive liars. Food was good. Computers were fast. Temperature was good.did not like.
bad,"employees dont matter only the bottom line matters."
bad,Not a fun place to work. Rules are constantly changing and someone is always looking to get you in trouble for saying the wrong thing. Management makes things stressful and they score you on every call on a difficult scale. Raises and bonuses are hard to come by and benefits are not what I would consider even good.
bad,"The brand pretends to be ethical about doing the right thing for banking, the customers and the community but so many of the senior staff are without morals - It's a smoke and mirrors act.. Don't touch this place. Toxic atmosphere"
bad,"Avoid to work for Capital One as much as you can; it is just as horrible as AT&T.  The treatment of the employees is horrible, no appreciation for the employee's worth and the compensation is not up to par."
bad,The recurtiment team is very unprofessional. Ive all the experience and knowledge to become banker but they keep on denying me again and again because one if the recruiter was raicest and probably put some negative notes on my account so everytime I apply for any job I get the email back saying we have other candidates we going with yet the job is still available to apply for.  This is insane and unacceptable...
bad,"You feel like a robot with unrealistic goals. Management is horrific... and forget about job security. It was a very sad place to work, your selfworth goes out the window"
bad,"The branch manager was TOO insecure to work under! He likes to have a bunch of sheep around him, no one with a voice or a brain. When I understood that, I started to look for other opportunities. & when he found out I was going for another role within the company he fired me, right before the Thanksgiving holiday! During my time working there, I was STRESSED out! He made us work through lunch because we were always short staffed! Isn’t that illegal?? The team was horrible & very gossipy, like high school! & everyone wanted to act like a manager - until an angry customer asked to speak to one, then everyone disappeared. As a lead teller I was cursed out & called all types of names from customers AND my own team. The manager didn’t care how much we all hated each other, as long as the branch looked good & we all acted fake when the district manager or other visitors came. I really liked the company & benefits, that’s why I was looking to move to another position. But I’m extremely happy now that I am as far away from that branch as I possibly can be!"
bad,"Was very poor, everyone at the branch and back office are related. Very unorganized, no leadership, no respect for coworkers, very high volume and traffic and is going digital"
bad,"Temp employees were treated like dogs.  They allowed a permanent employee to yell at a temp and the Temp employee lost the contract.  They didn't allow the temps to participate in any of the bonus, pot lucks, outing and such.  Took over 2 years for a representative to transition from Temporary to permanent."
bad,Management only will invest on those who they like. It's a very stressful work environment . I will not recommend this place to work unless you you want to risk your career.
bad,"District managers don't know what they are doing, and lack of managerial skill. Life and work cannot be balance, working under stress all the time, working 10 hours a day is normal as a Branch Manager."
bad,"Capital One is a great place to work if you are just starting in your career. If you are mid or senior level, you will find this place boring. There is no challenge. They don't encourage individuality or even trying anything new. You get silo'd into the role you come in at. The work is just OK and I'm actually bored working here. "
bad,"They don't treat you like you are a human being and don't show their love at all, no proper training and do not recognize your talent at all. I will not work their again"
bad,Capital One has lots of meeting but they were for show as decisions are made higher up that the SR manager or Director level.   They state they practice ITIL but in actuality they allow the developers access to all systems and do not segregate duties
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of meetings starting at 8:30am - 5pm, every hour, followed by condescending emails, and conflicting work instructions. "
bad,There is nothing I want to say.  I didn't enjoy my time there. Management was not helpful and the place did not work as a team. Everyone was out for themselves
bad,"I was forced to quit because they could not work with my school schedule at the time. I had originally put in my application that I had night school and when they hired me they said that was ok. 2 months later when the manager was replaced, it became an issue."
bad,Used to be a good place to work but as of late I have found management to be no longer interested in feedback for improvement especially if it shines a light on an oppertunity for improvement.  Will ask for feedback but not willing to listen to it if it sounds too critical.
bad,"if you like your career, dont work here. Management only care about numbers and even if you do well you dont get any kudos or rewards for working here"
bad,Company did not care about employees.  Over hired and then conducted layoffs regularly.  Management would ramp up a department with experienced people and then once it got going layoff well paid experienced staff and replace with lesser paid junior people.
bad,I did not have access to anything. It was a temp job. I only had access to one system. The work environment was a fun and warming place. They weren't hiring anyone permanent so I didn't get that chance.
bad,"The environment is not clean, they do not coach accordingly. There is small chance on advancing if you have the right manager over you. Systems are always on the fritz. Pay is not at livable wage."
bad,Bad mid to low level managers make it terrible organisation.company. Number of their managers are bigoted and unhelpful. make the company look bad. Awful experience
bad,"Not a good employer and on below parameters. "
bad,The working conditions are very stressful.  Not enough room to sit comfortably.   It is hard to concentrate constant noise. You can never escape the constant noise.  There is no privacy to have a casual conversation with a co work.
bad,"Working here was the worst 6 months of my life. Poor management, workload didn't equal the pay. stay away. Universal Banker role was super stressful. ."
bad,This job is for kids or fast food employees.. not professionals.. they watch and monitor everything you do.  . Big brother is watching and you feel like a child with babysitters
bad,They will tell you how great the benefits are but you can't afford them. When your pay is barely enough to make rent. good luck putting any money in your 401k. Just another corporation paying the least and expecting the most. Those company ratings don't actually talk to the employees. They look at everything the company offers and say it's great.
bad,Backstabbers.Not nice people and poor training.I would not recommend to anyone to temp there. You are treated like a second class citizen. I would never return.
bad,"Capital One has no human aspect what-so-ever. There is no work life balance. There is never availability to take a day off,no matter how far ahead you request it. Managers lie straight to your face saying they will help you, but when it comes down to helping you they tell you that you're on your own. Required learning and assessments is to be done in-between calls, which would be ok if there was time in-between calls, but there never is. At most you might get 5 seconds in-between calls. The training is a joke, no one knows what they are doing. Customers call back multiple times and get different answers depending on which agents they speak to. Capital One has gone down hill fast."
bad,no comment necessary at this time. Capital one has a stressful work environment. I would not work for them again. My manager was ok but it's not my dream job.
bad,I really don’t have any comment about this computer. I only worked for them temporarily. They were decent to me. But then the need for an assistant was gone and the job was over.
bad,"Too much politics going around. They wont have time to focus on your career advancement and contribution. If you don't play dirty, you will never climb up the ladder."
bad,I worked on a project for 4 months.  Manager said I wasn't learning fast enough.  He fired me and then black balled my profile so that I can never work there.
bad,"Bad corporate culture, poor management, and lack of fun factor all around. I could not leave this company fast enough. High pressure sales and ridiculous expectations."
bad,"I learned a lot during my time at iQor working for Capital One, however, the management made it more than undesirable to work there. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet numerous people while training them to do the job.  I really enjoyed this job the first few years I worked there, but  the  enjoyment started to deteriorate after getting new management and everything they decided to put into place.  The morale  of the employees decreased and no one was happy anymore."
bad,it was a lousy place to be as a contractor -- management is bad and your always the reason for anything that goes wrong because you will be the fall person
bad,Horrible management and poor training methods. You basically are figuring everything out as you go. It was frustrating and it felt like you were in a high school.
bad,"It's an okay job but don't think that you will advance here. Advancement is not based on hard work but is highly based on favoritism and office politics. 90% of management here does not care about employees, they care about numbers and stats. They want you to treat the customers with kindness and humanity but cannot take their own advice. The benefits are okay and there are some nice perks but not enough to justify staying here for too long or making a career out of this company."
bad,"If you do not agree with management, you're looked down upon. They claim to be flexible with school schedules, but they aren't."
bad,Horrible management in New Orleans AML office. Upper management mostly gay racists.(oxymorons) Sad operation. DO NOT WORK HERE! I was told not to go to work for Capital One by 4 previous colleagues but I went there any ways. BAD MISTAKE!
bad,"Good pay, long hours and high level of stress. The worse process for going through the raise process each November.  it is fine if you like to play the Hunger - Games where each Associate competes about their accomplishments (many are made up) to compete for better pay increase."
bad,"The company only wants AA as administrative assistants, not engineers a supervisor told me this to my face. Racist jokes about Blacks and Latinos not uncommon."
bad,branch hours are ridiculous.   What bank stays open till 6pm daily anymore?  Senior leadership is clueless.  The CEO is a credit card guy - no idea how to run a bank
bad,No room for advancement. I felt that the salary I was making did not match up with my level of education. I did not learn a lot from the position because the requirements were easy to do while on the job.
bad,"Job responsibilities: "
bad,I would not recommend this company for anyone. Bad treatment for the employees and taking advantage of the customers. For one thing they charge a tremendous amount of interest to the customers and they use very old technology so customers are always frustrated.
bad,"PPI managers are bullies as they are not confident to talk to new starters, they had to send a middle man to pass the smallest message. No people skills as they are big headed managers. Its the worst places I have worked in my entire life. Most stressful place."
bad,Capital one hires temps with the hope of working for the company a year later still not hired on to the company.  The environment is constantly changing which one will expect but the risk alerts and the write ups start immediately.  Each manger expected different things the stats was not consistent.
bad,"Worst place to work with the worst Regional Manager ever "
bad,This company is very backwards and does not know how to operate a bank. They still function as a credit card company and the banking area is sub standard. The culture was the worst I have encountered at the bank. Very unprofessional environment
bad,No respect for employees managers show favoritism and overall worst job I've ever had period lack of organization structure and allowing growth was very hard
bad,this job is no longer available as the company failed and closed down. Due to miss management and high price of products and little demand in the area
bad,"Too much politics, management is very unprofessional. Job is monotonous. If you have a family, they don't care and will give you ridiculously late shifts."
bad,Hard place to get real answers to serious issues.   The truth didn't matter.   User support and contractor seating was terrible.   It was a people mill.
bad,Compensation tend to be base on favor of an individual personally. Instead of being base on experience and production of an individual. Any concerns regarding a manager would never truly be address by district leaders either. Workplace culture depended upon managers in each branch.
bad,"if you enjoy consistently working with a skeleton crew,"
bad,"Your life has to be scheduled around work because the schedule changes constantly. The lead tellers have napoleon complexes and will try to screw you over when you least expect it. If you're part time, you won't ever have a chance to be full time as a teller, they don' t hire full time tellers anymore. Most of the branches are being converted to service centers soon, so a lot of people will lose their jobs. Don't waste your time."
bad,Management is the worst. They show favoritism. There bullying in the work place.. management will through under the bus. If your not a favorite by your manager they will set you up to fail.
bad,The company is ok to work for. The hours are not able to be changed once you get hired.The atmosphere depends on the job that you get hired for. they are a temp agency.
bad,Project never got off the ground before they laid off all 5 contractors.  I would not recommend Capital One to any of my colleges.
bad,"It was a good job, but offered little life balance. Managment needs a reality check on sales goals I am glad to have met hard working people there though"
bad,They show favoritism to some employees and treat other employees like trash. The mangers micro manage and it's so easy to get fired. They change policies often to thrown you off in my opinion. Some mangers treat you bad.
bad,Good work culture. Good perqs. and benefits. Management is very understanding. Work life balance is great. Job/Security and advancement is questionable. Compensation and benefits are good.
bad,management only cares about the customers and not the people servicing them. the management team only looks out for those individuals who excel in most cases and does minimal work in training up other agents not as proficient.
bad,"Company gives very misleading information regarding pay and bonuses prior to starting position.  Company preaches diversity but that is all a misconception, discrimination was evident and nothing was done even after reporting to human resources."
bad,i believe when working for a company you should be comfortable in yourself. a job shouldnt take away from the person you are. some of the people are great but the managers go overboard.
bad,bank would get very busy. management was unfair. coworkers were ok. most enjoyable was dealing with customers. Hardest was dealing with management
bad,"This was by far one of the worst companies I've ever worked for. Great employees, but horrible management. You can't play favoritism in the workplace. Promotions and recognition should only be based upon performance, and outstanding work. Capital one was definitely not the company i thought it to be."
bad,"Before Capitol one bought out the small community bank that I was working at, it was a great place to work. Capitol one was more concerned about making money than the customer."
bad,"They do not want to work with your college school schedule. They will literally get upset if you tell them you're in college. It's like they want to keep you from going to school."
bad,It was the same call center day in and day out. A person would get uses to the same which is good for some. But it was few and far between to experience change and grow without falling into the same millhouse type of work. Once your locked in it is difficult to find grow opportunities.
bad,I was promised to be fulltime and kept getting excuses as to why I was still part time. Without warning I was laid off for no reason.
bad,"You name it, the job, the compensation, management, culture. One of the worst places I ever worked. I did not like collection and do not wish to go back into it with any other firm."
bad,"making outbound collection calls to delinquent customer and asking for"
bad,I was hired on contract to cover shifts for the senior guys over the holidays and let go once they were over. I received no official feedback from either Capital One or Apex Systems who held the contract.
bad,unexcpirianced management rude co workers and bodses nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
bad,"Worst place in the world to work!  Capital One in the Richmond, VA offices promote discrimination, hostile work environments, fraud and abuse of policies as well as illegal means of obtaining information to obtain evidence for fraud cases.  Capital One discriminates against individuals with disabilities as well as transgender/gay/lesbian individuals.  Management is very young, unprofessional, and ignorant to be frank.  It's like they took kids from Best Buy and said - HEY, want to be a manager?  Horrible environment to work in as it's a 'gotcha' type attitude and cubes are designed so the managers of each section can over see each individuals monitor, phones and desk area.  State EEOC supports Capital One because they are a large employer, thus, they will not support any legal claims against them."
bad,back to back auto dialed calls. The calls are nothing compared with the insults that you get from those that are determined not to pay their bills.
bad,"Given stories to make the job seem better than it is, commission based only and poor prices at that. 12 hour days. shocking job."
bad,"The managers are very rude & snobbish. They don't pay you your worth. I dropped down from previously making $15/hr to only $13.25 as a 14 year CSR.  I walked out on them. The managers lie on you, plot against you & act like they're better you. They're pretty much the same in general if you're a customer as well."
bad,Typical work day is busy with work and many meetings. I did learn Clarity. Management all depends on who you work for. Co-works are friendly and helpful. The hardest part is all the meetings. Most enjoyable is the culture
bad,"It was a good experience, changing a lot into a direction not desired bymost"
bad,This was a good first job.  Management was terrible.  There was not enough direction at my center.
bad,Management did not have previous work experience and had no knowledge of the industry. Employees were not treated well by management.
bad,"•	Manage accounts that have over $50,000 lines of credit"
bad,Working for this company was ok.  Everybody's experience is different. I worked there 7+ years. Benefits are GREAT. They have some really appreciative customers also. By the way tellers are the HEART of any banking business.
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was the people. There was no support by the Managers.
bad,"I worked for this company for 11 months then quit.  The manager that I had played favorites and worried more about what people said than what people did!  More focus was placed on ""being the mayor"" than actually getting done work correctly.  The culture is made up of snobby, collegic children that have no respect for ""seasoned professionals"" and look down upon those people who do not have a ivy league college degree but possess years of actual, real work experience.  Capital One likes to hire college children so they can ""mold"" them to their way of doing things.  The company does not appreciate or welcome ""seasoned"" professionals or their guidance and advice.  The managers don't know how to manage. The people in this company also ABUSE the 360 degree review process.  If someone doesn't like you, they will send your manager unsolicted feedback and basically throw you under the bus.  They say that this is the great place to work but in reality it is not.  The culture is not welcoming to new hires and only associates with those in their cultural click.  Most of the Administrative Assistants have poor skill sets and are not up to date on the latest software needed to do their jobs efficiently.  This means that you will get stuck doing all of their work with no credit.  In addition, the bonus and raise pay scale is horrible.  It is based upon a rating system of how you are rated against other people.  So, what that means is if your boss has a favorite, you can forget about getting the bonus and raise you deserve.  Forget this place.   Move on....it be the best decision you'll ever"
bad,"Great company to work for,awesome benefits.A company that really cares about their Employes."
bad,Not very organized company with management lacking structure
bad,"Nice place , very cleaned place to work at. I've learned a lot about the company, and if I plan to stay."
bad,"typical day at work consist of updating profiles, ordering checks and cards for the customers. also just going over account balances due to some of the customers spending habits. there was never a dull call i received."
bad,Terrible management at this location. No breaks and a lot of threats from management. Thats why they always have positions for bankers open. They cant keep anyone.
bad,"work for a small time, capital one bank had took over north fork bank and pretty much did a clean a hired new employees."
bad,"Good benefits, enjoyed working with my teammates. Learned alot"
bad,Working with this company was a horrible experience. The staff was not friendly or willing to help anyone get ahead in the company. Staff was a complete distraction while employees were on the phone with customers.
bad,"I worked for Capital One Bank for six years. I was recognized by my management team, my co-workers, my peers, and my customers as a leader among my peers who was highly organized and excelled at customer relationships. I had a loyal customer following, and was known as a tough but fair and fun boss by my tellers. "
bad,"I worked here for a year. It started off very well...The company is very relaxed unless you have an a** hole manager like I did. The incentives are a rip off. No matter how much money you collect your incentive still wont be much. Its based off a hourly goal, instead of dollars collected. When trying to better yourself and move to a different department, you will have a problem doing this. Your manager will give you all the excuses in the world on why you cant leave. Even if your the best you still cant leave. Management will fire you when trying to go to another department. Beware of this place and hope to god you don't get the manager I had. She was very personal and talked to people like they were children. I guess she has issues at home that she needs to work out, but that's no one else's problem but hers. Management sucks and tell so many lies, but karma comes around and they will get theirs. Just dont waste your time. You see there always hiring that should tell you this place sucks. To be honest the best feeling is being free from this place and not dealing with the manager that I had. My stress level is down 75%since leaving. I dont miss this place at all!! "
bad,Dont work for this place you better off with no job than to work in this place u can find a better job keep looking
bad,"From day one I was friendly, on time and no absences. Came in to work happy that I had finally found a job, said good morning to all but no one responded back! I tried to make friends with co-workers but all they did was talk about me and turn their noses up even the management did this also! "
bad,Same as the other review hated it not enough pay no benefits.
bad,Contractors were treated like Second Class Citizens. They let people go with no warning and no reason.
bad,Provide courteous and professional teller service to customers.
bad,"Capitalone took over HSBC(cards). They didn't care for the employees that were rolled over. I've worked for them for 6yrs. Was not warned,coach or anything. Capitalo e says they ""do the right thing"". But they don't! My numbers were great working at there. All center. Better then people that have been there 10+ yrs. But they only care about bring in new reps getting paid less $. Worst company to work for."
bad,"we do not play, we do not have fun, our managers refuse to talk to customers, we have no answers but FAQ which we read from, the above reviews are false, we have no contact for capitalone other than call centers, we are all there is, customers are so angry, i did not do it, we put customers on hold forever, we are told to, we are told to not connect to managers, we are not allowed,"
bad,"Management is horrible. I worked in the call center and was expected to write down every time I needed to use the bathroom to ""track"" time off the phone. Position was very Micro Managed and office politics were awful. Favoritism was in full effect and if you weren't on managements good side, you didn't have a chance."
bad,"The best part of this job were my co-workers and my customers. Unfortunately this job was not flexible with ""life"". If you needed a day off for a emergency or a doctors appointment, they would not let you do this or it would result in trouble. Not a fun,good,enjoyable place to work AT ALL."
bad,Managers want you to sell agressive.. even if the customer does not want a service or product you must try and get them to get it anyway
bad,Managers are forced to make you sell things to customers that they don't want just to get the sale
bad,A typical day at work was answering incoming calls from credit card holders. I learned how to deal with very irrate card holders. The hardest part of the job was having to say no and not being able to provide the customer with what they were requesting because of company decisions. I like all of my co workers. The most enjoyable part of my day was when I could fulfill and exceede the customers request.
bad,I do NOT recommend this employer. Stay as far away as you possibly can.
bad,"Capital one is a horrible place to work. Why? So they hire young lot which is always insecure and do not have can do attitude. Hiring process is test based which includes math skills, probability etc. Interviewers are 22 year old kids with no manners and sense of diversity. No one knows what they are doing!"
bad,"I worked as collection, repo, tag/total loss, and new loans at the Tulsa, OK branch. Since I worked at the call center that required as many people there all the time. If you/family member have a medical emergency you will most likely get in trouble for missing work. You get 4 weeks for vacation but you have to bid for days off. It is very hard to get popular off time because everyone is bidding for the same days. At the Tulsa branch there really is no opportunity for advancement. Most people who advanced within the company had to move out of state for the position. There is favoritism, luckily I was one of the favored. All the positions I worked were all high stressed positions and it made it even worse when managers had conflicting policies and procedures. Managers would micro manage the teams as well. There are a lot of clicks there. It felt very much like working at a very dysfunctional high school. One of the problems I saw in the collection and repo departments was sometimes other people stole your payments for collection/repo which affected your bonus. After working there for 4 years the pay got better but I was so miserable and depressed. I didn't realize how bad it was until I started working for a different job. I know ever job is going to have it's downside but it should not make you want to start therapy. The customer was able to say almost anything to you or treat you any type of way. There were times I had to sit on the phone and let customers talk to me like a crazy person for doing my job. And that wasn't just for collection and repo. It was the same way in the"
bad,"Training was horrible "
bad,Not the best company to work for in my opinion. No flexibility with their employees and they do not provide a good  work and life balance for their employees.
bad,"Lies started before I was hired which I didn't realize until almost done with 5 weeks of training, management doesn't really care about you and write ups are handed out like candy. Employees are expected to be robots not people."
bad,Go somewhere else. Bad management and no plan. People are confused with no plan. These people lie about there hiring salary give you something else. There looking to save money for higher up bonuses.
bad,supervisors of the teams are more bully's than they are helpers. it's not about getting ahead it's about falling back and staying in your place. Seniority is everything there.
bad,"I work in a team called mars and almost everyday hate getting into work because of my manager. You can find that things break down faster here and that my manager has no clue of what is to be done for our growth and professional development. We have to accept condescending behaviour. "
bad,"Prefer to bring in young college students who are unhappy soon after as the company sells the company as a ""Google"" environment. Managers are forced to place employees in buckets to meet distribution, even if they do not agree with the rating."
bad,"Constant mgmt  changes and change in philosophy  , instability.  Hr does not care for itself.  Performance system a broken mess that leadership simply digs in and refuses to change.  The push back is their way or highway... hence the revolving door.  Suck it up philosophy, if you want to survive.... oh snd dont age... they thin the heard after five years and in your forties"
bad,"Cross-cal during mid and end year reviews force people to backstab, lie and brownnose. Many smart, hardworking, and honest people are pushed out of the organization because they refuse to do so."
bad,"Want a promotion? Party with the boss! Not about business. Upper management at Capital One only cares about how much fun you are, not what you are capable of. Senior management has actually been heard to say that it doesn't matter if you are more capable of doing the job than another applicant. It depends on who you are friends with. Since they are the ones making those decisions,that is pretty sad..."
bad,The company expects alot but compensation and work life balance was not balanced. Vacation time pro rated was the only plus.  I honestly do not feel comforable speaking about a company who is unfair to their employees.
bad,"Management does not know what they want. Everybody that works there is young and most are right out of college. Casual work environment. The campus is really large and if you work there, take your walking shoes. Supervisor in department looks like she belongs in a trailer park."
bad,"Predatory employment culture, IT department in Texas looks like its located in India / Pakistan, does not reflect available talent in its community, backlog of work is not planned, and corporate road map is high level only resulting in uneven workload and stress on workers and managers who actual do the productive work."
bad,"If you aren't ""in"" you are out- very gossipy, management has each others backs so you have no one to go to if your manager is verbally assaulting you like mine was. HR never directly responded either to a formal complaint- left due to hostile work environment and was denied unemployment because they sure did get their law team on that part!"
bad,My manager didn't know anything. Poor management at its best. They continuously added more work for us to do and did not want to pay us. Team members knew more than management.
bad,"Having to work for very long hours and weekends. No recognition for the efforts. "
bad,Certain branches are good to work at however other branches are a nightmare to work at. If you get a branch that is poorly managed then you're out of luck since my manager wouldn't let me transfer to a closer branch and denied multiple requests
bad,I worked an average of 50 to 60 hours per week due to the workload that was assigned.  Work Life Balance has always been an area that scored poorly on the annual Associates Survey.  Each year it was a planned area of focus for improvement and nothing ever changed.
bad,"Was previously HSBC and was promised a job for at least one year, all HSBC employees were let go within six months.  Job was minimized to handled all calendar and travel arrangements"
bad,Capital One is a fantastic company to work for. Depending on which department you are working in is another story. The particular department I work for is the most Unprofessional group I have ever belonged to. The managers lack managerial skills. People are cursing left and right. People are picking up slack for others which is completely unfair. We work fourteen hours a day and higher management does not have any solution to help.
bad,"I had a manager there named Tony who would say "" go ahead and call hr it happens all the time- they wont get rid of me. The culture was ok, the management was just horrible"
bad,This position was stressful and the environment was cutthroat. I did meet a lot of great people there though and enjoyed the opportunity to make bonuses.
bad,"Bad stay away"
bad,"If you give any push back, don't agree with something or ask questions when prior info given was incorrect all bets are off.  You'll be perceived as unprofessional and combative which is unfair."
bad,"Very difficult place to work. You are treated very poorly by management here. Most of the managers have never worked on a phone in their lives, and most are white. When this company does promote from within they like to promote young, white collage age kids who will work for nothing."
bad,i was hired after 7 interviews assessment test and after four months wait they offered me the job as a business banker. My impression mostly is right about people especially if they have a fake imagine and it was the same for my manager. I took the job because only heard great things about the company. I have 20 years of experience and an MBA and am people's person with humanity approach towards helping people. Very soon I learned was that from my manager to every one above him were the good old boys club. They had to hire me because they (capital One) wanted to be in good books by showing diversity. My manager would not return my calls nor was he interested in seeing me successful. My first loan was for $900K and was closed under a different banker later on had a big treasury referral that was also closed under some one else. Plus he too my conference calls and management loved spending expense on partying which made no sense drank on. Company expense and had no leadership no direction no very unprofessional approach with clients their internal staff. I was set to fail and had realized after some time when my boss and his buddy underwriter framed me well to leave where these two could bring in their friends from Chase bank. Fake people and Ll are very artificial and scared daily since they want their jobs. Very unstable job atmosphere do not let ads fool you.
bad,"Management doesn't care about you. All they're interested in is you working from open to close like a robot. You are not allowed to leave the teller window, they call you off of your break to take customers, if you call out they want to know why, if you request a day off you don't get it, if you ask for a transfer they hold you back, if you go to the bathroom they follow you to make sure you only spend 2 mins (they posted sings in the bathroom about time limits), if you work more than 40 hours you are not compensated because they adjust your time, nothing you do is ever enough and when they had enough of you they find a reason to fire you. The most enjoyable part of the job was when management didn't show up!"
bad,The management at this particular branch degrade their employees on a daily basis. They frequently talk bad about their employees to other employees.. They threaten their employees on a daily basis.. The employees here are all intimidated and this is not the way to motivate your employees. There is no room for advancement if your currently at this branch.. They will not let you go.. The pay is horrible and the raises are almost non existent. I'm trying to get out as soon as I can.. The entire staff is miserable and the morale at the branch is obsolete.
bad,"I worked for 26 plus years for Capital One in many positions. I did what ever they needed me to do. Help them re-start up department when deaster destroyed home office in 2005.Five years after relocating for this position, the company decided to shut down new location and left 30 of the most loyal employees without any job opportunities.They decided it was better to outsource the functions of our department. They had to hire two outside firms to do a part of the process and moved a few of the job functions around the country. A month into this new plan they realized it was not cost effective and quility of the work was not as good.But it was too late and top management did not want to reverse their decision. We were laid off. Since there are no banking operations positions located in a 300 mile radius of this new location , I have not been able to find a job that my experence warrents. I am starting over in an entry level position in a new field at 2/3 the salary. I do not feel that Capital One did enough to help the loyal employees and they make bad management decisions with out thinking things through."
bad,"No advancement opportunities for true talent and hard workers. In order to get any where in Test and Learn you have to be willing to hang out with management and get drunk or sleep around. This department has shown favoritism over and over again with the same type/group of people. Hard work, dedication and going above and beyond does not pay off, goes unrecognized and under appreciated. Test and Learn is not the department that you want to work for at Capital One."
bad,"A typical day involved dealing with various levels of ""managers"" who had no sense of technology but were good at raising their voices and acting important."
bad,"Management was terrible. She had favoritism, promised career advancement to the ones she care for more. Showed her dislike to the employees she did not care for. She did not appreciate my work, she not let me speak my mind, she gossiped way too much. She has a lot of hard working employees on her team but the ones that she favor more, take advantage of that opportunity, so they are able to get away with things, While the others suffer the consequences. Capital One needs to look more into their management especially when their branch receives so many complaints from customers whom are not happy with the service."
bad,Capital one was a company that grew way too fast and didn’t understand banking  they were so concerned about being advanced that they didn’t care about the ones running branches or having to make the everyday decisions with customers.  They opened branches to close them down.  They paid for people to stay in Manhattan apartments when that money could of went towards real needs for the company
bad,Management is horrible and does not care about the well being of its employees. There is too much stress and it’s truly become a toxic culture. Hope it changes
bad,They make you believe this is the place until you get out an release that is not true. There are alot of places that offer the same and more. Capital one is racist they discriminate they get back at you when you speak up. They drive you to commit suicide if you are not strong. More than half of the staff is on anti depression medical.
bad,"They hire you, give you the ""how amazing it is to work here talking points"" and then soon after you realize it's anything but that. They encourage you to advance but despite job experience in other fields in the company, they won't even give you an interview. If you don't advance within the company,  they will either fire, lay you off, or make your life so miserable that you decide to quit."
bad,"culture focused solely on making money. associates are viewed as pawns in the process of creating greater wealth and profit. personal views are not welcomed. mistreatment by management is very comment. bullying of staff by all staff levels is tolerated, and even encouraged. the only performance metric that matters is adding to the bottom line."
bad,"Capital One consistently hires, promotes, and fires under a belief that outsiders are better than existing employees."
bad,The managers have too much power. They're operational controls are not as secure as other banks. Could be a good place of you have the right Manager I'm sure.  My experience was a bad one.
bad,I've been at Capital One for 4 years. I used to LOVE my job about 2 years ago. Now it is ridiculous I have never been with a company so unorganized that changes metrics not even knowing what the end goal of changing them is supposed to be and/or look like. The management definitely chooses favorites no matter what they say. The worst part of all is there is NO room for growth. They sold dreams of one day being off the phone when I started 4 years ago. If you start here expect to be on the phones for the rest of your time here. There are people who have been here for 7 plus years still stuck on the phones.
bad,"My experience was not a very good one. I had a horrible contracted manager who made everything difficult for me everyday I was there. This along with other reasons, made for a very uncomfortable work environment."
bad,"Supervisor swore at employees, rude and not helpful, training for position was not enough so most of us guessed. Filed a complaint for hostile work environment and asked to be removed from team but was not"
bad,"too much back stabbing, favoritism, prejudice. cant get ahead unless you know someone. not such thing as moving on or forward if you are not on the favorite list. worst place in the world"
bad,Run away. This is a meat grilling organization. With a culture of back stabbing and putting each other down . There is no work life balance. You live like a slave.
bad,"Company hasn't matured enough to truly experience several economical cycles. Performance and promotion is still pretty much done in a who likes who fashion. Many layers, very hard to get anything done. Do not value employees."
bad,This company has a cult-of-personality issue.  A fear-based and very low tolerance of anything outside of the standards set by the CEO is enforced very brutally.  Nearly no job security for contractors exist.  Would not recommend this company to anyone.
bad,"Advancement at the organization is really a popularity contest.  If your manager likes you, then great.  If your manager doesn't like you, then good luck."
bad,"Unfortunately. I miscarried a child and was approved for all of my time and was denied my pay. I did not receive a check from the end of August until the day I resigned which was .12/3/. The excuse I was giving , the therapist did not state whether not I would be able to concentrate. I was baffled, who would be able to concentrate for one having a miscarriage and for two I still had dead particles and need an emergency surgery. Management did not do anything to help me. I was in the process of losing my home being a single parent. This was a very distasteful experience."
bad,"This company is racist toward African Americans and several complaints have been filled through HR for discrimination. The Tampa office is filled with African Americans, yet there's no African Americans working within management. If you prefer looking the other way when these things are happening then its the perfect place for you! I can't take it any more, I'm leaving."
bad,"This company will hire temps through agencies, with the intention of never hiring them as a permanent. They will make the job seem great, and that it is a great place to work, But really, they just dont want to pay for the required benefits of having a permanent employer."
bad,"Management was very harassing.  Taking calls was a typical day,  Managers made it unpleasant to work here.  Although I did like speaking with customers and trouble shooting with them."
bad,"After reading some of these other reviews I feel like I worked at a completely different company. In my entire career I was never so poorly treated in all aspect of the work place. They tried to protect a chronic harasser who also felt it was appropriate to make racist jokes, this man was hand picked by the director and eventually the complaints became to much and they had to let him go. I should have known then the charector of this company. They will promise you opportunity and  flexiability, but there is none of that your job is to make sure the higher ups hit their bonus while you make pennies trying to scrap by with zero coaching from your managers and zero support from a back office that couldn't care less about the customer or the job. The pay is decent, benefits average for the investing industry, but I have never been in such a toxic atmosphere. This place is truly the worst place I have ever worked and I hope enough people read this so they never have to experience what I did."
bad,It’s all who you know they don’t care about how hard you work they will lay you off after many years of working with them . When I was there the girls go with the managers and get promoted to a manager. They have no values or morals. You can work hard and I promise you they will get rid of you after so many years. This is what they do unless you are part of the click. I loved my job but the managers either like you or don’t. They don’t care about there associates they even pick people to get rid of and they do. Don’t depend on this company for your future. It’s not what you know but who you know. I had 15 years there and was good at many positions a top performer but it didn’t matter. Called over the phone and was laid off. When I was there one day they took a team in a room no warning and told them they were laid off.
bad,"If you do not ""fit in"" you are let go no matter how good you are.  HR and Employee Relations are all for the executives. They shouldn't call them Employee Relations because they do nothing for the employee."
bad,You could always tell when a survey was coming. They always went out of their way to be super nice with hopes of getting great survey scores. The benefits are great.
bad,"Worked for capital one for many years and moved up though the ranks. they like to say change banking for good, but they prefer if you just make them more money while they provide none"
bad,"Management is terrible and does "
bad,"Before accepting a management position with this bank, I was warned by industry colleagues about this banks culture and lack of advancement and nepotism.  Well, I took the chance and found that it was true.  Upper management will only promote their friends or hire them with no experience to the role.  Most advancements are for upper leaderships close confidants. Senior Managers are clueless with the department they manage and out of touch of the daily grind.  The company offers great benefits and PTO's and the company sponsored events are great.  Overall, if you are over 40 yrs. old, you will feel unease since they will change the department and create confusion to all associates and will be laid off.  "
bad,There is no help from management when your short handed and it gets busy. I learned to keep it to myself not give my input. Management only help themselves to succeed and do not appreciate their employees. My co-workers were awesome and we normally had to motivate ourselves because management wouldn't. The hardest part of the job was that we were always short handed and no help from management. My co-workers were the most enjoyable part of the job. District Manager has favoritism of her managers. DM never once would visit the branch unless someone was getting written up or  terminated. This was the DM from Galveston district.
bad,"Starting out things seemed normal. Then later on things started to change. My typical day at work was being a teller which included cash handling, customer service, and running transactions. Later on they started forcing sales from the tellers which is fine if it is a legitimate product in which they need. Regular customers were asked to buy these products every time they came in with us knowing fully that they did not want the product however if not offered we were reprimanded. Over time these customers became less and less to the point where the bank hardly had any business. The hardest part of the job was dealing with this policy and the management which did not care about the customers and only the numbers. I learned that no matter what I should stick to a high sense of moral. The hardest part was having to report suspicious behavior and the witnessing of stealing. Although uncomfortable, it had to be done."
bad,"as a teller working there it was very busy lines never went down until after 6. management did not know how to talk with employees, they were very mean and rude. there was no enjoyable part working at this bank. we got as much sales as we could but it wasn't teller main responsibility. hardest part of the day was eating lunch while standing up. and leaving work late because of management"
bad,"Very accountable, fast paced sales environment.  SALES have to be closed with product. "
bad,Company is great but the security console was filled with tension and provided the less than sufficient amount of job training.
bad,horrible culture favortism and revolving door employees...quick to fire even the most productive employees.
bad,you will have over 30+ jobs to fill and multiple managers to report to.
bad,"Most peers were great folks to work with! "
bad,Capital One Mortgage was a complete let down. They did not provide help with moving forward or providing a comfortable work environment.
bad,"Management didn't know how to run the bank. It was a great learning experience. It didn't pay well. I learned sales of consumer products, customer service, and bank needs. Loved my co-workers and was a team player. Went from Part time to Full time within a year and became an assistant to the head teller in six months. I loved learning new things and picked up the information pretty fast."
bad,run far far away and never look back. management all over is horrible and they do not promote from within. it's better to leave the company for about 6 months and then return to actually advance to a higher position.
bad,"I started my employment with Capital One back in December of 2012. I loved the people that were there and the training was fun. Towards the end of training I had some serious family issues arise and Capital One was more than helpful in what was going on. It was one less thing I had to worry about. Because I was out for about a month I was told to quit, let the lead of the training department know when I turned my application back in and that I would just go through training again when everything in my family was figured out and I was able to return back to work again with no serious interruptions. I was in shock at how a company could be so amazing to their employees. I did everything I was told and received a call the next day from the HR department. They informed me everything looked great and that I just needed to come in for a basic interview to go through everything. I went in and was greeted by a manager that I had never met, nor talked to the entire time I had been at Capital One. He also had no idea that I had worked at Capital One and wasn't told anything about my previous problems. I then had to explain to him my emotional couple of months, and he then told me that he didn't see why I wouldn't be hired again and I was on my way. The next day I received a voicemail on my phone. I'm going to repeat this last part again...a voicemail. It was from one of the HR ladies informing me that they were pursuing other applicants and that they wished me luck in my job search. I was not only disgusted that I was told over a voicemail that I wasn't getting my job back, but that the"
bad,"Antiquated systems with an unsupportive and unprofessional managerial staff. For the most part, hardworking, friendly co-workers who made the job as pleasant as possible. Very hard to communicate efficiently with supervisors and maintain order."
bad,"The work environment was very chaotic with a large number of employees being outsourced contractors (a large percentage from overseas), often hired after a 15 minute phone interview. People took a very casual approach to the work and the culture was very raucous, with disdain for rigor or process in implementing projects. There was a great deal of political in-fighting between different factions of contracting companies and ethnic backgrounds, and these rivalries got in the way of work being done efficiently."
bad,Poor management and favoritism of the department was regular. Answer incoming calls for deceased notifications. If you did not learn to kiss butt or suck up you would not advance.
bad,"Of about 15 people that started at the same time with me at Capital One were let go after a year. They all say the same thing, that tenured management team knows how to use the performance review process to get rid of people. It is cut throat. It isn't that the employees don't deliver results, the management team says that they have deficiencies in ""competencies,"" which of course are subjectively evaluated. If you ever get stuck in the wrong department or with the wrong boss, you are let go. As a result of the environment, there is a lot of backstabbing, rumors, and lies. Absolutely the most horrible work environment I have experienced. Job Hunters beware! I regret leaving my nice, well paid job to come to work here! Oh, and did I mention that I work about 80 hours per week with absolutely no appreciation or recognition."
bad,"Management is unstable,communication is horrible,I have learned alot from my co-workers but the deptartment as a whole is not the most pleasant place to work,morale is horrible and management just makes it worse for everyone."
bad,"They make a claim of investing in its employees but are simply metric driven. There is no reward for hard work. Those rewarded with bonuses, promotions etc are the ones that spend most of their time kissing up to their managers. Dissenting point of views are not welcome and discouraged."
bad,"No job security!  The managers don’t care about you! You are just a number here! They pick favorites, don’t care about how you feel. If you make one of the favorite workers upset, they will do everything in their power to write you up or push you aside to get laid off."
bad,"Unorganized,  management by intimation,  micromanage to the extreme.  Technology is a disaster. they have no idea what they are doing.  They are not a bank, they are a credit card company."
bad,"Company was good but the management team was a problem when you have a team that is not sure about taking decision then it is like a house of cards that crumble. The President never took decision always wanted one of his leader to, even thought it should be him, and he said so if you take the decisions and something happens then you are at fault."
bad,"I was fired for missing two days of work between January - September (with doctors notes) as a part-timer who needed the job due to being a full-time student. Everyone knew the manager had favorites, if you didn’t kiss her a** she didn’t like you. If you didn’t give details about your personal life she didn’t like you. I reached out to HR, they did nothing to help, she heard, and she retaliated. Now I’m completely unable for rehire due to this woman"
bad,Very unorganized department that was undergoing major changes.  Upper management was new to the department and lacked experience.  Decisions made based on favoritism and personal relationship.  Unethical behaviors were reported and backlash ensued.
bad,"The culture was great but management and pay was subpar."
bad,I really didnt like the fact tht the tl couldnt help you in your position but they was ur supervisor! My supervisor didnt know nothing abt the Fraud dep. I didnt like that we would couldnt get help with certain things thru CAAT ! Tge whole organization is a mess.
bad,The system at Capital One does not incentivize good leadership. The system incentives results over everything (even providing a quality product to the customer). It is a clique environment where most people that do not look like visible minorities get ahead.
bad,If so then you will love Capital One. There is so much butt kissing needed to do anything there you come home feeling dirty and like you've sold your soul. Management is all about having leverage over people and throwing it in your face daily. The pay is great and they know it so you're basically theirs to test as they see fit.
bad,"Not all, but alot of leadership lack the knowledge and ability to manage people and balance their role and personal life. Favoritism is a issue unfortunately for such a good idea company."
bad,The work environment is poorly led by directors who are openly biased and self serving. Unless you are willing to sell yourself out and be a brown noser you will not find success. Lack of direction.
bad,Working for capital one you have upper management daily being condescending. I had my manager tell me to go outside and speak to the people cutting the branch grass about opening an account because they where my people. She automatically assumed that the people cutting grass where Mexican. I also had a manager hit on me when I was six months pregnant. They under pay you and over work you. Maybe the CEO should focus more on making sure the work environment in the branches is a better atmosphere for employees. This is the company that has had the worst management.
bad,"Managers typically looked out for themselves only. You had to undercut others to move up or suffer the consequences. Benefits were good, and many friends were made, but moving up was bad politics in full form."
bad,"contractor’s beware!!"
bad,"After having worked at Capital One for 21 years, and a month after I had earned a B.S. degree from the University of Richmond, I was terminated.  I was informed by a colleague that our manager was intimidated by my skills and knowledge.  Our manager had a high school diploma.  I tried to reach out to senior managers, but my claims were dismissed."
bad,"The benefits and pat are the only reason anyone stays here. There is 0 job security (constant layoffs) and a very "" your job = your life"" wrk culture with little work/life balance. Stay away!"
bad,I worked as a temp contractor for the mortgage dispute dept. It was the worst position I had ever held. There were all girls in the dept and the manager basically took orders from his employees.
bad,"Many of the managers make it a very unpleasant environment."
bad,The company keeps making bad decisions.  They keep making their products worse and worse for customers.  They will release new products that don't even work and before those products are fixed they will release more broken products. Their current call wait times are on average 15 minutes before you get to talk to someone yet instead of trying to fix those wait times they are going to start advertising even more and trying to pull in more customers which will lead to even longer call waiting times.
bad,"Treated you like a number not a person. Only care about profits. Micro manage all facets of the job and give you no autonomy.            "
bad,"I love working for Capital One, great company. Good pay. Excellent benefits starting at day one. On the job training. A lot of advance opportunities as well as employee development. And added monthly bonuses. Very diverse with upbeat and positive culture"
bad,"Avoid working in Chester, Virginia.  Capital One was a great place to work until working in Chester, Virginia.  It was professional suicide.  The management is a group of people that need ego parties daily.  If you are not willing to feed the egos you will not last long."
bad,"A typical day of work at Capital One is keep your head down and work. Some days can be good if you have good people around you. I've learned that after all the years I've been at there they did not really appreciate the people, whether it be the branch or corporate client service role."
bad,At capital one its not what you know its who you know. Also if you do a great job they look for reason to fire you. If you max out with bonus then they try to find way for you to not. The managers lie and are shady and I would not recommend that place to anyone.
bad,"Very stressful, constant change, high expections. A lot of cheats nag is allowed by certain reps which makes it hard to get a bonus and compete to keep stats where they. Red to be."
bad,All jobs have goals and requirements to meet certain standards.  Cap1 goes beyond the extremes of what employees can do and they know the goals they have set are unrealistic.
bad,Capital One Bank was formerly North Fork Bank. I was hired a few months prior to transition.  Staff morale was low and the long time employees were not welcoming to the new hires.
bad,it started out being fun and a good place to work - management changes caused the place to become stressful. When you came into work you never knew if you would have a job at the end of your shift. New management became very cut-throat
bad,"It is mean girls, advancement depends on how hard you suck up and present others ideas as your own, no protection against poor managers, diversity and inclusion is a joke, beware of those who have been there 10+ years. They are skilled at smiling in your face and stabbing you in the back. If you're ambitious and a mature professional, you'll be viewed as a threat and you'll last no more than 2 years... it's a revolving door.... seriously."
bad,"not a good place to work for any single mothers or any mothers with no family support. the management at this company is worse i have ever experienced. benefits are great salary is alright, but the most stressfull and disorganized company."
bad,Capital One is a very hard company to understand as far as their leadership. They spend a ton of time over analyzing individuals instead of their work ethic and production. The management team are not equipped enough to make unbiased judgments on their direct employees duemail to the complexity of their reviews
bad,"Where do I start, this place only cares about money and how much you can make for them. Work hours are sometimes long and tellers are basically bankers without the pay. Company has high turnover rates because management are only trying to cover themselves."
bad,the best part of the job was meeting new people and having a good chat to them and the hardest was hitting targets and earning money
bad,I did not enjoy my time with Capital One. It is not a bank that I could recommend to others for employment. There were constant management changes.
bad,"Branch Manager of $90mm office. Maintained a highly energetic & motivated team of 8 associates, able to recognize sales opportunities, deliver exceptional service & able to effectively nourish a clientele with a concentration of high net worth professionals, Responsibilities included, but were not limited to: business development, sales & sevice coaching/training, branch operations, monitoring income & expense, work closely with business partners (wealth management, insurance, commercial lending, merchant services, treasury management, consumer loans). Highly developed knowledge of consumer & commercial services, as well as branch operations."
bad,"Production, production, production.  Would process requests, develop correspondence to respond to customers inquiries.  Reconcile 401k, Stock."
bad,"Typical day at work was a million phone calls in the call center, dealing with either happy or extremely rude customers that make you want to hang up and call it good. It required sales on top of sales on top of sales. You worked indefinite hours and worked with annoying people from my experience there."
bad,"They want Robots and not free-thinking workers. They say they give you all the tools you need, but I found this to be untrue."
bad,"The typical work day was very stressful. Managers played around and laughed and had fun, while employees took constant abuse from angry customers.  "
bad,Did not get any clear information of my assignment. Not seated with the rest of the group. Manager unavailable most of the time. No training for the assignment.
bad,Customers is always first and I love helping people all you have to do is focus on what’s needed and tend to the customer need. Always help people that’s around you be a team player.
bad,"Management did not know what they were doing and were flirted with very harassing behaviors frequently.  By throwing and name calling me, and I very inappropriate passes at other female employees."
bad,Not s good company to work for. They have their favorites there the people the supervisors like they treat them much better then the others people working there. If you not a favorite you will get a lot of compliments about your work.
bad,"On a typical day you have 3 people in a busy work enviroment. Everyone in the branch is able to do all transactions. Opening business accounts, managing the teller line, operational duties as well as taking care of escalations. Management is in charge of 3 or more locations and are unable to help on day to day activites. "
bad,"Many of the supervisors and managers went along with the way the department was managed, but complained about it in the breakroom or off property. Refuse to voice their recommendations or concerns."
bad,The company needs to do a review of their current managers that they have in place. They do not care about their employees as far as their well being or work/life balance.
bad,****I hope people really read this honestly****** I feel like they are very disorganized and a disappointment. The last 2 time I applied at Capital One  the person I spoke to is just not reliable. I have followed with the HR person plenty of time to schedule the interview because they were interested in meeting with me. I have sent emails and called. I never got a response from the Person from HR  and mind you I spoke to the same person 2 different times for different positions. They should restructure on how they follow up with potential Candidates. If that's what they want to do which is hire. They Should learn how to follow up.
bad,Capital One has great benefits but they do not outweigh the pressure and stress the workplace puts on the employees due to its use of stringent bell curve for performance reviews.  the bottom percentage is too high which causes it to place good people on PIPs and essentially forces people out of work.
bad,"You are set up to fail.  Training doesn't cover even half the stuff you need to know on the job and especially to avoid errors that count against your performance score and future opportunities.     Everyone is unhappy in this job especially the people in the Fraud department.   Manager makes it a mission to find as much fault with your calls as possible.   They arrange more customer surveys to get sent out for the people they want to have lowered performance scores.  If you take a lot of calls, you're screwed.  Sad part is that even if you get 5/5 star ratings for 10+ customer feedback surveys, if only ONE (1) survey comes back as a 2/5 or 1/5 star rating, it brings your score down tremendously as much as 30% down.  Its awful.  Departments are completely disorganized.  You work in the card department but yet are expected to take Tech Support calls and you don't even have access to the system on the backend or any training on handling technical support calls."
bad,"Bad management, poor training, treated like a child, just a number, poor IT network, good canteen, good pension, if you think outside the box your not welcomed."
bad,worst place to work. closing down all the branches.  going more digital. doesn't care about their employees and will push you to sell. making sales is their primary goal.
bad,"Multi-level projects including team projects, data analyses, daily/weekly/monthly audits, team building, coaching, feedback, disciplinary, hiring, corporate compliance management, internal compliance, training, onboarding, meetings, leading leadership management meetings, mentor"
bad,"nothing much to say about the overall experience, Capital One doesn't value great employees that know how to do the job right the first time, made lots of friends though."
bad,"Capital One is a good company however their managers are the worse. If you do not fit into the ""click"" you don't have a future with them. "
bad,"In the 7 years I worked there, I reported to 8 different managers. Out of those 8 managers, 6 were insecure micromanagers who gave credit or kudos to no one; blamed everyone on their team for any problems; and expressed zero desire to motivate or help their direct reports grow and advance. Any autonomous projects completed were never good enough; there was always something your manager would do ""better"", dragging out the deadlines and causing you undue stress and anxiety and working off the clock. Some managers had a habit of conveniently forgetting topics discussed in prior meetings, throwing you under the bus in front of other departments - then pretending it didn't happen when confronted. One day they are nice, the next they are rude. Most of my colleagues were easy to get along with, but the cutthroat atmosphere led to backstabbing and juvenile behavior that made it tough to do your job. If you showed any moxie or ambition or did your job well, EVERYONE thought you were out to get them and take their jobs.The tremendous amount of gaslighting that occurs in this company is disgusting. I've watched others have panic attacks and come in day after day hung over from the severe stress and unhappiness, and HR proved to me on 3 occasions that they only care about protecting their interests and their managers. It's an ugly cycle. Yes, the benefits and social responsibility of this company is great, but IT IS NOT worth sacrificing your physical and mental health. None of it is worth dealing with toxic people who will ruin you should they decide they don't like you."
bad,"Fun environment sometimes, but the compensation is not consistent nor enough. Depending on what type of manager you have, your work life could be non stressful, there are definitely some micro managers though."
bad,Not the best support from management.  Inconsistency with providing feedback from management.  Management behavior isn't consistent with the values that Capital One attempts to foster.
bad,Very stressful job and there was no compassion for the employees. No opportunities  for advancement. Very miserable to work there. wouldn't even recommend this job to my worst enemy. Paid the bills that was about it.
bad,"Annual performance reviews are very focused on the quality of your deliverables.  However, that doesn't translate into promotions.  Due to a focus on lowering operational costs, promotions are hard to come by making it very cutthroat politically. Middle-management are people that thrive in this kind of environment so you end up with leaders that are nice people, but fairly incompetent.  Added drawback is those leaders have been supported and promoted enough that they think they're the only ones capable of being ""right"" so they often ignore dissenting voices. Strategically, it turns into a white-male echo chamber."
bad,They did not value all employees.  If you were not in the click you were looked at as if you were not doing a good job.  Knowledge had little value.  Too many managers
bad,There is no job security at Capital One. You get laid off with no notice. Management does a poor job at translating effectively to their employees. Not satisfied with my experience at Capital One.
bad,Micromanagement with no purpose. No development or advancement. Very bureaucratic. Management conducted desk searches on all staff for no reason. Management used a lot of profanity on the floor and slandered staff.
bad,"Internal Compliance audit is a very unforgiving department to work in, any mistake you make will be held against you instead of using it as a coaching and development tool."
bad,"I have heard better reviews of other departments.  However, business banking is very biased and conducts business as if it was the 1980's.  Very male dominated, there are bias practices with male bankers vs female bankers. With preferential treatment provided to males. ""Boys club"" big time.   They are very behind the time in technology and the clients experience is not a good one.  The branch network is horrible and clients complain all the time.  Your lucky if you go into a branch and find more than 2 people on the floor.   Overall in comparison to other banks i have worked for this is the worst."
bad,worked with the small companies collecting on small business loans
bad,"Helping customer on their transaction. Managing inventory of cashier's check, debit card, general ledgers and other clerical duties.  Cross sell bank products to customer."
bad,Enjoyed the excellent benefits and compensation package.
bad,"Fun, high work moral but instability due to company changes"
bad,"•  Received inbound calls to resolve customers concerns related to all banking needs and incorporated product sales.  "
bad,They are constantly hiring and firing.
bad,"As a contractor, it is the luck of the draw which group you end up in. Unfortunately, I ended up in a group that was led by tyrannical micro-managers. One of them even told another contractor, ""Contractors need to be micro-managed."" It was horrible! Many IT project managers confided to me how much they disliked their jobs."
bad,"If you are working somewhere that you can tolerate, don't quit to work for Capital One. They will withhold information to keep you from making an informed choice. Management is not people friendly and will (in my case anyway) punk you in front of your coworkers"
bad,"Unfortunately the experience varies by the team manager.  Work tends to be rushed & low quality, however there are exceptions to the rule where there are very good projects and good managers."
bad,You where just a spot to fill not a person with brain and they let you know if you did't like it someone else is waiting to take your position.  No ones job was safe.
bad,Promotion is not given to African Americans.  There is an extreme amount of favoritism. I have nothing else positive to say so I choose to say nothing else.
bad,"The company has moved locations and invests in technology and building space but won't invest in their employees. For some reason AML team is concerned with funds going to the West Bank in particular, kind of Islamophobic if you ask me."
bad,"The best thing was the pay. Aside from that, they constantly made changes that negatively affected customers, to try to save money. I was able to learn great customer service skills but their training was years out of date, along with the information pages to advise customers. This caused a lot of confusion, that was difficult to constantly correct, with people giving different info to customers."
bad,Capital One touts itself as a Great Place To Work.  This is so untrue.  Their culture is toxic and they micromanage.  Their processes get in the way of production.
bad,"It's not what you know, it's who you know that will get you far at Capital One. There are numerous managers there that do not belong being a manager. There are manager that have HR complaints about them, and yet they still get promoted. Also, if you are over a certain age they will not promote you."
bad,"I found a security risk in the application I was working on, account numbers were being stored in plain text in web browser memory. In plain readable javascript, the account numbers were ""encryped"" meaning there was a string of all characters in the function and each character in the account number was replaced with a character some number of characters to the right of it. The unencrypt function was in plain javascript as well. I mentioned that I found this in the code in a morning stand up meeting. I was told not to bring it up when we presented our work to more senior managers, so I told the guy doing the presentation that I couldn't talk then because I didn't know what to say. So he went into this meeting and just completely lied and said that the account numbers were being securely encrypted. A couple weeks later he voted that I should not get a full-time offer."
bad,Mangment micromanages . They rather give you a lend position instead of promotion so they don't have to pay for you doing more work . If your a female you can advance with no degree . Males who have experience and degree don't get management roles .
bad,"Department Capital One took over. Managers would complain about being part of Capital One. Poor Training ,Very poor management, low pay and no growth."
bad,"Mine was located in Louisiana, there were a lot of employees and a lot of favoritism among them. Management doesn't care about your opinion. Be prepared to sell credit cards."
bad,"capital one is a good place to work as far as the culture is concerned, i had a lot of fun times there and great memories were made as well,but they really need to work on hiring better management as far as knowledge is concerned they have a tendency to hire managers who do not have knowledge of what the associates do on a daily basis. i feel that since they had a big lay off recently and i was one of the peole who was affected they should be more careful with their managers as alot of the associates feel that they are being mis managed."
bad,"Doesn't matter if your top in sales, all depends on if manager likes you or not. I would not recommend people to work in the auto finance department since management is poor"
bad,"There is an insane amount of politics between managers, directors, and employees. The typical day is being yelled at on the phone to work on something, then getting a call at 1 am to get new requirements."
bad,"Very political, management is not in control of employees or scheduleing, places favorites above seniority, not a equal opportunity employer, no room for potential or growth, shown appreciation with massive pay cuts!"
bad,"I had no idea what was going on ever. The place was unpleasant. Without saying anything goes, they pretty much allowed anything and they gave the illusion that upper management even used drugs at work. I did not have the experience and they did not bother providing it either."
bad,it was a very professional environment.  I really enjoyed the working for the company.  The call volume was very large.  Overall I enjoyed working there
bad,"It was a fun company to work. Co workers was very nice,  Branch closed down. The hardest job was to make the goal to open checking/saving account, you need to make the goal or you can be write up. Capital one bank is a company that cant make arrangement for school scheduled that a big issue that all"
bad,Repossession...its not fun. The customers are rude and then you have to deal with managers and co workers. The overall experience was not worth my time but it did provide me with a check
bad,"Left company in 2014 after 29 years and 6 mergers"
bad,"There was lack of morale in this company. The benefits for health insurance and stability were good, however no room for growth."
bad,"fast pace, back to back calls, long shifts, and 98% schedule adherance."
bad,"The most unorganized company ever. The management was horrible. Switched branch managers 3 times in one year. When we finally got an ""acting branch manager"" it was even worse. She was horrible at her job. She never stepped up to the plate to help out. She was rude and had favorites. I am not sure how she even got that position I know there are more deserving people. Lost 4 employees within 4 months. That says alot about this branch."
bad,"Executive management has very good long term strategy concerning what companies to purchase next.    Most of the growth of the company is based on buying other companies.    On the banking side of the company, there is very little internal knowledge about the details of the various banking applications used to run the business."
bad,"Management didn't know how to run the bank. It was a great learning experience.  It didn't pay well.  I learned sales of consumer products, customer service, and bank needs.  Loved my co-workers and was a team player.  Went from Part time to Full time within a year and became an assistant to the head teller in six months.  I loved learning new things and picked up the information pretty fast."
bad,"An extraordinarily odd culture that rewards self-promotion over team-based accomplishments. For entry-level finance or IT grads, it is probably a great place to begin your career. For anyone at mid-level career or above, proceed with caution and be very wary. COF is known for going on hiring binges and then, just as abruptly, shedding headcount by the hundreds. A very uncertain and insecure environment."
bad,"There is a disgusting culture of racism and nepotism at Capital One. I should have sued them for the abuse I had to put up with. The managers for the most part are very immature, some are so hateful! Only people that are friends or relatives of  current employees get the chance to is Yes move up. My department was so messed up that I had 4 managers  in one year!"
bad,"The company itself is very much ok however the problems are managers they are arrogant power trippers , there is even a manager there who would raise her voice to her agent in front of many people just because of a bad call very unprofessional capital should monitor the behavior of there managers towards their agent"
bad,My manager and I had a personality conflict due to a medical condition that I have which ultimately led to me leaving the position that I was fulfilling. If it wasn't for her I would still be an employee there and enjoying my job
bad,"Stressful and demanding, call upon call upon call, call center environment. Every second you are counted and judged.  The training is the poorest I have ever had, it is basically on the job training.  After two years I am the only one left from my training class that I am aware of.  It takes a toll."
bad,"Capital One's leadership is filled with bunch of people who use there power to benefits them selves and people they like. No fair system of advancement, all about who you know and act like you like them. Very sad culture, most of the people I  know only work there for the benefits and end up leaving after year or 2. Also the fact that they do not drug test, leaves you to working with people who sell and do drugs in parking lot and on campus (leadership included)."
bad,There is no appreciation for workers in Louisiana and it shows in the treatment of same.  The organization is top down from the north and the attitude toward the southern franchise is bad.
bad,I worked through an agency (S3) but reported directly to a manager and director. The job was not explained clearly and the worked environment was very stressful. Not friendly or interactive.
bad,"My management was inflexible and did not handle situations accordingly. I had been with the company for nearly two years. Human Resources was impossible to get a hold of, and when I did they offered me minimal help in resolving the issues at hand. When I went through some personal and physical difficulties like surgeries and the loss of my child, I was treated with disrespect for taking time off that was non-negotiable. I was a dedicated employee that they underpaid, mistreated and abused."
bad,The company as a whe isn't going to be around for long. Both mortgage and investment department has gone under. Not do long the branches will close down and there going to automated services as well. Which isn't working out for them
bad,Nothing to say about this company. I work there to complete my shift and left every day. I really didn’t have nothing nice to say. Just making the requirement
bad,Management did not protect me. I felt unsafe when with to my manager he presude me to stay know the situation. Then terminated after defending myself.
bad,"You work as a team, and achieve your goals (even most the time over achieve the goals and expectations). Never being noticed or awarded for any of your hard work. The branch manager would pull money out of her own pocket to show her appreciation of our team."
bad,"Capital One tries to bill itself as a tech company but is definitely not. The software is full of technical debt and rarely works. Management is borderline technically illiterate and is hostile to the idea of learning anything new. "
bad,Bilingual Department is more like the dump departmet.  Whenever Capital one doesot know where to send the call send it to bilingual.  Lets give them more work to do but lets pay them the same salary.  Other than that a good company to work for if you like inconsistancy
bad,The company itself was good to work for not the department of Merchant Disputes. The management was something to be desired and their training was horrible for new rules and regulations set forth.
bad,"I should have known when my interview with the sales coach was 2 hours long (of which the recruiter said was WAY TOO LONG when I told her) that it was a bad omen."
bad,"When I first started working for this company I should have known it would be a mess. The training is horrrible they basically just throw you out on the floors , and alot of the managers don't know answers to your questions. The managers have favorites so its definately hard to move up in the company! The best part of the work day would be your (2) 15 minute breaks and your lunch aswell as your time to clock out and go home"
bad,"I haven't learned anything the systems are flawed. Only go there for quick cash. Management was a joke, they micro manage somedays and non-existent on the weekends. But great inurance the best that I ever had. Schedule is a mess though"
bad,The environment is so high school and you can forget about moving up or transferring to a different department.  Unless you know someone higher up your stuck in the same department.
bad,"While there were some organic and talented leaders in the call center environment, head office and most senior leaders seemed to be an elite closed group of highly decorated bullies.  Capital One is a great place to work in general, but once you begin dealing with head office members, the employee experience drops dramatically.  The Montreal office is also similar in this regard seemingly wanting to be as cut throat and superficial as Toronto’s head office.  People should always come before process in order to achieve long term positive results."
bad,This was a low quality call center job. The entire company has a strange cult-like mentality concerning capital one and it was extremely off putting when starting out. The training was mediocre at best as they clearly don’t put effort into finding trainers that are worth anything. The managers were nothing but a figure head as they didn’t know anything about the job and were only there for coaching purposes. I left the job after 4 months due to the intense stress that the work puts on you. This job was so bad I began self-harming to cope. They do not value employees and will happily drop a box off at your desk and tell you to pack up and walk you out without an ounce of hesitation.
bad,culture d entreprise parfaite mais l'aspect humain est encore a travailler des les decisons manageriale
bad,job was not fun it was very good environment but management was horrible alot of food and fraud cliants that was calling trying to book cars flight and hotel using other people points and the company did not care
bad,"I would suggest that if you are hired through a contracted Temp agency to find other work ASAP. Not only is the compensation for pay below par, there are no affordable benefits, you have to work next to ungrateful people who have all the benefits of Capital One but not the ""Capital One"" attitude or simple standard of ethics. You will be held to a hire standard than their Permanent employess are, and expected to do it with a smile or theres potential for you to never get hired permanently or you altogether lose your job.  This is probably the reason why Capital One is a fortune 500 company. Because they refuse to hire good working people and only hires temps, and then gives those temps false hope that they will have the opportunity to become a permanent employee. The reality is that even when you exceed goal for your metrics there is still a process to get flipped to permanent. This is unfair Capital One and you guys should really do better."
bad,"A great place to work if you are in the right team and at the right level. "
bad,"Can't beat the benefits, time off, decent starting pay and sense of being down with the best."
bad,"management have no idea of the business, worked there for over a year. has to report to 3 managers, typical corporate world where zero communication and no one cares if you are doing something good.  need good connection for ""go up""."
bad,Not for someone looking to make a career. Expect tellers to do everything and don't compensate them for it. Not worth the pay. And polices constantly change every couple weeks.
bad,"For the amount of emphasis they put on internal growth within the company, there is virtually none whatsoever when someone tries to go from retail banking to corporate. As a branch ambassador, you are expected to do EVERYTHING a branch could need, yet you get paid very minimally. Company is constantly cost cutting, and it has gotten to the point where any branches that still exist have a budget of 2 dollars. For example, during the holidays, each branch recieved 1.... ONE cheese pizza and 25 napkins for a “holiday celebration”. If that’s not cheap, then idk what is."
bad,"Excessive workload, goals hard to meet, lack of training, poor management. Outdated hardware, extremely slow software.Too much pressure to reach the monthly goals."
bad,"Job was very stressful and I wasn't allowed to go within the company."
bad,Great benefits but company lacks motivation and transparency. They try to act like they don’t want to push sales but they really do want you to make sales.
bad,"Retaliation , bulying, pregnant employees discrimination allowed in a company. After what happened to me , i believe no one at this branch will be honest with surveys or HR."
bad,They fire tons of employees with out notice. They do not advance you no matter how good you are and they will not back you. run from this company.They want to be a credit card company only.
bad,"very stressful work environment, managers were extremely condescending. No hours given.Rude customers that your suppose to allow to speak to you in any disrespectful manner. The only good thing are the benefits and discounts"
bad,"The managers did little to control the vitriol in the office. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I was able to go for long walks outside alone. The hardest part of the job? Putting up with the junior high school playground gossip, insecurities, and slander...and the intolerance of different beliefs and opinions."
bad,"No matter how many years of experience you have, and no matter that all your former employers would take you back and have nothing but raving reviews of your work, Capital One operates like not even the Almighty could work there!  They put you through multiple behavioral interviews not thinking that a person might be nervous and not answer ""correctly"". They put you through multiple interviews in one day which reminds me of buying a car - you are so worn out by the end that you are not mentally functioning!  Really?  You need all this to make $50K if you're lucky, and you're not even trying to be a manager!"
bad,The pay was great but horrible management no motivation. Worst mistake you can make because this is no job securiry or advancement.
bad,"My experience with capital one has been poor. If you apply realize that Capital One cares about Capital One. First warning sign should have been when 3 weeks into training they informed us that night shift was going away. There were several people that took this job because of that and declined other opportunities to take this. Secondly, I had a supervisor that decided that punking me for 3 days was how to handle a termination. I filed a dispute which took over 60 days to resolve."
bad,"Poor senior management, over worked by upper management. We were forced to do more with less personnel with no incentive other than to keep the job. HR is worthless s well."
bad,"Capital one took us over with the promise to the government to get 75% of their jobs back in the US. Once thy hit it, they met their government requirement and immediately started closing sites to outsource all of their jobs again. I moved with the company and got to see the hirer management decisions. They are willing to bbuild a site up and get rid of the same site like it is nothing. Then build it up again and do it all over again. Very unstable. They treat people well, but they don't care about peoples lives. We had multiple suicides in our city due to them just pulling out after they hit there 75%. They knew about it and continued their business practices."
bad,"No warning just let go! "
bad,"Twice a year all managers of the same level get together in a big meeting and rank all their employees against each other.  Managers are required to give a certain number of each level of performance rating (needs intervention, strong, very strong, excellent). The bottom 10% of employees will be FIRED.  Turnover rate is very high (that doesn't even include the massive layoffs every few years.)"
bad,after my training was finished i kept getting disciplined for doing what i was told to do. i was not trained properly and the leadership was not doing there jobs properly. people were leaving or getting let go left and right.
bad,"If you were at one of the branches that didn’t close down, the managers just picked their favorites and then talked bad about all the other associates, and tried to either run them off or make up false things for someone to be written up about that only comes up at the annual review for a raise, so it’s denied unless you’re in the managers little secret group. Everything is a double standard."
bad,They need to have qualified management who cares about their employees and not just what benefits them. They need upper management to be investigated due to conflict of interest.
bad,"I worked there over two years, turned in notice. Was told in exit interview I was rehireable. I reapplied and had a great interview, left the interview talking bout which training class I would be part of. Then I was told by recruiting that I was not being hired due to the way I quit, and I needed to email A/R. Which I did and was, informed that I was not rehireable because of the way I quit. This is the same department that told me on two occasions I was rehireable. I feel like this is because when I left the company it was to work for my former Team Lead who had been fired. During my employment with Capital One I was never written up, had perfect attendance. I feel like I am being punished for someone elses mistake."
bad,"The brick and mortar banks are dying out. With less people actually banking in branch Capital is trying to take on new markets with it online tools and products."
bad,"They will fire you for anything any reason. even after any time frame from 1 year to 40 years, they dont care. Lots of favoritism and fake people. It feels like ur in the brady bunch. bunch of stupid meetings."
bad,Very negative feedback from supervisors.  Advancement opportunities minimum. Room for pay advancement none.  Call center atmosphere.  Felt like just a number.
bad,"great atmosphere, great people, wonderful place to be employed...............................................................................................joiqhgiuerguiwrfluywbdcuylbweufvwulfvkwvckguwaevfksvdfkuwvfkgwevfkgvsdkgfvwekgfvwkgfv"
bad,"much of a stick company - not a easy day here, lots of pressure and poor management. undercover boss would have a heart attack if they seen how management treated the staff."
bad,"good hours , management was helpful co workers were close knit group .sometimes hours were long but having a good group to work with helped the time go by"
bad,"worked 830 - 630 many days plus Saturdays"
bad,when i applied for the job i assumed id be part of a team in a back room but i soon discoverd i was behind my own desk and stuck in an office all day ...not my scene
bad,"I was not satisfied with the company. There really isn't much I would like to say about them. I do believe they pay pretty well for starting out employees. Working there can be robotic, and that to me was not fun."
bad,I enjoyed my co workers and the ability to have a family friendly schedule. I learned a lot in my time there and the collecting skills I gained helped me in masking a great living. The fraud department came after Capital one changed it . I did enjoy helping our customers and making their life easier.
bad,Work/Life balance is a challenge and locating information to resolve an issue or complete an inquiry can be a very long process.
bad,You are challenged to do your best and are encouraged to help others do the same.
bad,"Busy, ever changing work environment. Learning programs available."
bad,"great company to work for  w/ many perks learned how horn my customer service skills-great management, great co-workers one of the best jobs, I had"
bad,Not a place to work they don't care for their workers they take from us and give nothing back! Im mainly talking bout the call center!
bad,"Being in management, I had a ton of responsibility while being vastly under paid."
bad,- No Transparency
bad,great company to work for just working through temp isnt the best idea if you go to this company trying to be added on a full time
bad,"Customer service rep, the job was interesting.  This department at capital one out source, however it was a great place to be to grow with the company."
bad,"Working in The Flo Department was very rewarding having my own accounts assigned to me collecting on personal loans."
bad,"Stressful at times,  get unprofessional users calling in or on email. Some team members unprofessional at times. Being a contractor there was horrible."
bad,The facility is very beautiful and clean. The benefits we're great. There were no flexibility or work/ life balance and management did not care. A lot of gossip. The food places on campus we're good. NO growth opportunities and managers lied a lot. The manager had favorites.
bad,"they would yell at you if u went to the restroom more then once a shift...very crazy about states, calls, rating, now scores... they make promises they never keep... will keep u at a low level and not let u advance to a better position if u are a top ten scorer cuz they need u to look goid.. but wont give u a raise"
bad,"Training was great.  The constant turnover was not.  First line management was promoted because they were good at the job, not because they were good at leading a team."
bad,"Contractors are class-B citizens. No promotions, no benefits, nothing. The company is trying to buy into its own culture but doesn't really act upon it."
bad,Not sure it was a while ago. The atmosphere was always gloomy. People were always in fear of losing their job. No security and no matter how good you were at your job if they didn’t like you you were transferred fired or forced to quit.
bad,"Employees have been call baggage and are not valued. No job security. My branch is closing along with 20 others. We seen over 40 closings this year and will be more like 140 next yr. 200 other hard working ladies and gentlemen were laid off last week in business banking, and more to come."
bad,"great place to work. easy work load. people are great, pay is great unless you are a contractor or student worker. Federal experience."
bad,Very difficult place to work.  Changes were do to them not being prepared. I learned to deal with various cultures.  I also matured in the area of patience.
bad,This is an unprofessional environment where managers don't have the usual way to treat employees
bad,Smile and dial open floor plan environment might appeal to the non-creative worker.
bad,"Not much say. I did not like working there. The pay was low and not a good work-life balance. Pretty stressful work environment. They have to know where you are all times of the day. It's safe to say, call centers are not for everyone."
bad,Nepotism is rampant throughout organization. Impossible to earn merit. Human Resources only protects management team above all. Manager threatened to terminate my employment for pursuing a FINRA license. Contacted HR and 3rd Party Arbitration to investigate. HR took 4 months to respond. Acknowledged my manager was wrong. Unable to transfer to another department without my manager's recommendation. Voluntary resigned after two other managers stated that I was blackballed/blacklisted.
bad,"Terrible culture"
bad,Very hard to be a contractor at Capital One and THERE ARE NO Consultants you are a CONTRACTOR.  You are not treated fairly but you do all the work.  While cap one associates are out doing we care and give back you are inside doing their work.
bad,"Not a positive place to work, they allowed everyone to be the boss and there were too many cliques.  The branch i worked for really was not concerned about your family and the needs that you needed."
bad,"My typical day of work included plenty of multi tasking and servicing of clients. I had to assist my tellers with their work as well as coach them on how to send a client to my desk. I also had to prepare reports for clients of their financial's and for the bank as well. The management was great up until they removed my manager for an undisclosed reason. The hardest part of the job was being the hardest worker. I had little to no help, a lot of responsibilities and i had to work overtime to complete most of my co-worker's paperwork. The most enjoyable part of my job was making great relationships with my clients. My clients trusted me to handle everything for them regarding their funds and what to do with these funds with little supervision by them."
bad,Not a very good place to work at. You have managers that dont back there team member up.  And also managers that go around and tell peoples personal business
bad,Management is very poor. No experience working in a call center environment. Very critical and if they view you as a threat they will do everything to get you fried. Doesn't work with you to advance you. Overly critical management plays favorites and does not hide that fact. You're are given script to follow but told not to sound scripted. Good luck to any new hires you will need it.
bad,"Management in Plano, TX does not have a clue about how to operate a mortgage operation. They ran off all of the experienced professionals and replaces them with Auto Finance people and thats why they will be shut down by headquarters in VA."
bad,Company does not give sufficient work/life balance. Upper management shows no compassion to employees. The job itself is rewarding in that I am able to meet new people and help them with finances. The best part of my job is having great co-workers. The hardest part is feeling secure in the company.
bad,"Remember the data breach?  They are not good at tech. You can count on a few good years, and they they lay off people on a regular quarterly schedule.  The annual appraisal process is brutal."
bad,Management wasn’t available for any type of develop towards your career goals within the company. The pay was low and no work life  balance. I would not refer a friend to this company
bad,"Horrible place, probably the source of the very fraud they pay minimum wage workers to ""solve""... in most countries the FBI and Police chase fraudsters, not uneducated low-skilled workers... enough said."
bad,"The benefits is the only thing they have going for the employment package. Even if you work twice as hard then anyone on your team, the mid year and end of year reviews are very bios and slighted."
bad,My team leader was very demanding.I did not like that she talked about my family to try to get me meet my goals.I felt horrible everytime I talked to team leader.
bad,I love working in capital One but I had to relocate to New York City and then when I got to New York City I was still on hold because of the place that I applied for was not ready on time so I can look for another place for work by the end of the company is good
bad,"Capital One unfortunately got taken over by employees of BOA and other big banks which they all started to PIP employees out. Their hire process was biassed and unfair for internal candidates. No opportunities for internal promotions and the recruiters are the worst, they never get in touch with you. If you are a Relationship Banker, technically that will be the end of your career. Anything else is just biass decisions."
bad,Capital one cares more about profit than people. I project in three years they will only be servicing credit cards. The Plano site has 7 buildings and only three are being utilized.
bad,what I did at capital one was what I did at previous job and I was paid less for it and the job was easy to me because I have experience in the past. I did not enjoy the job because was design for all the permanent employer for the benefit
bad,"Never get raises when told so had to sell like working in retail. Never completly organized, not much work when there were no customers, Management was aweful."
bad,This job is good for basic experience unless your a work-0-holic it is stressful with 24-7 on call availability literally meaning just that. It is not worth the pay if you move up to management status.
bad,"This level of management was very uncaring and horrible about providing guidance and help with your job.  With them the glass was always half full or what have you done for me lately.  You were always on edge no matter what you did, right or wrong."
bad,"I worked at capital one for about a year and during my time there I felt bullied by managers. I was a contractor, they treated all the contractors like outsiders even though we were the back bone of the treasury management department. The managers let their personal feelings affect the way they treat people. I only got 30 min lunch , no other break for a 8+ hour work day, and that 30 minutes started the minute you left your desk, by time you get down stairs to get food you have 15 minutes left to find something to eat and sit .  The managers had attitudes for no reason , they hated when you stood  up for your self. I was pregnant and even though i was approved to come in late on Mondays  because i had to see a specialist, they still gave me a hard time, sometimes would call me while Im seeing the doctor.  I honestly feel that it was only the treasury management department because the other departments always seemed very rock solid. The turn over rate is also very high. be warned , you can make great money their because they do not mind over time but honestly you start to think is it worth it."
bad,My manager  was the worst manager I ever had. She would bully every employee and have  relations with other employees. Instead of laying people off they fire you so that they don't have to pay unemployment. When it's time to do assessments on managers if you tell the truth then you will have a red dot placed on your forehead and they would be out for u. They need to re valuate management.
bad,I enjoy helping the customers that call in and need assistance with their accounts. The major drawback is management. Management is constantly changing the bonus structure and what is required to receive commissions. Human Resources do not protect employees or help with problems. Their job is to protect management. My managers have told me one thing and have done something quite different. My integrity and honor has been constantly called into question. Frontier Secure has a partnership with Capital One Credit Cards as a customer service provider. The benefits promised upon hire are too good to be true and impossible to use.
bad,job sucks . they don't respect their employees or their ideas. Chance of moving up with this company are base on who you know
bad,"Capital One has been around forever, and the call center is very large.However the is not a lot of opportunity for career growth.There many nice people that you will encounter while working there.However the management team does not act as a liaison for the employees."
bad,"Good place to gain new skills. But, no good in terms of work and home life balance. Hardest part of working for them was the politics which were very abrasive and underhanded."
bad,The performance management system is more like a popularity contest.  It does not reward those who work hard and have tenure.  Rating and expectations are inconsistent from manager to manager and are completely subjective and not based on actual performance.
bad,Worked there for 16 years now the company is closing. Hours are ok. Get bounced around from different departments alot.
bad,Everything is repetitive and constant change with employees including procedures. Management is not very helpful. Co workers tend to make the day difficult when not needed.
bad,"It was different,different culture and dress code. I think some people get work wear and club wear confused, including foot wear. This was my first call center job , there were lot of changes, now I'm ready for a change, that does not involve finance."
bad,"I went to work for Capital One as a last resort. I was leery from all of the bad press and negativity I've heard about them over the years   and just knowing how the call center environment is based on my experiences. During my training it seemed that Capital One had made a variety of changes to cater more towards their employees, I was super excited. Once we got through nesting and onto the production floor my training class was separated based on our schedules. Needless to say it became a nightmare, everything we learned in training went out of the window! There was one person on the floor to coach and supervise 60+ phone agents after 6 pm, none of management wanted to help, management looked down and frowned at the phone agents, there was always drama and gossip ( all call centers are similar to high school), no appreciation was ever genuinely displayed in a warm fashion from management as they expect agents to do for customers. Everything Capital One supposedly prides themselves in was a total crock. I left after a year because there was no opportunity for growth, no organization, I didn't feel good about my pace within the company and felt I was going nowhere with Capital One. Some people absolutely love Capital One, it's comes down to personality, ethics and values. It just wasn't for me."
bad,"Job Description:"
bad,"Nothing to write home about, same dreary thing day in, day out"
bad,"Virtually impossible to move up in the company unless you are personal friends with the hiring manager. The pay is much lower than any finance company I've ever worked for. "
bad,worse experience in my adult working life.  surrounded by women who hated to see men succeed.
bad,"when I was there it was a disorganized mess, I had to run around to 9  branches in NYC."
bad,"the overall job enviorment was poor and unprofessional , the teaching and training was unhelpful "
bad,I have done multiple years at C1. My most recent experiences show me signs that C1 is reducing local wages to match off shore wages which impacts local community negatively. Additionally they do not honor contracts to term on a regular basis. You have to ensure that you are in with a good team prior to joining.
bad,"Was a lengthy process of traing I liked it, but i had medical issues. Personal that is why I left."
bad,"I answered phones, set appointments,filing. The hardest part of my job was that it did not keep me busy and I was at a desk all day, I would like a job where I am up moving, I did enjoy my clients and still miss seeing them."
bad,"culture is too corporate and not like a real software company. no value in relationships, just wants more and more from you on top of your daily duties.  salary for my position is low."
bad,"In the tech organization, management is worthless, as they're tech-oriented individuals that have been promoted to people managers and are not fit to do the job whatsoever. Their general ineptitude and apathy leads you to fight for any bit of respect from people that are actual leaders, as your coworkers try to throw you under the bus so they can stand on your lifeless corpse to raise themselves up in the eyes of leadership. The job is pure misery and I fail to see any future there."
bad,"A burnout job.  I was there 8 months as a scrum master and was the senior person by the time I left"
bad,"I worked at Cap 1 for 7 years filing claims for bank account fraud and merchant disputes.  Very repetitive job and easy to learn. The real obstacle is management. If you're in with the right people you can advance. So can your brother, sister, and your mom. Nepotism is rampant. So is the famous ""stretch-role"". They will use you if you let them and give the job you've been doing all the time to someone who just started. Then they wait to see how you react to it and use it against you should you try again. Sick. The pto benefits they offer you never really get to use them they deny most requests. Unless you're in with the clique. Management/Associate scandals galore. Personality and racial profiling galore. Promised pay increases and title advancements that never happen. Forget about open door policy,  its open to everyone and they'll know your personal business. Bullying from management. HR will do due diligence but secretly sides with management a common practice in Corp america. Well known company though, looks good on the resume. If its worth the loss of your sanity for this cult of a company. Proceed with caution..."
bad,"The company thrives on providing empty titles without legitimate career advancement and throttling the skills of some of their most valued employees. Taking advantage of these associates while giving empty promises and failing to  advance them for fear of being inferior to those they higher is evident. Too much value is placed on an annual evaluation by sub-par checked out management. One poor review from said mangement can destroy a career instantly, and it’s sad. For a company that supposedly wants to “change banking for good”, it is very clear that the corporate game of who you know is the only legitimate way to get anywhere."
bad,"Working for capital one was worth it in auto but working in small business banking miserable, not organized, and the managers and upper level people isn't professional and talks about employees. If only Rich Fairbanks really knew what his company is truly turning into. The managers show favoritism and everything. It puts you in the mind of a college campus full of mess and drama."
bad,Its clear that the branch employees dont matter.  They have downsized staffing to below whats needed to function daily. The team and customers suffer.
bad,Moving ahead with cut backs is hard - elimination of Position after branches were closed  Staten Island was affected and many people lost their jobs and benefits
bad,"Too much work without paying well enough."
bad,"Lacked diversity in corporate leadership and positions. The tuition reimbursement incentive assisted in the earning of my Master's degree but, I had a hard time with growing within the company despite my veteran and education status."
bad,It was a temp position so not much to get out of it.  It was  on a monthly basis and when there was no more work I was let go.  Would have been happy to have more opportunity to work there.
bad,"Certain individuals promoted to management at Capital One shouldn't supervise associates. They create toxic work environments, patronize employees, mistrust employee motivations, and proceed with tasks regardless of how it will affect the company."
bad,This company promises to reward and promote those who play by the rules and work hard. But it's a lie. At the end of the year you are reviewed and compensated with an annual bonus. However the rating system is flawed and it is basically a popularity contest. Hard working associates with valuable information and knowledge of complicated processes are overlooked and expected to keep raising the bar without appropriate accolades let alone compensation. The only way to get ahead is to leave the company and be rehired at a different management level.
bad,"Capital One seemingly isn't a bad place to work. The reality is different than what appears on the surface. To prosper you have to realize at the outset 10-15% of everyone around you will get laid off every single year. The bank could be called Churn One. They do stack ranking / forced ranking. So you could have a great team, with everyone on it be fantastic, but your manager will pick people to throw under the bus every year because they have no choice."
bad,"I've been a Capital One for over 5 years. If you're confident in your abilities, white people will mistreat you and hold you back from getting a promotion.  Also, associates today will call HR on you if you hold them accountable or if they don't feel you like them.  Who comes to work to be liked?  "
bad,"Decent place to work , Culture is not so great neither is the pay. Small company everyone knows each other. The system needs some improvement. Turnover rate is high."
bad,"Used to be a great company but has changed so much over the years.  Change is typically good but not when you remove the human element.  The company used to care about people, they now only put on a good show of caring about people."
bad,"Long hours, no help from management to succeed. Allowed cheaters to prosper."
bad,"The company at this time is going through tech transformation. It is a good place if you are into this."
bad,"Yes, you could work from home but know that big brother was watching to see if you were on line.  Pay not equal to the amount of work required.  Management was only looking out for themselves not those who worked for them."
bad,"They rope you in with a ton of promises then work you like a dog. Management is corrupt and doesn't care about you, they only care about themselves. There is no room for advancement they hire managers from outside of the company."
bad,"Poor management, I felt like they were out to get me from day one, they jump all over every little mistake and don't cut you any slack. Very cutthroat and not much room to advance."
bad,"Company that was great to work for at first, but quickly looked for ways to lessen our pay and save their profits. "
bad,"Capital One on the whole is a great company. There are lots of smart people and the company tries to promote an empowered culture. Unfortunately, for me the manager that I had wasn't a good one. She provided no direction, but consistently focused on any perceived action that could reflect negatively upon her management ability. Instead of honest and direct feedback, she choose to act passive aggressively in her interactions with me."
bad,"If you've worked here, you know what I mean.  If you working in a key state or department it can be rewarding.  If you don't - look out.  Oftentimes I felt like I was trapped in a very large game of telephone.  People do not communicate well, and expectations are absurd."
bad,"This place gave me a great education on how to be a collector, it's just that I refuse to be mean to anyone. I believe in respecting everyone. This place could have been better if we were just paid to do our job, and not by how much we collect. This job ended up closing down."
bad,"Everyday for the 6 years I worked I went in wondering if it was my day to get layed off. Eventually they wiped out my entire department but I found another position. Then a year later they wiped everybody out again but I found another position. 18 months later layed off again later but no such luck on a new role."
bad,I wouldn't even waste my time with this job. The pay is bad. Management is horrible. Upper management will try to speak to you however they want.
bad,Management sucks. Will say anything to get you out of a job when they are ready for new faces.
bad,"Training was disorganized by whoever wrote it.  Presenter just followed the plan. Co workers jump on you for doing something incorrectly even though you have been there 2 weeks and are still learning. You have to score 84% on your monitored calls monthly (5 per month) to earn extra $$ and ( what they didn't mention until the last day) keep your job.  Chances of getting the extra $$ are slim because they are evasive on if everyone who passes 84% will be paid. There is nothing in writing. They say there is no script, but you get a bad score for saying this before that.  My supe is/was OCD (according to her ) and she is correct.  It interferes with her doing her job.  She never sent me the calls and the password so I could listen to my calls, despite me asking repeatedly.  She set me up because she has no management skills and thinks acting this way is good. My supe sends inappropriate, unprofessional, critical emails, then waits to hi five each team member when she leaves for the day.  I am currently working somewhere else and out of 20 people 10 are formerly C O employees.  No opportunities to transfer even though they tout it.  Always laying off people or looking for a way to fire.  Just before I started, there was a story on tv how 200 people were dismissed."
bad,The hours were long and not many benefits. Management walked around and did nothing. They didn't know how to do most of the work they were to manage.
bad,I worked there for 8 yrs and went into the ICU at hospital and when i came home i didnt have a job!
bad,"Very interesting and great people to work with, but the office is planning on closing.  They cannot offer a full time position or any benefits."
bad,"Capital One was very supportive when it dealt with family issues.  My typical work day consisted of working with my direct reports to assist with customer calls and issues.  My co-workers were very helpful and friendly.  I learned many managerial skills during the years I worked at the company.  Management, depending on the department, were very  knowledgeable. However the hardest part of the job was our ability as floor managers to get our assigned tasks completed while managing the call center.  It usually required outside time from all managers to get the our required work completed.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the people and being able to see people grow."
bad,Forbes selected their CEO as the most overpaid CEO of 2012. His response was to lay off hundreds more associates.
bad,They can fire you for policy change which had not yet occurred at the time call recordings were made. 
bad,"This job was great I got along with everyone I enjoyed helping my customers, but Capital One did not have my back. I had been out sick and this company replaced me while I was still under doctors care. So I lost my jod and that was really sad."
bad,A typical day at work was made stressful by having managers stand over your shoulders monitoring what you were doing. I never really had a problem with co workers. The hardest part of working was having to get the same customers that we saw everyday to speak with one of the associates at the desk. Its hard trying to get people to open a line of credit or get a new credit card when they are struggling to eliminate debt. Customers do not like being hassle to do something they don't want to do. It just became overbearing. Any incentives was based on getting a customer to the desk. I truly enjoyed the job when I first join. It was like we were all one big happy family but as managers from competitor banks were brought in the family environment went out the door.
bad,After being told you are doing a great job all year. That one time of year when they can put what they are saying on paper. Some how those who are doing all of the work are calibrated below those who are friends with management. It is very interesting that a data analytics company doesn’t take any data in account when reviewing associates. When you make the company more than double than the next associate. How can you be rated below average.
bad,"Don't get sick, don't tell upper management what's wrong. Make sure you live in Florida and close to site that you can walk if needed. Training is nerve recking. You are written up while on phone during training. I've seen people loose their job 1 week in. Limited room to grow within the departments,will have to change. Should offer higher pay with the stress of the position and skills we must have"
bad,"benefits and flexibility disappeared once hired, no parking spot assigned in over a year, dishonest management eliminated position after illness despite assurances of security."
bad,The Managers don’t care about the employees.  The employees are simply numbers and replaceable.  This is the reason for the high turnover rate.  The working conditions are terrible.  The facilities are filthy.  There was literally feces on the bathroom walls which was left four days before being cleaned up.
bad,"Capital One uses a forced distribution model.   A certain percentage of employees are going to get a bad rating.   If you stay there long you will eventually land in the bottom.   It's a great place to work in your twenties but experience is not valued."
bad,"Management is absolutely horrible here, hardly ever helpful. When dealing with issues within the workplace HR is very slow to respond to any letters or notice's."
bad,"Not a great company to work.  No work life balance.  The leadership compare the team members constantly, with one another.  There is high expectation to reach a lot of bench marks."
bad,"Work environment is top of the market in the tools provided, office setup and benefits.  Talent calibrations are biased.  A great place to 'stop by' but not home if you are looking for a fulfilling career with a good company."
bad,"I worked in IT for over 17 years, twice as a full-time employee and three times on contract. It was much better for me on contract. They have a 12% annual forced performance management target, which is basically a cover for age discrimination. To meet this goal, many good employees are told that after years of solid performance they are suddenly not meeting expectations. Nice, huh? "
bad,"The culture was great with some people, but your manager could make or break it for you. I had a few great managers but they were great at shielding the team from the higher management and office politics that are rampant. Pay is way under market average for the position - and they vary year to year vastly and despite claiming they had no flexibility of starting salaries for the program I joined into, I had a new hire male making 20K more than my starting rate due to how he negotiated that he would be a great asset to the corporate basketball team. I wish I was joking. This example is a very common practice of favoritism, sexism, and politics that was present across the company."
bad,"They do not care about you or your goals, you are a number, a gear. and lord forbid you are a contractor, then you are truly the first to go on a whim."
bad,no comment to be given at this time. the company did a huge lay off with repo and customer service. job not secure enough for anyone to stay at all. n/a
bad,The company's management are not transparent.  The culture is certainly not one of the best around.  In fact there is much improvement needed.  Employees are not appreciated.
bad,Very stressful environment. Managers are very cut-throat.  It's not what you know its who you know in order to be promoted. I would never recommend anyone to work in this type of environment.
bad,"I worked on the US Card side for 5 years and loved my job, my manager and the people I worked with.  Made the wrong decision and took a job on the bank side, hoping for more opportunity - worst decision I ever made. There is no leadership, work/life balance is very skewed, and many broken promises around advancement."
bad,"Typical day is stressful."
bad,Not what they used to be.  Hidden agendas coupled with smoke and mirrors about your career options.  Superstar today and fired tomorrow when they decide to close your branch.
bad,"Capital One offers very competitive salaries and benefits; however, its drive and direction towards becoming a technology driven financial institution seems to have distorted its culture, core value, and compassion for its employees. Both as an employee and a customer, Capital One looks like lost its edge."
bad,"The security was hard because they wanted to make sure that customer's personal information was not compromised. Almost every day, I would get a customer that yelled at me because of money problems or charges not going through."
bad,They don't pay enough for the amount of work and stress you get from the customers. They grade most of your calls and expect goal to be met every time. Call volume is ridiculous.
bad,The culture at capital one is toxic.  It's all about stepping on team members and being boastful.  No one worth their weight there.  The most political and backstabbing place i have ever worked.
bad,"Capital one has the ability to be a great company, they are very generous to their employees. Perks aren’t anything to brag about but the benefits are the best I’ve seen thus far. "
bad,Job security is zero the department closed down and laid off 1100 people. Leadership was very weak and there was no knowledge of the business from management.
bad,"This is just my opinion, upper management is bad. That and the fact that totally unqualified individuals were put in management positions is a big reason by Capital One Home Loans is sunsetting it's business."
bad,"It's a very diverse culture and no matter what position you hold, you must upsell products and services. That created a non-personal touch relating to your everyday customer experience."
bad,"Loved the benefits, tons of stress and pressure. Used to work overtime and never compensated. Overlooked for management position. As an Assistant Branch Manger there was no support or job training for the next step."
bad,"No work life balance, you are expected to work 24/7 and even if you do a fantastic job you only get a middle-of the road performance review with a 1/% raise because you are expected to compete with everyone across the department and while working 50-60 hours a week just to get your assignments done you are expected to do something extra to get a better rating."
bad,The culture here is pretty cut-throat and competitive.  Managers are rotated to where you could have five managers in one year!  More interested in perceptions than actual output.
bad,"There is less of a partnership mentality in the Auto Division, certain levels of leadership have a chip on their shoulder when dealing with associates below their level."
bad,"working with a contractor in physical security and senior level management had no real idea as to what was proper and good for the position I was in."
bad,"Was a great place to work a decade ago, but the culture has become very negative.  Very cutthroat, back stabbing, etc.  Not a place that I would recommend anymore."
bad,If you want to get ahead by working hard and fixing things then DO NOT work here. Capital one is a corrupt political entity that incentivizes networking and making friends with executives and pidgen holes thouse who work hard and strive for actual results.
bad,"Good benefits but not the right place to work, Learned about the real estate management strategy, and hardest part is that, promoters cannot understand or differentiate between the loyal and the royal. They feel royal is loyal."
bad,"the center is always busy. the pay isnt great at all. too many calls not enough pay. i learned alot, the training came but the pay only increased by cents"
bad,"The company would be fine if it didn't hire incompetent managers that don't care about their employees, depending on which department you join you may have a good quality of work-life."
bad,"Traing was fun but stressful,lot of information"
bad,"You are really only considered valuable if you are hired at Associate or above, otherwise they pay you the bare minimum and you are unlikely to grow your career with them."
bad,Forced ranking rigged and a popularity contest and tilted toward younger workers. Company has to many check the box tasks that people just complete to get done but don't add any value like the monthly plan. Everyone spends hours to get done for sake of completion  but never use it or even look at it again.Company prided itself it seems on managing out older workers. My manager missed more work than the whole branch altogether.Always calling off or leaving early and became a joke to the team. That's not leading by example.
bad,not a fun place to work and targets for customers were high. no promotions. Not a fun place to work. Nothing to learn. coworkers were not helpful.
bad,"The management did not want to see any of there employees truly grow and succeed.  They are not family friendly. Set the same goals for all employees even if they were only part time employees, however only gave part time employees half the incentive pay that full time employees received."
bad,Capital one I loved working for. Im not one for bashing a company. Appreciate them giving me a job for the time they did before they got rid of me. More cons than pros the CEO is awesome management is poor. I was always shocked on how grudges were held on people. I would say this is a not a professional place to work for unless they quit getting rid of great employees that could help build the company and keeping managers that don't know what they are doing or losing. All i can say is God is in Control. So I'm happy looking for a new job the lord will keep us with work. So lets leave it at that.
bad,"Possibly depends on the branch but an average day at my branch is literally almost every worker dreading coming into the branch. It was not always this way, but we have recently acquired new management and authority and they have completely turned the moral in the bank upside down. Despite many complaints, HR does nothing for the associates; so we feel that anything that happens to us that is bad will be swept under the rug. It is an uncomfortable environment to work in. We are worked so hard to be rewarded with bad feed back constantly. We are put down constantly. Majority of the associates at the branch are on a conduct memo for absolutely no valid reason. If that is not enough of a red flag for what the managers are doing, I don't know what is. Our ABM is the worst. No leadership, always has an attitude, always finding a reason to put us in trouble for nothing, always mad, and very untrustworthy. The thought of working here has me crying as I type. Worst place of employment I've ever chosen."
bad,"I was a teller for 19 years, I loved the daily coming & goings of being a teller. My co-workers were the best, we were like a family. Until April 2014 when the new manager arrived & let us know she was the ""Hatchett Woman"""
bad,"fun and big resting areas, with lots of parking space. I was able to speak to people  in different states. Also I was able to talk to them about their personal info."
bad,"if you're any other ethnicity other then Caucasian, you will be fired as fast as you were hired. My advice stay clear of them!!! there turn over rate is 85% please stay away!!!!"
bad,"No good Communication, No equal Treatment, Bad Management, A lot of Workers left"
bad,"Depending on the branch you work, the environment you work in and who your manager is makes or breaks your experience at Capital One. I was in a super busy branch and management was horrible. Even the region manager was horrible. There is no regard for employees and my branch did a lot of things it wasn't supposed to. From what I hear, all the other branches are the same and there's no room for advancement no matter how hard you try. Even though my branch opens 100+ accounts every month, the back office only worries about referral numbers. So these regional idiots believe that a branch that opens 10-20 accounts with 250 referrals is more important then a branch that opens 100+ accounts and only has 50 referrals. Most bankers that open accounts don't even know how the interest rates work let alone tell a customer the necessary disclosures. I alone in my branch took over 200+ customers a day and they will only value a person who did a referral on the day."
bad,"Cap1 has Forced Review Rating Distribution. That means they must review so many as exceptional, normal & poor regardless of their actual rating. This leads managers to make decisions based on politics or older more secure personnel are more likely selected to be rated poor & managed out. This was first started in 2003 (class action suites filed & won). It is now active again."
bad,"Maybe it was the branch I worked at, but management was completely overbearing and controlling. At one point they told us we couldn't talk behind the teller line because customers may think we are talking about them. They made work tense and not enjoyable. I literally couldn't wait to leave when my shift was over. The compensation was poor and the raises were insulting. "
bad,"to many people they were giving job to that should've never been there "
bad,Very straining place to work. You give more to the company than you get in return.
bad,"It started out ok but the High Focus Department has a lot of favoritism so the only way to move up is to ""kiss up"" otherwise you have to find other avenues of getting the promotions you deserve. There's a lot required of you without receiving adequate compensation so if you come in the company via HF be sure to transfer ASAP"
bad,Typical work day at Capital One is a lot of policy changes with over bearing managers. No one is really on the same page causing confusion and a lot of loose ends with customers. I learned numerous systems as well as a lot of credit card insight. With all of free incentive programs to help you stay health and the free treats keep you balanced. The most difficult part of my job was reaching the outrage goals in this tough economy because you can be terminated for not doing so which makes u stressed and overwhelmed.
bad,Capital one in Irving sucks they try to rake your lunch and break away
bad,"my work experience was great at capital one, workplace culture was great as well, my manager was great to us. i would love to work at capital one again"
bad,"Apply through company instead of temp is a plus. The company treats the temps different than the actual employees. Depending on your direct sup. you could remain a temp for over a year, possible change various shifts through out the year also."
bad,"Capitol One has excellent compensation opportunities. They do a great job with giving back to the community, but need more diversity. Also, they should improve on their ability to accommodate those with disabilities."
bad,Great training process but completely different in the field.. Hard to move up in the company unless you know someone or are a favorite. I tried moving to back office and wasn't even considered. To many changes that it would mess up you initial flow of work. A lot of layoffs because of all the changes. I left before I became part of that group. Best thing about this job is their benefits. Worst part about this job is they made us write essays per customer. It became really annoying and if it wasn't enough of a novel management would come down on you hard. Aside from that the job was fairly easy.
bad,"great place to work on  cloud technology but career growth sucks."
bad,"At Capital One I have worked there a project manager, I spear heated the Agile sprint daily and managed risk communication. I also updated project plan and provided status update meeting."
bad,The culture is very immature. The company believes in turnover and each group is required to replace at least 10% of the workforce each year. It makes people very unwilling to team as it is a dog eat dog affair.
bad,"Contractors are worked hard and treated like second class citizens. Employees get the perks, contractors are excluded even from team activities, even those that are on site, in direct view of contract employees. Capital One is known for mass layoffs."
bad,Great opportunities to learn and benefits.  Toxic culture based on favoritism and knowing the right people.  The company message they sell you on makes it sound wonderful but unfortunately they stumble to execute.
bad,"Company lacks diversity within management and managers, at times, lose sight of caring for ""people"" . Business goals were top priority, as they should be, but proper training of people and proper compensation should follow. Look at anyone in upper management, absolutely no diversity or sign of any to come. The things they've done over the last year in efforts to downsize are inhumane."
bad,"Fast paced, micromanaged. Not many career opportunities,was too far of a distance for me to commute.high turnover rate. Very repetive. Constant ly taking calls and you could not be away from your work desk"
bad,"If you are an aspiring technologist, this would be a good pace to start, but do not anticipate making a career from this job. lately, the approach seems to be getting new talent in and do away with the existing employees. Great place to work if you can work upwards and be a slave driver"
bad,"There is no typical day at Capital One. This was one of the most enjoyable parts of working there. "
bad,Capital One is a good place to work and offers many opportunity to young associates. Each quarter they offer team outings with one quarter being dedicated to Volunteering
bad,"I quit a few short months before the Capital One Operations branch in Mattituck shut down. Workers were forced to get laid off or to relocate to Virginia. I learned a great deal about branch operations, but the income was not enough to support myself and my child."
bad,I have nothing to say. Because capital only care for the business not it employees. Which is very sad. I see employees for for them over 26yeas capital let them go
bad,"dont force people to provide feed back, I gave you random stuff, didnt even bothered to look at the questionnaires. ok so the he got her pregnamt. good bye"
bad,It is a newer bank. They change their minds as the wind blows. There is no loyalty. You can be the best employee and they will let you go to save a few dollars.
bad,"Capital One makes every candidate go through a grueling application and interview process, making each one believe that they are brilliant geniuses when they pass through. The job offer ends up being downgraded (if you were applying for a Senior Manager role, you get downgraded to Manager, Director becomes Senior Manager, etc.) for no real reason - and the salary they promise, especially the bonus, is not what you planned on, either. Everything salary and merit-related is completely arbitrary - they're hoping that their incredible health benefits package will make you want to join and be happy to stay in that exact position at that exact salary level for as long as possible."
bad,management needs to be more willing to teach rather than belittle new hires. needs a more detailed training class. better communication such as procedures to call in or get ahold of managers in case of emergencies
bad,The culture is very competitive and they employ a forced ranking system that is used by managers to play favorites and to get rid of employees who have been with the company too long.
bad,"Success depends on your manager.  Culture in other teams was good, just not in my group.  Would not recommend.  Promotion opportunities infrequent.  Divesting mortgage business cost hundreds and hundreds of jobs.  Enter at your own risk."
bad,"Overall if you considering working here, apply and give it a try you wont regret doing it, its excellent management and everyone wants you to grow and develop yourself."
bad,"Long hours, fun people but tight timelines and round the clock hours. If they weren't shut down I would have left anyway. Management was not good either."
bad,Team work is very important and they train everyone to follow the IT methodology.  I enjoyed working with them.  They have a wealth of information every team member needs to get things done.
bad,"This company will wear you out. Good people, good benefits. But not much to offer otherwise. Very stressful, very competitive, not supportive culture. Watch your back."
bad,I wouldn't recommend working here. It seems like they just hire anyone to work there. Its very stressful for the pay you get. I would look other places to work.
bad,"Filed complaint with HR and two people were disciplined.  Glad to be gone."
bad,"Great building, and benefits. Lack of advancement in capital one, pick favorite. Also poor management, when having an issue or poor coaching by your manager upper management don't assist."
bad,I felt Capital One's upper management was very unsatisfactory. I saw many colleagues get laid off and the manner in which proceed these lay offs were unethical.
bad,"Great benefits, great money, but stressful position. Stayed for money but left for a better work life balance. Did not care for upselling. Excellent training."
bad,"Overworked Highly liberal even tho they claim inclusive and diversity."
bad,"Absolutely not credit for hard work. Lot of free lunches, good 401k. Pay raise not good, start with good salary and negotiate. Not good management. No training"
bad,"If you were not in the ""in crowd"" there was no room for advancement and they did not respect privacy or understand how to promote a productive work environment."
bad,Management doesn't allow you to advance for their own selfish needs and when you address your concerns they find a way to let you go. They do not warn you about your PTO times so you lose job from that too.
bad,"None. I just come to work,  do my job and go home. Not a good environment . Nothing else to tell  we come to work,  do our job, and mind our business."
bad,"Micro-management, resistant to change, employees ideas ignored, lies from management. The pay is very low. Advancement potential very low. Managers typically hired college grads from outside with no experience. Very depressing. Would not go back."
bad,"Nationwide company attempted to implement Agile process yet was exceptionally dysfunctional and surprisingly conflicted with egos between depts. Exceptional time wasted between target assignments and depts. then unnecessary ""finger pointing"" when milestones not achieved."
bad,Company knows how to keep their employees interested in work. Always shows employee appreciation. I would recommend this for a entry level job or college graduate.
bad,I enjoyed working at Capital One but unfortunately my direct report felt we were not a good fit so I had to accept a compensation package.   I really wish that I had an opportunity to find another position at Capital One.
bad,Capital One is a fast pace customer service setting office stressful work incoming and outgoing calls very unprofessional people not a good place to workshopbeing underpaid at minimum wage for the type of work it wasn't worth it
bad,Take calls back to back with no time in between and constantly told by management you arent good enough. Stuck in a chair that makes my whole body hurt and they arent willing to make changes.
bad,"cool thing about the job is you can work from home so long as you maintain quality and amount of items worked per day. I had a great manager and then a really lame manager there and the lame one made my life miserable. Overall the management doesnt care about much so long as you hit your required numbers. Unfortunately while the overall atmosphere seems relaxed there is a lot of competition with ""favorites"". Basically you're either a favorite or your not. Majority of employees there are young individuals so the competition is steep because everyone is trying to make their mark. So it doesn't pay as much as other banks but they have some nice perks like snack days and leave an hour early on holidays- but once again if you're a favorite your benefits are a little different, you can show up late, flex your schedule, and in general take a 2 hour lunch break if you feel like it. there's a lot of good and a lot of bad at CapitalOne. if you need to get paid and benefits you can do that here. The employees are overall really nice people and I generally liked everyone and they liked me. The management is a complete shamble and change directions 360 degrees sometimes within an hour. So scattered managers that cant answer a straight question aside its a decent work environment."
bad,I wouldn't recommend this as a place to work if you have a life. This a very Demanding Job and too many moving pieces. It hard to keep up with your work load and  forces you to do overtime just to maintain.
bad,Very stressful and felt age discrimination. They want to have all young people work for the company. and they don't even know how to count money or take responsibility for savings bonds and any complicated work process.
bad,"Capital One was an amazing place to work until management started changing hands. It became hard to advance no matter your skill level. It soon became all about who you know rather than what you know. I had a horrible manager which ruined the dynamics of the team and environment. Its unfortunate because this was a great company to be a part of. If management is bad.. then you will have a lot of overworked, underappreciated employees."
bad,limited job advancement in mtl . the salary isnt great . the benefit is good at least. they move to parkex for cheaper location which is not convenient.
bad,"Pros"
bad,"Capital One is a wonderful company to work with but because of its fast paced changes, it is extremely difficult to keep up as due to Reorganization at a fast rate hinders your ability to prove as your managers change quiet often and they is always cut throat competition and your work style changes very frequently."
bad,Fun working environment with good coworkers but the frequent policy changes and team changes cause employees to leave which makes the turnover rate quite low.
bad,"Almost like a prison, very rigid and stuffy environment.  Too many family members working and getting promotions. Inexperienced managers promoted because of who they are related to."
bad,This job is very slow paced and has a high turn over depending on the location you are interested in. I recommend this position to any beginners. This would not be a career.
bad,"Performance ratings are directly tied to compensation and they have a minimum guaranteed low performers in each department. Meaning if you are in a 5 member team, then 1 member has to be rated low and placed on coaching plan even though everyone in group maybe excellent performers. This relates to the very high turnover rate."
bad,The benefits at this company were more than most companies around today. That is very important in today's world. I learned a lot of useful skills here and can take it forward with me in new ventures.
bad,"Throughout the day I was answering phone calls and I provided strong customer service and resolved customer issues."
bad,"They will write you up for anything. They won't write you up for going to the bathroom but they will write you up for leaving your seat. They will leave the part about going to the restroom out of the write up. If they are firing you, they will reach very far to write you up for everything that happened several weeks ago to add to the charges against you; even if it means they have to make incidents up."
bad,Capital one is a good company to work for but the management is the worst. They don't care about u at all. They threaten your job every chance the get.
bad,Bad management. Training not adequate. They don't spend money on infrastructure. Co-workers were shuffled around and customer's were not happy.
bad,"At this company when someone asks you to tell them what you think of something, make sure you only tell them what THEY WANT to hear.  ""Yes SIR, That's the most brilliant idea I've ever heard, SIR.  You're so smart.""  "
bad,Expectations are unrealistic. Company does not follow Agile or Six Sigma standard processes. They have made up their own version and its not uniform across the company. Leadership does not communication amongst each other or to associates. No diversity in the company...very apparent
bad,"Hires most employees contract labor.  Then when contract is up, they don't hire most of the temps and get new contract labors, to stop from paying benefits."
bad,"A typical day at work in the department I was in was stressful not only are you pushed to ""make the customer happy"" but you also have to meet your metrics. The policies don't line up with ""making the customer happy"" management is not at all worried about what you could possibly have going on in your personal life it's all about metrics. Being a front line agent means you have to rely the info that ""management"" has put in place while still making sure the customer is happy with your customer service. This place is your typical CALL CENTER the only benefit is the pay and the benefits."
bad,I was too ambitious coming from a previous bank that yielded me a higher position as a banker with more flexibility to handle accounts directly as an officer of the bank and a supervisor.
bad,Management is pretty bad. They don't care much about employees. They just care about numbers. The turnover at the bank is alot.
bad,A company that is all about the numbers. This is not a company that is too worried about developing talent but more worried about their bottom line.
bad,"Associates were ok,  but you definitely felt like an outsider as a contractor.  You had limited access to materials you needed on the intranet and it was difficult to get answers from associated via email.  I had a good three years there, but many other contractors did not."
bad,"A typical day will begin with the checking of my calendar before arriving in the building. I do a floor walk for the first hour, greeting my unit managers and associates. I engage in light conversations to help set a positive mood on the floor, compliment early birds and those with high NPS scores and welcome back those returning from sick leaves. I listen to my unit managers conduct start-of-day meetings. I check my emails for an hour. Proceeding to recruitment, I conduct business interviews if its early for meetings. A short trip to coffee shop then attend call calibrations followed by work stream or leader's meetings. More often, its lunch in the station while checking emails and setting coaching schedules. Remaining hours are spent doing touch base or observe coaching with unit managers. At the   tail end making follow through on sub workstreams for up coming engagement events and timekeeping update."
bad,"I would consider the department I worked in (Office of Executive Resolutions) to be somewhat of an anomaly within the company, so the information in my review may not be relevant to other non-exempt positions within Capital One. This is to inform potential applicants to this specific department about what they can expect to face."
bad,"Working for this company was hard work for fair minimal pay. It was a lot of long, unsociable hours and you needed to be willing to to be out working in all types of weather!"
bad,"I worked billing disputes and talked to customer's about their disputes.  I worked the second part of billing disputes, when the merchant provided the information.  I learned a lot about disputes and how to make the customer know that we were their advocate during this sometimes difficult process."
bad,"Don't work there. Promotions are random, managers don't have a clue how to manage people, and the culture is overly competitive."
bad,"Capital One is quickly assuming it's place as a midcap market leader for home mortgage lending.This comes with it's challenges, in particular vast number of systems used but is also not without it's rewards.  The Plano, TX campus is situated in a very clean, park-like setting and employees enjoy a work environment similar to a university campus rather than a large corporation."
bad,"I worked for ING Direct, which shortly after became engulfed by Capital One. Initially, not much changed in 2013. The customers were the same and I wasn't hassled by management to sell additional products. My job was still awesome. "
bad,Intersting especially calling customers that do not want to be ccontacted
bad,"Not many shifts were offered for this position. I worked a 4/10 schedule Mon, Thurs-Sat from 6am-5-pm with Sun, Tues, and Wed off. I was also in school part time during this going there Mon-Fri 5:30-9:30pm in which I did tell my recruiter prior to getting the position. I had slight adjustments to this schedule for a little bit but only because I was down to my last hopes when I was at a position of losing my financial aid because I was not getting to school on time and my work schedule was adjusted to leaving at 4:30pm VS 5pm cutting my lunch into a 30min one VS 1hr. I enjoyed my co-workers dearly but my manager was a very hard person to work with. He was all about the numbers understanding that's his position but managers should have a sense of humanity as well since he is managing people not computers. The stress of that and everything else this company weighs down on their employees eventually had me on edge and crying almost every week. Great benefits but not worth the high stress."
bad,"employee don't get end of year  bonuses.over work employees, use a a lot of paper for a company that is supposedly going green."
bad,"Work with lots of smart people but is a culture of low emotional intelligence. Overly competitive, aggressive work environment. Culture is very self-promting, pompous - they believe their own hype and drink their own kool-aid. Single-minded in goals and tasks. Management gives little direction or encouragement for advancement.  Is not committed to a diverse workforce - hires people similar to themselves. The nature of the work sometimes puts you in morally compromising positions."
bad,"personally there is too much favoritism between managers and workers, there is no team there is separation amongst bankers and tellers.. no career advancement"
bad,"it was fun talking with different people, i learned alot of call centers and credit cards. co workers were fun"
bad,"A lot promises were broken once Capitol One, N.A. took over Chevy Chase Bank. Short there after a lot of jobs were lost by Capitol One shutting down the Laurel Mortgage Office."
bad,"Offered a lot of overtime which made up for the lack of decent pay, I learned a lot about the industry and to read terms and agreements and ask questions about stuff I don't understand. Poor training, hard to locate information when needed, and found that other departments really didn't want to take calls when you needed to transfer because it was an issue you could not assist with, and upper level reps who pushed back also liked to complain. Do not take a job as a csr if you cannot be empathetic or sympathetic to customers who cannot take accountability for their own mistakes. you will have a hard time earning incentive. "
bad,"From a business standpoint this is understandable, but don;t make too much money or they get rid of you Q-U-I-C-K."
bad,"Spearhead projects including the development of new a co-brand credit card, and handled multiple aspects including: design of value proposition, and negotiations related to merchant pricing for a foreign airline to launch in the United States. Conduct analysis on pre-approval campaign for contractor market in the US, leading a large direct mail campaign. Directed efforts to create a revolving financing product line and merchant pricing for a powersports OEM by segmenting customers by product line and by creditworthiness. Oversaw a team to create in-depth studies and to identify strategic initiatives to increase revenue and customer acquisitions through various channels across two portfolios yielding more than $160 million in revenue. Direct the implementation of a Marketing Metric Report, to analyze the results of various marketing efforts and identify new business opportunities."
bad,review customer credit card accounts and monitor for fraudulent activity.
bad,The only constant regarding this company is the expectation for change. Down sizing/consolidation is a regular happening.
bad,"A work day at capital one bank would be to meet and greet customers, open accounts, establish a relationship with the customers, make referrals for mortgages and insurance as well as investments. I learned to listen and uncover hidden needs for customers. The best part about the job was my co-workers, we motivated each other to make our goals"
bad,"A typical day at work was to be at work at 8am, sign in to the phones and start making outbound calls to collect on charged off accounts."
bad,"Lots of analysis and lots of learning in a single day. coworkers are a group of very intelligent guys, so the peer to peer KT is vast."
bad,"Not an easy and accepting place for professional hires. Analytic driven, slow decision making. Cold colleagues and work environment."
bad,"I was hired as a part time teller and was working 40+ hours a week without the benefits. My co workers were good, and management was nice to you if you sucked up to them. They were also selective about who they liked and didn't like. One employee made a mistake and got fired right away...when a favored employee made the same mistake, he wasn't even talk to about it. They acted like it never happened. The training was fun but after that i didnt enjoy working there at all."
bad,Group of people works well and very honest. Would work there again.
bad,I worked for Hibernia National Bank (now Capital One Bank) for 20 years. I had surgery just before Hurricane Katrina and was not able to return back to work in November so they terminated me.
bad,There are 2-3 generally well-meaning leaders that due to ego and temperament  make it hard to succeed. It is a bit of a good old boys club that plays favorites. Passive-aggressiveness is in full force. You’ll rarely see the attacks coming. Employees are annually force-ranked against one another. Told they are all Olympic athletes but only a handful can win medals and the rest need to rise up or get off the team. CYA rules the day. Lots of talk of innovation and change but little of that happens
bad,"Musical chairs, everyone is pretending to be friendly while trying to get ahead of the person beside them. Team really means ""me"". Overly sensitive individuals that aren't allowed to think for themselves."
bad,The pay is good but the job itself sucked and the managers and PAs let the customers abuse you and then will fire you for being human. Unless of course you kiss the butt..they love you then
bad,"Capital One is an ever changing landscape where what was in yesterday is out today. There is no job security at this company. Upper management changes often, and philosophies and culture as well. What was regarded as highly desirable changes with every new management shakeup. The culture is one of employees always covering their back and only looking out for one's self. Collaboration is talked about but with the dynamics of the company of no job security, this stifles true collaboration. Capital One is always looking for the latest technologies and those who possess experience in these technologies. Being flexible and keeping up with newer technology is highly desirable."
bad,This company is not worth the stress or headaches that comes with it. The only fun thing about capital one that you will enjoy is the team outings other then that not worth it.Capital One has really changed from back in the day.
bad,Management was unwilling to change to make the program work. None of the job roles were well-defined. We were worked quite hard and things like the snack cart were not worth the overtime or weekends lost. The work-life balance was not good and the systems we used were also not designed for the type or amount of work they expected.
bad,Management wants to be hands off and let the lower staff make decisions for the branch. Often short staffed and overworked. At least you will get your workout in running from the drive thru to the lobby.
bad,If you're an exempt employee there is no support via HR. I was an employee for 16 years and never had I experienced what I endured for the last 2 years. Very disappointed.
bad,"Fortunately the manager I had while at Capital One is no longer with the company. The poor rating comes from Management Actions such as blaming me for failures in the onboarding process (blamed me for not having the team email box installed on my workstation within 3 weeks of starting. Note: no documentation or process to follow were issued and I constantly asked the onsite lead if there were any additional actions I could take to start working). This is just one example of nearly a dozen of belittling and demeaning actions taken by the manager that forced me to submit my 2-week notice after only 3 months making nearly $100k you still couldn't pay me enough to continue under the level of disrespect I experienced. Hopefully, different management would make for a better experience."
bad,"I don’t know how other depts are ran but refi funding is the absolute worse experience. It’s a CALL CENTER. If you’ve been a Funder in the auto/ mortgage industry or at any other company, run from this. It will definitely not be what you are used to doing. This is considered an entry level job. So Bachelors degree people, you will come in making the same as someone with no degree. It pays $18 an hr. There is no bonus. You will make millions of dollars but only get $18 when competing companies make more and/or have a bonus structure. Yes, Cap One has a slide and bikes and fun days but that does not pay my bills. Mgmnt doesn’t care and when requested getting a bonus, they told us that we need to find somewhere else to work in the company that provides bonuses and that we knew what we signed up for. Incompetent mgmnt that doesn’t know how to do their job. Disrespectful co workers who freely disrespect each other and mgmnt. Drama. Drama. Drama. It’s high school all over again. Remember it’s a call center. It’s really negative and morale is very low. You can tell people are not happy. Moving around in the company won’t be as easy as you think. Overall, it’s an ok company far as benefits but in this particular department, don’t waste your time."
bad,"Great benefits and decent pay. You get stuck in one department with hardly any transferable skills to move up or even laterally. If you don’t come in and just scream the mission of the company, you will lose your job."
bad,"There was an employee stealing during my employment, I reported her but nothing was done. Management told me that the cameras only face the customers."
bad,"Retail banking is dying and Capital One is fully embarrassing it while giving their employees the short end of the stick. If anything the online sector stays, but doesn't help those working within a branch. They cut numbers and branches but refuse to really up the pay after making things indefinitely more strenuous for those who are left. In our district turn over is massive. It's a shame, a place that once had decent culture and promise ends up like this."
bad,I did not like having to sale credit cards to people I knew were about to get themselves into debt as they would be unable to pay back. This is not integrity.
bad,"Capital One promotes a work/life balance but once you become a salary employee that changes. Promotions are very politically based on your relationships with management versus your actual work ethic. The culture at the site is amazing, co workers became family members, but if you are looking to get promoted, it is more about who you know."
bad,"The company is just way too big, IT has been outsourced so they are useless, and everyone is too overworked to train new people.I would advise against working for them, I also saw constant layoffs and restructuring. This caused departments to lack any direction and the workers are browbeaten for it."
bad,"Incentive rates change so often that it's difficult to see a consistently decent pay for giving world star customer service, even after receiving outstanding positive customer surveys. Prepare for random layoffs for nearly anything under the sun."
bad,"Capital one does not do a very good job of retaining talent. They are very political when it comes to providing advancement opportunities from within. They promote in an effort to increase their survey scores and rarely promote, or give opportunities for to the best candidates available.  They hide behind ""incivility"" and benefits but their pay is not competitive with the market, and unless you ""know"" someone you will not be given an opportunity to develop or advance."
bad,"I experienced unethical practices during the last few years at Capital One, created a case with Associate Relations, and it was swept under the rug.  My overall experience was good, especially at the start of my career.  However, I'm disappointed in the way my exit was handled and would never work for them again."
bad,"Management would want you to work a lot of overtime and half of the time if you tried to leave at your regular time they would want to fire you , go figure right ? Every ten minutes you would get a call saying what floor are you on or want to know what you are doing . It’s like you couldn’t go to the washroom with out have to ask if you can go !"
bad,"Its ok depending on department and who your manager is. Like all companies there all always managers who are good, mixed with ones that should have never been in that role."
bad,Want you to do everything without being taught on job.  Show favoritism to friends. Great pay and benefits. Work very hard for the money and Benefits.
bad,If they cant find a legit reason to release you from work they will fire you for something that should only be training worthy. Run at all cost do not enter.
bad,company culture has been changed. no professionalism.  too many groups and lot of dependency on other teams. lot of political drama. no one knows what they are doing.
bad,"I loved working from home and the associates.  However, I was hired under false pretense.  The only way to get promoted is to move across the country."
bad,"I am only completing this review because it is a mandatory component of the registration process.  "
bad,"...the management in the department of recoveries had their own agendas on how to run 'their"" department. apart from the rules and regulations of company policy. The Funny thing is all the mangers followed the same protocol. Until I started having issues with a manager , and one manger actually told me to look for another because thts just the way it was. So good thing I moved away because the last 5 months of working there turn in a nightmare. This company needs to have some internal affairs employees investigating these situations are not fired these people but send them to a retreat on team building."
bad,"Relaxed and collaborative work culture"
bad,"No work life balance or security. Hours change frequently turning employees lives upside down.  Layoffs are frequent at a minimum once a year."
bad,Was seeing if a marketing was for me - this was a self employed role attending venues and marketing monthly donations to charity representing. Only paid when people signed up. Discovered this was not my cup of tea & decided to leave.
bad,Departments do not communicate well with one another.  Seemed grossly mismanaged.  A typical day would mostly include meetings and very little time to do work.  The communication between departments is non-existent.
bad,"would not recommend no room for advancement. Workplace environment would have been decent if not for the culture and negativity. work hours and life balance was great, many opportunities for overtime."
bad,"I was terminated because my phone calls were on average 30 seconds slower than what they desired. When I found out my mother had cancerous cells in her body, I was told not to let my ''excuses'' distract me at work. I sat next to two brand new employees who required a lot of assistance, and since my manager was never available, it fell to me to assist them in their phone calls. This was not taken into consideration when they fired me just a few weeks before Christmas out of the blue, with no prior indication that my job was in jeopardy.( In fact we had just done a goals for 2018 meeting, which made my termination even more surprising) On paper the benefits, pay and environment seem too good to be true, that's because it is. If your going to apply for this job I urge you to have a contingency plan in place. Because you could be a great employee for them one month, and gone the next. The most dehumanizing job I've ever had."
bad,The job would've been better if they was open with employees to let them know you might not have a job due to opening new locations..... Over all the food was good!
bad,"management micro manages employees, no real job security, work life balance extremely low although its 1 of the core values. Benefits are great when you can use it"
bad,"C1 is laying off individuals either through small redeployments or rigged out performance management scenarios to get rid of experienced associates.  If you are under 35, enjoy it, the place is great."
bad,"Terrible Management, people are forced to present resignation. Managers have no idea what coaching is about. Bias administration. Lower level associates are blamed about bad higher level decisions."
bad,"This place is full of people who like to be involved in a clique. There is too much socializing and not enough working. This makes the workplace feel like you shouldn't take it seriously, because you are surrounded by gossip and attention to details that guide you away from the current task/goal."
bad,"I spent several years in the company, the company is good for career growth, and providing a myriad of different opportunities throughout the company."
bad,Fraud department starting pay sucks not enough to make a living off of it. Great place if you all just need a job and not concerned about the money. Don't have to talk to too many customers over the phone which is a plus
bad,"Nice place to work.  Pay is good if you're hired externally for a management position.  They like to hire from within so salaries stay low.  So, if you're a good fit, promotion from entry-level to manager is relatively easy but you will never make nearly as much money as your pears who were hired into a manager role."
bad,They need to be less robotic and wok on their people skills. I wanted to learn but they were always in a stressed team building which had no flow. I wish them all the best
bad,"Don't believe the hype. Just like any other corporation. They do not care about employees. Managers lack training and leadership skills. Treat their Temps/Contractors horribly.  Difficult to get promoted even if you are a stellar employee, very political."
bad,The overall flexibility provided is as promised. Fun environment to work in but has room for growth and improvement. Compensation structure isn't as promised and more scrutiny should be applied to new hires.
bad,"-I learned that the job is extremely sales driven and they want you to pressure customers into products if you are unsuccessful you get in trouble."
bad,"Management needs to listen more to their employees, try to have more advancement within their departments, because a lot of times there are employees who get stuck in their  positions because of the  lack of opportunities in the company.  Also because ING Direct was acquired by Capital One advancement to different positions are practically impossible."
bad,"I am so happy that I left Capital One. There are  a lot of politics in the office, and the mangers are not qualified(in terms of both job required skills and management skills). I feel much happier at my current work."
bad,"I loved my job and co-workers but lately I've been stressed there because of all the changes.  My duties changed because my immediate supervisor was transferred and I had to take on her duties and still do my job.  I've learned to check my attitude because I have a very expressive face.  What I enjoyed most was my customers, they loved me!  The hardest part was getting customer referrals.  I'm not a salesperson and that was what my job was becoming more and more about."
bad,Working in the banking part of Capital One when it was first entering the banking side of the business was smooth and organized. Did not work there long as most of my position was under the previous owner.
bad,"Typical day at work is managing money and assisting customers"
bad,Experience is very team / leader dependent.  You could end up in a good / bad team.  The forced rating curve does not promote real team-work - it is very superficial.
bad,"A typical day was about customer service when I first started with the bank.  Over the last few years the focus changed to sales.  The bank talked ""customer service"" but walked ""sales"".  Tellers were expected to referral every customer they could to a banker.  Over time the rapport with the customers was not as relaxed because they knew we would try to refer them.  Some of our regulars started using the drive up to avoid the ""sales pitch"".  The teller staff worked well together, despite the management.  The management was less than stellar.  They knew how to badger, but not how to lead or inspire."
bad,If you want to be in high school environment where people lie and cheat  and get away with it then work here. They terminate people for struggling but dont for cheating? If you want equality dont work here.
bad,"No encouragement for growth or advancement. highly disappointed, would not advise anyone to consider."
bad,not a good company if you are looking for advancement opportunities
bad,"Enjoyable environment, excessive hours, and work life balance challenges."
bad,"You take calls ALL day long, assisting people with any PC, printer, network, connection, soft/hardware issues etc. creating a ticket for each call. If you resolve the issue you can close the ticket, and In the event that you cant get it resolved you escalate a ticket to the proper handling group or find someone who had the knowledge and know how, to fix the problem."
bad,Management was unorganized and bad handling of employee's layoff.
bad,"management never knew how to mange, thinks always changed, some for good and some for the worst"
bad,Hectic work environment
bad,"asssist customers with their accounts and cash checks,deal with customers personality, and assoicates"
bad,"A typical day begins at 8 am, to 4.30, begin with taking calls from customers regarding their account Learn the valves of connecting with customers, and making them feel that they are not just numbers. The management is alright, they could be more honest to associate, well as with any thing in life there are going to be problem, but everyone has to deal with. Helping customer, and been with coworker."
bad,"I had such a terrible experience with Capital One Bank. I was there during the conversion from Chevy Chase Bank. It was sad how some Managers still tried to run the branch as if it was still Chevy Chase Bank. Even the experienced representative from Capital One who trained us all during the conversion was annoyed with the branch managers because they were trying to tell him how to do his job, telling him the he didn't know how things were run here."
bad,The lack of communication and how they treat their contractors isn't appealing.
bad,"Maintain excellent knowledge of Bank systems and procedures in order to perform necessary maintenance to customer’s accounts in a timely and accurate manner, including; lost/stolen checks, ATM/credit cards, stop payments and bank transactions."
bad,"In my particular department, the work was production focused which means meeting metrics. The work is very easy however management does not assist or provide feedback to encourage growth within the company. Department morale was mediocre. The benefits are great, and amazing and with a schedule that works for you there is potential to create a career there."
bad,overworked and litte room for advancement. I would not recommend to anyone unless you want to go into management. there are better opportunities for managers then there are for other employees.
bad,"Direction company is going leaves little to no room for career opportunities on the branch level. All roles have been consolidated to 2 roles (branch ambassador and market manager). Responsibilities have been distributed among the Branch Ambassadors to perform all branch operations and at times manager duties. Market managers have been required to manage multiple branches which leaves certain branches with no guidance at times. Benefits offered (4 weeks PTO, 12 holidays, and health insurance) is the major incentive for seasoned employees to stay. Compensation is not competitive or enough for all the duties expected. Within my 2 years of employment with Capital One, the company has eliminated many roles on a branch level as well as services the company offers. Over 1000 employees have been laid off from departments in home mortgage, financial advisors, to market/branch managers. With the exception of branch managers these positions/services are no longer offered at Capital One. Office politics rise high even on a branch level due to the new performance review system. Popularity is the new tool used to determined your yearly review. This system is based on your ability to get your name outside your ""four walls"" regardless of how great you perform in branch. Every opportunity associates will look to neglect their true work assisting customers so they can work on their ""skills"" they want to develop across the market. This job is ideal for those attending college or looking for a resume gap filler. Recognition will be given via email, certificates, or verbal praise, however pay will"
bad,Management makes decisions based on personal feelings. The job was very stressful. They changed our hours to 10 hour days with no chance for rebuttal.
bad,"The store manager treated people differently based on their colors /races ( I feel so bad to say this, but it is true), he made fun of people's English accent and disrespected customers who couldn't speak English well. I don't think this is the Capital one's problem, but he was one of the store managers who were representing Capital one. How could customers like this branch if the branch has a really horrible manager?"
bad,You have to work very hard and advancement opportunities can be limited. Some managers are great but there are some that are terrible to their employees. The team work environment is one of the most enjoyable part of working for this organization.
bad,"In my experience Capital One is quite political. If you are on the right team with the right connections and influence, things are good. If not, people who are better positioned will maneuver to marginalize people they see as a threat to competing with them to make significant contributions. This situation is inflamed by a performance review process that encourages people to do things to stand out. But it results in many people trying to solve the same problem and instead of cooperating, competing to beat each other out, not on the merits of their solution, but on the power of their political/organizational influence. I have seen a number of good people leave because they are frustrated that they are not allowed to contribute to their full potential."
bad,I was initially impressed by Capital One from the outside looking in. The community involvement was a nice selling point but once I came on board I realized the culture that is depicted is not true across the board. No diversity in leadership. Management has little to no say in decisions being made. There are a lot of politics being played.
bad,"The Agile practice compelled teams to achieve certain velocities.  The predictable result was teams gamed the system to stay green.  Transparency was punished.  Management was fixated on waterfall style metrics, to the detriment of making teams better.  The metrics always gave the desired answer.  My Agile lead was a PM with zero experience.  The SAFe transformation team seemed to have lost their way.  Capitol One at this point had a reputation for axing people and/or entire teams without warning.  The talk was Agile, but if you looked at SAFe Core values or the Lean Agile principles, they were not in evidence.  This was 2014, I hope they have improved since."
bad,High turnover of Management - a few awesome managers. Great benefits over any company out there; Different locations vary greatly in what is offered..
bad,"Captial one recently changed all employees to ""branch ambassador"" role. The company expects all employees to be able to do everything in the branch. In theory, it could be helpful to clients but the branches are ALWAYS short staffed. The company let go of about half the company back in June. Then expects the remaining staff to pick up the slack without raises. The only employees to get raises are part time tellers. So part time tellers are now making the same or more than full time employees. No appreciate for the employees."
bad,"There is a natural tendency for all corporations to drift away from the principles it's founded on because it's impossible to both become the one calling the shots and stay in touch with the real issues that people face in the new atmosphere that your arrival creates. "
bad,"They are an AWS shop so one can learn Cloud better over there.Jobs are always at risk coz of their layoff strategies.One is always at risk to save his skin , so lot of dirty politics .Will never ask anyone to join this company."
bad,"Capital One started out as a great place to work. Excellent benefits, great PTO for part time and full time employees. Lots of support from upper management and just an overall secure feeling. Then June 2018 hit. MASSIVE lay-offs across the board. I understand businesses do this sometimes but the reason Capital one did it was to go forward with this ""Brand Associate"" type role. Everyone does the same thing within the branch. Which seems great right ? Wrong. How can you move to a better position if they've gotten rid of all of them all? How do you differentiate between individuals if they want to grow in their career? Then you have what they call a Market Executive ( District Manager) come to the branch where everyone is still reeling from these layoffs and tells you he cant really promise you a job by next year. Horrible way to work. I would not recommend this company to ANYONE."
bad,"If you don't get in a rotation program, forget about being promoted. Lack of management, and your coworkers will likely be about 10 years younger than you on average if coming from the outside. "
bad,Company always making changes and may not be for the good. Great value statement but not lived in all areas of the company. Leaders not all on the same page so they are hard to follow. Finding and keeping strong talent always difficult.
bad,"Not recommend to friends. Lot of work place politics. Rather than focusing on work will focus more on undermining people."
bad,"It is a great place for tech folks to learn their ropes as the management is very encouraging for adapting new technologies. But job security is very low as management makes drastic tech decisions every few months which often causes massive layoffs and entirely jeopardizes the tech strategies and causes everyone to start from zero. The calibration sessions also cause mandatory 10-15% layoffs every year. You can join as a short term destination and get your tech skills upped, but don't consider this to be a long-term workplace. In the current scenario neither the company itself nor the employees expect anyone to work there for more than 3-4 years at the most at a stretch."
bad,"The big emphasis in IT at Capital One is to innovate.  The only people who are rewarded are the ones who create the new bright and shiny ideas, with no appreciation or recognition for those doing a great job of keeping the business running.  Very little thanks given once a deadline is met, even when the product is highly successful.  Performance evaluations are highly dependent on your manager, not your actual performance, since there is a forced ranking.  The organizational structure is endlessly changing, which means your job role is also constantly shifting (not necessarily in the direction you would choose)  On the plus side, most positions provide an opportunity to work from home when needed, and there are a lot of amenities available depending on your office location.  They also make it relatively easy to move around within the company if you find an opening."
bad,No good if u have a disability   and being new to the company makes u outsider  treated as so.  I had anxiety everyday I had to work.   I was called  names n yelled at daily n pick on n Miss treated  felt as if I was being  bullied by  my coworkers.
bad,"I only worked part time and it was very difficult to move to full time.  The pay was extremely poor.  The focus on sales made employees seem almost like robots. The force of trying to get sales made the customer experience unpleasant, always being hassled to get some new product."
bad,"The company lacked many aspects of a good organization. The quality of top management and HR practices were very mediocre. "
bad,"Working here could have been better. Communication between management to the front line lacked tremendously and was far from tactful. There was also extreme turnaround so they are always shorthanded. No matter how hard you worked or went above and beyond in what your job title required, it was never enough, acknowledged, or appreciated. I will say however that they do provide great training to do your job which will allow you to gain the experience needed to move onto something better."
bad,Terrible managers who are only in it for themselves. Zero care for employees. Job itself is fine. Pay is good and benefits are better. Only complaint was terrible management.
bad,"Its an okay place to work. Job security and advancement fluctuates alot. Not much stability. Its not what you know but who you know, in order to move up and stay within the company. Management team can be shady so it can use a serious upgrade!"
bad,"You expect issues from the customers but I learned you can never satisfy either the customers our your managers. Most of managers didn't have any experience on the phones so they would never know what you were going through but were quick to tell you what to do and when they were placed on the phones for a short time they would freeze up, ask you what to do, or even dodge taking calls. The culture is great. The hardest part of the job is not being able to fix a customers issue even though you know you can since it is out of your power. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with and some of the customer or knowing you have scheduled time in your bucket but you can't use it for months because all the time is blocked off and you have an emergency and your job is on the line."
bad,"Cons:"
bad,"it not what you know, but who you know type of organization. you not graded on your work performance but who you network with."
bad,"Good place to work but no jobs opportunities. Great people, great hours for any lifestyle. They have nice party and events for their employees"
bad,"No matter what you do, it is never correct. They only focus on the one tiny negative when there are other accomplishments that any other company would praise. Management is completely wrong. The only way to get a promotion is to be a snitch and push the blame onto others."
bad,"Not the best move that I made, but I could have done worse. Not what they described the job to be. No support from management. Absolutely no room for growth."
bad,"Starting with the company in 2012, the management was great the environment was amazing. As the company started to inquire more businesses that all left with the more work that they added to our plates. The company has forgotten about its employees and how we are the front line of the business. Personal development and self success is a figure of the past and unless you have had the chance to network yourself and work outside the business its hard to get anywhere."
bad,"Taking care collections, and helped with computer issues for the department. I learned how to fix computers, fix printer issues and help customers with their technical issues."
bad,"Great Company to work for, however communication between mangers and representatives could have been better. This also depended on the manager you had as well as their willing to listen and resolve and issue. Was fortunate to have an manager who would communicate, things were seen one way and that was his way."
bad,"High call volume call center working in the dispute department was like clock work i would deal with irate,confused,polite and, entitled customers on a daily basis from main stream clients to high value customers with credit lines from $300 - $40,000 plus. If customers had any issues with a purchase made on their Capital One credit cards whether product or services we would educate and emphasize with our customers on the possibilities we have for them and their rights swell as ours to properly file a dispute to regain proper services rendered or a possible refund or understanding of the charge and/or service that needs to be provided. The co-workers are in most cases pleasant to work with and it was a very diverse place to work. Hardest part of the job at times was helping the customers understand the situation and what capital can do due within our policies as well as Visa and Mastercards policies also. Most enjoyable factor working there would probably be the day to day situations that we can actual solve for the customers."
bad,"I was able to advance my career; however, this was 20+ years ago. While I worked, I learned the technology of computers. Managers however, were not very helpful. The hardest part of the job was to go in everyday knowing I would not move up any further, once I went from customer service to IT related work."
bad,"If you have never heard the phrase ""Herding Cats"", I am certain it conjures up the correct image as you chuckle from the image it portrays!  I found people did not share pertinant information and still other employees, including managers, did not know of new processes or of changes that had been in place for 6 months or longer. Information was not shared openly or consistantly. Most of my time at this organization was spent doing reports and learning of process changes or explaining process changes.  It was common to insert the same weekly reporting information into 3 or 4 different reports.  As a Project Manager, I can see why so many PMs have failed in the past.  Human resource constraints was common, reporting was extremely redundant, and activity performance was slow and with no repurcussions of low or no activity within a project.  However the PM's were expected to close the project within budget and time frame every time.  If you can fit in quickly with the social click and perform at an OK level, you will do well here.  However if you have high expectations of your project team and want to run a tight ship, this environment is not for you."
bad,"I have worked here for awhile now and the company goes out of their way to provide the associates with incentives. It is great that anytime there is a client contest they find a way to include the employees. Working the office though, the managers are not knowledgeable about the positions, there is little support for associates in their roles, and it is a game of favorites."
bad,"A typical day at CAP 1 was just routine collection.  "
bad,"I was responsible for the teller staff, including performing and assisting in customer transactions, customer service complaint resolution and escalation, scheduling, operational compliance, reconciliation of bank vault and teller drawers, ATM replenishment and settlement, engaging in peer conference calls, staff meetings, and sales incentive promotions."
bad,The best part about this job is that the managers are down to earth people.
bad,"It's been nearly 14 years since I've worked at capital One so things may have changed. Many years ago they layed off a significant portion of their Tampa workforce and did so under very shady circumstances. So defintely, beware of what you are getting into."
bad,• Assisted in opening and closing bank.
bad,Job was very repititive and was hard to advance within company. Had good benefits and enjoyed the team activities that were always going on.
bad,Poor management. Capital one switches managers very often which makes it hard to get to know a manger. Capital one makes it hard to grow within the company.
bad,"The job paid well, especially for a student in college. However, the culture felt forced and there was little time to build rapport with coworkers. Overall, a good experience."
bad,"---A typical day of work was very fast paced."
bad,"Capital One is still trying to figure out what kind of bank it wants to be.  Branch staff tends to suffer for it. Once they figure out what kind of bank they want to be, then they will need to revise how they Manage on a Branch level.  Branch Managers have need of leadership development."
bad,"Unless you like schmoozing,get your skills building here and move on."
bad,Good customer services. I was the top teller with most referrals. We had a good teamwork. The hardest part of the job was the referral to open accounts and
bad,"My manager was a man hater and had several hr reports against her including from me, she would hire her friends while I was still part time. I eventually was wrongfully terminated. But they paid me!"
bad,"Capital one and the management Empowers individual thinking, centered around team building.  Relaxed and challenging environment.  Rewards hard work with bonuses."
bad,"Capital One views its employees as liabilities, not assets. It has closed several office campuses and outsourced the jobs of hundreds of employees at a time when the company was already highly profitable."
bad,"They try very hard to come across as a fun, hip place, with their open floor plans, ping pong tables, hashtags on the wall, ""Capital One"" specific lingo, etc.  But none of that is a substitute for talent and efficiency.  If anything, it's a hindrance.  "
bad,Capital One wouldn't have been bad except I had several co workers in management that did not have management or people skills.  I found hr violations and extreme poor people skills.
bad,"All for one not one for all. Management super selfish. Fired me without noticed, didn't find out the reason until unemployment hearing all because of a miscommunication on my time card that could have easily been fixed. I was Capital One for 5 years as a top performer. I had a great reputation with the company after winning a prestigious award. That went down hill once I transitioned into Investing which is banking. They underpay their non-licensed and licensed associates. Management in investing also offer broken promises to help non licensed get their series licenses, while licensed associates are named ""supervisors"". While the the supervisors are on the phones they often dream about eventually being financial advisers for the company since that was their original job offer. Now its currently a goal for them to be that at another company. Overall Capital is a great company to work for and I built great relationships and learned new culture aspects through the working environment at my previous department."
bad,"It is good to work, friendly environment,daily meetings , learned how to manage the the team.good health benifits, large amounts if testing as the hardest part in the work"
bad,"Working for Capital One is awesome for the most part, benefits and salaries are above and beyond your norms. They want to make banking human again, focus on Diversity and Culture."
bad,"I worked at this company for nearly 2 years in the fraud department in the evenings as a part time associate. Being 23 years old, working every Friday night gets old. They did not care about work/life balance and continued to feel that individuals needed to stick to a set schedule rather than having a flex schedule."
bad,"worked for this company for 6yrs, then was racially proifiled and terminated. Had to file lawsuit with EEOC!"
bad,"Amazing on benefits, salary and work/life balance. However, terrible on job security and advancement. Also, mid-management is terrible lifers that have zero knowledge of strategy and implementing new processes."
bad,"login to the phone system where everything you do is monitored and scored even ""break times"" split day off so made it hard to plan vacation or time off.  The bonus was nice when it happened difficult to attain."
bad,"I started with Capital One in Retail Banking as a Sr. Inbound Rep and was eventually promoted to a Sr. Coordinator in Auto Finance. I eventually was fired after the company reviewed my personal credit card payments and weren't happy that I had fell behind - but that's what happens when you're paid far behind industry standards. I struggled the entire year that I worked for Capital One, so I do not miss it. "
bad,"The organization has good,friendly and developing environment. Every day you get new challenge. Every day you get something new to learn. Personally, I think if you continue doing your work well and continue to update your knowledge in your domain, then you will experience a lot of growth"
bad,"Working hard for this company does not pay off. Great benefits, though. Most departments have a healthy management to employee relationship, but Fraud Intake is disorganized chaos."
bad,"Capital One gives very good compensation for their workers. That is a good thing, because they will absolutely work you to the bone for it. The people tend to be good, but the atmosphere is always tense and it's hard to feel comfortable. For those who excel in that environment, I feel there are myriad opportunities to advance, but if you don't, you will be quickly shown the door. Not for the faint of heart."
bad,This was my longest job and I must say that I enjoyed my stay there. I created great relationships with co-workers and management. The hardest part of the job was the customers and trying to meet their needs. Limited resources played a big role in why most of the customer base were disgruntal. The best thing was the bonuses and potlucks.
bad,does not pay well at all. i had to move on. the compnay has bad benefits. not reccomended at all. fksJDFBwjkbf wkjefb
bad,"This company would be great to work for if they offered more vacation time than 120hrs on a 10 hour shift basis. 12 days off for an entire year and no bank holidays off, good grief!"
bad,"A work day involves processing invoices received from landlords and working with landlords to reconcile their accounts."
bad,"I've learned that keeping focused and believing in your personal work ethics is key to being successful, and that not all employees share the same values. I've learned that not all employees will be treated fairly.    The hardest part of the job is not being able to accept unfair treatment by management.  The most enjoyable part of the job is that I've had the pleasure of speaking with some awesome people of which I've had the opportunity to support.  Also, that knowing I've been able to make a difference to some of those that I've supported makes my job that much more fulfilling.  Company also makes room for the work life balance which allows for you to work from home which allows you to balance work and meet deadlines while at the same time maintain a home life and be able to deal with other responsibilities.  Although it can be challenging when dealing with some management. "
bad,The work/life balance and pay are not the best with this company. No growth either
bad,"Solid culture due to employees at the branch level however upper management has a disconnect. When first introduced as a bank Capital One had many promises for advancement, but little where fulfilled for many individuals."
bad,Capital One is a great company. I enjoyed the time I worked there. Policies are always changing so you have to be able to adjust swiftly. It doesn't provide stability.
bad,"Capital One preaches understanding, but rules are strictly followed and adhered to. Capital One makes a lot of decisions, but doesn't bother to help the supervisors when customers are angry and nasty."
bad,"Constant changes at all levels. If they are not happy with something, rather than fix the problems, they just shuffle everyone around. "
bad,"Please see the the star rating but to that, it depends on the tower you work in and the management chain you report to. It started out well but when my manager moved, it changed a lot. Also, the vp made some bad decisions from my point of view. Also important, their performance management has many flaws. I have been told, the performance management system was copied from by G.E."
bad,"The management team did not COMMUNICATE with the contractors AT ALL in Auto Finance AML Dept. However, other LOB's were very nice and kind to their contractors.  They treated us as if we were not human. They were very competitive and only cared about NUMBERS and not so much the quality of work. If you worked 15 cases a day, you were hired permanently it seems. Positions were open to go permanent and a lot of people were never given updates in regards to the process or a fair opportunity. "
bad,"Capital One talks a good game.  On paper, they have everything that you would expect.  But career growth is very difficult... as you get rated on things that aren't properly ""established,"" or that are out of your individual control.  You will get compared to others in the organization at the same level/officer title; but who may have a completely different skill set!  Overall corporate politics and ""Fortune 500 ways"" are clearly evident."
bad,Capital One is an awesome Employer. They provide up to date skills to get the job done. I like that the managers are knowledgeable. I learned to be a team player.
bad,"Company very unorganized, management is terrible. Capitol one likes to create new products frequently before fixing the current products that customers consistently have problems with"
bad,Lack confidentiality and need to evaluate who they have as managers. Managers rely on their associates instead of sitting down and learning the function.
bad,The work at Capital One was extremely interesting but the culture at Capital One was extremely difficult to work in given the highly competitive nature of the workforce and the semi-annual forced rankings and distributions
bad,"One of the things that I enjoyed most about Capital One was the work environment. It was always a laid back environment. On the flip side, the company is known to fire minorities, and last year I was one of them. No notice, no reason, no prior issues, but I was fired one random day along with about 7 or 8 other people of color. I cannot support anyone or any entity that discriminates against groups of people and carries out that discrimination through acts of systemic racism. I have since closed all my accounts with Capital One."
bad,This job was very slow.most days dragged out to be long and stressful. Sometimes hours where cut short. HARDLY EVER did management came out to help. wasn't organized.
bad,"I choose to exclude a summary. My views are personal to me on this matter. I believe everyone's experience is individual, and prefer to not provide this type of feedback."
bad,Company was demanding.  Perhaps due to the financial constraints at the time that resulted in company wide Reduction In Force.
bad,it was a diverse company that employed diverse people the company believed in hiring from within so the long term bond was there
bad,Capital One colleagues are some of the best I have worked with. Managers are stressed out and often self oriented. The CEO is worried more about stock price than providing jobs.
bad,Its great untill staffing comes into play . you can never really use your paid time off when you want to. scheduling should be better they should treat the FAST agents better since they are the end all call for the company
bad,"Very accountable, fast paced sales environment. Retail bank is far behind in systems and mobile technology but won't admit to these glaring issues. Heavy paper for everything. Bank has turned into a mini BOA, high turnover, lower pay, short staffing… enjoy if you have the stomach!"
bad,Provide friendly customer service to card members. Meet call matrix and expectations. Track and record rewards on Excel documents and report to management.
bad,"Open the branch, handle customer transactions, balance, close branch."
bad,"Loved it in 2005 when I started had a team of people who had been their for 25 years most are gone now because of the stress put on them by people in Dallas, and trying to make the bank the same as in New York and other large cities. East Texas is known for it's personal customer service but Capital One does not care about that anymore they are big now and it's just about the bottom dollar."
bad,"Hard to get in, but once in it looks good on your resume. Stay the 2 years for the 401k vesting and move on due to countless reorgs and forced ranking for performance reviews. Creates toxic environment."
bad,They are no longer in business in the Wealth management space. Capital One Corporation appeared to treat their employees well with many paid for benefits and company trips.
bad,It is a decent place to work. Office politics can be a bit toxic. Management is friendly enough and they try to help you advance your career. I had a general good experience here.
bad,if you liked highschool you'll love capital one. really focused on being personal and not caring about your career growth. they'd rather know your personal life
bad,"Work days were very busy and productive. Learned alot about fraudulent purchases, making good decision, and how to analyze dispute claims while following company policy."
bad,"I was hired as a contractor to assist with a major phase-out of business, but I still had a good experience. The campus has several dine-in facilities and transpo shuttles to get you there & back every 10 minutes."
bad,"I started with the company in 2009 when they were much smaller.  They grew exponentially while I was there, primarily through acquisitions.  This is where they lost their way and grew too fast.  They need to focus on what they do well - credit cards and auto loans.  They have their hands in a little bit of everything and it shows.  They are a very top-heavy organization - meaning the performance review process and promotion process is brutal and unfair.  You can be a very high performer and still be considered average - with no career advancement.  I was there 8 years an received two promotions but having been a People Manager, I can tell you the process is unfair and way too complicated.  Could be a great company but there's a lot they need to change."
bad,Managers are poor and are never in the branch when you need one..pay raises are terrible and customers hate this bank because it’s so NON-PERSONABLE!!
bad,"Productive company, friendly atmosphere, Opportunity for development of skills for personal growth. Capital One has a high turn over rate due to frequent lay-offs. Team leads can be judgmental and do not show compassion for employees at times. Lack of patience with upper level management. Great cafe's and Starbucks access."
bad,I would say overall it was not what expected goo day and bad days not there long enough to give honest opinion of the company dshb wlnt want to for the review
bad,"Would only work for a place like this as a last resort, never as a first choice. Hardest part I would say is remaining focused and keeping in a ""Ready"" state."
bad,"Filled in for someone so was not there long enough to give a full review on the company as a whole, I enjoyed the work experience. It was a shift from what I am used to."
bad,"Pros"
bad,"Job wasn't hard. Branch manager at the location in which I worked was impossible to please. She was never satisfied and found a flaw in everything. She made the work environment uncomfortable. Additionally, customers were a pain and demanded to be served to their liking even when it is against policy. Overall it is a job that you have to bend over backwards to please everyone. The job itself is boring and I wouldn't recommend it."
bad,If you like working at teleommunictions.It wasn't the job for me. But best of luck to you. Its a typical day at work. Time goes by slow. I learned alot.
bad,"High call volume call center. Typical 20 + calls holding and no down time. At the time I worked there, stats wee strictly enforced. Failing stats for 2 months equaled termination. Due to call volume, we weren't able to interact with each other during working hours."
bad,"I was hired for one position, and was told I was to work another position on the day I started working.  There are many issues with management not being what the owner wanted out of the company."
bad,"Not great for me as a writer. Great for others though."
bad,No comment.  I will keep my experience private.   It was ok.   The team was a bunch of young HB visa boys that play around a lot.  I was the only old female in the team.
bad,I don't really care to write a review of Capital One at this point in time as it was over 10 years ago that I worked for them. I doubt that anything that I say will make a difference now.
bad,as they ignore the surveys which went to check against the bad practices of the Managers as those managers are there since long and carry good cap one domain knowledge.Lot of politics and I hate higher management not knowing/ignoring this
bad,Culture clash. difficult job. banking industry is slow to change and adopt new technologies. lot of micro managing. stress statistics and goals to maintain.
bad,"They laid people off constantly, consolidated departments, closed branches, etc.  Job was fun but stressful...had to have daily accountability calls even if you were hitting your goals.  They wanted you to help other branches."
bad,"I just recently got fired. The way they fired me was unprofessional and they even went against their policy. Capital One was a great job and paid very well. I was an excellent employee. They terminated me while I was at work in the middle of a call & also caused a scene by making me leave early. They stated that I was “late 3 times in one month”. But when I received the documents, the paper stated I was late 9/27, 9/29 & 10/20. ONE which is in a whole other month."
bad,"Capital One decided to get into the banking game through a series of acquisitions. When they purchased Chevy Chase bank in the mid atlantic region (DC area) they purchased a retail bank with VERY limited  business and commercial banking services. In building this portion of the business out, they hired some decent folks, but the culture is still very new, the politics internally is a struggle, and they are a bit disorganized. The pay and compensation is GREAT."
bad,"They recycle you every 3 years unless you can navigate politics, and be in the right place at the right time with the right person."
bad,"This company is offering fantastic facilities, great training opportunities, and allows for flexibility. However, it is a place where change is viewed as a good thing, so everything gets changed all the time. If you can handle 100% of changes all the time, that's a place for you. If you are looking for a stable career, that might not be the right one."
bad,I hated my short time at Capitol One. Their were a ton of managers that had come over from Wells Fargo and their attitudes towards the workers were very bad.
bad,"Capital One has a great philosophy of ""Change Banking for Good"", but executes poorly in its attempts towards reaching that goal. They aspire to be a digital leader, but their technology very rarely launches without major glitches. Tech support does not stick around to fix broken technology. Management tends to be very disorganized and self-seeking because the forced distribution ranking systems for evaluation and bonuses create constant internal competition. The atmosphere is very transaction and less personal. It's a large company that hires a large workforce, so many of these negative things are to be expected."
bad,"Capital One has great benefits and pay, but they don't care about their employees. The call volume is very high so you do stay busy all day."
bad,Every day is a productive day and lean different things.  Great interaction with customers and co-workers. I manage the staff with pride of their productions.
bad,"Little regard for contract workers. Needs better technology. Needs better communication from management. "
bad,I was also very young at this position. They liked to change the rules on a daily basis or whenever they needed to. They were not very good at communicating this to the employees.
bad,I have learned that the training that is offered is not sufficient for all employees.The company has some needs in working with new employees to help them through working with them in their new positions
bad,answer calls all day long. attend meeting and never get any time off because you play the waiting game all day.
bad,The hardest part of the job is when you voice as an associate was not heard
bad,"Don't plan on retiring from this company."
bad,did not work here for long but management was supportive and help you succeed.
bad,"Very fast paced, hard to take breaks, constant drain on your energy. Did not enjoy this job or the company."
bad,"The moral at Capital One when I first started was EXCELLENT, but now has since gone down hill."
bad,"When I worked there the pay was not great and the workload was very high. call volume was kicking sky everyday. There was not enough employees and at that time capital one also took over banks in New York, it was real limbo. I was really stressed out. one sunday i came in and the call volume was in RED and negative.....there was hundreds of calls on hold, so i turned around and went home and never came back....LOL"
bad,"Little room for growth, not interested in the advancement of their associates"
bad,"Good pay, decent work - life balance\Capital One is really good about treating their employees well. They are trying to become more like google with their campus. They have bikes, ping pong tables, yearly festivals and flexible enough schedules. The compensation is fair once you get to mid-management and higher."
bad,"First off, Capital One pays its Business Managers very well with all the related benefits you'd expect. Frankly, the pay is why I stay around. That, and the relatively few hours I have to work. "
bad,"Capital One pays well and has great benefits however their schedules are horrible. I worked M, Tu, Fri, Sat 9-8 every week. They promised shift bids but it was painful to get the one I really needed which was M-F 9-5/8-5. Bonuses were good when you got them but policy changes affected reviews left by customers. You had to fight to get time off."
bad,"I worked for Capital One for a little over a year. The client came in and laid all agents off in one day. Horrible experience from the client, but wonderful local management."
bad,"I loved working FOR Capital One. However, my location was not the best. Due to there being a lack of drop ins from upper management the current work team fell short when it came to following rules, and they did not make one feel welcome when they were just entering into working at the branch. The management at this particular branch held little respect for new employees,. and they did not hide their negative feelings towards the new employees either, making working at that particular location a miserable experience."
bad,Great environment not kid friendly really don't have good hours made great money but interfere with school overall great people great workspace
bad,"Have to compete against other reps. Have to meet goals, Policies constantly changing. Turn over rate is very high. Job is never secured."
bad,The benefits were good. The management was not. I learned a lot about fraud and money. They taught us great customer service and how to cross-sell. They made it very hard to advance. The work/life balance was great
bad,"My four plus years at Capital One has been an up and down roller coaster. In the beginning it wasnt too bad, we got a bonus the first year and everybody wasn't down your throat. In recent years it has gotten worst, we at least for me. I've been moved around different branches like cattle without any warning or indication. To me it was disrespectful and a slap in the face because it only caused inconvenience. I didnt enjoy being at my branch at all and I can say I hated and currently hate my life there. The only thing that I can say thats positive is that I have a little money in my pocket and my 401k is growing."
bad,"Capital One has it's potential to be an amazing company. However, for the representative that's first coming in, be weary. They are quick to weed out and replace the weakest links. I personally feel like, for as much stress and nonsense you put up with dealing with their customers daily, the starting pay should be well over $18... but you start at $15. Advancement is harder than it should be and you can only move up 1 level at a time. Be prepared for change, as it is literally the only CONSTANT at Capital One and the motto they go by. Yes, change can be a wonderful thing, but when you only change things for the benefit of those who make more money than you and the terrible customer's you have to deal with on a regular... change gets very annoying, very quickly."
bad,"It was nice while it lasted, it just didn't last as long as it was advertised.  Sites appear and disappear with startling regularity."
bad,"I would prefer not to comment, however indeed would like additional comments. Age is a big factor at Capital One. (read between the lines)"
bad,Overall ok.  Very poor management team. They do not have African Americans in management.
bad,very hard and boring job.. it was collections. but most of the day you wouldn't get a hold of anyone so made the days long. Enjoyed the people I worked with management was great and good incentives.
bad,Capital One is very well established company. The guidelines and procedures are pretty laid out for everyone. I had many opportunities to advance.
bad,"I am not sure of the company as a whole, but the branch i work is severely mismanaged."
bad,"13 years and over. No job security...after the merge constant  lay offs."
bad,"Great place to work, but they are not afraid to do massive growth or massive cutbacks when they feel like it."
bad,"good place, but my function is a little off. I wish they could tell me about my function before I interview with them"
bad,was hired for inbound customer service and in the 7th week (out of 8 weeks training) was told half of us would be in outbound collections. I would make applicants aware of the fact that they may not be getting the position they were hired on for
bad,"Management needs improvements I was attacked like many other employees and when I asked for help from higher management I was told to ""deal with it"". I was in a very hostile environment and the director gave me the cold shoulder and ignored my emails."
bad,"I did not like my particular branch my manager had horrible leadership skills when it came to certain situations. Great company. Wish I could have stayed longer but with a different branch,"
bad,"I have no much to say about capital one, I wish capital one think about family first before thinking about the business, cutting dpt affect employees."
bad,i get up at 6:00 to be at work by 7:00 everyday was the same hard work and long hours but the pay was good R8000 and comision but very crazy boss the best part of the job was the bathroom brakes
bad,"The self-directed investing team did a wonderful job of hiring smart, fun, and hard-working employees. It's sad to see that division go through such a major change and eventual shut-down."
bad,"typical day at work are great with my fellow co workers. Their are game rooms with ping pong and pool table. I have learned that no matter how much you learn from each company you will always have new things to learn. I would say the most enjoyable part of the my job are the learning experience. My hardest part of my experience are the managements. Sometimes it's hard for them to understand and relate and to even listen to your ideas. When you do have a good ideas, they do not let the teams or their manager know that it came from a certain individual. Management and your team makes the department of any companies strive to be the best. Not just the one person."
bad,Capital One Health Finance  was wonderful but it went to India. It was a call center and full time. The supervisors were great and I would be happy to find a job like this again
bad,"manager are there to help you, helped me advance a lot. I would recommend this place, had to get in the door but once you are in it is easy to advance your career"
good,"It was a job where customers yell at and sometimes berate you in the phone.  It’s not a job to make a career out of.  You may start off as happy, but you won’t leave there the same."
good,No review for this company. I would avoid this company. Micro management is huge. Not a lot of opportunities in Auto Finance. Good benefits but for the amount of work pay sucks
good,They don't care about contractors.  It's who you know and how you play politics that keeps you in Capital One.  Don't get your hopes up if you would like to get a Permanent job while a being a contractor.
good,The company itself could be great if some of the managers wasn't against the agents with the work that was to be done. They tell you 1 thing and then it ever happens mostly none of the upper managements have communication skills last minute with everything unorganized.
good,I loved the work I was doing but my manager was thrown into a managerial role with no prior leadership experience. This resulted in rash decision making along with an extremely stressful work environment. She showed no interest in wanting to help me get better despite numerous attempts made by myself so I left.
good,"Love working for Capital One as a hole. But management was not helpful nor friendly. At times you would need to go to other teammate to get assist. I understand that a person would need to have knowledge to process, but it you ask a question it was not addressed. Just my experience at the time I was there. I'm sure things has changed since."
good,"Challenging place to work"
good,They're not about the culture they say they live by. Managers are unprofessional and incompetent. Not good incentive. HR is biased towards management.
good,The blind are leading the blind starting from HQ to contact centers and bank branches.. The right hand does not update the left hand on what's going on. I guarantee if you take a job here you will leave in 3 months
good,"Phones ring and you pick up. Great bunch of people, just trying to help customers. Like all customer service jobs, customers can be quite rude."
good,Average. its a good company but a lot of silos in the organisation. In addition they have good perks and work life balance. However the culture is really slow
good,The upper management was not great. No room for growth. I would recommend this job for a student. I didn't enjoy my time there. It just felt like a job.
good,"High volume of inbound calls, Lots of customers, lazy co workers and manager wasn't the most professional."
good,Not much work-life balance.
good,"There are many tasks performed on a daily basis. More importantly, the most influential skills that are universal are my coaching, training, development, and mentoring skills. Through coaching and training associates, I have effectively promoted many associates within their careers, along with sustaining a competitive and consistent history of meeting deadlines, goals, and customer expectations."
good,"Challenging too some according to how busy the office is., if not use to being in a call center and being on the phone from the minute you walk into the building."
good,"Great facilities and good benefits especially for maternity leave.  Great vacation policy, great place to learn.  I highly recommend for college grads to apply for jobs at CapOne."
good,"Need someone to hold managers accountable. They tend to have more opportunity and power to be dishonest because they aren't being watched. "
good,It's very disheartening to work for a company where growth opportunities are not there. It's difficult to receive a promotion or even transfer to a different department.
good,"Capital One makes the attempt to include the different cultures of the employees however the overall company culture is not conducive to someone wanting to advance in every area. It depends a lot on who you know which makes the time spent advancing in education can be worthless if you are not liked by the powers that be. It is also not a company that pays well according to level of experience or education,"
good,"This company is all about their ""business needs"". They have very little regard for their employees and there is very little room for growth. If hired through third party then your even more at the bottom of the hierarchy, and any little disruption in your life could cost you your job. If your looking for a career don't waste your time, as you can be easily replaced. This is just another job."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was when I went through teller training. I learning so much about banking processes and polices. The teller training was at an actual Capital One teller training center.
good,Management is great and look for better procedures.  There are a lot of team building games and meetings. I have learned a lot about credit and credit bureaus.
good,"Predictive work schedule as certain tasks in ARM Maintenance need to be completed as early as possible in order to enter the various indices in ECM/LPS system so brokers or originators can have the correct updated interest rates when originating loans."
good,"18 years and many things have changed, culture has gone from one of collaboration and development to cut throat and self promoting.  Still great people there and great programs, 40 hour work weeks and trusting co-workers became a thing of the past."
good,"Working for capital one overall is a great experience, Learning all new systems and more about fraud I love everything about it! The job itself is very hands on, the management isn't the best but the co-workers really makes the job! The hardest part is no part!! I love working for capital one!"
good,"From my experience the corporate side of the business is much better than the retail side.  The culture is different and so are the employees.  Moving from retail to corporate is not easy.  Benefits are great and if you can work in one of the corporate centers like Mclean or plano it is amazing.  Business is certainly changing as they move to their digital first focus.  If your in Tech this could be a great place to go."
good,"Not a bad company, some communication issues but the pay is ok"
good,Had a great time on the teller line. I loved the customers. Most branch managers run their branch differently. You have very friendly ones and those that will not even say good morning. The other tellers are always willing to do team work.
good,"very fast paced work environment. Management canshow favoritism depending o n who you are and or who you know, which I feel is very unfair andunprofessional on so many levels. But my coworkers were awesome."
good,There are a ton of hoops you have to jump through to get on permanent with them they will just keep you on a temp basis. That way they do not have to pay you benefits or give you the pay that they do which from what I understood was 15.00 an hr but keep you at 11.00 an hour.  The schedule was totally different ball game all together  11-8 m-f was great but there is no flexibility in the schedule.
good,It’s a good company overall but they will fire you for ANYTHING. management is never helpful when it comes to anything they barely can answer questions when it came down to drastic changes and they show FAVORTISM. Not worth it
good,Throughout many years with the company there were more good times than bad. Ive seen departments close and people reassigned.  It was a great place and still is.
good,The training was not good and not in debt. If you missed one day then there was no way of anything else making sense. The staff is only nice for a couple of days then they show there true colors. TERRIBLE
good,"Too greedy.  Products are pushed on clients by reps in order to meet company goals.   Not a fun job.  Too many conference calls where goals are discussed and daily action plans are promised by reps in order to appease Management.  The problem is, mist of the goals are unattainable and unreasonable in certain locations."
good,"As long as you are matched with your career choice, Capone is a good place to work. If you just want a job to pay your bills then it's also a good place to work. Promotion is not based on merit but who you know."
good,Management could be better the shifts are not always ideal like 8-8 on SATURDAYS and Sundays but over time is unlimited customer options for payment is very flexible
good,Just a job not a career. very hard to advance where it would mean a lot to the people you help and your family. The managers advance more than the well deserved.
good,"They give you PTO time that you are required to ""schedule"" at least 2 months in advance, if you are sick and ask to use your PTO, it is considered unscheduled PTO and you can get wrote up for using it without it being scheduled ahead of time."
good,"handling RSA security issues"
good,I was a member of a company acquired by Capital One who has a history of dissolving the employees overtime after utilizing their expertise. This was my experience.
good,"Lack of career advancement was frustrating, almost too much emphasis on work-life balance. The managers across departments do not work well together and are pulling the same resources in different directions."
good,It was a very stressful job. They expected alot from you and you had to meet certain quotas. The management staff were not very supportive to their employees
good,"-Good company and great values."
good,"I had a good enough experience at Capital One but management needs some help. There are some employees that know the job very well. If the job is explained to you the right way then it will get done right. Some managers do not know how to explain how to do the job and when it is done the way you were taught it and that way is wrong, it is always your fought."
good,"besides work life balance it is a great place to work at. New technologies presented all the time. People are nice, on call is very busy. Make sure to check on call prior joining"
good,"Capital One is a good company if you land in the right team."
good,If you went to another location things would be perfect. The schedule isn't workable. To work only 3 hours and they the next day work 3. not cool please make sure you have in mind people have families. Workers at my location were not professional at all. The manager never at the location. Not enough pay for your work.
good,"They under pay for the job, but its the market, if you do customer service you are paid the least amount of money. They have a high turn over rate because of the pay vs the stress of the job."
good,There are great opportunities to grow in the space of diversity and inclusion. Currently there aren't any measurable action plan in place to accomplish this imperative which disrupts the overall atmosphere of the culture.
good,"The company is great, values, morals and mission. However lower management is awful and favortism plays a huge role not only in career progression but actually in maintaining employment!"
good,"I feel that in order to keep clients trust, there needs to be more consistent  employees and less turnover. I am not going to trust a bank with all my personal information to constantly  replacing the staff with new hires. newer and younger isn't better. This is one of the reasons that big banks need to be taken down. The higher executives making the wrong decisions, but get paid the most. Staffing the branch should be first priority."
good,"No job security, Not a lot of direction or training from the company. Your just expected to know everything, even when your new to your role."
good,"Seems Rich started Capital One with an amazing vision and ideals; as the company grows these visions and ideals are dwindling despite the bank's best efforts to market new missions and provide excitement. Poor pay, and poor management skills is the heart of the problem for this company. It's a great place to work for about 3 months."
good,"Expect to do a lot for little pay. Little to no growth, dead end job! Good for young uneducated person, just starting out. It all depends upon who your manager is."
good,"working for capital one was a okay experience for me, Being new with a new manger was work. It was kind of like the blind leading the blind but after I got the hang of it, it was a piece of cake."
good,"On the plus side, the benefits are reasonable. "
good,"The Call Center for Capital One was a stressful environment for me. When we were not on a recorded call with an irate customer, we were either rushing to or from our 15 minute break. While dealing promptly and professionally with customers we also had to keep in mind our call handle time, our sales pitch, providing correct information, and other requirements."
good,"I enjoyed going to work everyday, there's a new task being learned daily to knowledge myself better and I enjoyed working with my peers. The most enjoyable part of my job was the giving the best  customer service to clients and challenging myself to do more and more task and executing it to the max."
good,Good experience with the company and I like working here as well.
good,It was an ok evironment to work in. I did get a chance to meet new people but overall I was not satisfied with some of the management.
good,inbound /outbound contact with customers delinquent on automobile accounts ranging from 80 to 120 dpd...
good,Overall good place to work...little to no oppurtunity of advancement varying from manager to manager
good,"Capital Auto Finance is most differently not a career,"
good,"High call center atmosphere. Customers called in for balance inquires, transaction information, transferring funds, and loan information."
good,"Capital one bank is a company that offers no supports or feedback to the employees. Capital one is a corporate that has gone and still is going through a lot of restructuring, keeps employees confused and unhappy. A typical day at work is a busy day a great customer focused environment. I've learned a lot in the past four and a half years, about government regulations, customer feedback and customer satisfaction. My co-workers and I have become a great team and work together as one every day to achieve goals and provide the best customer service. The hardest part of the job is to work around our customer's busy schedule in order for them to get the best out of the company's products and services. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we accomplish customer satisfaction and happiness. When a customer thanks you is the most rewarding part of the day."
good,fun kinda too laid back not very focused on customer service as it should be
good,Its overall a good company. I really enjoy the hours and having weekends off to be with my family. I love the staff at my branch. You really become a family and they offer really good benefits.
good,"Non-Stop learning experience, one step after another. There is good and bad like all companies."
good,"Managers don’t know how to manage.  Very few managers care if you succeed or not.  Job descriptions don't match the job.  What the Company expects, which is Good Customer Service, doesn’t match what they get thanks to poor training."
good,Short term contract ended unexpectedly. Would consider future opportunities. Good contracting agency. Minimal interaction with management. Used current  change and communication skills.
good,"Need better management"
good,Capital one is okay company to work but need a different that really cares about their employees . too many things happening with credit cards need something else
good,Very stressful . Quota that is unreasonable . Business only cared about surveys and numbers . Never cared for employees . Don’t care about customers . Just want them to use their cellphone so they can hire less staff
good,"This is a good place for someone to start your career. But it is not an easy place if you are not part of the dominant white culture. You can hardly find non-white managers (not senior developers, or other senior non-managerial positions)."
good,There are some benefits that made it worth working for them (paid time off/Maternity leave). Decent pay for the area considering costs of living. However some of the management and departments can be undesirable. In my experience the management was not supportive and not knowledgeable of the processes. Their end of year approval rating process can be unfair to say the least.
good,It seems as though they are always under going change and not allowing the environment to stabilize. It seems that leadership doesn't know what they want and it seems that they want to make change for changes sake.  Very inconsistent and new managers don't have a clue or want to understand what the staff is doing.
good,It was an easy job but they get on your back if you don't sell but it is hard if you see the same people throughout the day. The drive up was detached so stuck in a box waiting for car to pull up.
good,"Was in a major time of transition. Pay was significantly peer competitors and local banks. Management was focused, but unfortunately they just weren't focused on internal talent development at the time."
good,"If you are a manager or below, Capital One is a great place to work. However, they rarely promote women to senior leadership and it is cutthroat and individual contribution is highly sought out. Teamwork is not valued there."
good,"The campus was beautiful but management did not seem to know what was required of us or each other; straight answers were difficult to obtain.  I would reccomend this as a place to learn and gain experience but not for the long term, although I have known employees that were able to navigate the system and stay for up to 20 years."
good,"A recent survey stated that both managerial and company NPS were at or below 50, yet morale was over 75.  Kind of a contradiction, but it may have to do with the fact that people adapted in spite of management.  The culture has shifted quite  bit over the last few years with the move into cloud and this culture may not be sustainable.  Management hoards those with knowledge and expertise and runs them ragged while preventing true collaboration and knowledge sharing.  They scream from the highest mountains about being Agile, but they should really call it COFAgile because there may be sprints, PI's, and retrospectives, Product Owners and SCRUM masters for the most part are ineffectual in their duties.  There is also a cultural difference as to how you came to work for Capital One.  If you came via an acquisition, you have to fight harder than those that were hired in directly."
good,"Typical day at work: de-escalating highly escalated customers over the phone to prevent tier 3 complaint. "
good,I do not want to write a review. I have nothing to save negative about the company nor positive about the company. I worked for the company for 5 years and it time for a change.
good,"This the best company that I have ever got fired from. If you are lucky enough to get a manager that truly cares and motivates you, then success will follow as long as you do the work. If you get a manager that cares only about covering themselves then you are apart of the 85% population there. Policies and procedures change too often. If you become stressed easily, this is not the place for you, you will die from a heart attack or stroke. If you can tolerate abuse (customer and internal), lack of security, and total chaos, this is a perfect match."
good,"this is not a company where an individual can have a career.  the longer you are with this company, you are subject to loose your job due to outsourcing/layoff."
good,taking calls from Capitol one customer you learn how to assist with helping customers handle money matters. the most enjoyable part of the job would be assisting a happy customer
good,"Work was good and allowed employees to advance fairly easily. However, at times you had to be flexible in order to help other multiple locations and branches."
good,Their job culture has change drastically and not for the better. Employees are very frustrated and looking to leave. There is too much pressure.
good,"This job was ok, normal teller duties and sales goals. This job is good for starters, especially if you are interested in banking"
good,Working with this company is great when you know the right people and in order to move up the ladder or get promoted you don't necessarily have to be a top performer. The company is very biased and lack zero to no empathy for struggling employees when it comes to work life and balance.
good,Capital is a great place to work but its very hard to have work life balance here. My job is very stressful but it pays well.
good,the job was fine but the pressure they put on you on our calls was enormous. instead of concentrating on the customer you had to make sure you hit everything the scorers were looking for. so your focus was on the grade not the customer. Good calls were graded as bad calls because you didn't apologize after each transaction even if the customer told you not to apologize just fix it. the customers would be more irate with you after the call because you had to make sure you hit all the points they wanted you to. but they would tell us in the meetings they weren't trying to make it a checklist type of call.
good,this company is ok to work for if your looking for a part time job and if you looking for extra money this will be a good job to be this job did teach me about credit score the management are ok
good,Only work at home position that is worse than a call center environment. The ONLY perk to this position is the ability to work in pajamas. There is zero perks or flexibility to this job. Extremely poor management and no opportunity for advancement.
good,"Typical day is starts with stand up followed by core hours."
good,"Es una buena empresa, con muy buenos compañeros, simplemente implementaron cambios que no han sido favorables para la mayoría de los empleados, y no se han tomado en cuenta a los empleados."
good,so i was relocated to a place too far to travel and because i could not take the position i was refused ueb so i would not recommend
good,"I think capital one is a great company to work for and we had some good employees. I learned a lot working at capital one especially working in fraud, fraud is something that never stop and it always changes so you have look at the case and status as fraud from very little info."
good,"learned "
good,"The culture at Capital One is excellent however, the compensation is probably better at McDonalds. Like most companies in corporate America, promotions are mostly based on who you know and not what you know"
good,"High volume customer service, providing customers with correct information regarding finances. Hardest part dealing with management. Customers are always enjoyable"
good,My experience with Capital One Bank has been bitter sweet. I have learned many processes and application involving the Financial and Banking Industry that have been beneficial to my current life. I enjoyed learning from my counter parts as well as my manager in the 8 years I have been employed with the Company. I have been there on the frontline from the company converting from just a credit card company to a bank. The exxperience has had it up and downs but overall its a great company to work for if you want to devulge in the financial industry.
good,I love my co-workers we have worked together in the same group for years.
good,"Needs imporvement in career development area, workn and life balance and organzation across the board"
good,Loved my coworkers and assistant manager.  Manager seemed too busy focusing on numbers to care about her employees.  Pay wasn't great (other banks pay $2-$3 more an hr) Got a VERY small pay raise after having been there for a year. I enjoyed the work. Didn't feel appreciated or that the customers were appreciated. Will never go back.
good,Very laid back environment. Got along with all of my coworkers. The best thing about the job was the incentives.
good,"I worked for the company for about 2 years, once the Hylan branch finally opened up and Staten Island was declared NOT part of New York any longer (according to Cap One executives), it all went down hill. All new management staffs goal was to work the people currently employeed to insanity. Unethical in practices by current Hylan manager, worse branch to do business with. Telling customers that are unemployed in debt to their ears to apply for credit cards, pre judging people on whether they will be approved for loans, etc. The staff is under paid, over worked, belittled, and disrespected in front of other employees and customers."
good,Manage up to 100 outbound collection call to bring accounts out of past due status. The most difficult part of this job was not being properly compensated for tasks performed. Most rewarding part of job was additional incentives and regular contest to win certain prizes.
good,capital one has no since of direction. everything is on the fly. It will stay that way until 3-5yrs down the road
good,"Good benefits, people are to young and know it all."
good,"-sometimes management seems very far removed from their reports' day to day work lives, and so cannot empathize properly with work-related grievances."
good,Meeting and talking with Customer.
good,"Inbound and Outbound calls from Customers and Repo. Agents. Daily review of accounts, Skip Trace and resolution of past due accounts."
good,a typically day was not knowing if you would have work
good,"It's a great environment, but management is very biased and play favorites. Certain managers only help you achieve goals and promotions if you are liked by them."
good,Capital overall is a great company to work for.  However please choose your location carefully when applying.  Dont quit a job to go Richmond Hill.  THE STAFF THERE WILL MAKE YOU FEEL DUMB.  Ther are about 2 nice ones and if there are off you are screwed. No one wants to help you.  Its a lot to learn.
good,Capital One Manager had no idea what he was doing. He relied very heavily on the team lead who ended up leaving because of work load.   I loved working with capital one customers and helping them.
good,"Used to be a great place to work, but now they've lost sight of taking care of their people. The culture has changed and management is keenly focused on protecting their own jobs.  Would only recommend for entry level jobs, middle management is cut throat."
good,"When employed the company had a lot of employee moral that was 4 stars. It was a stressful environment, also constantly being micro managed with stats that were impossible to make on purpose since the company did not want to pay out bonuses. It was a manipulative environment as well, as upper management looking to get terminate people in order to not pay out a severance pkg due to the consolidation of shutting down call centers. Management was good on the front line, but anything after that good luck. I do like the capital one mission statement and think the banking division could use some coaching on following the mission statement. If offered, I would work for the company again, just not with the banking division. My most favorite part of working there was relationship building. I knew people in every department and was able to have quick resources for my clients."
good,"Comp and benefits are amazing.  In theory the culture is set up to be a diverse and inclusive one but in reality it’s like most organizations in the industry - only those who are within the “circle” get the benefit of senior leadership support, development, and dare I say protection.  Senior leaders are very good at talking the talk but fail miserably at truly walking the walk and leading by example."
good,"Typical company. Culture was fun, however management could use some help. Reminded me a lot of high school drama wise. Advancement is hard, as far as getting off the phones and into a man agent position"
good,"Severe age discrimination in HR, over 40 means you'll be overlooked for promotion, advancement and eventually eliminated under the guise of ""performance management""."
good,It was so long ago. I don't want to write a review because they could have fixed their issues. This could have been done when I was laid off when they moved my department to Minnesota.
good,Great job until I got a new manager. Then unfortunately she made a bogus reasons to get rid of me. There’s a great place to work and learned a lot. It’s sad when just because New manager doesn’t like you personally they make above magic magical reason to get rid of you. Manager also do not like males and a female’s preference
good,"My typical day for almost a year was a constant mumbling of, ""What is my role here and what am I doing here?""  "
good,Provides lots of pto. Company culture is poor and poor management. Bonuses are decent depending on the department. Relaxed dress code Richmond office is much more professional than Chesapeake office.
good,This compnay offered great benefits; however the pay is low and their is no room for advancement. All the branches are understaffed and overworked. You will not get any overtime working for this compnay they are very strict about time. They will make you clock out if you go over your time regardless if its super busy with a line of cusotmers or not they do not care. All they care about is numbers and how many accounts and new customers they can get
good,My time at Capital One felt very stagnant.  The company was going through major overhaul so career development was not an option.  The job is highly repetitive and the management lacks direction.
good,A lot of drama... Can get lost in the system as far as one on one training. You have to make sure you have the right manager to really help you if you get overwhelmed or confused
good,"Management is out of touch with reality and have no idea what goes on. Then at the end of the year, these same managers try to evaluate resources for performance management."
good,I loved working for Capital One as a company until they allowed managers to ruin their reputation with their high ego's and will for power. We are all humans and should be treated as such rather than children.
good,"overall company is a good place to work, however individual mangers have their own missions and does not follow the mission of the company. i worked in commercial loans"
good,"The management team was not supportive and unprofessional . "
good,"This is a good company to work for if you can get hired. They will keep you as a temp indefinitely, but not hire you.  Hours are good. Company benefits not available unless you are made permanent."
good,Overall capital could be a fit for you working life just not sure if it's a fit for a parent with a family. Just do your research first before applying
good,I think everyone has their own opinions about how they view working at Capital One. I for one thought advancement was close to none. And to me that was the most important thing.
good,"Great company with a forward thinking agenda, based on your assignment group its a hit or miss, ask detailed questions on management knowledge of product development, and engineering delivery before you make your decision. Overall a good company to build your skills with a good work life balance."
good,"it has good technology to work with but not good management."
good,Great benefits draw you in and keep you. There is not a lot of opportunity to branch out in a different direction and very little room for advancement in the call center. Capital One is very much about the customer and numbers but not very concerned about it's employees. There is little flexibility and you feel easily replaced.
good,I did not enjoy doing the collections.  I am a people person and I did not enjoy it at all. I did not think that it was fun at all.  I did not enjoy working the nights.
good,"Good culture very good in the agile environments. Mid management are tough, some do advance, opportunities are not always shared to stem development.."
good,"Needs open door policy.  A lot of information isn't shared with employees; rumors seem to always be true, although management would make a point to deny."
good,I did not work at Capital One to give an accurate review.  The experience I had there was fine.  There was not enough opportunity for me to advance to the salary level I desired as quickly as going back into the transportation industry.
good,"Really like the people at Capital One, but in the iT area we worked a lot of hours including weekends.  The IT management changes directions frequently causing high turnover.  Overall a good experience, but I wouldn't work there again.  Have a much better work/life balance now that I work elsewhere."
good,The workplace is safe and management is adequate.  They do provided an industry-leading product.  They place the perception of diversity and political correctness above having traditional family values or having well-qualified people in place. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the fact that they will keep asking you to do more and more while they find ways to decrease your compensation.
good,"Capital One culture is very laid back. The benefits are decent, but they company is cutting back on alot of the non-core business, such as mortgage and wealth management. Their focus is solely on credit cards. Branches are closing and bankers have no sales goals. Branch staff are getting laid off. No more assistant managers, and mortgage officers in the branches."
good,I personally don’t like working for capital one. There is no consistency as far as policies. There’s no strong management team. However they are flexible.
good,It's a ok place to work I worked there 5 years and I liked the employees and some of the managers. They feed you good food and the morale is ok. The managers are paid a lot more than the agents. They change their policies and procedures often.
good,"An employee has to be in the workplace at least 15 minutes before log in, to have ample time to do personal chores, and log in on time. I learned in my 15 years in the BPO industry, is punctuality and respect to the customers and every company depends the income through the customers. "
good,It's all about who you know. Promotions are given to people less  deserving. Management are put in positions without any knowledge of the positions only because their friend is doing the hiring.
good,Although the salary is fair and the benefits are never ending - I experienced very poor management! Direct & timely feedback are non-existent....Beware.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of collaboration with a great team of associates, to invent the next shinny whiz bang thing."
good,Your typical day would be key check amounts that would flash across your screen. You would have 2 try's and then you would have to pull the check and physically look at it. Extremely cut throat. You got paid on how fast you could key the check amounts.
good,there are good and bad days like every job. The people you work with and the management at your branch makes a huge difference in if you enjoy working there or not.
good,"I would've stayed if I had more support, it wasn't easy being the lead teller....or I should say the ONLY teller. I rarely had time to eat and my feet would kill me! I definitely would have stayed if they offered more pay and more support."
good,I enjoy working at Capital One but it's a big boys club and doesn't allow for inclusion as much as it claims. The management is biased and is polarized between keeping their jobs and associate development
good,In my time with Capital One I fell in love with the company.  During the last 18 months the senior leadership started shifting their management to be less alligned with corporate.
good,"Daily duties included but were not limited to:"
good,"Bad Directors continue to work and be promoted."
good,"Big company with lots of departments. In my current one, management is clueless. Every day is stressful. Too much work that is not reflected by the pay."
good,"I really enjoyed that capital one seemed to put alot of focus on Fun events with employees.  Capital One spent a lot of money on day trips, cruises, going out to eat with employees.  However, they didn't seem to care enough about the individual employee when the money ran out and they couldn't afford to keep a certain department anymore."
good,"Overall the company is strong, but leadership within certain Lines of Business is weak. Many initiatives are launched without sufficient prioritization and/or resource allocation and senior leaders are often indecisive.  This creates undue confusion among associates and can lead to negative impact on work-life balance."
good,"Decent in between job. You are a small, very replaceable cog in a machine. You have the ability to earn bonuses, either small lump sums or up to an extra $2/hr for a specific pay period but they will take any excuse to strip you of them. Bonuses are also directly tied to customer reviews, so if none of the customers you talk with fill out that little survey when they are done you don't get any bonus. I lost well over $400 to extremely minor offenses. There is no grey area for anything it's all black or white and if you get 3 strikes, regardless of if they were major or minor issues you are let go. Promotions are also pretty random and there were more than a couple girls who slept their way up the ladder enough to a position that handled less calls. Also, once you get your schedule it is near impossible to change it unless you actually want to work weekends. I told them specifically that I had a weekend job and they decided to start my workweek on saturday, and if you already are scheduled for working saturday/sunday any schedule change request you send in will be automatically declined"
good,"I was with cap one almost two years and enjoyed my first year, but when trying to promote, it's about who you kissed up to and who you know, not what your performance proves. Some management are only there for the same reason, and are somehow not held to the same standards. Company overall is great, but without a great management system, even the best employees will fail."
good,Each day was something different with my coworkers and each call was a different issue.  Unfortunately  all the managers were not on the same page; which made it hard when when we had a realignment with new managers.
good,"I was brought on when Capital One Bank's business model was service over sales.  When this changed, the morale became so low that turnover was common.  It became a stressful, and this led to an unpleasant working environment."
good,"The work place was  very ,nice and you had to follow a script on what needs to said ."
good,Constantly working understaff which leads to multitasking different roles in a day therefore productivity decreases.
good,"Capital One offers excellent benefits and great opportunities to establish a career experience.  Capital One encourages a work, life and balance theme.  As a result the experience is unlike many industry peers.  There are pros and cons to the unique culture."
good,"I have nothing to write about regarding Capital One, except it's a great place to work."
good,Typical work day included being on the telephone processing credit card applications and retail credit applications. Speaking with potential customers to complete verification and existing customers to process credit limit increases. Credit underwriting both on and off the telephone for customers. Speaking with retail store associates to complete application process and address their concerns with process and outcome of application(s) submitted.
good,I have been here for 6 years as of 9/15/14 and at the end of the year they will be closing my department.  This was my first job in banking/credit card and maybe my last
good,"It's very routine, not much different than any retail job, management is very poor, co-workers tend to be very uptight, hardest part is not having job security and lack of motivation. There is no enjoyable part."
good,"•	Monitor results and maintain awareness to identify emerging error trends by isolating root causes of known, larger or chronic issues. Address issues to executive level by developing and implementing sound and sustainable solutions that reduce the volume of errors or eliminate the problems altogether."
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,"a typical day at work - FAIR"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job, is being able to resolve a customers problem."
good,"a typical day at work back to back inbound calls assisting customers with any need they may have on there bank account, offering new products we may offer, was never really was able to build a relationship with a manager every three months we had a new manager and schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with different people on a daily basis. "
good,"Assisted customers with credit card and bank accounts, was an mediator between customers and third party merchants.  Learned to waive fees, verify funds, release payment holds, add travel notifications, and deny credit limit increases.  Co workers were supportive and fun. The hardest part was the constant denial of credit limit increases and the constant switching of managers. The way monitored calls were graded. The most enjoyable part was the ability to connect with the customers and  my co workers."
good,"A typical day at work is starting your work as soon as you arrive and you end your day on time. So far, I have learned that Capital One is a great place to start your career if you are entry level. Management is very structured overall. If you are in a good department you can really learn and grow. The hardest part of the job is the lack of training when you are new to the company. The most enjoyable part of the company is the interaction with the customers and knowing you are helping someone with their business needs."
good,"A typical day ofwork consist of lobby leading in the front. Welcoming every customer asking if they need assistance and have they heard of whatever product we might have available. During downtime i make follow up calls with my customers in which i have opened there accounts or have assisted any other needs they might have, The hardest part of my job is the safe deposit box area because they can be very heavy at time and being that we have to wait for the client accessing there box, we lose out on prospect clients upstairs.The most enjoyable part of my job is when i make my customers happy and satisfy all there needs."
good,"Since bank is so large, I was able to specialize in the department I worked in. Overall, good work experience"
good,worked for 10 years with this company. loved my job and the people i worked with.
good,"My typical day take inbound calls all day help customers with questions regarding their credit card bill,benefits,assist with lost stolen cards and send new cards to them. I learned about how interest works and annual percentage rates affect account and how your credit is affected by credit cards. Management was okay they listened to your calls and gave feedback on what you did well and what you can improve on. I loved my coworkers it was a fun place to work. The hardest part of my job was dealing with difficult customers but that comes with the job most enjoyable part was dealing with different people from all over the United States I dont travel but talking with people from all over the country makes you feel like you travel."
good,It's a good place to work depending on what department you work with.
good,"Nice company to work for except, they are very hard when it comes to sales and making teller referral."
good,"Working at capital one is stressful because of the constant changes in procedures. Most things are at managers discretion making it seem unfair at times when some employees receive different treatment than others. If you decide to work there, prepare for a stressful day most days. Fun work environment and great coworkers but advancement within the workplace also seems difficult."
good,It’s ok j no it the best place to work but it’s a relaxed environment and slow paced. Costumers are ungrateful and mostly come in during happy hour but it’s fun the coworkers can be irritating because everyone act like children including management but besides that it’s not horrible.
good,My two years at this company did provide some great industry knowledge and I enjoyed the co-workers but the pay was terrible for the amount of work expected of you.
good,"Intense work environment with very aggressive leaders.  There is a focus on the employees...good communication from leaders, benefits, on-campus fitness facility, company-subsidized cafeteria, and covered parking."
good,"Capital One is a good company to work for if you are in Technology.  For the supporting organizations, there are minimal opportunities for advancement."
good,i left capital one for 2yrs now but they dont help you to find a job inside capital one i work with them for 8yrs i hope they will help me to get a job in a branch even balancer in the branches
good,"It’s all in who you know, it used to be a great company but some new outside hires, have come in and have changed the culture and atmosphere negatively."
good,"no work life balance, nice people, late schedules.  I enjoyed the people I worked with.  They change from customer service to more sales driven and pushed people out."
good,No comment about the work.  It was mostly just paperwork and a few diagrams.  I don't have enough to complete the 15 character minimum.  Working at Capital One was a short contract and I had co workers there with me.
good,"One should be objective yet intentional about what direction you would like your career path to go in. Although there are attempts to support employee career goals, management seems far too distracted to offer very much support. Have your own goals and plan of execution in mind."
good,"Working for Capital one was a waste of time. There wasn't nearly enough training, they threw people into the field. Not to mention that they weren't honest in the interview with what the job would entail. I quit a great job to take the job at Capital one and i wish i had never done it,"
good,"Lots of busy schedule, No breathing time at all. It is recommended for H1B persons where they will work more than 12 hrs. / day and week ends."
good,Capital One was very competitive with the cross calibration at the end of the year and layoffs are part of the regular process there.  You have a chance to be very deep in a small area but because of the size it is difficult to have breadth across a number of areas at Capital One.
good,"very set on business development but lacks competitive technology"
good,"Like Capital One Bank overall as a company,but where I worked was not a professional environment.The manager I had was not any help with making sure you succeed at Capital One,not nice and she was always out sick."
good,"I think the company as a whole is unstable. There's no job security. I worked as a temp for almost 2 years, and all the other temps that were hired before me did not get a position with the company and all eventually left. However, the people and the environment was great. I absolutely enjoyed my time there."
good,"I love the company but hate my department. There is a lot of favoritism Very had to move around in this department unless you are a butt kisser, The environment could be so much better...."
good,"If you decide to work for this company or want to, I would highly suggest applying directly through the company. The work days can be very stressful at times during peak times or during disasters such as hurricanes, but the staff is pretty good. You will learn in this environment, which higher level staff really know what they are talking about over others."
good,"I would work anywhere other than the fraud space. Horrible management and leadership split between sites led to a horrible experience.Great corporate culture, but terrible local management."
good,"Management tends to hire who they want, not who is more qualified for this position. The aren't interested in your career advancement, only interested in what makes them look good."
good,"i work for capital one in the manual department, There's no 40 hours a week only 35 the insurance through united health care is awful and covers nothing don't bother to sign up for it and you have to pay a 40.00 co pay. I took outbound calls for capital one pretty much left voicemails all day maybe talk to 5 actual customers a day none of them want to pay 98% hang up or don't answer. Also there's been no bonuses or bonus structure since September 2018 no plans to fix it i guess. You have to hassle managers to put in your free time when you take a paid day off. The cafeteria and break rooms are always loud and packed can not find a seat some times. If you don't have kids or any dependents expect at least 250.00 in taxes to be taken out each check pretty much you have to work over time almost every other day to get a decent check and the first 5 hours is not over time because you have to hit 40 hours 1st since you only work 35 hours a week. Outbound/manual is so boring since you just leave voicemails all day 1 call equal 1 minute that goes by so the time drags they play music and leave tv on but the tv stays on cooking channel all day and is muted. You have to have lockers you can not have a single thing on your desk especially if its paper or anything to write with and no snacks or drinks either unless water bottle or in a spill proof cup. You also share your desk with other people so take your stuff home. Also a ton of rules very strict completely different from any call center I've ever worked for. You work at a desk but it's really a table because there's no where to store"
good,"If you get into the right department then you'll be fine. If you get in a department that lacks management then you have three choices become complacent in the position you're in, see if you can get out of that position, or find a new company.  "
good,"Features pushed out so fast that massive technical debt accrues. Even when several people leave because of this, little changes. They keep saying quality over speed but there's a disconnect between tech and management and we rarely see that ever happen."
good,I had to go through major vetting to be hired and was not hired at the discussed salary and job position. I was supposed to be fraud resolution instead it was customer service. Score base environment on NPS. Relationship is confusing policy and procedure compared to what is written versus what's being said. There's a wonderful group of people that I worked with. However management appears confused and are quick to blame the staff. No accountability and loyalty from upper management. Very high turnover. False reports about being the top Ten rated company to work with in Florida
good,"Work/Life Balance is claimed.  However, with the amount and pace of change, it's impossible.  Everyone is stretched thin and work in silos (which makes it difficult to assist other team members).  Working endless hours and sacrificing personal time for the business is celebrated and is a ""badge of honor.""  As a whole, Capital One is a well-oiled machine that is on the cutting edge of technology and products.  Yet, individual units/teams tend to be dysfunctional.  Like a duck on water; gliding peacefully on top of the water while paddling like crazy below.  In less than 12 years, I had 10 managers and 2 temp managers which made it very difficult to create team synergy and understand a manager's style/expectations."
good,I enjoyed most of my time at Capital One until my last line of business.  They offer great benefits and there so many options when it comes to what you want to do.
good,"I was hired through a temp agency, and a month before my short term assignment was supposed to be over, they told us we had 9 days to find another job."
good,Things are moving more digitally and the pathway for advancement and promotions were just removed.  The feeling of being laid off is constantly in the air now.
good,Capital One no longer has teller and banker positions now everyone is an Ambassador and they don't equal or raise your pay but expect you to pick up with the extra work.
good,"The company is not what it seems to be. The call centers are not properly developed for people to feel secure about their jobs. It is hard to get promoted to positions within the company that are top level (finance, banking, etc.) they always hire from outside in. The culture and management of the company does lack in places in which their turnover rates are fairly numbered. Good overall, but needs lots of improvements."
good,"I loved my job, but it was extremely stressful. I often worked 60 hour work weeks because I had no back up to help me, even when I asked my VP for help. Even when I wasn't actually working, I felt like I had to keep an eye on my email via my phone until late in the evening in case something came up. I almost always had to work during my vacations and ""days off"". My work was appreciated by other departments, but not by my own leadership team. The VP was a bully and most of the department hated working for her and often complained to HR about her but they did nothing about it. Even after killing myself for my job and the company, they still laid off my team."
good,"Looking for a new position, love the company; however, the management team is not supportive and does not live by the guidelines that is given by the CEO"
good,"The early days were fun, but now is very political.  They have a focus to get rid of the people after 15 years of experience and hire in younger less expensive and knowledgable resources."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with.  I enjoyed the retirement 401k match.  You contribute 6% they contribute 7.5% for 13.5% total.    I enjoyed the nice facilities.   I enjoyed working from home occasionally.   However, after 11 years the annual performance process is terrible and it pits everyone against each other.    Every year 10% of the workforce is laid off.   Most of the time they don't back fill with employees.  They hire contractors so after a few years you are cutting good employees.     They call it redeployment.  People are always getting ""redeployed"".   Its hard to be faithful to a company like that.    They leadership think its a software company but its a just a bank that moved all its core data into the Cloud."
good,"My teammates were helpful and I enjoyed them, we had a work life that helped the day go bey. Management was very aloof and would destroy the teams morale with unnecessary changes and ineffective processes."
good,"The Vacation Policy was awesome, the salary was not comparative. The company's leadership did not promote development in it's employees. They did not offer salaries that allowed hourly associates to thrive."
good,"Experienced programmer focusing on service automation. Leadcto believe during hiring process that this would be the type of work that I would based on decades of experience. Instead first 6 weeks ignored. Finally placed me on team performing Manual releases. This is not my skill set and I’ve spent career replacing manual processes with automatic. Resistance to change and what does hsppen, assigned to inexperienced colleges grads. Who struggle for months with something i could resolve in a few hours. I love mentoring but told to focus on manual processes I have always automated."
good,"Work day was fine, but it was like team vs. team instead we were all a team. Some of the managers that i ran into, NOT ALL but some, were rude and obnoxious, No interpersonal skills. Didn't really standing for their agents because they were afraid of losing their job for ""standing up"" for their agents....other than that I loved my job."
good,The company could not stay on the same path for more than 6 months.  Management was always turning over.  There was a lack of  connection to the work you were doing.
good,"I have no suggestions or comments. Except the low pay. Also the How-to is rediculously hard to navigate. Also, they set you up for failure, since it's easy to get a regulation error and it could be avoided with proper tools in use."
good,"Starting salary just above minimum wage-raises and promotions few and far between. If you are there for any length of time, new people are soon making same wage as you."
good,This has been my best job and worst job.  Gave me great opportunity to expand my skill set and work with smart people.  Culture changed and now weekly layoffs are the norm.  Advancement is limited.  Performance management process is completely broken.  Bank bureaucracy is stifling.
good,young environment ok place to work didnt plan on having a life long career with the company on a day today basis I was not overly happy with the position did it for a check only didnt like location or pay
good,"Process payments"
good,"not enough workers so your always doing double duty "
good,No structure or guidance since rules and regulations kept changing day to day and management kept changing causing chaos because of inexperience managers. Mortgage collections is already stressful for the customer but because of the turnovers and additional work a lot of customers were not able to be receive the attention they required. The workplace culture was cut throat and was geared to who you knew and not what you knew. At the end people were very scared everyday that they would lose their job. Hardest part of the job were the daily changes. no consistency. The most enjoyable part of the job was that the company realized this and tried to make it easier. I learned that upper management did not learn from the middle managers and never learned what really is important in a good company. I believe this was only in the mortgage department. Hence all the layoffs in 2016.
good,"The metrics here made it almost impossible to receive incentive bonuses. Customer surveys were weighted to bring down bonus eligibility, especially with long hold times."
good,Like any company there are some hurdles to jump. The company is making great effort in accomplishing that. It's my hope that the company eventually hits the mark in truly being a great place to work.
good,"It sells you a very good culture, but it falls through. It was impossible to get any PTO, even though I had plenty of time. The job itself is difficult to handle"
good,"Ever-changing environment with no job stability, no areas for advancement. Hard work life balance, very stressful environment, areas and branches constantly closing.  Great for someone starting out in their career. More of a who you know not what you know environment."
good,"While I was working there, they went through multiple rounds of layoffs to re-distribute jobs to other locations. 300+ of the 500 employees were laid off."
good,"Capital One was a very stressful job. I was able to build positive relationship with customers. There was a lot of system to learn , in a short amount of time."
good,Overall the company has grown too large and become inefficient with too stressful of a political environment.  As the company has grown there is a continuing lack of ownership
good,Capital one bought out a local bank in new york and told the employees in the customer service dept where I worked that nothing would change. Within one year they dissolved the customer service dept in ny and relocated the dept to virginia resulting in loss of jobs for many people.
good,It's a corporate business so it can be cut throat and competitive. There is no real job security due to dept.s being moved or shut down or sent to 3rd party vendors to run.
good,"Each site has a different culture. Benefits are decent, but are generally based on east coast/south east. Main sites have a lot of amenities, minimal every where else."
good,"When Capital On acquired HSBC, all existing employees were told their jobs were safe.  Approximately 3500 of those positions were eliminated within 2 years."
good,"typical day log in and take calls.  Management is out of source some have no clue what they are doing.  The culture is anyone can work there. "
good,The technical departments are segregated in a way that it is difficult to get anything done in a reasonable timeframe. Management is far removed from the actual state of the environment
good,Buena comodida de trabajo y un ambiente aceptable de trabajo
good,"It was a typical banking environment with sometimes goals that were too aggressive to meet. Hours were alright, but a lot of time they would be extremely slow in mornings."
good,"The typical day would start at 9 am, I covered the metro of Tampa Florida by phone. My focus was to stay in in contact with the higher level management levels in the dealerships, GM CEO etc. My job was to book as many auto loans per day as possible. I had to use my sales skills and persuasion at every level. I maintained a steady pipeline of business by keeping the brand in front of them daily. This was a inside and outside job. I traveled 50% of the time. I enjoyed the relationships, and the people that I encountered, some of which are dear friends today."
good,The company offers many opportunities for recent college graduates.  If you have a degree and want to obtain a title it is a great place to start. It is nice to be able to start a company and have benefits.
good,"They weren't a bad company, but I would say they didn't have the best management in certain branches. A lot of micromanagement took place and promotions were given to ""certain"" individuals."
good,"I was a temp to hire but for some reason after they hired over 60+ people they laid me off, after they asked if I wanted to more to days and then on top of that they waited until the my last day off to let me know, loved the job though."
good,Capital One is a wannabe big time company but the stalwart old guard can't get out of the way and squash innovation.  Cutting back in the wrong places
good,"Not a good place to work. Management is clueless. the palce is full of temporay workers that have been working there for over 2 years with no Chance of getting hired permanently."
good,"*call at least 150 customers, leave voicemail, come up with solutions to get customer on track with car loans"
good,"Depends on what team are you in, your experience may vary. But increasingly work life balance is not very good and the expectations are very high. In a lot of meetings you will be asked to go home and spend your personal hours to learn new technology or attend meet ups etc."
good,It was a great place to work but the job itself was very stressful. Very long hours they treat workers like slaves. I would not return to Capital One bank call center by any means.
good,"Team was fun, management was fair. They did a lot as a team offsite for morale and the management was respectful of their employees and contractors"
good,Could use better manager and have better safety  and better cleaning as well and also could be more space and better desk room. Also better equipment for agents
good,"I worked at Capital One twice on a one year contract with a staffing service. My first assignment was a good one. The supervisor didn't want to contact the staffing agency to hire us on as permanent. That was out the window. Second assignment was good, until the attitudes of regular employees changed. I also worked another position where you weren't thoroughly trained, but the second you give the customer the wrong information, you're chastised like a child. It's ok for contractors to do all the work, but no reward. When it comes to company functions, contractors get a half day of work, or the day off because they're not employees. If the agency who assigned me to Capital One ever call me for another assignment, I will kindly refuse."
good,"This is good place to work with highly professional team."
good,a decent place to work for short time. management focuses too much on sales and not enough on customer service. good coworkers and benefits though.
good,"Productive workplace that always tries and mostly fails at maintaining work and life balance. another word, word, word and yet another word"
good,"Company can be great to work for while you have a job there.  The benefits and pay are excellent.  Also, many different fun events, meals, etc.  Layoffs are very frequent.  Company is only worried about meeting certain budgets work and are not concerned with how the implementation can affect employees or customers.  Changes are nearly impossible to implement as there are so many layers and processes in place that making a simple update is extremely frustrating."
good,Capital One walks the walk when in comes to providing great service to their customers.  They are very focused on doing the right thing.
good,I performed collection duties as temp agent contracted to GC Services COAF department. Call center duties using a dialer and manual dialing. This job was very stressful due to fact to make bonuses you had to fill time quotas company quotas and contract quotas while trying to keep to a script and keeping a calm demeanor. The work environment was tiresome and breaks and lunches too short for the 10 hr days required. Office politics played big part in advancement and i was not willing to continue on after my 4 month contract ended.
good,Pay is very low the work that is desired out of their agents. Work can be fun at times with the amount of cases you review daily
good,bosses and coworker were good to work with as a team. I moved that is the reason for no longer working there. I do miss working there.
good,Managed accounts in over 13 branches in the Alexandria/Springfield area. Train employees on sale to service pitches. Performed outreach to local businesses to gain prospects for future business.
good,"Great place to work with job and work life balance. Flexible working hours, with excellent working conditions. Support staff and management are engaged and provide opportunities to be successful. Most challenging aspect of the job is the frequent change in management."
good,"Start sellecting tickets in the morning. By 9am you are knee deep in something either werid, disorganized, or just plain wrong. By lunch time you are looking for the hour you can go. That's if you get a chance to eat lunch at a normal time. 3 oclock comes around you are looking to finish up any last minute details that may need explaining further down the road. At 5 you are so releived that be walking out the door."
good,"Great team culture and training, products are superior however some managers are terrible and micro manage their bankers. A ton of politics within managers and executive leaders."
good,"They give good bonus', however, the raises are marginal.  It is very hard to advance. The people are that work their are very nice and hardworking."
good,"I have found this company to be very structured and very detailed. Which is good to have structure however, didn't seem to accept people in how they communicate and behave independently."
good,"Highly structured management processes with an emphasis on talent development and serving the customer. The development of leadership and managerial skill sets of the front line leadership staff is a main priority. Identifying process improvements needed to provide outstanding customer experience. Planning, organizing, and executing highly complex projects and initiatives to improve processes and procedures. Creation of call flows and call routing to improve service levels, customer service scores, and overall effectiveness. Team oriented environment with an emphasis on collaboration and team goals. Best part of Capital One is the people - great team."
good,"Job is ok if you can remember how it was in high school, the people are the worst to work with, management sucks, No raises, they work you like slaves"
good,My typical day involves helping customer with any online issues that they may be experiencing when they visit our website. In our environment as a team we all work together to resolve our cardholder concerns or issues which is our main priority. I enjoy the most speaking with our customers and assiting them and knowing I ended our conversation with a smile and great experience
good,"If your not from Virginia, you will get replaced. They do not care for tenure."
good,"----No job movement or advancement"
good,"A bank on the rise. Very little opportunity for advancement, poor work/life balance, great mission, but does not carry down to employee-level"
good,"It was a great job, they payed their associates their holidays and they payed really good, the break room was awesome too bad i was just a tempt"
good,Went through several member of upper management in a very short time.  Very stressful work enviroment.  Okay pay but great benefits.
good,"Capital One is full of a lot of perks however, there is a lot of waste for fun activities and the like. As a result, massive layoffs often come as a surprise. If you are a remote worker it is three times harder to stay in the look as out of site out of mind."
good,"What I enjoyed most was being able to connect with the various landlords, property accountants."
good,"No comments at this time other then, Very interesting and challenging"
good,"Capital One provides multiple and diverse opportunities for financial services professionals.  I learned a lot about growing a business, managing people both directly and indirectly, and analyzing business opportunities."
good,Capital One is a fun place to work. But I guess any place would be fun when the people are great. I enjoy it most of the time. It gets stressful when they don't staff the branch properly. Management doesn't know how to schedule and is oblivious to problems behind the teller line.
good,"Capital One use to be a great place to work, but a lot have changed over the years that made it a hard job to work for."
good,Good Company pay not comparable to what other company's pay for the same work.
good,"Processing payroll, making weekly and Saturday schedules, scheduling PTO for 18 associates. Audit compliant, while servicing customers with problems or new banking products. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers and the family atmosphere. The hardest part was being micro mananaged."
good,management is still evolving
good,I liked the people I worked with. Management was laking at this branch
good,"Working in the console is very fast paced and demanding. It requires you to be able to multitask events and demands great people skills. You can expect to spend your day answering calls about security issues from employee's, writing incident reports, doing key control, taking an event log and acknowledging and checking the status of various alarms from various sites all over the united states."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my day was having the ability to challenge my staff to perform at high levels while satisfying and exceeding customer expectations. Promoting a positive work environment, hiring the right staff, and consistent performance management, and strong leadership skills are critical to success."
good,"Not a bad place to work, however management there is very poor. Doesn't care about associate's."
good,"I worked as a drive-through teller for one year. The teller manager was so terrible, she pretty much is the reason so many people don't stay long at this job. I was only hired as part-time, and worked 6 days a week, without a single Saturday off the entire year I worked there. The drive-through was sometimes ran by only one or two people, and cars would be lined up for a mile. I was forced sometimes to take 2-hour and even 3-hour lunches, so I could both open and close, without going over my hours."
good,A typical day would be start at 8am to collect from customers across Canada. Learning is always a ongoing process because the credit world and companies always changing. My co-workers were nice and management was very professional and was always there for the employees. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unsatisfied customers but the customers you do help makes it all worth while at the end of the day.
good,"Good stable company, just not a lot of opportunity for growth."
good,"The first 12 years were wonderful. I loved going to work. As the company has grown into Banking the culture and environment has changed. The associates are not rewarded for knowledge but for who they know. The environment has gone from focusing on the people to that of what have you done for us today attitude. Pressure from senior level management has increased to the point of exhaustion, stress, negativity instead of the positive culture there once was. It is/was not the intent but rather just how it has become with the competitive market."
good,a day filled with customer service.I've gained great customer service skills along with a new outlook on the finacial part of life. My co-works were the best to work with. The hardest part of the job was cross selling. The most enjoyable part were interacting with the customers
good,I worked for Capital One for 5 years. I rate the company 3 out of 5 stars.
good,"The company has great benefits, some caring staff. The pay is not great to start out and the incentives could be better but all in all it is a nice place to work if you are interested in banking and finance."
good,this was a good job but it just didnt pay enough. not enough hours offerd to work. couldnt get over time.
good,Management truly tries to do the proper things. Has had to face many hurdles but is making headway
good,Capital One is a growing bank that is focus on customer service and revenue. They value employees with outstanding achievements and acknowledge the commitment the employee brings. They are environmental friendly company and also helps out the community by giving back.
good,"The company itself is cutting edge.  Some of the pros were definitely the compensation, the benefits were great (Health, Dental, Vision, 401k, PTO and ESOP).  The company was not afraid to spend money on employee morale!  There were amazing give-a-ways, up and close meetings with the CEO, career training centers, etc.  "
good,I enjoyed working in a diverse working environment with multi-level managers and newly college grads.  Definitley an atmosphere to develop and learn..
good,Great company with good benefits.  On site amenities are incredible.  Capital One takes pride in offering the best perks of most any company out there.
good,Provided good experience for future jobs. Management was a hit or miss regarding interaction with employees. Every person had different experiences and opinions.
good,"I have worked for this company for seven years. You do not need to know much at all to get ahead in certain departments. All you need is a ""great brand"". They have manager meetings in which they talk about/compare agents. Being promoted is definitely a popularity contest."
good,My job was relocated to Plano. They are moving to the Cafe environment. Closed most of the business banking in the community markets. Pay and benefits were great!
good,"I was one of the top performers on my team and was ""terminated"" without reason. When I asked why, my supervisor was unable to say anything and just kept reading her job separation script and told me to sign severance paperwork. I called TWC (Texas Workforce Commission) and explained the situation when filing for unemployment. TWC conducted an investigation to tell me that I was separated from the company when they offered me a severance package and not fired and would be eligible for unemployment. Overall good company. Bad management."
good,"It was great until I became ill. It just felt like everyone was there to ""support"" you until you weren't able to come in because of a medical condition. They were not willing to work with me and I was told that I had to be let go. My first manager was an amazing man. I loved his team, but then I moved to someone else's team, and then she quit. Then I was placed on another person's team, and she left as well. It just seemed like the turnover in management was really bad."
good,My department is all about brown nosing. Kiss as much butt as possible that's what gets you promoted.... Doesn't matter if you are qualified or not.  They don't promote talent they drive it away.
good,I was with Auto Finance. They have strongly taken a turn away from the consumer and employee and feels much more focused on share holder. As such they are slowly slipping away from following the needs of the market in pursuit of what they feel is reimagaining auto lending.
good,The work environment is cool with all of the activities that they have from contests to meeting and bingo and gift card give always but it doesn’t add enough to balance the issue with advancement
good,"Working from home was a plus but you need to work in VA to get the full experience. Compensation was generous if you had the right senior leadership.  "
good,Working for capital one allowed me opportunities to experience big corporate business. It taught me a lot and provided me with some great benefits. It was a long commute so I was happy to find something closer to home.
good,"It's banking, what can I say. I was doing it for almost 7 years before accepting an offer here and was wowed in any other way. I was there during the time they decided to cut the ABM roles which was a very difficult time. They held a national conference call with all the BM's to prep us on how to have the conversations with the ABM's to explain they will no longer have a role at Capital One. "
good,Way too many changes for a company that has too many employees. There many shifts you can get into but communication is not good their. Culture is good. Its the employees who make the company. Very Disappoined in the way things were handled.
good,"The boss was not nice and not helpful but condescending instead. She would explain something and treat me like I was stupid. She would train ending with ""this is clear as mud for you isn't it""?"
good,Their so called Performance Management is a joke. It turns people against each other just to look better than they are. Very little sympathy if you are having problems of any kind. Dont be off ill!!
good,"They shut down a lot of branches and let a lot of employees go, which was sadly to hear  n see but I guess they had to do what they had to do! But I'd definitely like to go back at capital one if I get a chance"
good,I worked as a contractor there a few times. Just filling in for the overflow of work they couldn't catch up on. The work hours are very flexible. No dedicated work station and had to bring my own laptop.
good,"Good environment, not stressful but the pay does not add up to the amount of work they expect you to do. They promote people based on a faulty ranking system. Again, pay is not equal to the work that you do."
good,"Capital One is all about who you know, so as soon as you get in the door start networking and kissing up. The easiest way to advance is the same as in high school, be popular with anyone and everyone above you. So if you are an introvert fake it or accept a slow rise if any at Capital One. Management is more often offered to those that get in good with miring managers etc.There are the unicorns that get to be managers because they are simply good at their job but more often than not its the kissing up that got them the job.Pay and benefits are awesome and all the career help is there so they can say they offer it."
good,Capital One was a good place to work until I decided to use their educational benefits and then they did not want to work with the schedule that I have changed multiple times. Manager are okay but favoristim is very much seen.
good,Does provide flexible schedules needs to be more proactive about hiring need to change test to be considered for job due to employees taking test for ppl test has not been updated. Test should be taken in front of person interviewing but update test . Capital one is hiring undesirable employees no longer professional place to work!
good,I wouldn't recommend this company for anyone with real responsibilities.  They weren't very flexible and very stressful job. They give a lot of false hope during the beginning.
good,Contract position but great company for advancement. Management was efficient and helpful. Would highly recommend. Company's site is also pleasant and clean.
good,It's enough to support you if you live at home with your parents or just need some extra cash. Not enough money to deal with the stress and responsibility that was given St that time
good,They will fire you for any little thing. Unless you kiss alot of butt or related to someone there. They really don't care if u are a good person and do what you are supposed to do. One small mistake or mishap and you are fired. They're systems mess up alot and you will be held responsible for call avoidance.
good,"Had a not-so-good expereince there, not sure if it is universal.  The culture at the various levels of management seemed to be different at each stage."
good,They only treat you right if you’re in their leadership friend circle. Otherwise the company as a whole is better than some of the managers they have.
good,"It was a part time job, however the pay was low and management was constantly breathing down your neck. Managers have unrealistic expectations of workers."
good,Capital One provides opportunities for advancement within the organization with an emphasis on self development . During 25 years I built long lasting relationships that I will never forget. During a very crucial time in my life when my husband was diagnosed with Throat and Lung Cancer I was well supported by my immediate leadership team. As with everything due to reorganization the players change.
good,The company is willing to take big risks for big rewards.  Project teams often accomplish great things.  Worked with some of the most talented people in the industry.  The trade off is work life balance is seriously impacted. If you enjoy working with type A people and accomplishing great things and are willing to make that work/life sacrifice then you might stay for 10+ years!
good,They were very generous with the training budget. Books and classes were easy to get. I had issues as a technical person trying to rise up the ranks without managing others. They compared me to other managers and held me to their standards and ignored my wealth of technical expertise.
good,had a lot of fun working there. just needed more advancement opportunities. would recommend for anyone just needing a job.would not mind working in different departments within the company
good,Capital One has too many changes and turnovers with not enough room for growth with individuals who have been there. Capital One also had a horrible pay structure.
good,nice place to work. focused on credit cards. Techically ahead than other banks. investment in design and UX. San francisco location is hard because headquarters are in DC Area
good,"If you're looking for a job that's not a career, this job is the job for you. If you're looking for growth then I suggest looking elsewhere. Capital One is really great for people with youthful energy and into technology."
good,"If you love that then this is the place for you.  Find a good mentor who is looking to move up the ladder, align yourself to their values and projects, and work hard to stay along for the ride."
good,"Managers are not all on same page."
good,"Frequent off-site events as well as onsite.  "
good,"This was my first job and it was pretty steady. I became very close to everyone in the office. We were like a family and after that portion of the company sold the portfolio and we were transitioned to no employment, we've kept in touch over 10 years later."
good,There are too many clicks. Job security is not there!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Job/Work balance is better than other companies I have worked for.  The best part about the company is the compensation and benefits.
good,"A typical day at work was working from home, on the telephone 85% of the day working with employees resolving employee relations and medical accommodation concerns. Also working closely with management and legal to ensure the best recommendation and HR solutions were provided. The hardest part of the job was working lots of hours, the best part of the job is working remotely and having lots of flexibility with my work schedule."
good,"Fun job if you can manage ""your"" accounts as you deem fit since you know them best.  "
good,Micromanaged as well as no job security  they don’t promote within and the employee survey they claim to be anonymous they reslly are not  leadership gets the results by location and it is very easy to figure out and they retaliate against you and you will never know
good,Constant reorg displaces employees.  Longevity and loyalty is not rewarded.  Scale of work and peers were great but management was not supportive to employees
good,"Capital One has gone through extensive Identity changes in the last several years, most recently; they laid off all of their Home Loan employees, Wealth Management employees, Many Branch Managers, Business Banking employees and Mid-Management level employees as well. "
good,it was great pay overall. the best thing i would say is the pay we were payed very well from the time being the pay was very nice and i really enjoyed the pay
good,Not a bad place to work great advancement opportunities and work environment. Great benefits and discounts I would recommend others to apply. Starting pay is on the low side compared to competitors.
good,"A good many free meals, and team builders. Was tough to get ahead when HR loses test results, and applications for roles, and gives you tests incorrect for the roles being applied for. Managers can turn you down to apply for a role, just to keep you in their area. I saw preferential treatment given to others at my expense."
good,Worked for the company 9 months.  Had high turnover and reported to 4 different managers in that time.  Extremely poor management heavy on work politics and not very transparent when it came to promotions or advancement.  Decisions seemed to be made on whether you were liked rather than what you had accomplished or done.
good,Never know what problems or issue you will walk into on any given day. unneeded stress if problems were addressed when reported.  I work weekends / nights and most times finding after hour support needed can be quite hard. Management support could be much better and proper communication needs to improve.
good,"This company is getting rid of several big and small titles based on wanting to keep up with technology. I was with them almost ten years and was laid off along with all assistant managers, DOCS, etc"
good,"Capital One provides tremendous compensation and benefits, but in return note that job security is lacking and change is constant.  Quality of job depends on your manager and your manager's manager."
good,"My last manager should have never been a manager.  She had no idea how to speak to her employees.  I have witnessed several co-works cry and quit because of her.  Don't get me wrong I have had some excellent managers also, she was the last one I had before I left.  She had been reported several times to upper management and nothing had been done."
good,"I gained many transferable skills at Capital One, but I left in order to complete my college education. I value the experience that I gained while working at Capital One."
good,"Great company to work with but recent management changes no longer value people and forcing people to resign by lowering reviews.  Location is important, make sure your manager and his/her direct manger are in the same location.  The company management is truly believe in co-location and team has to be co-located.  Unfortunately with frequent business re-alignment, you may aligned with a team that is not co-locate and your position may be eliminated."
good,I have worked for Capital one for 6 years and loved what I did. After holding this position I realized that I wanted to do more than ach disputes. I felt I wasn't using my talents to its full capabilities. I am a person who likes to engage with clients and deepen relationships.
good,"Could be some best talents' worst nightmares -- rigid seniority system, fraternizing environment,  few lateral move opportunities. And very competitive middle management in general."
good,"Management ran the company into the ground in less than 5 years since Investing was acquired from ING DIRECT. No innovation, focus was taken off Customer feedback, and Employees hired during these five years were less and less capable to complete their daily tasks and stay accountable as corporate training positions and internal reviews that kept employees honest were eliminated. It is literally like watching a slow motion train wreck with upper management praising the process all along the way during corporate dog and pony all hands on deck meetings."
good,"Working at this company can be stressful, but also enjoyable at the same time. The management could be better because they need to have knowledge of the position"
good,"Having worked for the company for over 12 years, I can say I loved my job. I loved working on the phones while sometimes hectic it was very rewarding."
good,I have nothing further to add about this job. It was an overall unfortunate experience and almost every person I know who worked there was fired or quit.
good,Working at home was a plus but there were challenges to working virtually but I feel I did a great job with my team and management  Hardest part of the job was not having face to face conversations.
good,stressful position monthly goal requirement. some people are not able to meet under the stress. too many responsibilities on one individual. should break down some of the work into different departments.
good,"It was a good place to work ,but they had a change in policies that weren't customer service friendly. When you're used to helping customers solve problems and you're not able to anymore it's too stressful"
good,Was a great experince however due to structural changes in the company there have been many branch closures and and most employees were laid off. Too many changes.
good,Didn't enjoy it.  Had to constantly be logged into the phone and calls came one after the other.  If you take to long logging the after call they would write you up.
good,"My co-workers are great, friendly, very knowledgeable, and most of all hard-working. However, the politics and management culture are the worse. It's breeding too much anxiety due to constant hiring and firing policy. Lucky you if you have a relax, appreciative, and supporting manager. Otherwise, you're hook for a roller coaster ride on your job security especially with managers that are schizophrenic about their own job as well."
good,culturally it is a very laid back place to work. advancements are a bit tricky to move up if you are not in a ventral area like Virginia or elsewhere. salary could be better for employees
good,"They hire temp staff and make them work and entire year with the promice of permenant hire  out benefits and can let you go at any moment, there is alot of favoritism also, if you are a temp or contract yu sift can change at any moment and are required to show up with out ample notice"
good,A great place to learn at working at a call center.  But the most stressful of jobs.   Constantly pressured to keep up with statistics that were extreme. Time monitored when not on the phone. No time to socialize with co-workers.  All business.  Very strict.
good,"The days were long with high expectations. More than not my immediate manager was not available because he worked different days and hours. That was a mis-match. I was left to work on my own most of the time which was not my ideal choice (personally)."
good,"Excellent benefits and pay, but you will work hard for them.  This is a fantastic place to work for young people.  Especially if you don't have children or need much of a home life. It's great that you are allowed to work from home, but you will be working from home constantly when you should just be home.  The work life balance means more that you will be working as a course of life than having a balance.  You are always on.  "
good,ING was very efficient and completely paperless.  Good group of people with strong work ethic.  I don't know much about Capital One since the completion of the ING absorption.
good,"A typical day at Capital One consisted of over 100 transactions, and at least five disgruntled customers.  Although at Capital one I learned to adapt.  Everyday it seemed like something about the company was always changing.  They were a financial institution that prided, it self on staying ahead of the technological curve (mobile deposit, multi-denomination atms, apps, etc.)  Working for Capital One definitely felt like working for a larger corporation.  The management and staff relationship was fairly poor, and there was hardly any communication.  The hardest part of the job was working 25 hrs a week right out of college, thinking I deserved more.  The most enjoyable part was working with great friends."
good,Recent years have seen COF devolve into a more cut-throat environment (each department is pressured to have associates on the chopping block for each quarterly review. And once an associate is identified as struggling they are basically written off and not given a real chance to overcome opportunities)
good,"The community of people who work are great. The rest is a business with its up and downs. Companies that move outside of US and displace employees after years of service are always in the wrong, just to save a buck."
good,"Capital One is a very unique place of employment."
good,My district manager was very vindictive and had her favorites. Since day one I was hired as a BM to be moved out of her district and get her personal friend in. No recourse or direct paths were given to the employees to express concern.
good,"Capital One is a great place to work and has a great work/life balance... on most teams. Unfortunately, like anywhere else, you can be put on a team that doesn't allow this, making it hard to feel excited about the work, coming in, and having to deal with bad management."
good,"Worked there for two years and had about 7 different managers and worked for two different locations. They genuinely do not care about their employees and don't recognize the people who dedicate their time above the call of duty. Laid a lot of departments off and are ""cleaning house"". Better institution for if you're a customer rather than employee."
good,"Very forward-thinking vision for the company at the highest levels of management.  It doesn't necessarily translate to lower and mid-level management.  Apply at the highest level you are qualified to work at the onset, if possible."
good,Good Company . Good benefits. An increase in salary ever year bases on performance. Diverse company as far as employees and  good volunteer events. Lots of volunteer events of giving back to the community.
good,"A typical day is taking inbound banking inquiries such as transferring funds and offering beneficial products to customers. Not that much management around since they are constantly changing. There was an awesome co- worker atmosphere, the hardest part was the poor work/life balance. They said that I would not have to close for more than sixth months, but it has been over ten months. The most enjoyable part was making the calls fun and interacting with the customers on a more personable level."
good,"A typical day is spent working with my team on a variety of interesting and challenging projects.  Management has been very good in helping us learn new skills and make our team stronger. "
good,"This bank is a corporation.  They focus a lot on sales, not what the customer needs or requires.  I waited for six weeks for my first paycheck.  The corporation is so big it is difficult to feel like an individual.  This corporation does not really care about its employees."
good,Loved my coworkers but with all the changes there is now little to no advancement opportunities. All about the culture and promoting the brand but the changes are now limiting.
good,"The pay was very solid, especially for a college student. Get hourly wage plus incentive at the end of each month. Job gets really repetitive after a couple of months. Good co-workers but can feel as management views you as a number rather than a valued employee."
good,"Their a great company, I feel the need to be going different directions. The employees are great, the calls are not fun, I get yelled at, we are changing things all the time, the polices change alot. They try their best to please everyone and it's just not working out."
good,"Felt like a bait and switch, great benefits, team spirit all up front, manager was difficult to work with and made for a very stressful environment"
good,"Overall my experience at Capital One was good. Management fails to realize that with the trending of fraud, that more work is required of agents and that the pay should be increased accordingly. People get paid a lot more money to do a lot less work than my co workers and I did. Their demeanor and happiness with their position showed through their attitude. The people in my department were always angry, stressed, and worried about how much work was going to be heaped upon them, that was never before required and could've been easily dispersed among other departments."
good,"Teller, all duties required are fine.  Customers are great and I enjoy interacting with them.  Capital One let go all assistant managers and did away with the position.  My branch has experienced manager turnover and lack of consistent leadership which has been difficult.  We have not had consistent reviews and the ones done have not been by managers actually working with us on a daily basis."
good,"My typical day working as a bank teller at Capital One is greeting and servicing customers with withdrawals, deposits, credit card transactions and answering any customer questions to the best of your knowledge."
good,Great company to work with. Love the activities and volunteer work  that we are able to do within the company. I love being able to work with customers.
good,Capital one is a fun place to work.  The downfall is all the fun stuff we do it takes away from the employee's getting raises.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to help educate customers on being financial stable. Its never too early to plan for the future. The hardest part was not knowing which policy and procedure to follow on any given day. This was my first time in this position so I was learning everything. Closing mortgages and HELOC's was a struggle for me. I worked with some of the most helpful and genuinely good hearted individuals. Management was great before they removed the assistant manager position. The branch manager liked to use job intimidation and micro manage EVERY aspect of the position. If I was hired to do this job please trust me to do so. Advise or coach if I am not performing correctly. I learned so much about HELOC's, LOC, mortgages and small business accounts. I still have much to learn. A typical day consisted of opening personal/small business bank accounts. Use  Making sure all documents were signed properly and scanned, assisting with customer disputes. Having that needs based conversation to uncover hidden opportunities. Always lending first."
good,"Its good place to work, they are growing, job satisfaction will be there middle management is a task, but the work culture and higher management is good"
good,"It can be a fun and growing place to work, however theres consistent turnover from higher management leading to uncertainty with the job."
good,"Capital One Bank has great benefits, average pay, and I have really valued my time with the company.  However in areas where Capital One does not carry a large market share they generally do not invest much money into the company which creates staffing issues and consolidations."
good,A typical work day includes daily interaction with customers. My co-workers were very friendly and knowledgeable. Overall I liked mostly everything about the job.
good,Capital One was a nice company to work for and they definitely got my foot in the door of the workplace; although management was very disorganized. Also due to the upward advancement of technological advancement there was no job security.
good,"Great staff, great success in time there. Great loyal customers. Customer service was number one for us! Technology not where it needed to be and the hiring and training process took way to long."
good,Fast paced learning environment with interacting with Customer base on the phone.  Teamwork and Individual performance contributes to the overall goal.  Some red tape and politics as expected with a large company.  Most enjoyable were some of the bonds that were created through working together.
good,"When I started at Cap1, it was fun, energetic, and rewarding. The first 2 years were awesome. We had OT and when we stayed late we were provided lunch and dinner. I barely had to cook as there was so much food. Rewarding with prizes and gift cards. I had so many Wal-Mart, Target, and other gift cards I could use to pay for other stuff as their pay was minimal. Recognition is great, not forced. As I moved around to the more corporate areas, things changed. They are supposed to be people managers but they are not for the people and lack communication, skills, and knowledge of their business unit. If you have any issue, associate relations is unhelpful. All you can do is put in on file, nothing happens. There is not one consistent business culture, credit card does their own thing and banking is doing their thing, that is where the most improvement is needed. I am not for micromanaging but senior leaders need to micromanage the managers. The best part are the people, they do hire great people but they do not utilize them. Advancement is slow and bureaucratic. I suggest that you not go to the banking side for the next few years. The CEO needs to really take a good look at the lower mgmt, that is why his vision is failing. They are becoming a tech bank but are forgetting about the people, great for anybody in IT. They need your help. It is not a bad place, most people get stuck for the vacation and 401k. That was not enough for me, I value advancement, learning, and recognition. The bonus structures are weird, another HR issue. Overall, it depends on where you work. Normally having"
good,Interesting trainers and environment and not really in a good way either! Had to fight to learn things and they were not very organized during training with computer access etc.
good,"I have worked in two different business units and there is definitely a disparity in the areas of corporate culture, work ethic, work/life balance, support of Capital One's mission, etc. They have no qualms about laying people off with complete disregard for time in position or years of service. One great positive is that they do hire a large number of college grads, which provides them with a wonderful opportunity to apply their education practically. I also find their benefits to be both diverse and the quality superior to many other places I have friends working."
good,This company is ok to work for if you can devote your entire life to it. If you have a family it is very hard to balance work and home life.
good,I am an escalated department representative. I love my co workers. The most challenging part of my job is not being equipped with some things to help me work effectively.
good,"Capital One has top notch employee benefits"
good,"Fast paced environment where change is constant. Although, there were very challenging task at hand, the greatest reward at the end of the day was knowing that you provided a solution to someone's issue."
good,This place is a fast paced environment. Things are always changing and it is really hard to keep up. It is great there are cafeterias on site because you can't always get away for lunch breaks.
good,"Capital One is a great company. Awesome benefits package, although they could pay better. Local management can be a nightmare depending on where you are placed. Most new hires have to begin as a part-time teller (32 hrs./week, avg.), and full-time positions can be hard to come by, as branch managers get to choose after another interview process. Advancement is difficult, but not impossible."
good,"forced distribution of performance mgmt"
good,"Capital One is good company that offer great benefits to their employees, however there is a huge inconsistency in management. The life span of a branch manager at a particular branch is no more than a year before they are removed and placed elsewhere. Also compared to other large retail banks capital one operational software is extremely outdated and slow which make being a teller a bit frustrating."
good,"Fun environment with fun people, at the end of the day helping the customers with their issues makes it all worth while."
good,Management breathe down your back during the work day. Constantly trying to intimidate you. Love the new system the job itself is easy sales goals are easy to accomplish just wish management would allow you to do your job hassle free.
good,"Good work life balance, but not much else. "
good,"Capital One can be a fun place to work depending on your manager. Sometimes there are managers who do not have their associates' best interests in mind when making decisions and this often goes unnoticed and uncorrected by senior leadership. Other than this, Capital One has recently increased the starting salary for many entry-level positions but the changes to the bonus structure for those caught in the middle positions makes the pay significantly less than it should be. The benefits are decent other than high insurance premiums and co-pays."
good,"Variety of roles and wonderful job rotation "
good,"short term position held through temp agency,very fun place open for great oppurtunties, enjoyed assisting customers with solving there problems. Staff was very welcoming including management."
good,Give me a call  and I'll be more than gladly to discuss or answer any questions that you may have
good,"Incentives are good compared with other banks.  However, I do not think there is a good life balance."
good,"The work is okay, not hard to do. Working from when the doors open and until there are no more customers. Can be very overwhelming and stressful. Sometimes doing 2 or 3 jobs at a time while still helping customers. Co-workers keep to themselves."
good,"Since, I didn't have a job, I need something right away.  The pay is not much at all to live off of, but it beats having zero dollars in your pocket!!!"
good,A typical day at work is busy most of the time. I research Capital One account numbers and then process the payments. Some of my co-workers are cool. A couple of my co-workers like to keep mess going on. There is really nothing hard about my job and the most enjoyable is making my production.
good,I liked the flexibility of being part time and working from home
good,"I enjoys going security so it was ok, really didn't like working over night.."
good,"Sales culture not to aggressive, reasonable goals to specific branch locations. However management was terrible. Most branch managers are incompetent or either to new to know how things work with in Capital One because there is so much change. Seems like the prefer outside hires rather than promote from with in."
good,"Fun atmosphere, plenty of room for advancement for entry level reps. One of the best places to work to get your foot in the door. Hands down, best benefits for students and small families."
good, 
good,worked as an Closer in the REO department. The role is great chance to learn about both parts of the loan origination and mortgage servicing.
good,In the department i worked in the immediate management was at times not supportive of the staff. For the last couple of years no one promoted from the staff even if they had manager responsible. Manager did not provide enough help to get the job done.
good,It would be a great place if the wages werent so low. The culture is fine as long as you fit in and are always positive. Otherwise you will get micromanaged .
good,"learned a lot about the banking world. typical day would be to answer over 100 inbound calls and resolve banking issues such as overdrafts fees, lost / srolten cards, balanace inq. etc."
good,"If you are a people person, this job is for you. You get to interact with people of all walks on a daily basis. Networking is also amazing."
good,"A typical day includes mainly inbound call centre work and data entry, answering phone calls to customers looking to activate their credit card, answer any queries and deal with any complaints."
good,"very stressful place to work, co workers were easy to get along with"
good,"A typical day at work was pleasant. I learned how to use banking systems and master Microsoft suite and Microsoft Outlook. Management wasn't the best, It was a lot of uncertainty with the managers.Most of the time they didn't have the answer to some questions or would tell us to figure it out and make it work; it became a problem sometimes because customers would say the branch said 1 thing and we are saying another. The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers and the office perks. We had a lot of contest and pot lucks which was very nice but not every manager participates."
good,"A typical day can be easy going depending on the amount of customers you have to see and my attitude to the day. Management can work on transparency and lack of favoritism and better communication on all levels. Co- workers are easy to get along with for the most part. I agree to disagree on issues to make life easier but always speak my mind,I tend to be the voice of the empolyees. Hardest part of my job would be the large number of clients to see on given days strecthing each assoiciate thin with less than par technologies to work with. Most enjoyable part of my job are the customers that Ive gotten to know."
good,Be prepared to work six days a week.
good,"A typical work day consist of checking general legders and making sure branch is in compliance with regulations. Managing staff and handling customer complaints and satistfying their needs.I also have to monitor our production of sales on a day to day basis to ensure branch meets its monthly goals. Coaching staff to produce numbers.The hardest part of the jobs is producing our goals when lack of cliental. The most enjoyable part is the teamwork mindset to meet our goals monlthly, quarterly and annually."
good,Working at Capital One is very exciting. The President of the bank continually moves the company forward which is constantly evolving.
good,"For a Typical Day at work will be planned according to the calendar detail, Performing Huddle to get the focus day start, take commitments from team members for the day. Perform Mid Day Brief to see if any coaching is necessary. I learn new management skills everyday as every person in the co-workers is different and also follow the GAIN and GROWTH Model for Coaching and Sales performance with the sales associates. Managing the Branch Operations Activity to make sure the branch is in compliance."
good,"Pleasant place to work, flexible scheduling, good sales incentives."
good,"Go to work greeted by friendly faces. They enjoy your company because you actually talk to them. Come in sit down and set up you workstation and have all your applications ready for your first call and the ones after. Break/Lunch/Break…look forward to those especially if you just dealt with an irate customer. Shift done…say good night to every one you know, if they are there. Go home."
good,"I was a transferred associate from Capital One's recent purchase from HSBC. The second day after the transfer we were advised that our jobs would be gone by the end of 2012. The job itself is enjoyable. I constantly review customer accounts for suspicious activity and attempt to contact them when red flags appear on an account. If necessary, I process new credit cards for the card holders and submit fraud claims so we can begin the process of recovering funds and finding potential suspects."
good,"Too many reorgs everyday, Salary and benefits are OK, No Work Life Balance, Leadership is not great as developers have been made directors and managers."
good,"The company offers great learning opportunities. It can be challenging to advance, and receive the compensation that matches the job responsibilities."
good,"Not a great pace to work."
good,"Short stints are better, but don't plan on a career here. Come and learn what you can and take elsewhere. Bring your patience and a high level of tolerance for lots of political correctness. Race and gender seems to have become more valued than experience and competence."
good,"Instead of financial advancement, the department instead chooses to give out monthly cupcakes, cheesy carnivals, snacks, and quarterly team outings.  "
good,Started out great had a really good team but was split after a great year in numbers never was the same company changed pay policy starting giving less incentives
good,"Capital One is an equal opportunity employer committed to diversity and inclusion in the workplace. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to sex, race, color, age, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, protected veteran status, disability or other protected status. Capital One promotes a drug-free workplace."
good,"Management is horrible where I work. More like high school."
good,"Favoritism is a huge negative. The branch I was assigned to was all female.  If you didn't do what the ""senior"" of the branch wanted you were  an outcast. I came to service the customers and give them the easiest, and most pleasant banking experience ever. That is why I was not a good fit there because I came to provide a service..not make friends. Good luck hope you find the best fit for you."
good,I did not feel challenged. The credit policy was always changing and no one was quite clear on how to get anything done. Seemed as though we spent more time trying to figure out the policy;
good,"Capital One is really good about treating their employees well. They are trying to become more like google with their campus. They have bikes, ping pong tables, yearly festivals and flexible enough schedules. The compensation is fair once you get to mid-management and higher."
good,"Recovery is very stressful, Q&A system changed affecting incentives. Constantly under pressure of losing your job. Chance for advancement or lateral if you can make it to your 9 months."
good,"Very successful company, good pay, but ""it's never good enough"" culture is exhausting.  As a people manager, the performance review process was demoralizing."
good,"Not a good place to work, no work life balance. Stressful chain of command. No chance to advance in regards to promotions and etc. The calls are excessive and barely any breaks"
good,"Capital One was once a great place to work, but since announcing the closing of the Rolling Meadows location, good people have left and continue to leave."
good,"During my time at Capital One, I've seen a fair bit of change and and quite a bit of talent walk out the door recently.  A lot of the teams are working on assignments that they aren't very interested in, and the compensation isn't up to par with the rest of the major tech firms in the area.  Work life balance is fine, though, as long as you're willing to make the move towards having it.  They will let you work as much as you want, but there's no penalty for not working late."
good,When I fist started with the company i was told there was room for advancement. Since September everyone has been placed under the same title. No room for advancements. Most of the managers and bankers were laid off and they are hiring new people probably at a lower wage. The people who were hired as UBAS's do most of the work because they were trained to do teller work and platform work.  The don't train new staff properly and come into the branches knowing nothing. They don't get paid fairly and they do most of the work. Benefits are great and 401K is good. Just wish they paid more.
good,"Very bad management there, treated temps poorly. Was very good on trying to make the workplace relaxed, very competitive work department, enjoyed the fun days."
good,It was an okay job but it's a high roll over rate so never get comfortable because just as quick as they hire you they will get rid of you too. You take inbound and outbound d calls
good,empathie et patience  contribue grandement a ma journée de travail
good,The culture changed drastically from when I started to when I left.  Way to many changes took place that impacted the environment in a negative way.  Company advancement was more about politics then actual job performance.
good,"Great benefits package at start, but no job security. The only constant at Capital One is Change. Every so often we would see a news truck on front of one of the buildings and see online that thousands were let go as jobs went overseas."
good,"A typical day consisted of a wide range from card issues, payment increases, etc. I learned the insides of a credit card company and the importance of credit in the North American market."
good,It was a good job with good pay. Promotion's based on who you know not how good you are.  Lots of management/employee after work fraternizing. Can I be done with this yet
good,"The overall company was family focused and offered a lot to their employees. Generous PTO up front. The benefits offered were okay. The management was horrible and that's why I rated it so low. Although they have HR and are supposed to address employee concerns, they do not, instead the Manager who you may have an issue with is giving the upper hand on your complaint against them."
good,"When I started working for Capital One, it was about doing what was right for the customer. A typical day was setting up your work space, check emails on new information and getting ready to start taking calls.  What I learned is that not all calls are the same.  You have to tailor each call to fit that customer.  If they are stressed or angry, how to calm them down; if they are lonely and just want to talk.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with disruptive customers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when I was able to help someone figure out what was best for them, their credit card and be able to save money."
good,"There's a lot of changes right now so I cannot say how a typical day will be. The trainings are not the best when you start, but you will learn as you go. Too many programs to use that it can be complicated at times to navigate on the systems. A lot of times the teller system will stop working. If you want to start in banking its a great place to start, but there isnt a lot of opportunity to move up when everyone is the same title."
good,"A typical day includes:"
good,I worked there for several years and had a great experience. I learned a lot with the credit card industry. I highly recommend capital one but never saw a chance for advancement.
good,"Overall, a completely different culture to retail banking. The innovative direction was interesting but no room for advancement and branches were poorly managed."
good,"capital one has a lot of potential to be a great place to work but there are a lot of politics when it comes to advancing, your basically at the mercy of your branch manager because there is no true metric system to count sales."
good,"Capital One has changed into a company that pays well, does the right lip service, but treats their employees as interchangeable parts. "
good,"Worked at the call center. The managers did not know how to manage and asked for unrealistic numbers. Extremely taxing on your mental health. Would only recommend for a short time, because it is so competitive to try and get out off of the phones."
good,"Good company culture, but no advancement opportunity in a call center environment. Very repetitive job and will get bored only few months in. The staffs can be trained to have more decision making capacities"
good,Great company to work for sometimes can get overwhelming & stressful! Great pay also with great benefits opportunities for advancement after 1 year of employment
good,"Co-workers / peers were terrific. The organization's management is East-Coast based and embraces Leftist political positions which alienate more than half of associates at the Plano, Texas campus."
good,I loved the culture and all the people at Capital One.  The company followed through to enact the mission statement into every day activities.  I was not able to stay because the pay was too low and I was not offered relocation assistance.
good,"Hard to advance to manager or assistant manager as the positions almost never become available. Very focused on sales goals, and they do not take branch location into consideration."
good,"Actually worked for Sykes for only a short time who formerly represented capital one for call center services, it was okay working there, nothing super cool but nothing super bad."
good,"Typical work day with a couple meetings per day. Weekly team meetings, manager meetings, and project meetings. Culture is pretty cool. Sometimes talking more about the values than living them. Pain points are Mid year and End of year reviews."
good,"As a business loan closer there were heavy deadlines to meet.  The environment and position was extremely busy therefore, additional coaching and training was rare."
good,Honestly you're in a cub all day in Melville. They need an upgrade in the office. It was not ideal if you like to be in a lively environment. I wouldn't want to be boxed in. Many people like this type of environment but not I
good,"When i first started at Capital one, the environment was amazing,very customer friendly. As of recent years, Capital one has many changes that I believe is made to look impressive rather than practical. Going completely digital takes away from people who are unable to follow the digital trend due to language barrier, disability or other issues. With the new changes, comes new policies and procedures that are not clear to associates, long wait time to speak to reps both in branch and the phone. Lastly, the branches are always short staffed. Associates are working 10 plus hours, sometimes without taking full breaks, but have to still maintain their hours 40 or under."
good,"Migrated now to all the latest technologies"
good,Being located in Virginia was a different experience then at any other location.  Beware if located at a site outside of VA.  Being in Illinois put me at a disadvantage and there was no future.  Jobs were eliminated and no consideration for time with company was given.
good,"Responsible for management of administrative policies, business functions strategic execution for associate facing services.  Work/Life balance is important to the culture at Capital One."
good,"While Capital One provides exceptional compensation and benefits, it  rarely makes up for the downsides.  Workloads can be extremely heavy with tight timelines and approximately 70% of workdays are spent in unrelated meetings.  Actual work-life balance is impossible due to the previous statement.  On the upside, they are very o[en to working remotely and flextime."
good,"its hard to advance within this company, definetly something to think about. If your looking to start a promising/ long term career. also be prepared to perform more duties than what the pay would even equate to."
good,Capital One is an evolving company.   The culture has changed from being a company that used to care about its people to one that is not concern whether or not working long hours and no social life is the norm.   I've seen myself and others like being ask to give 110% for long periods of time without realizing the long term affect on health and burn out.
good,"I was a contractor for a short term contract, so I do not have a lot of experience with their cultures.  They were using open spaces for their teams when I worked there."
good,"It is difficult sometimes to stand out in the crowd of many if you are in a production based role.  Career advancements are more about networking than merit and management truly affects one's personal advancement.  There are varying efforts by management to mentor and coach associates and it is hard to see those under managers who give their time more freely help advance their associates while others are stuck in roles without the references and help from their specific manager.  That being said, it is very much up to that person to take their own career by the reigns.  The benefits are the BEST I have had ever.  After first year you can buy an extra week of vacation, to make five weeks paid time off."
good,"Especially on the tech\product side. I think the company is great but you have to find the right balanced, diverse team (if that exists at Capital One) so group think doesn’t play out."
good,"Capital One needs to decide what it wants to be when it grows up.  I enjoyed my time here and learned a lot but during the 10 years that I was employed, i was laid off or had my job eliminated or outsourced 4 different times because executive management decided to change course and not offer a product or service they once embraced.  The culture is great, and they take good care of their employees. . . . until the axe drops and then it's so long and good luck with your next opportunity!"
good,There is a lot to learn technology is Top Notch. The management is poor. Especially with the Tech/People Managers who do not know both Tech and People. There is a lot of un healthy competition as there are not opportunities for growth.
good,"Big focus on work life balance. Company really gives back to employees via numerous company paid fun days, catered food, movie outings. Even the town hall meetings set up in a fun and exciting way."
good,Management team is chilidish or never there to help unless you have an specific coach but it is a good job just gotta get over a lot. Hopefully things change.
good,Capital one lacks focus and projects are not well managed. You have less job satisfaction and mutual respect. The old leadership needs to move on. Tech associate do have good training available.
good,"i was a contractor at Cap1 for a year.  In that time they had several layoffs and firings.  Most based on them moving IT groups from one site to the other.  CAP1 is very confused when it comes to its IT jobs.  Some unwritten rule that you have to be within 80 miles of a CAP1 Corporate location.  When your group gets moved out of state then everybody gets let go who can't be within 80 miles of the office.  They lost a lot of talent in my short time there (a lot of CAP1 employees who had been with the company for a long time), because some Executive way up the chain decided he wanted his group to work of his office location.  Also, if you are looking for a large corporation that has a ton of paperwork and middle management look no further. I worked on the SDWAN team.  My job was 80% paper work and 20% engineering.  It should have been the other way around.  Not a company I would recommend if you are looking for a long term career."
good,Capital One acquired my employer Chevy Chase Bank.  Chevy Chase was a great company to work for.  My job was one of the best that I ever had.  Capital One eliminated our department and gave us a nice severance.
good,"It was a fast paced environment that compensated well for your time. However the management did not communicate between each other, so what one approved another apparently disapproved and worked to reprimand you for it. My department was closed with a months notice, and we were placed in completely opposite departments with absolutely no training. I started capital one part time, in a collections position and had to take 6 weeks of full time training. However after its closing, i was put into a full time position, in the hardship department, with 1 8 hour shift worth of training. It was absolutely disgusting."
good,"CapOne has the best culture hands down, but management isn't all that well. Life happens at times managers don't take that into consideration when they are under pressure to meet deadlines."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Capital One.  I met great people there that I still connect with today.  I enjoyed the flex schedule and the ability to work from home, if needed."
good,"Culture like no other...very welcoming. Great on boarding experience, due to very professional and organized Hr department. Company is focused on associate engagement."
good,When I was a teller for capital one bank it was fun diverse liked the culture that came with being a teller. What I didn't enjoy to much about it was that I felt it was to much micro managing for me to much of the same over and over maybe it's like that most tellers.
good,"Very competitive environment focused on movement to the cloud, Environment varies depending on the department & management team, good benefits, very difficult to gauge your success as goals are not clearly defined and can change during review process."
good,"Excellent medical benefits. Don't take care of Tellers, poor pay. Good for a first job to learn some skills such as customer service and handling money, job isn't hard, customers are usually pleasant."
good,Capital One lacks putting the right people in management. The managers are not knowledgeable and most cannot perform the basic job that their associates perform on a daily basis.
good,"open new checking and savings accounts as well as all types of business accounts such as LLC's S-CORP C-CORP, SOLE PROP etc. "
good,"The culture at capital one is stressful and doesn't give much room for improved morality. Its a financially driven culture that doesn't foster development outside of business need. Employee balance is based on the needs of the business and not the needs of the person. At capital one, you are a number. All of the contributions that you make to the company go seemingly unrecognizable and you're not given the due diligence you work hard to gain therfore making it difficult to reach above the entry level positions."
good,I was told constantly that I would be converted from a temp to a permanent member of the contact center. this was constantly delayed and discouraged me from wanting to continue with the company. I was also advised from my temp agency that I would be compensated much more that I was and only found out when I got my first paycheck.
good,"There are a lot of opportunities for advancement. Really nice offices, gym, and cafe. All in all Capital One is a great place to work if you have the right manager. Unfortunately, I didn't."
good,Great entry level opportunities. Lots of turnover and constant change. Work didn't feel purposeful. Culture and guiding principles do not match day-to-day culture and operations
good,"Actively engaged existing affluent clients and sourced new high value relationships"
good,"It's not a copywriter's dream to work here. The work isn't very creative. The pay is okay. So, I guess there are worse places to work. If you do the work and want a place to chill for awhile, this place could be that. Don't expect lots of career advancement or work that you will want to show off in your portfolio."
good,"Move departments and/or teams every 3 years or so to stay fresh.  Burnout is a risk.  "
good,"You really have to in the right department to succeed at Capital One.  If you end up in one of the old Hibernia bank groups run by the good ole boys club from LA you better be a good ole boy or you are going no-where really slowly.  If on the other hand you can get into the consumer card side of the company life is going to be great!  Avoid any job descriptions with the word ""Treasury"" to stay out of the old Hibernia culture."
good,"The department that I was in was very focused on results. This typically ruled how people were treated and the decisions that were made. Furthermore, there was a lack of development conversations with my direct manager."
good,A typical day at Capitol One included obtaining loan documents to move the file towards closing. I enjoyed working with other loan processors but found it challenging to work under the requirements of the company's leadership.
good,Leadership and key decisions were poor within homeloans. Ultimately these decisions caused Capital One to exit the mortgage business and cost 950 people their jobs.
good,"Good place to work at if you are a human relations postions. As for a tech company, Capital One is a good place to start if you just graduated from college."
good,"The culture of the company is great, however, there is a lack of opportunity for advancement within the company and the hours are less than desirable. A typical day consists of assisting customers with their account servicing requests over the phone."
good,"Great company when I started, but the Fraud department has slowly gone down hill.  They can afford to pay supervisors and entry-level management $100K plus but cannot afford to provide employees with adequate systems or the necessary overtime to complete required work. Several new managers are more focused on the numbers than the people who work for them.  The bank is losing its humanity."
good,"Hire the Right People."
good,I enjoyed my stay in the company. It was fun working there.The employees were friendly and accommodating but the job is really exhausting and the salary is quite low.
good,"very focused on college recruiting and building a tech brand and culture but once the rebranding dust settles, what is the business strategy (especially for Chicago)"
good,Overall I enjoyed working at Capital One.  I did not like having to up sale or that there was really no options for advancement there.  I did not like working weekends really either.
good,in the mornings we would review our workload for the day and start working cases. We evaluated information for PPI claims and worked out whether or not to issue a refund.
good,I had a great direct manager however the overall organization and company going through turbulent changes.The workplace culture is inclusive on the surface but advancing was elusive.
good,"back office positions are great, however branch positions lack direction, company is prone to change on a whim.technology at the branch level is lacking"
good,I love the company.  The managers were only concerned with themselves or their favorites.  The benefits are great.  The work/life balance was great.  There are great people and then there are really bad people.
good,"I worked as a 6-month contractor here and was told by my recruiter that Capital One likes to convert contractors to permanent within 90 days of work, but that never happened."
good,A very fast paced job that required you to have a clear mind no matter how furious the customers were at the issues they encountered. Managers came by to make sure everyone who had any questions or concerns were correctly answered in a professional and timely manner.
good,"A typical day at Capital One is maybe fast paced or slow depending on the call volume. The overall experience at Capital One has been awesome. My manager is a great leader, the workplace culture is very professional. The most enjoyable part of my job would be speaking with customers hearing different experiences they may have had and being able to help"
good,I enjoyed my job as an Operations Manager. I like the customer service part of banking along with audits but it's a very sales driven environment and it's not for everyone. You must be self motivated.
good,"Environment is cut throat depending on manager "
good,"The Capital One I worked for was very fast paced,  I liked my job, being that I'm a big people person.  You came across many different people each day."
good,"Day starts very early and ends very late in the evening, alot of customer complaints. Very serious about sales goals, time management, and customer satifaction."
good,"Capital one is a good company , just my experience was different than others due to the management that  was not unto par to support, motivate, and promote growth within its team."
good,Great work place environment and always busy. Fast paced and stressful at times. Great company incentives. Management is pretty good at keeping the employees motivated.
good,Need to provide classes for management and make sure the employees are just as happy as the customers. Work on building department moral and make changes that make sense
good,"A typical day at work is sitting and answering phones throughout your shift. Handling clients needs and problems. "
good,management was nice and you take a lot of calls and respond to customer's situations. some sales but more customer service driven.  overall was a good place to work for.
good,"I learned a lot in software quality assurance and programming. My typical days included daily morning performance meetings, managing and improving automated software services used by the company and use of Agile methodology."
good,Short staffed when I worked there and were not very flexible with my schedule.  Pressured too much on making sales.  Easy job.  Good Benefits.  Nice management.
good,Nice place to work. Just understand its kill or be killed mentality. You have to make alot of sales or no one respects you. You have to be ready to bens over backwards to please the manager or she will turn on you as well.
good,"Great opportunities, varying culture depending on department/Line of Business. Good benefits, considerate of working mothers, and opportunities to grow in different lines of business"
good,"There is always a need for customer service in the thriving industry of credit cards. However, administration is flighty and is quick to open new services and just as quick to shut them down. Thrice we had nearly lost our jobs as Capital One was going to stop their San Angelo branch just to change their mind and keep us on for a few more months."
good,Growth opportunities were frequently available in the Tampa location.  Business reorganization led to large scale layoffs and closing of various locations.  Support services provided for displaced associates was very helpful.
good,"Capital One was a pleasurable experience for the most part. They ask a lot but compensate well with salary, bonus, and amazing benefits package that includes not only 401(k) but investments as well! My experience was in a call center. It was fairly laid back although it felt like high school most days due to the lack of maturity exhibits by some associates and most notably management. As my first corporate experience out of college, I learned that you have to stay on top of your stuff in every aspect if you want to move forward. You have to take charge of your future and if one person says ""no"", keep asking people until you get the answer you seek or find out how to change that ""no"" to a ""yes""."
good,Good company to work for. Starting pay not bad.  Management will train you and treat you like family.  Great events to participate in and volunteer opportunities.
good,I enjoyed my time at capital one. Im not really into call center jobs however. If you are into that line of work they maybe for you. Nice pay but long hours.
good,"Capital One is great about showing the culture that it wants for its associates.  I work about 50+ hours a week and that is the toughest part of my job.  Within the banking industry things are changing, and job security is a thing of the past."
good,"very nice group of people .Management  is awesome."
good,"The company has a high turn over rate. Customers always noticed how new faces always appeared in the bank which they usually did not like and were not shy about voicing their opinions. I was able to work my way to becoming lead tellers. I was fortunate to have a very good branch manager at the time who was willing to help his employees progress. But, that was very seldom in that company. Management are trained like robots and it is loosing the family feel between the customers and employees."
good,"Provide exceptional customer service, while exceeding referral/sales goals. Serious focus on results and how to stay competitive in the banking industry."
good,Working in the mortgage field has many rewards. I enjoy the interaction with the community and also helping make dreams come true!
good,"Wonderful company, management not open to change and resolutions from employees. Due to this process continues to be broken, which overall effects the customers internally and externally."
good,"Working with Capital One was major learning curve. Good work environment."
good,"This was a good company to work for. I learned a lot about the banking industry and had an opportunity to work with great people. Good benefits and lots of vacation time, but constant change at the leadership level created much uncertainty."
good,had to put up with politics at capital one and management wasnt helpful much. really didnt learn anything . coworkers helped our more then anything. most enjoyable part of the job was the break times and lunches .
good,"Co-workers are good, morale is okay, leadership change is often which can result in employee turnover. The benefits are good and competitive, salary compensation is average, but advancement is slow."
good,"It is a great place to work and the compensation is great, along with the people. But please be aware that you have to be dedicated to the job and nothing else, they don't really leave room for much family time or family emergency."
good,The best part of working for capital one was working with the customers through their credit issues. Although there is a serious disconnect between management and trainers the job is fairly easy if you receive your updates on company policy regularly.
good,"Great place to work, work life balance is a bit difficult but if you have a lot of time on your hands and feel comfortable pushing people this job is for you."
good,"The position, at the time, was a dead end one. No growth within the department. The quarterly team outings and fun events to boost morale were always a highlight. My department ended up being outsourced and 3 months before this happened, we got a new supervisor. She had a reputation of coming into new departments and ""cleaning house"" and that's exactly what she did. I just thought it was pointless and cold hearted."
good,"At work, you're always selling yourself to your colleagues.  This can be both very dynamic and exhausting.  They stress work-life balance, but there's always a lot of pressure to get viewed by very senior leaders."
good,"Benefits were great, work environment was great. Advancement opportunities were limited and they would often hire people from the outside instead of promoting qualified employees."
good,Management were a little insensitive to minorities which made some people feel frustrated.  Learned a lot about banking and the checking department processes.
good,Capital One was a good place to work but at times there was no job work/life balance.  There is always a shortage of employees in the banking field but as needed I filled shortages to keep our branch focused and thriving.
good,"Requires a HS diploma and thats what you get. No true leaders, poor management selection."
good,"I investigated fraud for a major credit card company. My job involved investigation, looking for trends in fraud, spotting fraud, and contacting card members to ensure their account is secured. Very exciting and rewarding to stop fraud. Co-workers are like family, very caring understanding."
good,"I am a high-energy, motivated leader seeking an opportunity to use my background and skills in support of your company’s strategy and mission.  I have managed Call Center Associates both domestically and internationally.  I have experience in Public Relations and Communications; but my passion is developing high performing agents, teams and customer service functions.  "
good,"Great benefits"
good,"I was a nice place to work, i worked for the previous company houshold, and it was just a big change and due to the down sizing its become difficult."
good,"Good Place to work"
good,"Review loan applications, work with dealers and customers to get appropriate stipulations met and reviewed to provide profits for bank as well as dealership."
good,It was a nice place to work as the co-workers where very supportive. The work was enjoyable due to the friendly environment.
good,"Capital one is a forward thinking company, they are working towards doing the right thing for the customer and the company."
good,"I was able to learn a lot being in the management team. I loved that I could help each person find the best parts of themselves and bring it into light through their work."
good,Typical corporate workplace where the employee's are laid back and have a good time.  My experience at Capital One was good except when it came to progressing my career and also being able to get deals completed.  Those two area's became more about social status within the company rather then getting the job done and letting the work speak for itself.
good,what makes it more especial is the network of acquaintances that I've met. I've grown in this company professionally. The customer service training is excellent!
good,"fast paced, hectic, every changing"
good,"> Low pay"
good,"Founded on ""Information Based Strategy"" so certainly respects data as an asset. In transition since 2012 from a Credit Card monolithic culture to a full service bank in many locations with many cultures. Rigorous learning and expectations from everyone."
good,Created and documented customer complaints and addressed them accordingly. Included issuing compensation and apologies along with documenting and sending letters from our corporate office. Worked directly with customers and vendor sites.
good,I reviewed credit application packets from auto dealerships to ensure the applicants met Capital One guidelines. I reviewed each individual deal to make sure that all the paperwork was in order with a special emphasis on looking for fraud indicators. I was in the High Risk funding department so all the applications we received had already met certain automated parameters indicating possible fraud so we reviewed them in great detail. I enjoyed my co-workers and took great pride in my cosistently high level of confirmed fraud discoveries.
good,Good Corporate Structure.  A place where a candidate can create new processes and develop procedures.  The company is growing in a very healthy way.
good,Capital One is focused on their customers satisfaction which is a great thing. They always consider customer feedback to offer products that they want. Morale is sometimes low but management works diligently to come up with contests that will drive performance.
good,Working at Capital One is definitely an expierence a person could never forget. You learn a lot about yourself that you never would have thought possible. You learn your interpersonal strenghts and weaknesses.
good,"A typical day at work - meetings, meetings, and more meetings. Your actual work happens before 8 AM or after 5 PM when finally you are done with meetings."
good,"A typical day working here is like an everyday type of setting. It has its ups and downs, but its main repetitive pretty much everything except meeting the different types of customers and interacting with them. It has its fun times with the people you find working there with you."
good,Fun place to work with a lot of younger employees when compared to a typical bank.
good,"Although Capital One has great benefits, better than any job I've ever held, the company does not allow for a decent work/life balance. The advancement is a very slow process. My job is pretty routine so there us no hard part."
good,Debt collection department to recover unpaid credit card bills.
good,"An average day at work is very busy with helping customers via phone. I've learned great problem solving skills and how to make in important decisions in a moments notice. The management here is great, always will to help and motivate. My co-workers are great team players and motivators as well. The hardest part of the job would be having to deal with the difficult customers. The most enjoyable part is being able to help customers who are really in need."
good,"I unfortunately didn't have a lot of time at Capital One to experience the whole overall effect of the company.  HSBC transferred some employees to Capital One when the credit department was bought.  On Legal Day 1, Capital One announced the Buffalo office was closing.  It seemed like a very exciting place to work with great perks!"
good,The call center environment was great at first until you get to here all the stories with the customers. Had the chance to meet incredible people that I still associate till this day.
good,Expect long hours and decent pay.  Very political. Management is either or... you either have a manager that is for the good of the team or a manager that is trying to get promoted.  Lots of networking with different departments.
good,Working in a bank branch is a great experience; it’s a fast pace and highly competitive environment which can be very stressful in today economy.
good,"Collections Representative "
good,"Company aims to do the right thing by its customers and employees but fights too strenuously to maintain its Card cultural roots."
good,"Call center environment, monitored calls, 4 calls scored pe rmonth, monthly bonus, provided general banking information sucha s balances, reversed fees, offered sticky products such as savings accounts, debit card for accounts, lines of credit."
good,This is the only employer I've had that does not offer good job security.
good,Worked there during an acquistion and merger. Problems arouse as expected.
good,the best part was my immidiate manager and co-workers. other than that it's hard to deal with upper management level.s
good,The atmosphere is good. People are friendly. There is a lot of focus on the work/life balance.
good,It is a fun place to work however the pay in my current role is the same as it was when I was just a teller. I belive that those who are responsible for holding more cash should be paid more. Typically I handle all commercial customers and maintain the vault. The hardest part of the job is not having enough help to make sure other daily duties or done. Overall it is a fun place to work and you learn as go.
good,Was working for a bank.Learned about the handling teams and also about power point presentations.
good,"WOrk day is slow. I learned to always stay alert for the customers. Management is ok. Co-Workers are friendly, The hardest part is pleasing every customer. the most enjoyable is listening to every customer need."
good,This company really is employee friendly. They have all the extra perks an employee may want. A typical day is on the phone taking calls from customers. Co workers are willing to help in any way they can.
good,"The hardest part of the job is to reach all the goals dictated by higher management, but everyone works as a team to help each other."
good,As a smaller bank compared to the big 3 this bank lets you engage more in customer service. The downside is as a smaller bank they constantly are pushing sales. Some managers push it more than others. The best part about the job is engaging with the regular customers and being able to help them when needed. The hardest part about the job is being told to constantly force products on customers knowing they wont need it or shouldn't get it.
good,Capital One is an alright place to work. I don't think they pay their employees enough and there doesn't seem to be enough job security. Very sales oriented.
good,"A typical consisted of me working as support and team player for all of the loan officers who were for the most part kind, respectful, appreciative of any help they received and easy to work with and for. I learned that I could be creative and take iniative and eventually created a new position for myself as Administrative Assistant to my immediate supervisor. I was also asked and invited to move to Dallas with them but my husband did not want to move and leave his job and did not want to commute."
good,This is a number driven company. My coworkers seem stressed all the time. If you don't meet your numbers the first 30 days you're there. They come down on you hard as if you've been there for a year.
good,I learned a lot from this job
good,Typical workday would include answering phone calls received through and outbound or inbound dialer. Handled all payment arrangement request and completed check by phones. Assisted customers in understanding their account.
good,It is a pleasure to work for one of the countries biggest leaders in the finance community. Although there are some drawbacks to anything that seems too good to be true. The benefits offered are nice but getting to take advantage of all of them when needed is a stretch.
good,"Fast paced, innovative, technology-driven company aimed at helping ""change banking for good.""  Founder CEO, diverse workforce, supporter of the communities we live and work in."
good,This company was a great experience for my career. However the performance calibrations with managers can be like a vicious High School Bully the toughest bully wins. They have a high turn over in Executive Leadership in the last year 5 Executives left big red flag. This place is filled with constant change and reactive approaches with no direction. The salaries for Chicago are not competitive the culture is laid back. The people are nice. If you're looking for career advancement you must be a favorite of your manager. Disrupt the calibration process it doesn't work.
good,"I was involved in converting the investment division over to Etrade, so it was a non-typical experience. The campus is vast, but a nice corporate environment, with several amenities such as on-campus cafeterias, constant shuttle service to seven buildings. The campus is located close to 121 Toll Road N & Preston Rd. There is plenty of exterior & covered parking."
good,Since this is a collections environment some of the managers are more focused on collecting the money than the customer service aspect of the job. Capitol One promotes that they strive to do banking differently by treating the customer as a human and understanding tough times. The management style mentioned above does not show this.
good,"Its a good company to work for, but management is not organized, not much support form management. poor training but in all is a good company to work for."
good,overall good place to work.  flexible hours and competitive pay.  roles are very diverse but there is a heavy emphasis on technology and related job families.
good,stack ranking performance appraisal led to a highly political environment. Hard to move around unless you know someone. leadership should be stronger.
good,"a typical day at work is fun with ping pong tables and pool table with a beer garden the best place ever to work, beautiful views of the ocean and free massages!"
good,"Company is diverse, and friendly, easy to get along with, great leadership, fun atmosphere, light workload , call center environment,  team management"
good,"First the good."
good,"It is a good stepping stone for people who want a diverse skillset. Capital One provides a lot of opportunities. However, there are some toxicity in the work environment that is not good for long-term health."
good,"It was ok. Easy job description, messy management, messy messy. The drive is far if you don’t live in Plano. Police patrol must have tags, license and registration"
good,a typical day at work involves meetings. Learned to be independent but also seek team support when needed. Management can be very demanding when there is a pertinent issue at work. overall culture is somewhat friendly with well organized work parties and team outings. As long as you know your job and enjoy what you are doing there wont bee an hard part to it. The most enjoyable part of my job is when the team achieves a goal
good,"Customer service is never an easy job. Especially when the job involves other people’s money. Lot of angry customers, struggling finically take out their day on agents."
good,"Coordinated and organized daily workloads and processes with managers and team leads to ensure accurate and timely completion. •	Partnered with Treasury Management and commercial clients to identify and resolve problems as well as identify and mitigate potential issues. "
good,"Fun place to work, however, there were several inconsistencies in how disciplinary situations were handled at associate level. Good people, some with questionable judgement though."
good,"Its a job and its ok, basically do your work and pay attention to customers needs and everything will be ok, wish the holiday pay was a bit different."
good,"Flexible; progressive; fair compensation; ""open"" work environment."
good,I enjoyed working through a third party for this company. Leading the system’s was not challenging at all. I would definitely still be there had the third party not closed for business.
good,Not very good work environment and micro-managing managers. Little to no room for independent innovation. Not a place I would return to if offered an opportunity.
good,"call centers can be very draining especially if you do not work first shift"
good,I felt that we spent more time doing our jira boards and rushed the customers. I liked that we focused on what the customer needed then just trying to sell them something
good,"not enough pay at all..... o much work they dont pay enoughyou have to take test "
good,"When you have a lot of years with them, you don’t feel valued and just like another number. It’s sad because I loved working for them and feel like they just throw away talent when you start making a lot of money. Also in middle management, the employees have all the power and can make up lies about managers. No proof doesn’t make a difference. long history of excellent rating doesn’t make a difference the company does not care about their people. And that is sad"
good,Job was easy and fun but it's hard to advance to managment. Also this job had a lot of the higher ups showing favoritism which I didnt like. Pay was competitive but they have a criteria that they cant to control that employees have to meet which is controlled by the customers.
good,If you are the kind of person that doesn't like change you will hate working for capital one. Due to it being a financial institution there is always change and constant training. Also if you are looking for possible advancement look elsewhere. Once you are in the position you are in you won't be moving much at all. It all depends on what sector of capital one you will be working for so be aware.
good,"CapitalOne has good benefits, CapitalOne has a good education match, capitalone changes with the times, capitalone promotes good customer service, capitalone"
good,"With Capital One you really have to be a self motivated go getter to prosper. You are told of possibilities and programs, but not how to access them or who or where to start. You have to be an investigator to get yourself on the right track."
good,Great company overall but SF office lacked leadership presence. HQ is in east coast and they treat SF office like read headed stepchildren. SF office is trying very hard to get simple things like HR in the office since it is growing . Do end up get a lot of free food and company events
good,Bank is very good to work for good team good environment to succeed and help others typical day at work is usual management is ok overall team is nice.
good,its a job that pays well the calls can be stressfull at times but that is more about how you handle the situation at hand many peoople are going through a lot which is why we have to help but then you get people that will just scream and berate you its pretty much a toss up
good,"Capital One is a good place to work, good benefits and opportunities for career development, as long as you are in the right department. Hard to move up in some roles"
good,Over all a good place to work. It was my first job and I was trying to learn how a typical day at work would be like. Gained a lot of experience on the Quality Assurance side.
good,I always willing to make a work day the most exciting thing ever. Learning about different skills I can use to further my career. I am open to use those experiences somewhere to help bring in more value.
good,"Capitol One was a good company, however, they had some serious HR practices were very un-fair.  This comes from a former Department Head who was ""cut"" due to ""workforce"" reduction, but his team was reduced by 3 members for 6 months and they hired outside contractors to replace the regular employees."
good,"What I learned working at Capital One was no matter how hardworking you are and how dedicated to your job, the moment someone is threatened by your ability to inspire others, you could be out of a job in a matter of seconds.  Your skills, hard work and dedication are never taking into consideration.  It was very disappointing."
good,It was a ok type of job alot of answering phones but the management was horrible and the pay was not that good the clients was good and I loved that they let us have potlucks
good,"Great pay & benefits, but can be stressful at times. One hour unpaid lunch, two paid fifteen minute breaks within the daily schedule to help break the monotony."
good,The main location was always busy! Long wait times for customers but the staff worked hard. Pay was low in comparison to other banks but training and morale was great!
good,"Depending on the area of entrance, work experiences can very greatly.  Pros are it a very entrepreneurial company.  Cons are be sure to enter at the level of work you expect to be at and not expect to promote through rapidly in most areas if qualified"
good,It’s a fun place to work with to many things change everyday and they really don’t care about they employees so they terminate people for no reason...
good,"If you want a job at a bank this is not the role. In theory they are a bank but don't operate like one, its retail but with money instead of t-shirts or coffee."
good,Average employer with really inefficient management. The direction seems to be lost and the company need to do some restructuring at the top. Key leaders needs to be repositioned
good,Our branches are short staffed. They work you to do the bone. They don’t care if you’ve worked to weekends in a row they jst want a BODY. The pay is decent though & there is also good benefits. That’s the only good things about the job. People also choose to make up rules as they go & have favorites.
good,Shift bids means you have to compete with others to get better working hours. They choose favorites and monitor bathroom breaks. Capital one doesnt care if you have a family as they can switch your shift anytime. You get put down if you arent hitting your metrics and they prefer quantity over quality
good,Capital One is a good place to work.  Some of the managers are good people and care about their employees.  The schedules are flexible.  The bonus structure is not secure.
good,This bank was like any other bank to work for with goals and continue learning this bank would be good for anybody wanting to continually grow with it. I only left this bank because I moved.
good,"Typical workday was 9am-6pm with multiple meetings. Culture is competitive, pitting individuals within the same team against each other. Modern workplace."
good,"Nothing to say regarding this company. Thanks for experience that I gained while there. A lot of overhead, workflow could have been a little easier as well."
good,"Management is ok, if you want opportunities you need to look for them yourself, it can be very competitive."
good,Working for capital one was very fast paced and required a lot of mental work. There was usually a great team effort from all employees. I would recommend the job.
good,"Not a collaborative culture.  Not inclusive of new people....love to talk about the people that have been there forever or that were recruited out of college.  All others seem to be ignored for a long time......maybe one day they'll start to recognize new people, but seems like an exclusive ""club"" that they are proud of and do not want to bring new members into that club."
good,Enjoyed working here staff very nice and helpful.very understanding of someone looking for work. Easy to find and loads of jobs. Good pay too. Weekly phone calls from your worker to see how you get on witch I found very helpful.
good,Always plenty of clients to talk to. Branch staff was engaged in referring clients. Company had an employee discount which was well received and let to a lot of business.
good,Too many snakes at the Vegas location. HR which is headquartered in Virginia needs to clean house with management. Managers job retaliate if you tell on them and they lie on you
good,"fast paced, bad hours hard to move in the company, good training, fun people, slow work, ok location, bad parking options, clinic on site, cafe on site, good benefits"
good,"This was my first job out of college, answering calls in customer service. The company was young when I worked there and I've enjoyed seeing it grow of the past years"
good,Capital one is a fun relaxing work place with great amenities like the gym cafe's bike to get across campus but they don't offer room for advancement unless you know somebody and if you are making 2 much money they will lay you off at the beginning of the year with the budget numbers come out.
good,During my time at Capital One i have concerns on how they rank employees when each manager judges differently and not fairly. They trying every thing to cut your bonus from you even if you give your everything for the customer and do what is right they grade you incorrectly.
good,"Great people to work with. It was a pleasure to see the different aspects of what makes the company work."
good,"Capital One has many internal teams and each team has its own culture and ability to be effective. Finding a good team fit is crucial for having a positive experience. It's easy to tell which teams work well by asking about turnover/how long current team members have been there. Overall, career progression is slow. But at least in the San Francisco office, the snacks are fantastic!"
good,They promised job advancement after 12 months. When ever I tried to get info on how to do so In was constantly shot down by both my supervisor and manager.
good,Capital One is an outstanding organization that I enjoy working with and for. Upper level management in specific divisions needs improvement which would make it a better working environment.
good,"There was a lot to be learned coming straight out of university, and I've gained a lot of experience with Java/Spring, AWS, and numerous other toolings related to the cloud, data engineering, software engineering, etc. I now believe it is time to move on to greener pastures."
good,"Working at this company was fine the cultural was ok, the people were very family oriented .the only problem i had was the schedule it was really hard due to me being a single parent ."
good,It is a great place to work. The management could be better but overall it was nice. Very good benefits and many opportunities to advance your career.
good,"Seems only the people who cliche with their manager get promoted."
good,Was a great experience working for a third party company that works for capitalone. Provides great service and quality benefits to employees. Enjoyed working there
good,"Our site was closed down in our area, it was extremely sad.I realloy enjoyed working there. I've remained in contact with some of my former coworkers."
good,"When I started with HSBC, I had not experience with AML. This company provided the needed training in order for me to achieve the department goals. It is a nice place to work but at times the work load was unachievable. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the other Investigators."
good,My time at Capital One made me realize that I was interested in being in a caring profession. It would have been wonderful for someone more interested in finances.
good,Lots of non communication in management rolls.If you would like a fun place in some area it is realy fun if you get under the right management but I had three new managers in two months.
good,good places to work at good culture and great benefit. great management. good compensation.good job work and team. overall great place to work i love it there
good,Good company to work at. Employed lots of smart people. Great opportunity to learn and grow. Friendly work culture and very professional work environment.
good,"was a contractor and had no beneifits; job was stressful never knew if you would be there from one day to the next."
good,I was mislead into believing that i was achieving and had a great brand at capital one. I was terminated abruptly without a heads up and did not end my career there the way i expected
good,"People are helpful but there is a clash of culture between ""Bank-North"" and ""Bank-South"". Too many meetings and not enough simple one on one solutions to problems. Confrontation is frowned upon even when necessary. Pay scale very good but a lot is expected for the money given. Not that understanding of transportation or physical issues."
good,Customer service is a tough job.  You have to have a really thick skin and a patient personality to deal with customers yelling at you about their credit cards.
good,I was a contractor at Capital One and had a good overall experience. I cannot comment on benefits etc. Worked with various departments and learned a great deal about the business.
good,I easy place to work. Management didn't go above and beyond to keep good tellers benefits. Good for working parents to have bank hours. Learned a good amount of info to take to another bank if applied.
good,"Good place to work,  it was a fun experience the management team tried to do their best to help employees archive their goals and provided peer training. i say it was  a good experience but a dead end job very hard to move up, more of who you know environment, over what you can do for the company.  a lop of very well educated associates never moved up while those who were close to the manager move up quickly."
good,"If you like constant change and upper management shifts, then your ok. The benefits are very good. It all depends on your manager, how well you will do, if you got a good experienced manager, then you will do well."
good,Hr culture did not match company standards. Very heads down environment not many wfh opportunities or flexibility. Frowned on to even take your lunch hour
good,I was a contractor so I was not allowed to participate during internal calls and don't know much about company culture.I spent only 6 months during the migration phase of the project for their phone system.
good,"Back in 2009, It was extremely hierarchal and the culture was not very supportive especially from the management but things may have changed now so can't say."
good,"Open work environment where leadership is accessible. VPs work on the same floor as engineering teams. Events are organized to help teams blend more."
good,"I worked for Capital One at a center called Sykes. We answered inbound calls to help customers with their credit cards, my role was helping mostly new customers. We did get rewarded for meeting stats and not making any errors, which was nice but advancement wasn't very easy. My biggest issue was if you were sick you either had to be to work, make up your time if they had time available or take a point. points led to disciplinary action. Sickness circled around ALL the time because everyone came to work when the clearly should have been home. They did give a thing called life happens, which equaled out to 2 hours per month if something were to go wrong, like a flat tire etc that you wouldn't be in trouble for. The other issue was it is almost impossible to get your schedule changed. I had tried for several months to change my schedule to something that fit my and my families needs better, I even tried 2 different schedules, I constantly got denied as I watched others get the schedule I asked for who started and asked after me. Very frustrating. Things also changed a lot!"
good,Capital One is changing for the worse. The company is cutting corners with everything just to save money. Slowest computers and worst systems. They used to be a great place to work in but over the past couple of months it is going downhill. This is a gossip central company. Everyone talks and gossips.
good,Capital one was a great place to work.  They had wonderful people and helped you move up into your career.  I will say they are a great place to settle.
good,"very high-paced stressful job but good pay/benefits; Pros: "
good,"Capital one is stressful, management was horrible. The hardest part of the day was counting the vault. I learned how to large amounts of  count money in 2 min by my hand."
good,Great Work Culture with Sharp individuals. Associates are concerned with forced distribution via performance management.  Even strong resources gets forced to bottom bucket.
good,I have nothing to say about Capital One. Work was work. I made friends I will have for life. lunches were 1 hour long you get 2 15 min breaks. A paycheck biweekly.
good,Have fun!  Capital One is a great place for personal and professional development.  Great pay and benefits.  Growth from entry level to management is a possibility.
good,"The company overall was ok to work for but, depending on what manager you had would determine how far you got with the company.  The pay was really good."
good,The company is OK to work for but the management has a lot to learn. Camaraderie is very lovely people are great to work with and get along with the pay is OK
good,Come do your work and leave don't get your self caught up in any workplace drama keep to yourself and work hard should be the best advice working for this company
good,Good place to learn. Organization driven by analytics and value add to the organization. Very cut throat/ competitive working environment. Competitive salary and bonus structure that rewards hardwork.
good,not much to say cool company to work for.    they take care of their employees and their families. workplace was a great atmosphere to work in everyone was nice and warm.
good,"While there was little flexibility regarding work hours or family emergency, this company paid fairly and had good benefits.  They did incent employees with pizza and cake rewards and recognized achievements."
good,"nice company provides training for career advancement."
good,"My years working here have been some of the best in my career: an abundance of training is available, people you work with and those you don't are usually always pleasant and helpful, and work/life balance is the best I've seen. Worst aspects aren't much different than at other large companies: promotions go to who you know and not what you know, and you never usually know what your manager does everyday.For me the positives have outweighed the negatives."
good,"The days were random and very fast paced, you'd start by having a team meeting then move immediately into lunch, then into work as door to door fundraisers."
good,Not for creative writers or deisgners. You will mostly be excuting from verify you don’t understand. Save your time and find an agency because this isn’t it.
good,The company has many benefits as well as flaws. If you're working in the call center environment it isn't a cake walk and advancement is extremely difficult to obtain.
good,"I called customer's to collect balances on checking accounts that were overdrawn for over 56 days. I connected with them, which was nice, and took tips from management on how to make the most money for the company.  The hardest part of the job was taking/making hard phone calls, and the best part was when I made breakthroughs and made great bonuses.  The benefits package is very nice, also."
good,"A typical day at capital one is rather productive. You're pretty much driven my the people around you to get the job done. At the end of the day, everyone has the same goal and wants to give a quality performance. Majority of the workers there are helpful and easy to work with. It's a very diverse atmosphere. Overall working at Capital one was enjoyable."
good,good company overall. great company events. friendly staff. was approved for time off once though and explained i was travelling for a family event so i purchased the ticket then was told by upper management this particular day was mandatory and they refused to honor my already approved time off and forced me to resign
good,Capital One bought my previous department from my previous employer. Capital One wanted to centralize all of their staff and you had to be either willing to relocate or find another job.
good,"was a great place to work several years ago, like 15-20 years ago.   was voted one of the best places to work in dallas fort worth by the dallas business journal"
good,"I was not with the company that long, but while I was there it was ok. I could have learned more but job uncertainty was too much to handle with all of the lay offs"
good,laying off people in the next few months but glad they provided enough notice. Good training. Good coworkers and knowledgeable. Dislike that have to reapply to be considered for other jobs.
good,"The job was good, however sometimes stressful. Unfortunately, there is a big lack of communication between management and employees which creates a lot of confusion and error when it comes to handling accounts during system updates."
good,"Very nice working environment. Friendly knowledgeable management and peers, working with highly advanced technology, so it’s a great place to learn and gain some wonderful experience."
good,Capital One offered the ability to lead in new technologies and at the same time ensure quality code builds through production.  The workplace culture was one that encouraged innovation within the financial sector.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to improve upon existing technologies to better the companies direction.
good,"for the most part it is a good company to work for, people are helpful, but my manager was not very flexible and was overly critical of everything and just not a good person to work for"
good,It was a very fast paced job.  Management was always on top of you and very pushy and annoying.  Hours were somewhat flexible when it benefited the job
good,No mainly a production area. Did provide lunches for holidays and special promotion days. Annual Holiday party. The hardest part of the job was there were too many meetings and conference calls.
good,"Capital One gives an incredible level of exposure to people at the analyst and senior analyst role. It is an exciting company with lots of interesting projects happening across the various lines of business. There is generally a strong development culture, good pay, and a good work life balance. The McLean campus is adding a beautiful new building in summer 2018 which is a great perk."
good,I actually was just there as a contractor to support a migration project that had mostly been completed by the time I joined.  So any review is purely arbitrary from my perspective.
good,Corporate Culture always changing.   Staff constantly moved around making it impossible to build a client base.  Constantly ridden to produce sales in a market area saturated with financial institutions.
good,Capital One did well in the area of employee appreciation.  Cap One would surprise their employees with random ice cream sundae parties in the middle of the day.  Occasionally hot team building events at offsite locations.  Great benefits with a good work life balance Outside of the remote travel.
good,"employed for approximately a year, operations center moved to  Texas,  In the interview I was ensured company has not and will not be looking to down grade, however a year later I was laid off"
good,"Great place in Plano, TX. Very corporate environment. Culture is relaxed, everyone is highly intelligent. Overall very good place to work with excellent benefits."
good,Capital one was just stepping stone to do other things in my life . Not interested in going to work for the company customer service was and is a good experience
good,"Very stressful, had to speak with customer and collect on their balances. I learned how to be a good collection agent and good customer service. To listen to the customer and then respond."
good,"Good place to work, people friendly and very active. Schedule is first come good attendance type of situation. A place to work for that anyone can do with the positive environment influence."
good,"worked at security desk.walked did patrols, filled out paperwork everyday, made sure everyone entering had proper clearance to be in the building. Good place to work"
good,"ok place - big - runs slow.  Very young thinkers, kind of using new industry tools.  ok place - big - runs slow.  Would have stayed if there was more dynamic work to do."
good,"The benefits offered were great, however it is impossible to get in touch with any HR rep or superiors. the only way to speak with someone was by email, no face to face contact. very frustrating."
good,Capital One is a great company to work for if you arr not a temporary employee. The building is very fun and exciting with free bikes to ride on from building to building and complimentary umbrellas on rainy days for emloyees
good,Too many job duties and wasn't compensated for them.  Worked long hours without pay to keep up with the various job duties.  Some employees new to banking and had to be trained.
good,Capital One is a great place to work in the Richmond Va area. There are great people and a variety of different career paths. The benefits and facilities are good.
good,Good place to work with friendly co-workers fast paced I learned a lot of different rolls. the hardest part of the job was it ended to soon the most I enjoyed was a clean location
good,"Worked as a developer, production support team availed opportunity to learn new technologies. SQL, kron shell scripting. Worked on legacy and oracle based applications."
good,"Pros"
good,"When I first started working at Capital One, the atmosphere was one of growth.  Unfortunately, leadership took wrong decisions and it ended up loosing a profitable division of Capital One."
good,"this is THE company you want to work for. just get what you can when you come in the door ($ compensation). Make sure you ask about the salary range, what the development path looks like, and what the promotional structure looks like. Make sure you know the full range of titles at Capital One, from coordinator - VP (about 10, then 5 diff VP levels). External hires generally can be placed in the 50-75% of range with minimal experience. All you have to do is ask!"
good,"A typical day includes troubleshooting various pc and mobile device issues on the spot. Customers are able to stop by the office for any issue. They are not required to call in a help desk ticket, but have the option. Although tickets are not required by the customer they are required by the technician for tracking purposes. The environment is constantly changing. There are frequently new systems to learn. Some customers are a little impatient, as most have deadlines to meet or meetings to go to, which adds pressure to the technician to identify and resolve issues as quickly as possible regardless of complexity."
good,"Executive Leadership has great vision which gets diluted as it reaches local leadership. Your progression depends on who you work for, I had a opportunity to  work for Manager who had no intention to advance in his career and wanted to retire from his current title, he has made his intentions clear to me but I stayed along assuming that I will have an opportunity to advance, at the end of two years, when I questioned his intentions he made it very clear to me that he does not how to promote me to director or above roles. There are many people like this who had been there for over 15 years. Too many politics, had a opportunity to directly work for tech VP, who has promised a growth trajectory, due to REORG he was ruthless and looked for his personal welfare. Stilla great place work as their blazing through cutting edge software engineering. You need to be in the RIGHT place and work for RIGHT people. Internal talent is not recognized and they are keen in hiring external talent. The bad aspect hiring / firing happens througout the year. Performance Management has its limitations as Managers we are bound to identify bottom 12% in a high performing team."
good,the company is okay.  great benefits.  Good Management.  Culture not so great and has many rooms for improvement.  Job security is always a worry.  Lot of sales goals and pressure.
good,It's great place to work. Team collaboration is good. I have learned Data analysis skills. I also collaborated with Sales force and AWS teams to get exposure of those environments.
good,The work was rewarding but no flexibility on work from home.  Clock punching environment.  Leaned more old school working to be new school.  Good team members.  Heavy reliance on contractors which it typical in finance for some reason.
good,"They spent more time degrading each other, that they barely had time to put out any type of production. When they took breaks they really took breaks."
good,"I decline to speak about the company. I don't feel this question is appropriate. There are confidential papers signed and I don't have them in front of me to speak on this subject. "
good,"The company has a favoritism culture for IIT campus hires. Analytic work in subpar with the industry. Additionally, not at all a place for a tech guy. It is not a technical company."
good,I worked in repos at capital one so sometimes it was difficult to get in contact with the vehicle owners but I loved capital ones willingness to work with them.
good,"I enjoyed Capital One, because it was my first banking job. It was a great place to work at first. Over time they became very stringent about sales of accounts and loans. You could get written up over the smallest detail and I started to dislike working there. That is why I left."
good,A decent place to work with decent work life balance. The bank is bolstering itself in the tech arena and looking to hire tech savvy candidates and position itself as a tech company
good,everyone was friendly and nice. Like that you have the option to work from home certain days. Unfortunately I was a contractor and was not able to find a full time job.
good,Started out a local bank that was absorbed by Capital One.  Mixed reviews because it was great to be part of something larger but missed all the little company benefits.
good,"I enjoyed my role at Capital One .  I had a great team and worked together to meet a daily goals."
good,"A typical place to work, staff was great and customers was a joy. Volunteering was a priority. Very community oriented and supported staff and customers during natural disasters."
good,It is hard to get things done around Capital One due to the constant change.  I'm okay with change but multiple leader changes in one year is a bit excessive.
good,"There is opportunity to learn.  Management is iffy in certain departments.  The technology space is great, however there are lots of political stuff going on."
good,"Production credit environment"
good,"A fantastic place to work, with great employees and a collaborative culture of learning, training and development from management level on down. Unfortunately, very little of that translates to director level or above, which results in something of a disconnect and the occasional sense that the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing."
good,"Fun place to work but could use more organization. The company itself doesn't know what its doing, there's been a lot of change in upper management. Need more structure."
good,"No much to say, other then they want you to get more people credit cards so they can make more money. They didn't care about the account holders. They are all about money."
good,"Capital One is a great company with a inspiring vision.  They never stop innovating and are on the leading edge.  The compensation is attractive.  Senior leaders are highly knowledgeable and generally motivating.  The pace is incredibly fast with little time to come up for air.  The consequence is everybody looks exhausted.  The morale varies depending where you are in the organization and burnout of dedicated, very bright people is sadly typical.  The once genuinely embraced work/life balance is now seemingly a historical observation.  In the end, you either love Cap One or you are ""over it"", depending on whats important to you.  An ideal place to grow your career.  It certainly was good to me."
good,"I think Capital One could be a great place to  work, I did not have a good experience. But I've advised others to apply.  Management is key to having a successful career there."
good,Lots of opportunity but have to know the right people. Networking outweighs talent. If you are willing to fully embrace the drive to digital and the mission of Capital One you can go far.
good,"Decent place to work. As a contractor, i was provided with all the tools to get my job done. Contract ended early. Team was good and supportive. Would recommend."
good,My job specifically was easy. Management was not great. The environment was awesome. good hours. pay was not that great. meetings were taken place to better our work.
good,I choose not to provide information here since everyone's opinions may be totally different.  My review would just be one of many based on their personal experiences.
good,Great place to work. I did love the people and the atmosphere. Capital One is no longer located in Sioux Falls. I enjoyed learning about different types of collecting practices. Good place to work.
good,"had to move - 	"
good,While I was at this bank they were new to the market as a commercial retail bank.  They were trying to reinvent banking and hiring those who worked for other large banks to re-invent.
good,This company was a good company to be associated with. I enjoyed the people. The employees give the place life and balance. I left for advancement reasons.
good,Good place to get a jump start on your career. Good salary and benefits and great training.  Very fast paced environment with opportunity to volunteer your time to community events.
good,"Great company if sticks to core competencies. Flounders in its attempts to penetrate new sectors; ie Mortgage, Investing, etc. Great opportunity if in Credit Card or Auto Loan divisions for tech oriented people who want good work/life balance and slow linear career progression. Don't expect to conquer the world, expect free pizza and a T-shirt."
good,"Cap One is going thru major strategic changes leading to jobs being eliminated. Unfortunately, my contract was impacted as a result of the changes. While I enjoyed my time at the company, I was happy to move on once the contract ended."
good,Very fast paced. Sometimes overtime was mandatory. Different jobs to be done daily. Monitoring of calls was never done the same way. Good bonuses. Good benefits.
good,"Great place to work with many different opportunities.  I started in customer service, moved to Operations, and ended in Print center and distribution."
good,Give it a try if you want to be part of a Fintech. It wasn't a fit for me  although I learned many valuable lessons as part of a fast-paced internal start-up.
good,Capital One is a good company actively working towards a digital agenda. The culture has a variation of work hard play hard which can be good and bad for a balanced work-life balance.
good,"Busy day"
good,"There was an adequate training program but once you got on the phone with a real customer it could get really hairy. The managers had their favorites of course and was once counseled because I said ""sir"" too much!! Sorry that's how I was brought up and trained."
good,"The Retention department was a fun place to work, Good atmosphere, friendly, relaxed pace. Plenty of incentives to be had by all. Food on Fridays and coffee in the break room."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job are the people I work with.  I Enjoy being able to resolve issue for our customer and being able to brighten their day.
good,"They try to make it a great place to work, the campus is absolutely beautiful with many things to do such as the 3 story slide, putting greens and bicycles to ride around. Depending on your department, the business life could change drastically. Auto finance can be repetitive especially in the call center. Home mortgage is almost impossible to feel safe in your job security as there are a lot of lay-offs."
good,Its been a good working environment but the draw back is that the manager has to put in the request for you to advance but the turn over for branch managers are high. So you have to prove your worth to every manager that manages your branch.
good,"A lot has happened since you took the All Associate Survey in April, and we’d like to check back in and see how you’re doing. "
good,"Was a great transitional call center to work in, when in between jobs, or if just starting out to gain skills. Pay was low, but a lot of free giveaways were included to make up for it."
good,There are some great opportunities to learn at Capital One.  The caliber of individuals is generally very good.  The nature of the year end appraisal process generates a very competitive environment.    Look for positive influences/people in the work environment and this place will be tons of fun.
good,"Constant learning on the feet required in a fast paced environment. Good team structure and decent hours. Great benefits, market rates with management providing a culture for growth."
good,"•	Balance currency, coin, and checks in cash drawers at ends of shifts, and calculate daily transactions using computers, calculators, or adding machines."
good,"Great co-workers and reasonable management, but the closure of so many brick and mortar locations caused the prospect pool to dwindle as the majority of business was derived from banking referrals."
good,good work environment great food nice co workers team are great sizes local to great food places is not far of a drive the benefits is goods and they do work with you on shifts if they can
good,Very big company with lots of processes and procedures. The culture is positive and people are very nice. The talent and skill level is high. Promotion opportunities are limited.
good,No advance for temporary agencies. The process is hard and very rigorous. Very fast paced and stressful at times. Decent place to work with the proper management.
good,"Capital One is filled with helpful, friendly, smart people. Your co-workers quickly become close acquaintances, if not trusted friends."
good,Laid back place to work. Flexible schedules and a lot to offer employees in a campus style setting. Enjoyed coming to work. Pay was competitive and environment was conducive for growth.
good,"The Banking and Financial Industry is Productive and Informative, but most importantly it is a strong workplace culture. The most enjoyable part of the job was connecting with the clients."
good,"The company does care about their employees. They don't support to grow with in the company. Because of change in business decisions, there is no room to grow and simply no additional options to keep good working candidates to continue their career nor safety in employment"
good,Capital One is a great company to work for if you are not in retail banking. It is very hard to get promoted or even recognized if you are in the retail banking side. Capital One is a great company as far as benefits and helping the communities go.
good,"Fast pace, Stressful, challenging"
good,"Handle a lot of cash and a lot of customer interactions."
good,Relationship Manager is a demanding job that requires extended hours and schedules up to 6 days in a week.  There is substantial reward for those willing to contribute the time an resources needed to exceed company metrics and goals.
good,"Sales are a priority here for everyone including tellers.  Wages are not very competitive for the work load, especially for middle management. Despite mediocre wages one does learn a lot as work load increases.  Management works well to teach policy and procedure in the branches.  Capital One has a facility to train its new hires which is efficient and well managed."
good,"Capital One invests in it's employees, there's no doubt about that. On paper, everything is awesome. Unfortunately, senior leadership (director +) is highly disconnected with the values and overall mission of the company. There are silent wars that take place between leaders which causes discord among staff. Some days, it's a honour to work for a company with such pure values. Other days, it's stressful and volatile."
good,nothing bad nothing outstanding...pleasant experience overall working with many professionals but management could use more of a human element very robotic atmosphere.
good,"Dealing with customers on a daily, solve customer problems,train new employees,bookkeeping and accounting ,call center customer service,receive branch work and process it and send process work to federal reserve(Transit department) Learned all aspects of banking.The hardest part was lossing my good job and salary. The most enjoyable part was dealing with customers"
good,"Capital One has such an amazing culture but the managers are terrible.  They accuse you of doing things but have no proof.  I know of several instances that people are under a microscope but if you are friends with your manager then you are given free reign.  The company as a whole is awesome, has amazing perks but the attitude of the managers casts a dark shadow over the mission that Capital One is trying to achieve."
good,"Management sucks depending on who is managing you, but overall capital one is great, the benefits are wonderful, NO OVERTIME. i do however think that they do not care about their employees as much as they want you to believe that they do. Banking is a very phony industry, A lot of Fake smiles, no one is your friend, and management gossips about everyone. But the benefits are great, and i guess you can pay your bills. The most enjoyable part of the job were a few of my favorite customers."
good,Amazing place to work if you find the right fit. Challenging if you dont. Great bennys. good work life balance. lots of perks around campus. always free food!
good,"While working for Capital One Auto Finance my job title was a collector though the actual functionality of the job was great I never really had a stable manager and other managers would change ""team"" there hours very often. Did not feel secure in my job placement do to my supervisor not knowing  my history of calls and how I handled them. Capital One however, did see to it that all employees where appreciated. There was always conferences to see how the company was doing as well as bonuses available after needs were met. Also my coworkers were  always friendly and willing to help with old and new material that we had to learn. My coworker made it easy to come to work and be productive as well as enjoying small conversation between calls"
good,"At Capital One, I was an Teller, I worked for one of the busiest locations in NYC. I enjoyed the environment most of the time. The things that interests me the most was building relationships with the customers and learning about financial gains."
good,"Good Company (as an Institution) But leadership is very weak and lacks of objectivity, since they have favoritism and not open to subjections. Hope to see changes in the future."
good,"Needed to solicit departments and managers acquire projects to work on."
good,a great place to work with your peers but i always felt the mgmt team & support departments didn't support front line staff sufficiently and as a result very high attrition
good,I enjoyed my time with Capital One. I liked working with the people and our customer base was excellent. I did not like the hours and the push to sale.
good,IT WAS OK. they paid well and having paid time off is always a bonus. didnt really experience alot of oppurtunities to move up because they dont seem to hire in office often.

Assisted in special queues, research and confirming information"
good,"overall my experience was pretty good, however management could use a little work. it works great with a college students school schedule and over great vacation time as well."
good,"Good company for employees, not a good company for vendors."
good,The team I was on was pretty laxed. It was also diverse. It was a pretty big campus. I was doing contract work so my time there was limited. I would work there again.
good,"Excellent place to work particularly in card tech, investment is really heavy in the cloud enablement and associates are given a lot of help in building skill."
good,This job was fun to do and the people was so friendly. I love the environment around me. I wish I could've stayed longer but it was only a contracted position
good,"Capital One offers excellent employee benefits, and truly cares about it's customers. I did experience a lot of frustration with the way operations were managed and the way changes were rolled out. The management structure did not seem to fit the operation very well, which caused communication and execution problems. Employees at sites other than the home office felt somewhat cut off from access to the upper levels of the company."
good,"Changing fast, less tellers more machines. Customer friendly but working to cut cost at any chance. You're expected to do the work of positions that were eliminated and management will trick you into thinking this is a positive."
good,"Good company.I have learned a lot in this company.Have good work experience as a JAVA developer."
good,"Capital One is the best bank to work at if you like working at a bank.  There is definitely opportunities for advancement.  Personally, I am just used to working for myself."
good,Capital One could be a great company to work for. However the department that I'm in is not organized. And everyday it's something new. They keep changing things and not being considerate of peoples life outside of work.
good,just prefered something with a more set schedule. I am a mom of a younger child and would have liked something better than a shift bid to rely on. Other than that I loved the job. It was a great atmosphere just not right for me on the time schedule
good,Love the raving culture that exists and the freedom to empower change. You won't be reprimanded for suggestions and they try to make it a fun atmosphere to work.
good,"When I worked there, Capital One hired a large number of contracted work staff, so there was a constant stream of people starting and finishing contracts. I was one of those contracted employees and was never sure who was and who wasn't directly employed by Capital One. Much of my day consisted of reviewing contractors' access to applications and confirming terminated accesses' removal from the system - a lot of data review."
good,"Enjoyed working there , they will take care of their associates while they are there , will open up numerous jobs only to have to lay off employees within 6 - 12 months , to send those same jobs out of town or out of country ."
good,"It's ok. Each person has their own pros and cons, and I witness some stress on the faces of higher management, but in all places of employment, there will be ups and downs."
good,you never know what will happened for the company. too many re-orgs and make people feeling it is not stable at all. Management has bad culture. and too much politics are going on.

good,"Awesome place to work. I performed teller duties. I had a learn a lot about money. Staff and customers were very nice. Daily duties, were to cash, deposit check, ask people how we could further assist them in their financial needs."
good,"Pros : "
good,As a teller the company forces you to sell the products that Capital One has to offer to every single customer. Even though bankers are working within the branches they still require tellers to do so. Basically your playing a teller role and banker as well but don't get paid as much as they do. They also have a high turnover rate.
good,"Capital One has great culture, and you can meet a lot of great people working here. Balancing work and life when working for capital one is a challenge. Job Security varies, I for one do not feel 100% secure. As far as management, i been working there for a year and a half i already had 3 managers."
good,Elicitation of requirements with senior managements and creating BRDs and SRS documentation. Collaborating with development and functional teams to develop systems

good,"Productive and Challenging place to work, driver of innovation, commitment to clients, vendors and customers. Wide array of investment vehicles."
good,"Capital One was a bastion of opportunity and free thought. It is a shell of the past. Don't lose heart, there are still tons of opportunities for ""culture lobotomists""."
good,The company has an excellent work/life balance. Working from home was an option. Extremely flexible work hours were available
good,Great Incentives. Growth opportunities. Tuition reimbursements. Great health care package. Good and stable working hours. Good pay. Bad policies and asymmetric communication.

good,"Capital One is a good company they just need to work on there scheduling and being open to schedule changes for people that have family issues.  Other than that its a fun and great place to work, The company provides us paid fun days once a quarter to do team building and get to know each other more."
good,"Depending on location and manager, internal politics might kill you. It is a progressive company in a  lot of senses. In last few years lots of positive changes have happened, but if you are an existing employee, it is a struggle to get what new employees are paid coming in now."
good,Day stars with a good atmosphere. Learned a lot and shared my knowledge with others. Excellent management and co-workers

good,"Capital One is an absolutely amazing company to work for. I have never heard of a company that invests so heavily in its employees and provides such a great environment to learn and grow. The culture at Capital One makes everyone feel comfortable in bringing their full self to work.

good,I am not at all interested in participating in giving an opinion on past employers be it negative or positive. I hope your company understands this decision.
good,"I worked extra hours and went above and beyond, but was not liked for pointing out issues in the system. Coworkers were great. I have learned to be a great mortgage Underwriter."
good,"Capital One is a very diverse and great place to work for a corporate setting. Typical day is work random fun and games and work again! Management is pretty easy going and the co workers make the job fun and the work hours go by quick. Hardest part is withstanding the cool temps from the ac.. keeping the computers cool, and I  would say the best part is the fun and easy environment."
good,Loved the flexible schedule and the people working on my team.  Enjoyed the variety of work offered in the department I worked in.
good,"Decent place to work if you are great with sales. If you cannot get customers to get new banking products, the job can get very stressful."
good,"12+ hour workday "
good,The company itself is not that bad. Their training and systems used to do job need to be improved. Most departments have back to back calls.
good,Fun place to work with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics but this is to be expected of a big company

good,"Great Company"
good,Fun place to work but too many reorganizations which prohibits creativity.  Treat their employees very well and have great facilities.
good,"In the short time I have had the opportunity to work here, Capital One has been decent about ensuring their employees are well-balanced regarding work/life balance. Overtime is not promoted nor encouraged. 40 hours is expected, but an abrupt end is also driven to end your day at your normal 8 hour shift. Teamwork is also promoted to ensure that expected tasks or deadlines are met instead of requesting extra hours of work to meet a goal."
good,"i "
good,"Enjoyed the people I worked with."
good,the policies and procedures there was not being practice there sometimes it hinders your productivity that's the hardest part of it

good,"My typical day at work would start from logging to the dialler, taking as well as receiving calls in relation to outstanding debts. "
good,Customer Care Advocacy Team was challenging and fun. Had to think outside the box on the spot for the company and the clients on every call. Some management was amazing with an awesome open door policy and very helpful. My co-works were the best. We made a great team. We always worked together. The hardest part was the limited resources to other departments and management after 5pm. The most enjoyable was being on team with a supervisor role and advising other employees and changing clients lives.
good,Capital One was a good experience benefits and pay was great I learned how to use great negotiation skills which have really been a great help on other jobs and life also
good,no clear road for career growth. I am motivated by develpment and and progression and without that opportunity its very hard to stay motivated.

good,Very competitive.  Lot of type A personalities.  Which pushes employees to be better.  Very open to feedback and communication and escalation.
good,"Capital One is your run of the mill bank job. Referrals are pushed, but how many you need varies by district. I would say the hardest part is seeing the lazy coworkers get promoted."
good,"Capital one started as a great place to work, but the dynamics have changed drastically. More focused on referrals and sales, not as much on customers like it use to be. No longer has the hometown bank feeling."
good,Good place to work. Got the opportunity to learn new technical skills. Working on different domains. Got to interact with clients to learn about the business in detail.

good,"The job details heavy customer service, Daily Banking needs, such as sales and referrals to increase sales productivity. Heavy coaching and through programs such as huddles and background buzz.  Must be able to multi task and don't get bogged down.  Implement policy and procedures to the staff.  Proactively use the operations dashboard to identify operational gaps. Able to plan activities for the current business week. Encourage associates to participate in community events."
good,Definitely different place to work. Great environment and culture but performance management system is less than desired and very unfair.
good,"This job could really go both ways.  You could either like banking and pursue it as a career or you can became super bogged down with banking center politics and policies which will have you looking at banking as just a job. The hours are long, the customers are a mixed bag (both good and bad).  It's easy to make a mistake and lose your job. The managers are not loyal and have a very ""what have you  done for me lately"" attitude.  Raises for employees are very slim and the goals are not evenly matched with branch demographics.  The company incentive/benefit packages are getting smaller and less beneficial and unless you have a goal of becoming a manager which means you are willing to FIGHT to get there, then you might be playing a losing game."
good,"Call center employer for auto finance customer service, loan work-outs, collections, repossession and reinstatement / redemption of collateral. Enjoyed interactions during workouts and settlements."
good,"Test Lead and Project management."
good,Huge company and pay is the best in the industry however management sucks. You don't have the freedom to blossom. Everything is done on a non creative bases. you have to follow a script. Your manager has freedom to treat you how they want to and your word is no good to upper management.
good,"hard days work to keep customers smiling and content."
good,"It was great before the open floor plans became the norm.  I can't focus when I can hear a dozen conversations going on around me and I can't produce the results they expect if I can't focus.  Working from home is given lip service, but I didn't seem to get any credit for the work I did do from home, which was more that what I could accomplish in the noisy workplace."
good,Medium sized company; with good benefits but very limited career opportunities depending on what state one is in.  Work/Life balance almost non-existent for anyone in management role.
good,I really enjoyed Capital One it was my first Career based job and I loved the fact that it was an 8 to 4 Monday to Friday set schedule .
good,"Love the environment, great work atmosphere, along with great peers."
good,"I learned a lot from working for this company!  I loved my coworkers and felt like we were family.  The only thing I did not like about the job was the fact that it was not personalized, the past three years I was working there I felt like it was more about numbers than how I was treated or how I felt.  Compensation was another problem I had with the company, if your branch was not doing good with sales then that determined what type of raise you got if you even got one.  It wasn't based on the individuals track record or individuals accomplishments."
good,The company is great. The co-workers are interesting but hard workers as well.
good,Everyday was different. I enjoyed talking to customers from all around the world and solving their problems
good,"Loan Origination and Loan Serivicing SME.  Powerpoint presentaitons, PMP methodlogies, Leadership team"

good,Feels like working at a credit union. If you are hitting your numbers there is no micromanaging.
good,"Customer service on the phone all day servicing incoming calls and making sure all of the customers are completely satisified.  I sign on to the phones every day and micro managed throughout the day. I have learned to be very patient with people and sadly to say that all people are not treated equally.  For the most part,  my co-workers are nice and enjoyable to be around. The hardest part of my job is when at the end of the call, I have done everything possible to please the customer, but they are still displeased and ask for a supervisor."
good,good job for right out of college. learned alot about general banking and client facing
good,"It was the normal at work. Learned about culture and food. Management was ok. Co-workers where the only reason i stayed! They always had me laughing!

Make 10-15 outbound calls to set appointments for accounts reviews and to uncover financial needs with new and existing customers.   Conduct observations on team members and provide feedback and coaching to strengthen skills and improve behaviors.  Ensure we provide exceptional customer service by ensuring there is always a lobby manager to greet customers and direct them to the right team member.

good,A typical day included sales meetings and increasing book of business.
good,"always saling and closing."
good,Overall the company is a good place to work.  There a plenty of family oriented events and great incentives for the employees.  The only problem I've had working there is the contact center your more of a number than an employee so although you can be recognized everything is completely based on the numbers you receive.  Also they offer shift bids which don't work out well when it comes to  having younger children.
good,Gained a lot of knowledge and experience. Networked with customers and merchants.
good,"Every day was high, paced 10-12 hour a day.  Tasks changed by the minute and road-map importance."
good,"Work with delinquent borrowers and implement successful workout "

The company's associates do countless hours of volunteer work in the community from helping out in local area schools to Habitat for Humanities to helping prepare meals at the food bank. The work life/balance can be very flexible depending on the department. The area I worked in, was good about the flexibility for moms with sick kids or if you need work done at home. The health benefits are excellent compared to other companies. I've never had any problems with the insurance covering any expenses."

good,Great co-workers and management. Plenty of room for advancement into other departments. Management was good. Good pay for St Cloud.
good,"If you like the college campus type of setting, then this is a great place to work. If you like structure and your own desk, you will hate working at Capital one.  All projects are constantly in the RED and there are too many project managers who run around not knowing what they are doing. They are constantly hiring and firing contractors and the associates (FT workers) all take advantage of coming an going at any hours they want to ""because they can"" is their attitude."

Good benefits and vacation.  Great place to learn and pick up new skills. "
good,"Customer Service Skills were a must, Excellence in Cash Balancing was a High Priority. Proficiency in 10 key calculation, Math skills, HIPPA, Customer Service were required.

Being able to complete these task came easy with the help from management.
good,I have worked in car loan collections and this was a decent place.  Their structure taught me how to better manage my time and meet deadlines.  Decent place.
good,"A typical day at capital usually involved greeting customers and helping them with their bankning needs, while trying to improve service. My management was supportive and offered feed back when necessary. I learned valuable ways to deal with people even when they were irate or dissatisfied. My coworkers and I worked well together. The hardest part of my day would be counting the ATM's. The most enjoyable part of my day would be the satisfaction of helping someone and sometimes offering advice that could improve their lives."
good,High stress environment. Nice locations and staff is fairly nice for the most part.
good,I worked at capone for five years. They are very stat driven. I have seen people lose their jobs after have been working for the company for over ten years due to bad stats of three months.

There are a lot of products we have to sell to customers such as : checking and saving accounts, credit cards, home equities, auto loans.

good,"•	Worked closely with clients in gathering and reviewing the business requirements for each Sprint/Release."
good,"The company was a great thriving corporation when I started. After a while it became obvious there were financial issues and we were told the shareholders were unhappy. I learned quickly that although the benefits and perks were great I wasn't happy working in the high capacity call center. It was long hours, late hours and non-stop. "
good,Based on one year of service. Great work life balance but because there a young company they are not as innovative and there systems are completely outdated.  
good,Great company would loved to have stayed as an employer.  Due to family circumstance I was no longer able to commute.
good,Its a job that pays some bills and not a career. I have great co-workers.
good,I talked to customers all day and learned so much about different people and areas of the world. I loved my co-workers they were excellent.
good,"They recruit you in a very cloak and dagger method, tell you nothing about what they do or where they do it, how you get paid, or what happens to the money you earn. Here it all is though."
good,"- Answer phones to provide online support on the website;  "
good,"While working at Capital One Bank as Teller I created a good working relationships with all my co-workers. The staff there was extremely helpful when I joined the team and constantly offering their assistance. The customers we dealt with on a daily basis made me love by job. The management team was never on the same page with the employees and never cared about what we thought or ever considered our input or ideas. However, we all worked with what management wanted and did everything that they enforced."
good,Being an ING DIRECT Legacy employee makes it difficult to transition to a big box bank. I see unlimited areas of opportunity for Cap One to improve but until they get their heiarchial head out of their derier they will continue to run in place.
good,Steady pace sometimes it can be a little busy but overall a good place to work. If you like banking and want to make it a career they believe in promoting from within. Goals are a little unreasonable for the pay. Pay could be better for all that's required.
good,"Management is great"
good,Capital one is a great company to work for depending on your management.
good,"On a typical work day I assisted numerous clients. Within this position I've enhanced my skills to identify the needs of my clients by just having small talk. At times I felt as though my management team was not as supportive as they could've been, but I appreciate the leadership and feedback they provided. My co-workers made my work day pleasant each and everyday. We all enjoyed setting goals amongst oursleves and coming up with new and exciting ways to ensure that those goals would be met. I don't feel that any part of this job was hard, although, some times were a little bit more difficult to deal with. During the periods we were under-staffed we all came together to do a little extra to make things as smooth as possible. I really enjoyed the day to day interaction with my regular customers. Getting to know them was a great experience and it helped to develop my interpersonal skills and many others."
good,"assits phone associates with finding the right answers for our card holders, identify trends and needs within our department, draft department communications, take escalated calls when needed"
good,I had worked at Capital One Bank for 13 years and enjoyed my job. The part that I enjoyed the most was the interaction with the customers. Most of the customers preferred to come to me to help them with their financial needs. My co-workers were easy to work with. The hardest part of my job was trying to get customers to sit with a banker.
good,"They bought our company and changed the culture to the point that I now work with a bunch of disgruntled, disengaged, unhappy people. I no longer feel like an individual contributor engaged with my team members, making a product we were all proud of. Now I feel I'm treated as a ""resource"" to be ""allocated"""
good,A typical workday consists of working one to two files per day and look for work the rest of the day. Management and co-workers are nice. The hardest part of the job is trying to stay busy. The most enjoyable part of the job is the relaxed environment. I would love to stay here if the work was available and the pay was better. They take care of their employees and do a lot of fun things.
good,great invironment
good,smart people
good,"A good strong company but the drive was to far from my residence, overall great place to learn about the auto industry."
good,"Capital One is a good place to work if you are new to the workforce or going through a mid-career change. It does take a while to move up in the company, however. If you are willing to invest 5-6 years in your career with Capital One Bank, you will undoubtedly get to where you want to be if you perform well at every level. However, if you are looking to climb the corporate ladder relatively quick you will have a task on your hands."
good,"Good company for benefits and ""extras"" like food team outings etc"
good,"Capital One is a good company to work for overall. Marketing and branding efforts are best-in-class. However, the long-term direction of the company is often misunderstood by employees and potential customers. Is it a credit card company or a bank? The bank products are generally vanilla while the card products are highly competitive."
good,"The work environment is friendly, approaching customers in a nice way will help the job go smoothly."
good,Lots of hard work and training that opened up my communications skill and express my personality
good,"Performed security functions at Capital One's corporate headquarters in McLean, VA. Duties included access control, video surveillance, operation of Lenel multi-purpose security system, monitoring deliveries and visitors, customer service, interaction with employees at all levels in a fast-paced corporate setting. Management and co-workers combined to create a harmonious team concept to promote a positive and productive climate. Occasional problems with maintenance and alarm issues would cause temporary problems, but these were normally handled in an expedited manner. All said, the work environment was positive and satisfying."
good,"I only worked there for less then a year, company and people treated me pretty well."
good,This was my first job experience here in Montreal and it was quite the challenge. It was collection and our clients were delinquent Capital One Hispanic customers.
good,"I did not feel valued as an employee, necessary training was not given to make you feel comfortable working in a remote position."
good,At a typical day at work I interact with different clients. I utilize different sales techniques to increase sales and provide quality service. I have learned about different financial products and the benefits it provides to customers.
good,"My day starts out by having a morning meeting with all my employees. Going over operations and branch goals. Once we open I make decisions on my overdraft report. After that I am greeting customers, coaching and observing all employees each day. I will wait on customers if we are very busy and I am always helping my employees with their customers. I go out and meet businesses to generate more business for the branch and have regular conference calls with my peers and District Manager."
good,"I felt very unappreciated for the hard work and long hours I put in my position as Assistant Branch Manager. Their management support is very little. You have to figure out things by yourself because nobody offers help. I would not recommend working for this company, especially at the retail branches."
good,"Overall, I've enjoyed my experience at Capital One Auto Finance. I love that the job objective and responsibilities are made clear everyday. This was my first job doing collections, so the fact that I was able to be successful very quickly gives credit to management and the training staff. Capital One appreciates their employees, and lets it be known by going the extra mile reward them. I wouldn't really say that there is anything hard about the job, but the challenge is learning how to manage different account types month to month, and still keep your productivity high. The most enjoyable part of the job is the competitive nature that is promoted by management amongst the employees. The only real concern for me is the compensation package. Capital One Auto Finance collections department is not competitive with other banks when it comes to their compensation package. Even though I would love to work for this company long term to see how much I can grow and advance, I wouldn't simply based on the lack of monetary opportunity."
good,I learned about procedures and policies the government has in place for banks.
good,"Good company to work for, has great benefits. Provides a good work and life balance, retirement plan is excellent."
good,"I am over three departments in which I make sure that all the correct trainings are entered into the system. I create and facilitate new hire classes for the call center up to fifty-sixty employees. When we are hosting events My responsibilities are to find a venue, come up with the best time and date for this event, and make sure we have a hundred percent occupancy."
good,Its ok. Good benefits and reasonable pay
good,"Great employer, innovator, prepare you for leadership roles, allow you to train your own employees. Lacks communications process where all fields speak same language, HR with Branch distribution, General Customer service with Inside customer service. Employee referrals sometimes get sideways if you are not on top of them. The severance division had several errors from cancelling vision benefits to other added benefits in a job elimination event happened recently, without advising employees. HR was inappropriately rude about responding to request when they needed to be escalated."
good,- Contact Customers to collect past due debts
good,Military has awesome earning and great benefits to suppost family life. Great supporting pearls and team builders to push you to another level
good,Developing company with development needed in associate engagement and management development
good,"Flexible work culture, company who cares about employees."
good,"You can learn new things by working in this company daily, the environment is very friendly and everyone tries to help you if you have any dooubts."
good,there will be no communication between employees.manager will not treat employees like human beings.
good,"Capital One Bank is a fun, innovative compant that takes care of its employees"
good,the paper was good for serveral years. then they got sloppy.
good,In working for this company I have learned that being part of a strategic team is crucial to success in a high demand atmosphere.
good,management not good
good,"A typical day at work would be to come in to work, sign in to my computer, check my emails, go over my book of business and prepare my plans and goals for the day. I had very good co-workers we all got along very well. The management team was a good too. I believe that the hardest part of my job was the lack of traffic in my specific location, it wasn't a very busy branch. The most enjoyable part of any job where I've been are the people that I encounter. I've always met interesting people. People who have done all sorts of things in their lives. Successful, some not so successful but are still very happy with their lives. I definitely loved the people."
good,Face Paced job keeps you on your toes. Good Trainers cafeteria and plenty of vending machines and ATMs
good,Best company that I have worked for in Virginia. They enabled employees by providing the resources needed to perform jobs efficiently. They encouraged and provided training to acquire knowledge and skills to ensure employee's professional and personal growth.
good,It has provided me lots of opportunity to shape my career and helped in the growth.
good,"Great company to work for. They are simply too big and there processes can be tedious. Great work environment, pay and benefits."
good,Good place to develop broad set of IT skills. Turnover was high but don't know if that is still the case. Always best to keep resume updated and handy since company goes through frequent layoffs.
good,"Capital One is on a mission to help their customers succeed by bringing ingenuity, simplicity, and humanity to banking. They were founded on the belief that the banking industry would be revolutionized by information and technology, beginning with credit cards. They are now the nation’s fifth-largest consumer bank and eighth-largest bank overall."
good,". Fast Past"
good,"From a technology perspective, Capital one is very cutting edge, but they have a tendency to over customize every application from third-party vendors.    This makes it difficult when upgrades occur from the vendor due to over customization compared to the base code."
good,"Duties"
good,"Good place to work, a lot of technology integration. The banker roe has changed faster at Capital One than at any other bank so adjusting to it can be a challenge to some."
good,"Depending on your branch it can be busy or slow but the reduction in branch locations and limited upward mobility creates stress on associates.      Everyday responsibilities included greeting customers and promoting alternative ways of banking, accurate conduct transactions and provide financial advice on products and services offered by the company."
good,"if they don't like you, you're pretty much done there. it started off well in the beginning but it all depends on who you work with. some employees were fun but others like playing the seniority card and will belittle you in front of others in the hopes that you learn your place."
good,"The pay and benefits were good, but there was little opportunity for advancement.  Their internal systems are antiquated.  Overall, I enjoyed working for the company."
good,"Managers are losing the focus of their associates. Without management acting as advocates for associates, it makes the job stressful. The call volume can be heavy."
good,Cap One pays very well and promotes an amazing culture.  The employees under management do the best they can to create and live by this culture.  However the management fell short on this.   For Commercial Card the problem in my opinion was they focused too much on hiring sales reps and not enough on development on the ones hired.
good,Employees appeared content and motivated - - work was intense but collaborative .  Management was supportive of the teams effort and rewarded the teams for deliverables
good,"This was a good job to have and they will work with you when it comes to work life balance. The pay is good and benefits are good also. The only downside was a lot of favoritism goes on. Meaning if your not sucking up or brown nosing, there may be a target on your back. Get in! and Get out!, move in and move up as quick as possible."
good,Capital One was a great company for new graduates to learn new skills and gain experiences. The company culture is very competitive and sometimes stressful.
good,"This is good place to work, offers some flexibility and good training.  They do believe in rotating folks in and out, so it can be hard to achieve stability."
good,"At Capital One we say we're a tech company that happens to be a bank. In actuality, it is a bank that relies on tech. Highly matrixed and moves incredibly slow. People are nice and work life balance is great. If your content to be a fast follow Capital One is a good place. They are generally not first or even second to market. They rely on data interpretation and efficiency vs high growth."
good,"Company offered lots of training and side by sides, people were nice and knowledgeable. The job was very detailed and the hardest part was finding a good work flow.  Overall Capital One is a great place to work and has a great work environment unfortunately I went as a contractor and my contract ended before they decided to bring people on permanently."
good,You absolutely gain a ton of great experience and opportunities here. However the way they execute performance management is a joke. People with no qualifications or expertise get promoted by their managers is they are a favorite and their managers bully others in calibration sessions. People that should be managed out are just moved to new roles to let the best department deal with them.
good,"Capital One has an amazing work environment. Lots of events to help with team building and fun days. Capital One offers a lot in the way of benefits. The downside is in the compensation. The starting pay in the Recovery/Skip is $16.54 an hour. Per management, the reason for that rate of pay is due to they offer an unlimited bonus program that averages $1000 to $1400 per month. The reality is the bonuses average around $400 per month and only the top 20% qualify. In reality, this is a job for somebody just out of high school or just starting out in college."
good,Capital One is a quality company. They have been a good employer and enjoy working there. They have decent benefits. I have had many experiences and challenges with the company
good,Relaxed call center environment. Have to wait 9 months for advancement which is not ideal for those with experience. Otherwise it is a decent company to work for.
good,"Capital One provided a typical bank teller position. Sales were a requirement, and depending on location could be difficult to meet. Hours were consistent and holidays off is a plus."
good,Capital One is a great place to work. Their benefits are fantastic. The downside is they reorganize a lot. You are never safe from layoffs and having to reapply for another job in the company. There is zero job security
good,"Capital One offers great opportunities for career growth, including coaching, training on specific skills, etc... It also has a good program for young moms, including lactation rooms, and an onsite nurse at the McLean location"
good,A typical day at Capital One involves meeting with your higher authorities and providing your daily analysis on the work that has been done. The workplace culture is like a typically like a startup and you I enjoy it.
good,"Capital One has amazing benefits, there is nothing to debate here. However, recently Capital One has made a few business decisions that have led to continual customer frustration within the bank. "
good,"Repetitive but good environment. Phone calls, customer service and sales but they did a great job of making sure we had fun and coaching us to get better."
good,Innovating at a fast pace describes CapitalOne. The company is very successful and earnings continue to grow. If you like to work on new and exciting technologies this is the company for you.
good,"If you're in the market for free t-shirts and fun activities but not career growth, COAF is it. You get a foot in, in Collections and never leave. I made several attempts to move around the organization and was unable to do so. So I left. I saw so many people who left and came back and that's how they got better positions and pay. It shouldn't be that way."
good,"The US management is great however, Toronto software management was nightmare; you would either follow order stay on the Director side with same voice as his, or leave; if you young you will be good and free as you are not a threat to management, especially to the Director"
good,"Capital One has to have the fun pong table, basketball etc... or else no one would be able to stay. Very stressful; you have to be more social than you would think for a call center job."
good,"Capital One is a company that is extremely focused on office politics. If this is the kind of environment you thrive in, it'll be great for you. If not, you may want to look elsewhere."
good,"If you take a job there and last long enough you'll see my pros and cons soon enough.  I hear it is best to avoid the Chester, va office altogether if possible."
good,CapOne is a fine company- Its a bank so expect to behave like a banker. Lots of turnover makes mane folks uncomfortable but the compensation is good enough
good,"Great people to work with and you can work from home. Calls don’t come in as often as other places I’ve worked. But you are busy sometimes. Decent pay especially for working at home. If you have a family at home while your working make sure they stay as quiet as possible. When they say no background noise they definitely mean it. I believe this job is best if your single and don’t have any young children. Even during meetings, especially calls there is to be no background noise, no pets, children, door bell, door knocks, phone, music. Absolutely nothing, silence. Always make sure you mic is muted during downtime between calls and during meetings so there is very minimal chance for background noise. I can’t stress this enough. They do not tolerate background noise of any kind as to ONE slip up, you will be fired. Other than that the company is great, great benefits and people for the most part"
good,Hate they relocated to Plano. It was a very fun place to work. Capital one valued their employees. Great food in the cafe and basket ball courts in the break area.
good,good benefits and time off. good work culture. management easy to work with. fun activities. hardest part was working customer service. other than that a good place
good,It’s a great job to have part-time but to have full time is to not have time for your kids when it matters most. In the meaning of doctor appointments and field trips school vacation days. Your always at work and they understand to a certain extent then they have to take disciplinary actions against you. It’s an ok job for people who don’t really have family obligations.
good,"Passionate professionals in relation to the BPO industry, great young minds are there to teach to be polite and patient. Veteran leaders and young professionals alike are keen in always achieving excellence"
good,"Calm environment with great co-workers, but poor pay and benefits. Managers are okay. Work load is a bit much, but nothing any normal person can't handle."
good,"Learned a lot about cloud and new technologies in a very short time. The environment is very competitive, but very rewarding as far as improving your technical skills as change is constant here at cap1."
good,"The manager at the Raceland branch is the worst manager to work for. Overall Capital One is okay to work for, they are just pushing to get rid of live people and that makes job security very shady."
good,I love coming to work and working with my co workers. Everyone seems to get along on that level. Management is not consistent. The move you around too much and doesn't give you the chance to grow because each manager is different. Teamwork is very import at this work place and I love being able to reach out and get assistance whenever its needed.
good,"Though my position was a hands on role, they still allowed a work from home day if you needed to be home that day."
good,"I dont want to say anything more"
good,"Great job if you are at one of the major locations in Virginia and can take advantage of the on site benefits. Good if you can keep your nose to the grindstone and bust out numbers, or invent some money saving scheme that catches someones attention"
good,"Lack of advancement and earning potential was not recognized. I was stellar at sales and customer service. Management was ok, during my time there i do firmly believe that i was not being compensated for my skill set and also what i brought to the company itself."
good,"The area of this particular branch was not near any other branch, therefore it made it difficult to receive assistance from corporate and other customer service areas. There were many occasions of co-workers taking off days that were not convenient to others, especially management. The workers had an ""all about me"" mentality, while management had to reschedule her personal life in order to fill in the gaps. "
good,"During my time with Capital One, I learned much about developing processes and managing to a regulatory environment within a bank. I also learned the importance of having sharp senior leadership with specific and clear goals for the company. The lack of this, along with a gap in corporate culture between the U.S. and Canada branches of the company, caused an overall work environment that was somewhat toxic at times."
good,Benefits are great - people are great but things are very scattered throughout the organization.  Very unorganized - too many people working seemingly pointless positions.  Very frustrating place to work.
good,"Culture and perks were awesome."
good,Good Company to work for if you enjoy working with the public. Company encourages collaboration to help meet customer needs and so all transactions go smoothly.
good,"The company will always come first NO MATTER WHAT.. Awesome opportunity to make awesome pay however you will work for it.. The benefits are amazing.. The people I worked with and met, I wouldn't trade for anything in the world. I am thankful for the opportunity and grateful for all that I learned."
good,"The team you work with is awesome. However, after being with the company for almost 20 years I have noticed changes. They do go through a lot of re-structuring which results in layoffs."
good,"Days were long and very full, never a dull moment especially when there's a big sale, or holiday coming and most people want credit so they can shop. The management team was good very family-oriented and easy going structure. There's a lot of support for the needs you need. The company paid based on experience, advancement was definitely difficult task. But even if you didn't have the title you were able to get the experience of the job. Bonuses paid will for this behavior as well. The hardest part of the job would the constant changing for most. But for me I loved that part about it change is good keeps you on your toes and ready for what's next. The most enjoyable part of this job that I will miss the most is the people. The relationships I made over my 20 years at the company was AWESOME!  I wouldn't change this"
good,"Overall, Capital One is a good company. The culture and benefits are fantastic.  The con's I have for Capital One is the political environment in the office along with the year end performance process."
good,"A typical work day is usually busy but we had fun doing it. "
good,"Like every company capital one has the pros and cons .Capitoline is a company that gives you various opportunity, space to grow and time to learn and help you to grow your career."
good,"Typical day - coaching, call reviews, training, meetings, working with multiple departments"
good,Capital One is a great place to work but the job security has associates in limbo. Very diverse and great networking groups that allow you to participate in events that are with other ethnicities. Great benefits but with the constant layoffs it is hard for to assess stability.
good,"Overall its a good place to work.Had a good team which communicates each and every single terms of the project."
good,"I worked in Customer service at Capital One working a 4 day 10 hour shift. It was a call center type environment. The management was good, however the opportunity for advancement seemed limited. However, I would recommend Capital One as a good employer to work for."
good,"Excellent environment for new workers and type A Extroverts. The rest of us, and those who prefer a more purposeful and intentional way of working, may be disappointed."
good,There was a culture that was quite fun at times. The work was different and fairly fast paste. Often I would work alone and that was fine. Working in groups was not needed.
good,"I had 9 managers in 3 years, no one is ever on same page, nice to have 4 wks pto from start, don't like how the use job title to add more work to your role without compensation."
good,I learn the importance of time frames and working in large teams. The people I worked with were always helpful and extremely knowledgeable in their fields.
good,"A good workplace description would be ""up-or-out"" type environment, with smart people as part of the organization, but sometimes rigid and competitive and a not as concerned with the individual contributor."
good,"It was a good company to work for. The defibrillator department was source out Zoll, they are no longer in Beaverton, OR it was a mix culture. had good manament"
good,Great place to work. Lots of smart young people. Fun days every quarter to keep morale up. Lots of interesting projects to work on. Company takes development of its employees seriously.
good,I would not recommend this compnay becuase the mortgage division is way behind the industry and not a priority for Capital one.  They are losing money and have no strategic planning capabilities.
good,"Really don't have anything to say beside the fact that I have been with them and they haven't been able to find me a job in 3 months. To me that is not helping no one, more like stressing a person out."
good,"Capital One is located in the centre of Nottingham opposite the station. The office environment is very open plan, with 2 large sections. The canteen is excellent and subsidised. There is a small team feel to change delivery, and resources are situated close by, which facilities side of desk updates."
good,Great company to work for however job advancement is difficult. Work life balance is hard as each department does not allow for the time to take off when its needed.
good,It was a good place to work. the culture was diverse and it was fun. There was room for growth and opportunity. The day went by fast and there was a lot of things to learn while working there.
good,"Worked 10-12 hour days, no work life balance in my role. "
good,"Great culture, puts the customer first, unlimited development opportunities."
good,"I enjoyed working at Capital One.  Good working environment, great benefits and the management team overall was pretty good.  Would love another opportunity to work with them again."
good,Most of my day I'm coaching my team on how to provide better customer service and process knowledge. I also design process flows to better assist customers. I manage a budget and hire when help is needed. What I like most about my job is helping my employee's and teammates get promoted within the company.
good,"Executives are inspiring, work to do to bring vision down to all areas of the organization.  Great benefits, commitment to community. Work/life balance is good overall."
good,"For one to succeed in Capital one Bank, they will need Advocates. It does not matter whether they are performing their duties or not. The Managers are in full control. They can decide to control their boss. The judgement to the employees are not fair sometimes."
good,"Capital One is an okay place to work my most enjoyment came from the people around. very good benefits, only problem was the management and job security. your job was constantly at risk over a metric that you cant control NPS"
good,"Went to work one day and immediately left to spend the day at King's Dominion.  Getting into the park was completely paid for along with lunch. Got paid my regular scheduled pay, but was not at work."
good,"Monday-Friday 8:00am-4:30pm was the normal work week"
good,The employees are beautiful people. But I do not see to many job advancement for people that have been working there for a while.
good,"Good benefits, 401k, medical, dental and vision, but too many major organizational shifts and changes and lay large scale lay offs every few years."
good,"Overall C1 was a place to start a career but you should only be there short term.  If you luck up and get a FAIR manager, which is rare that might be a good place for long term.  I found that the GOOD managers do not stay any longer than 3 years and within that time frame the are looking for other opportunities.  C1 is Fundamentally Flawed in their management style.  Over the 4 1/2 years the department I was in had 10 managers/supervisor, maybe they relate that to change management.   BUT they do have GREAT benefits...Best of luck...."
good,I worked in an agile project team environment and all the team members were great to work with.  The projects I managed were not complicated and I learned alot from my experience there.
good,"i learned a lot about fraud in banking credit cards , and how to discover when i face any case is fraud or not and how to prevent fraud to be done, and how to advice people to save themselves from fraud ."
good,"Challenging, interesting work in a demanding environment. Loved managing through complexity, which is institutionally baked into the company at this point. "
good,"The company is in the middle of a great movement to become more technologically innovative and fast-paced with a focus on moving into cloud infrastructure and utilizing open source software.  It is invigorating to work here, but be prepared to work some long hours with some intense daily work.  The work-life balance has taken a bit of a downward trend over the past year or so as teams are expected to deliver more with less resources."
good,The job can be mundane. The leaders can be a little distant. This is a black and White company. The hardest part of the job was continuing to stay excited about the job.
good,Its a fun work place with challenging roles as company shifts through its IT strategy. Great people to work with and great opportunity to work on new technologies as Capital One is changing Banking for Good.
good,"It's a great environment to work in with a good work life balance and competitive pay and benefits. However, management is not great. They don't have clear goals and keep changing their strategy constantly"
good,Good values and good job culture.  Environment on the corporate campus is much better than the remote offices.  Good benefits and good time off.
good,"A typical day at Capital One is a fairly good day, You're just not properly compensated of the work that is required of you. The benefits are great, management could use a lot of improvement as well"
good,"Great atmosphere with the potential to learn many new things. My co-workers were great people who were eager to share their knowledge. Management was HORRIBLE. There was a huge lack of leadership and trust with the management, that being the ONLY down side of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was coming in everyday and learning something new."
good,"The organizations leadership is very adept at reading and planning for changes in the economy.  So effective are they that there has never been a down year, from a revenue perspective, in the history of the company."
good,"Pros:"
good,Handled inbound calls for the credit card collections division at Capital One handling escalated calls and assisting customers to get back on their feet and manage their cards better
good,I learned about the credit card industry. It is fast pace work environment. My coworkers were great. I most enjoyable part of my job is with the card holders. The hardest part was the management.
good,"Great work life balance.  Hard to get work done, slow advancement in some areas of the business.  Compensation is good, bonus is sad :("
good,"I work at a very busy branch.  I get along with all of my co-workers.  The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with my customers. I learned how to deal with irate customers.  Some members of the Management team is not very helpful.  Whenever my co-workers and I ask for help, they would pass it on to someoneelse."
good,"Back to back calls, management is fair, hardest part is being micromanaged."
good,"Super place to work"
good,"great benefits, good values. day to day varies depending on department."
good,"Slow paced slightly boring job, though this can vary by branch location. Heavy on sales and customer experience. Branch leadership can be very uninvoled with actually managing team"
good,"Capital One has an excellent benefits package, ie-Vacation time, insurance etc. However, the pay that I received as a Direct Banking Representative was on the lower end of the median. Also, the Supervisory Team which Reps were directed to call in need of Assistance could be very Rude and nasty for no reason. After all, Everyone needs help sometimes. My main issue with Capital One was it wanted to pay Peanuts for 5 Star Customer Service."
good,Capital One is a great business minded company. Capital One leadership demonstrates they do what's best for their share holders and account holders.
good,"I worked at Capital One from 1999 until 2013.  It had many positives, but one of the original attractions was the strong positive culture that existed when I arrived.  With the growth and large number of acquisitions that the company has gone through much of the positive culture has been erased and replaced with a far more chaotic and hyper competitive environment."
good,"Collegial, talented, below market rate for capital markets"
good,Capital One is an evolving company with many moving parts.  While at times it is one the best places to work for it falls short on the communications aspect of ensuring the frontline is well informed.
good,I loved the environment and diversity of the company. Everyone was very helpful and the trainers were thorough with information. I appreciate the detail oriented training class and the independence you have while at work.
good,Packaged many applications and because their policy was to review the packaged apps with the team it just made us all better and better.
good,"A typical day at the bank was fun , interesting . I got very familiar with a lot of my customers . My co-workers were also awesome. We worked hard as a team and individually."
good,"you will keep your job if you hit your numbers."
good,"Has been a good place to work, but may be ready for a change. Enjoy the working environment and have met a lot of good people here."
good,"call center environment meant to have fun, Took and handled high value servicing calls from cardholders that needed to make payments, dispute transactions, report fraud, contact update, credit increased or decreased, reward balance and redemption."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Capital One. Fast pace, and alot of work. Not alot of Job security, but management was great and very understanding for your needs"
good,"Tried about a year to work full-time, denied every time. Amazing training program, management promotes a fun environment. Realistic sales goals."
good,"This bank is ok. I enjoyed my job and the customers. But the general "
good,"Our current job function relates to reviewing accounts for potential Regulatory and Compliance errors.  Throughout the day, my teammates and I collaborate on these reviews.  Our manager encourages quality results by a monthly deadline."
good,"A typical day consists of many customer transactions, lots of small talk as well as handling lots of money."
good,A great place to start a career as a college student. Great management team that wants you to succeed career wise. Great opportunity to move up to management
good,Stressed profitability at the expense of personal/professional relationships
good,"Like the conscientious leadership top of the house; flexible work hours;"
good,"Capital One is a great company and does banking well.  I joined their team during the digestion of Chevy Chase Bank.  Molding the former Chevy Chase Bank employees to the Capital One way proved to be a challenge for the bank.  This ultimately set the grounds for poor customer service, poor associate attitudes, and choice branch management.  If it weren't for the lack of employee relations my career interest would still lie with Capital One.  The credit card side of the bank is a powerhouse in the financial industry and its bank subsidiary needs improving for Capital One to be the most competitive among its peer banks."
good,"When I first started, the bank was called Northfork Bank. Then Capital One acquired it.  It was exciting to be part of this ne venture..  We were the second retail bank acquired by Capital One. And my many years of banking helped me through the transition.  My typical day consisted of opening new accounts and reviewing daily reports.  My co-workers were the greatest and management was ALWAYS fair and supportive."
good,Receiving inbound and making outbound call manually or with a managed dialer and working to find resolution to accounts 
good,"A typical day consist of assisting phone agents. I'm constantly visible on the production floor to answer questions, and troubleshoot system issues. I also have 3-4 agents assigned to me monthly that may be struggling in performance areas that I help to up-train and coach to improve their stats. I also work on departmental reports that are presented to senior leadership on a weekly and monthly basis."
good,"Awesome benefits!! Lots of employee recognition. Travel to other cities. Benefits start day one and you have over 140 paid hours off, you can purchase more if needed. The pay sucks and you are not allowed to discuss it because no one makes the same thing you have people in the back office dealing with all of the paper work and data entry making less then basic call center. Management is not so great since they are mostly friends you can't really address your concerns if you have conflict with your manager it only hurts you. The company has a lot of employee morale programs."
good,Jobs is ok but not what expected. More of a customer service representative. I have many years experience in relationship building type of sales.
good,"This was a call center job that wasn't for me. However, I was subjected to angry customer calls and it prepared me for those types of situations."
good,"Processed checks, balanced general ledgers, researched problems with payments on customer accounts, posted mortgage payments, resolved customer problems, helping out other departments so all made their goals for our customers, always learning new systems and to better understand the entire payment process, worked with other banks to resolve outstanding issues, generally just enjoyed doing my job."
good,Each day consisted of several teleconference meetings. Co-workers were helpful and competitive. Having had this experience will help me in future endeavors.
good,Managed employees in a collections call center environment
good,Management left a lot to desired. Lack of communication and meetings were often squandered time.
good,"My time at Capital One has proven to be pretty fun, despite some questionable management procedures, at the end of the day, I focus on quality of quantity. With this concept in mind, I have believed that there are still some management at Capital One that believe in this value...they are who I identity the most with."
good,"A typical day at Capital One is assisting customers at my desk with their accounting needs in reference to creating personal and business checking accounts for our customers. In fact, the management team is always their to assist you with any problems that you might be experiencing at the particular time. Nevertheless, there were a few nice people there at Capital One. The hardest thing working at Capital One is not being able to spend a lot of time with your customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is learning new ways on how to do your job productively and efficiently."
good,"I loved the co workers, it really was a good place to work. management was a little different, I never really seen the managers."
good,Capital one is a place that you could move around and exceed in the company. Slow pace.
good,"A typical day is being scheduled on a phone for 10 hours/4 days a week for customer service. Examples include: General information like balances, transfering funds and providing transactions. You service all banking accounts like checking, savings, loans, CD and Iras. You rarely can find a manager which is ok except when there is a serious issue you are needing assistance with so you then have to walk around till you find a manager to assist. I learned a lot in my career and till this day I am still learning. I like being able to help customers with there accounts and helping them understand banking concepts for the future."
good,The work was not bad at all. The branch I worked at was very busy. The believe in training their employees which is very good. You only work weekends every 4 Saturdays which is fine.
good,"The environment depends on where you work. They have call centers, offices and branches. Overall experience is good."
good,Love to work for capone. Enjoyed workin here. Learned a lot. Good company. Very good company.
good,I work for a very busy 9-7 Branch and despite a full staff I am consistently work 12hr days. The Management is poor and to my knowledge this is throughout the company.
good,great manager with extra ordinary technical skills. Hoping to work with him in the future. Highly knowledgeable and supportive. Capable of handling situations during hard times.
good,"Manager and up are unconsciously bias and tends to have better relationships with co-located peers. Out of sight, out of mind and it's a disadvantage; culture clash between locations."
good,stressful environment. friendly management. unrealistically high call volume. limited breaks good benefits. overtime when available. paid holidays. verbal abuse from customers
good,"Capital One is definitely a stepping stone in anyone's occupation history, but do not let it be the only one unless you move up. The  management team is understanding of family."
good,I enjoyed having the opportunity to work and learn the life of credit cards. I seen the good bad and the ugly side of it. It wasn't cut out for a kind heart like myself.
good,"Overall there is a great culture at Capital One - a lot of smart and driven people.  The performance management process is unbelievably cumbersome and getting worse (from 1x a year, to 2x a year, to now 4x a year).  Particularly challenging are calibrations and rating distribution policies."
good,"Je suis déjà reconnaissans par le fait que  j'aime tout ce ce vous me faites,raison pour laquelle je vous  remercie. Je vais  toujours continuer dans cette  même  lancée."
good,"Technology wise CapitalOne is ahead of other banks                 "
good,"Fun fast paced environment. Very competitive. Great benefits. Company believes in work life balance and loves to spend money on their associates. They have fun days, and off site fun days as an incentive for top performers."
good,"You have to perform in order to keep your job. Their system is flawed. They're not quick to release you, but they pressure you to meet department measurements."
good,"Work with smart people"
good,"Capital One was a great place to work with. I worked in a very wealthy part of Long Island and my customers were great. Overall, I enjoyed working with Capital One but during my time as a banker, I did not seen myself moving forward with the banking side of things. I do however enjoy more than i can explain, working on the commercial lending side. I work very closely with the Capital One loan teams in VA and Mellville, NY, and my goal is to transition into a career path as such."
good,"Early on, Capital One was a great place to work.  We were empowered to come up with solutions to problems, and to entrepreneurial."
good,"I was working in an inbound and outbound call center."
good,Capitalone is my first project and working as Contractor for 7 years as the contractor. It is good place for workstyle. I recommend Capitalone for my friends.
good,"it was fun working here, great management, learnt a lot in the field but was very limited room for promotions. Fridays were always a very chill day for us lol."
good,Great manager and people that I worked with. Can’t say anything bad about them. The people that I worked with were awesome and friendly. The only thing was I wanted to get hired on and they didn’t bring me on. My hours was great for the Datacenter.
good,"Casual dress. Supportive management. Good benefits package. Clean office. Good salary. Well stocked vending machine. Free hot beverages, oatmeal and a variety of sous in a cup."
good,They have numerous activities for employees and is a family environment. They are very strict with attendance no matter the circumstances you cant miss any days
good,Capital One offers great programs to grow your career. There are opportunities to connect with Mentors and learn other lines of business.  More than just a bank this company is very tech savvy.
good,Capital One pays well and has great benefits calls were back to back all day and the hours were long . The work is very tedious in the collections department. You have to be very detailed oriented because it is easy to make mistakes which will cost you your job.
good,"Upper management should look closely on how team managers are doing their tasks. Some of them lacks the credibility to run a team, it seemed like they are just appointed to do the tasks. Other than that, Capital One is a great company with lots of opportunities for growth."
good,Fun environment. Good coach. Difficult to advance in same umit. Re-org every 3-4 yeare screws up any headway made to streamline units. Very frustrating.
good,Very minimal hands-on programming. No peer programming whatsoever. Work/life balance is great but young developers  (usually out of college) are not given enough opportunities to get more involved in the software development process.
good,"They have great benefits such as healthcare, dental, vision. They also offer 401k, stock options, and paid vacation. They no longer have the capital one investing division."
good,I really like the culture at Capital One however they are fast paced and constantly changing.  The systems are antiquated and difficult to get a handle on when first onboarded.  The company is constantly implementing new systems and change and it becomes difficult to keep your work and contacts.
good,On the phone helping customers with tech support issues. Once a week in team meetings and meeting with supervisor to go over performance. Capitol one has great management.
good,"Capital One is a good company to work for in terms of benefits; however, the advancement opportunity is in a decline and the overall direction the company is  taking, has decreased moral and work-life balance"
good,"I enjoy the quarterly team outings, the yearly campus carnival, up to 7 weeks paid time off with tenure, doctor and pharmacy on site, and fitness center on site. "
good,"Working here you definitely have a work life balance. There were never any long hours that you would expect at the larger firms. But with that balance, so also are on the lower end of compensation."
good,Work culture is collaborative. People are smart problem solvers but the organization is risk averse as they need to comply with the many financial regulations.
good,"Culture is off. Several banks merged together. Still feels like us v. them v. you. Also, can seem very: right hand doesn’t know what the left is doing. Too much paperwork."
good,Capital One is one of the few institutions that is actively taking a step toward the digital age.The acceptance of online banking and transitioning many features to online is Capital One's strong point.
good,"Change is often for the best, but the rate of change at Capital One is difficult on the associates as well as customers.  Capital One changes things so often that customers are consistently learning about new accounts or methods of banking, even if they don't want the change.  If they aren't willing to conform, Capital One is fine with taking the loss. That being said, Capital One is a company that provides wonderful benefits.  Paid time off, materity/paternity benefits, Health Savings Plan, etc.  You name it, they offer it!"
good,"I enjoy the worklife balance at Capital One, as it offers the opportunity to allow associates to tend to family and personal matters that may have not been possible to manage over busy weekends."
good,"I liked everything except my manager, felt like I was judged from day one and could never get past that initial judgement. I learned a lot about tech and everyone was smart and innovative."
good,"The company as a whole is a great place to work. The department I am in is in the process of being eliminated, so its hard to rate them. "
good,"Typical day at Capital One was clock in take back to back calls until your 15 minute break, then back to back calls until lunch. "
good,"Once I brought my client base of 30 years on board with me, then I was not needed any longer.  This happened during the economic down turn of 2009.  This company was new in banking in Texas, and needed a quick way to build a client base."
good,The training was long but because there were a few people asking millions of questions. But the trainer was good and they gave you most all the tools need  to do your job. All in all I would go back there and work the property is very nice and there is a big food court and a gym.
good,Capital One is not for everyone I some people thrive others don't make it long. My biggest issue was that there was no set standards on what was required on a call and because the managers change so offend that once your get used to what was expected with one an other come in and has a completely different standard.
good,Good place to work at.  Very fast pace and stay busy at all times.  Great place to interact and help people with their financial needs.  Excellent work environment.
good,"My coworkers are the best people trustworthy and dependable. Card disputes is an ever changing job due to risk and regulations, which is the most enjoyable part of the job. I've learned how to be a leader and a teacher while being an expert in my current role."
good,"This is a fantastic company but only if you fit a certain personality. You must be jovial, bubbly and aggressive in order to move up. I guess your typical corporate environment."
good,"I worked in funding, was a simple job however after the summer it’s slow which means work runs out quick if you have a late schedule your left with no work, which bring your production all the way down ."
good,"Good Place to learn New Technologies  where as the change is very frequent."
good,Capital One is an amazing company.  I am not sure of what their vision is at this point.  Work home life balance is amazing.  However they relocate families whenever management knows there are already shutting down a dept.
good,Capital one is a very good company to work for. We were going through a new management phase but overall great company. It started out as an internship through my high school. Then became permanent a little bit after.
good,"a typical day at work was on the phone, heavy call volume with two breaks a day. You receive heavy training, but litter room for errors. great management, but high turnovers. Parking wars."
good,"Capital One is a wonderful place to be. In the department I was hired under the management is poor. We were put on a ""lend"" in September 2017 and we are still on it (Feb2018). We were given a total of 5 days for training but are still being held responsible for the errors that are made. The actual training process for this line of work is 5 weeks. We were given 5 days, and will continue to be on the lend until April."
good,"Company pay and benefits is exceptional, however, its highly competitive with a lot of turnover / churn.  Seems like experience is under appreciated as new leaders ""make their mark""."
good,"Work/life balance was very inconsistent for me. The jobs was wonderful and the benefits are the only thing keeping me around now. Because I can not be accommodated with scheduling, I am leaving the company."
good,was very busy calls were steady and the work life was very please I enjoyed working with my peers  the atmosphere was warm and inviting due to it being so relaxed in reference to having a dress down casual day everyday
good,You meet great people and depending on your position the work isnt bad but management doesn't look out for your best interest career wise. Overall moral is pretty good due to team outings and food.
good,"very fair place to work, you will love your coworkers, bonuses have been taken away but it was replaced wit a 3 dollar raise so most people there aren't making less than 18 dollars per hour"
good,"Benefits, 401k plan is excellent"
good,"Better options for employess and offers to"
good,"Capital One tries to be a technologically progressive company but isn't doing a very good job, at least in San Francisco. The directive from senior management is that C1's interpretation of ""AGILE"" is that all Developers will be full-stack engineers. As a result, Quality Assurance specialists have been eliminated and developers are testing their own code and the code of their peers, like 50 years ago before Software QA was born. Quality is deteriorating as a result. Every developer is expected to also be an expert on Amazon Web Services, several computer languages and Devops, but the peer support in this endeavor is lacking. "
good,Needs to improve on somethings such as part time benefits. I say this because other banks have much better part time benefits than capital one. Also the pay is not good for all the work that they have me doing.
good,"Typical Day At Work. The work load isn't difficult , as long as you're trained properly but some of management is terrible. There is a mixed atmosphere."
good,Managed the daily operations of the Retention department. They reived incoming calls and took care of the customer's needs.  They forwarded the difficult ones to me.
good,Capital One is a good company.  Lots of incredibly talented people working there.  Plenty of challenge.  Culture is very competitive and work environment is stressful.
good,"Great company to work for. They are very involved in the community so there is a lot to participate in. They care about their employees a whole lot. Benefits are great! Also very innovative company. They are all about tech! "
good,You are  made to do  more then advised.. changes happen often and  You  have to  just  adjust  or else. Benefis  are  the best  here.01k is  matched and other discounts offered
good,"Overall good coworkers, but the overall job experience isn't that great. I would prefer it if everything was a bit less uptight, and I wish they were more understanding."
good,I worked for the company for almost 12 years and i love the culture the company offers as well as the work life balance afforded. I have learned so much over the years about business as well as people. I think Capital One is one of the leading banks simply because they focus on the people doing the work and that matters. I believe that the culture is unmatched from what I have seen. I think that there are so many locations and departments available that there is something for everyone.
good,"There is good work life balance at Capital One.  The environment is ever changing, which can be a strength as well as a weakness; sometimes the change is too constant and doesn't allow an associate to find their footing.  Overall, upper management is involved and makes real effort to be visible and open, and there is room for advancement."
good,I worked as contractor for this company. For a very short period of of time. I liked the work culture. Also the analyst team I was working for. I just wanted to move to full time position.
good,"I enjoyed working for Capital One, however after 21 years the company has decided to close some branches in the South TX Market in which both of the branches that I am managing were affected. I understand that business decisions will be made and I respect that, however working with the customers in retail banking for over 2 decades I feel that the company is going to lose the quality core base of conservative customers who bring quality deposits and with that growth opportunities that the younger, more digitally savvy age group will not. Not only that, but the company is losing highly skilled and quality associates. I appreciate what Capital One has done for my career and look to take my skills and knowledge learned to continue my work with another growing company where I can be valued."
good,"Fun workplace with great people. They talk about the opportunity for advancement although I never saw this opportunity presented. They used to care about employee moral, but that seems to have gone out the window with more drive toward customer satisfaction."
good,"Typical day, includes taking call and servicing customers with fraud concerns. Relating with agents and customer on all levels, Using various system to complete tasks."
good,"Good overall company, diverse culture & great work life balance. Several company sponsored team outings per year. Annual reviews and raises. Promotion process can be challenging."
good,the hardest part of the job is working with angry customers on the phone. it's also very frustrating feeling like the coaches don't quite understand. best part of the job is the coworkers.
good,The company has a massive disconnect from the top and the bottom of the food chain. It's all about goals and very little to do with how you get them. The middle management is there to cover themselves when things go bad and lift themselves up when its going really well.
good,Capital One provides and enormous amount of education to help develop you to become a well rounded employee. Most positions are fast paced and the company is definitely moving in the direction of being a digital leader. To be agile will help you succeed with Capital One.
good,"very positive"
good,"This is a fast paced environment, in which associates must respond quickly to the changes in the financial services environment. "
good,"Good work life balance, great team building activities, Good training and management team. Overall good place to work"
good,"Great corporate structure, questionable management. Great work/life balance. Takes a long time to convert contractors."
good,Good people the management is also kind an generous and caring the job is secure and comfortable. However there tends to be a focus o mistakes instead of progress and a low rate of advancement.
good,"Overall this is not a thrilling place to work. Management is lacking and the culture is very emotionally numbing. Customer interactions are treated more as ""transactions"" not an experience. Many branches were closing at the time of my employment."
good,"a nice place to work. great manager and co-workers.  office politics from upper management overwhelms staff, no encouragement, a lot of pressure.  This is relatively a small branch and there are times where we have no customers for come in for a while.  Its nice to speak to clients and learn about them.  Gives me pleasure in knowing them and helping them anyway i can."
good,"Some District Managers recruited into the Company in the NYC Queens Market, are not reflecting the Capital One values,  creating high tension by practicing questionable politics; as a result, hurting employees royalty, morale and performances."
good,The people I work with are extremely friendly and make the environment great. The only issue I have is that my department is being eliminated and I now have to find another position.
good,Capital One is a great company with the opportunity to gain different skills. They provide extensive training opportunities and good health benefits. Their turnover has become a stressing situation for many as they make changes based on their growth.
good,"Great co-workers. Very nice work environment, and benefits. Job security and stability is a big concern. Things changes so often that it is very easy to get lost."
good,"Loved working with my peers and networking across the company. There are times the company feels very reactive to changes they want to implement leaving the frontline management feeling lost, confused, and frustrated. This then creates doubt about where the company is headed hence the site being closed due to lack of direction in my opinion. Overall though, the benefits, people, and overall culture the company prides themselves in are second to none compared to other comparable jobs I've had. You had fun at work, worked hard, and had the flexibility between work/home."
good,"The managers I reported to and interacted with were supportive and provided a relaxed, fun atmosphere. Most enjoyable part of this job is the people. Most frustrating part is the disconnect between frontline associates and intent owners."
good,"Great place to work, great benefits. Unfortunately my job was eliminated. Relocating was not an option for me. We were given a tremendous amount of help in finding new jobs and was even were offered positions at the current cite. The schedules was not suitable to my life needs."
good,"Every Monday consisted of all day meetings "
good,I love the fact that there was something new going on at the branch.  there was never a boring day.  I always have something different to handle which make the day better.   The best part was helping clients with their financials issues.  You learned something new every day.  Each client is unique.
good,"One of the few organizations which truly walks the talk about work life balance. "
good,I've worked for capital one for over 10 years and overall I would say its a good place to work but the work/life balance is not realistic for working moms
good,Great place to work at with many opportunities for career growth and advancement. Management is ever changing which can make the most loyal employee weary of the companies long term goals for their personnel.
good,"This company was fast paced, fun and exciting. They shut down but I really enjoyed working there. I dealt with customers on a national level and learned a lot by working here."
good,"Change is a regular occurence, requires much flexibility. lots of freedom day to day, however lengthy check ins. good peers"
good,Learned all about auto finance and new to the mortgage portion of the industry. Worked front and back loans in the auto division and always had competitive but friendly coworkers to team up with. Managers will assist to the best of ability to advance you in different roles.
good,"The typical work day at Capital One consist of an unbeleivable amount of task that seems to grow everyday. It seems like it is not enough time in the Capital One work day to complete all of the task."
good,"Very busy stressful at time "
good,"Good job if you like to be on the phone all day.  It was easy to learn programs and help customers."
good,"I have learned that although I believe I possess a high level of professionalism and patience, Capital One Bank has enabled me to strengthen those skills significantly. Some days can be very trying and overwhelming, but its a rewarding feeling to know that I am successful in those areas no matter how difficult things can get. I also love my customers walking away feeling as if I have made their experience satisfying and extremely pleasant. The hardest part of my job is knowing that no matter how hard I try, not everyone is going to be happy. Unfortunately, there are escalated circumstances that are beyond my control at times depending on the customers concerns. The most enjoyable part is working with my particular team of people. We are a family and they are amazing!"
good,Great company to work for overall. They are very diversified and have many opportunities for advancement.
good,Overall good place to work but a very micro managed business. The emphasis is on quality of work and it is a bit difficult to pass their standards.
good,Management was unprofessional. Other than that it is a good company great benefits.
good,"Amazing leadership, great coworkers, professional environment. If you like to be really competitive and challenged on a daily basis?? this is the job for you."
good,"A difficult place to get a promotion."
good,"I enjoyed working for Capital One on a daily basis. Everyday consisted of a hard working team, and regular customers. The day required taking care of customer transactions.(deposits, cashing checks, withdrawal of funds) Also on any down time we did filing, and organizing any customer information.(alphabetically and/or by month and day) answering phones, emails, and strategizing plans to meet goals. I learned that dedication, hard work, and focus were key in my role. Keeping a positive a professional attitude made an exceptional work day. The hardest part of the job was the high turnover and often being short-staffed. But we always managed with what we had. The most enjoyable part of my job was the friendships I gained and the knowledge from each of my coworkers."
good,Capital One is a decent place to work. Phone job for customer service. Take inbound calls to solve cardholder concerns.
good,A great work culture. Fun place to work. The teamwork aspcet is clearly encouraged. Moral is an imprtant part of their work/life balance.
good,Very slow in advancing employees. I enjoyed the benefits and the flexible hours.
good,A typical day at work consist of talking with customer via phone while determining dispute rights.  Management is helpful and willing to assist you in advancing. The hardest part of the job for me is being on the phone. 
good,"Great on-site training workshops to enhance employee efficiency. A lot of fun day interactive activities for employees to create work-life balance. A typical day consist of doing payment processing due diligence, mailing of title documents to customers and third parties upon completion of auto loan payment. Phone call resolutions with insurance companies, division of motor vehicles and dealerships. Entry of payoff auto loan amounts for major third party clients and submission of spreadsheets back to client at the end of business day. "
good,"I learned plenty about collections and customer service. Would have loved to continue working there and advance but unfortunately, there was little room for advancement unless you were an outside hire. I would call people that were past due 3-5 months on their car payments. I would also try to locate the vehicle and send the information over to our repo agents. I made plenty of friends there, and still keep in contact with many of them. The best part about the job, was the vacation days and health benefits. The hardest part was  having to be in such a negative environment of trying to take people's cars away every day and knowing there was little room for advancement within the company. "
good,"Good overall company, strong financials, pay & benefits are quite high. Very competitive & political though, review process can be subjective & petty, doesn't always look out for the best interest of employees."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was my interaction with my clients with whom I built strong professional relationships with. My second favorite part was working with my staff and coaching them to increase their performance. As an employee of this company, the least enjoyable part was working long hours with no recognition. Working long hours is expected as a manager, and I actually enjoyed the time spent, but acknowledgement and recognition from senior management would have been nice."
good,"Where I worked was a mostly slow branch of Capital One. It's basically was a 9-5 office job. Not much to say, show up, sit at your station and deal with customers all day. Very nice coworkers, I still believe they are some of the best people I've ever worked with. But job pay and benefits aren't very good."
good,"Capital one was a great place to work for. I gained knowledge about refinancing loans, credit and interest rates. My co-workers were very pleasant to work with and were always there to help when needed. I must say the most enjoyable part of this job was being able to help people bring their delinquent accounts current."
good,"• Increased efficiency of code, by using bulk collection techniques to handle large amounts of data"
good,"Company is going through growing pains; out growing sites, rethinking how work is delivered, etc."
good,A typical day starts at 7 am. There are several conference calls and interaction with the team members and customers. I enjoy the fast pace and the complex issues that come my way. The hardest part of the job is the inter-departmental communication. Somethings take too long to resolve which can be dreadful. The one thing that enjoy is developing my team to have high level interactions with customers and exceed the expected service delivery. this in return translate into better sales opportunities.
good,"Work is fairly challenging and analytical in nature. There are plenty of opportunities to hone your technical and business skills here, from sql to SAS, valuation to deck building."
good,Great benefits and work life balance. Middle management could have better people in place.
good,"Capital One's Bengaluru office is tiny and doesn't quite integrate well into Capital One's operations onshore. This office is heavily driven by politics, and has not had a strong direction or goals throughout the period I worked there. "
good,"Overall it was a good place to work.  Management made or destroyed it. "
good,"The facilities and amenities are great. They have massage chairs, gaming area and gym. But when it comes to the management, I can't say that it is great. Too much politics going around. Managers tend to favor some employees over the others."
good,"Overall, my experience of Capital One was rather good. The company culture, as well as the amount of resources (both personal and professional) and the benefits are very nice and generous compared to a lot of other companies."
good,"Every day is a productive day"
good,"Nice Working in Capital One , And learnt many new technologies. Had a friendly environment.  AWS is the primary cloud tech. they used and they have their own softwares built to use."
good,Great for preparing but work/life balance needs work.  The company provides technical opportunity but the work/life balance leans extremely heavy to work.
good,"Answered incoming phone calls regarding questions on credit card accounts. Most days very busy, high call volume. Received a lot of valuable training to assist customers."
good,"None stop busy from the time you sign in until the time you clock out. I learned many things and so much changes constantly. Problem Solving and research I had to do a lot with Customers. There were some things that I experienced that was not fair and Management was not able to do anything about it in my defense. The hardest part of the job was back to back calls all day but the most enjoyable part of the day was when I was able to satisfy my customers, put a smile on their face, so it would be the connection I often had with all of my Customers. Capital One is very diverse, and everyone got along and helped each other as a team."
good,"Capital One culture changes drastically over the past couple of years.  Although the mission is followed , the digital experience has taken the from seat and caused many business line eliminations and cut backs."
good,"The culture of non-leadership employees was great. People from all walks of life. We were encouraged to be unique. Hairstyles, hair colors, and the dress code was not policed."
good,"work was fine.   a typical day would just be to come in and start working and finish files that needed to be completed.  "
good,The corporate values and mission are not followed by many managers. Favoritism prevails regardless of skill set in the credit/risk analytics service area..
good,"Great place to work as long as you live in one of their people center areas.  Excellent benefits and Capital One really seems to care about their employees, until someone decides a certain geographic location is no longer important."
good,"Capital One is an alright company to work for. The biggest downside is that policies and the programs used to work is always changing. They also like to shut down whole markets and lay off many people. Despite these detractors I had supportive managers, a positive work environment, and enjoyed additional benefits."
good,Company has a lot of great benefits and opportunities to offer.  You have to be on the top of your game all the time.  They base performance on cross calibration so if you are not working on a 'special' project then you are likely to be in the bottom of the tier.  There is opportunities for advancement throughout the company.
good,"Company was great however mortgage two closed down, otherwise this would have been a good company to work for.  Management was great.  Process for daily work needed improvements."
good,"put in years only to get laid off.  very disappointed after long service, but the benefits are like the golden handcuffs."
good,"Overall Capital One is a great employer and an e,cellent place to work. However, any disagreement with management and your overall experience can change, somet8mes for the worst. If you are able to find a supportive team with a great manager, you will be successful."
good,"I was laid off twice 2013 and 2018; closed down "
good,Compensation and benefits were great. Takes a lot of patience to call people who are going through a difficult time financially to make a payment on their car or credit card.
good,A Fast-Pace Work Environment. Capital One is All about CHANGE. .... They are always striving to provided the best and most-effective ways and programs to assist our customers. The Hardest part of the Job is Measuring Up to Captial One's Quality Standards. The Most Enjoyable part of the Job are the Many Benefits that come along with being A CapOne Employee
good,The one thing I miss about this company is the vacation time. The management would not hire experienced people and management itself was not experienced in Mortgage either.
good,"competitive salary"
good,"I decline to review Capital One and limit my review to the Rate this company section. Overall Rating of 3 stars, Job Work/Life Balance of 3 stars.  Compensation/Benefits of 5 stars.  Job Security/Advancement of 3 stars. Management of 4 stars and Job Culture of 3 stars."
good,"Typical Call Center problems. They do try hard to show you they care, which is nice, but you're still a just cog that gets lost in a huge machine and it shows."
good,"The company is rapidly growing as and giving many employees more flexibility with management."
good,very cool and laid back fast paced work place. this is a great company to grow and excel at. Bonuses every month. Very competitive job and very decent pay!
good,"more to offer on site than just the spaces for work and breaks! CAPITAL ONE has many resources on site for your convenience, for well being , for maturiy"
good,"Restructuring locations so currently closing branches"
good,All around nice company to work for with good benefits but little pay. Management could prepare you a little better in some cases. Really no complaints just feel as if room for growth and pay could be better
good,"A lot of change - constantly. Not a lot of advancement, they hire outside rather than promote. "
good,Capone is a great place to work but suffers from selfish under trained management as well as not being given a fair chance a certain jobs do to management wanting to hire their friends.
good,"Great culture and company-sponsored training. Room for rapid advancement if you are in an entry-level position However, there are more lateral opportunities and fewer opportunities for promotion at the mid-level management range."
good,I learned a lot here and the culture was good. Management was good but I didn't feel that my ideas were heard. The company hired a consulting firm after I had spent a lot of time on the project which undermined all my efforts.
good,"I loved  working at Capital One Bank,i enjoyed seeing my customer walked a with a great customer service experience.The hardest part of my job is not working with team players."
good,"First off the company in itself is wonderful. I love everything about Capital Ones mentality. Awesome benefits and an awesome experience they really do try to make things very convenient. The call center I had was very lax in all honesty the facility comes off as a 40% play and 60% work. The only issue was I felt undermined a bit. It was my first call center experience, and they make it seem like it's almost impossible to get terminated. Being a new hire I received a good amount of training. Two weeks were spent on the phone during training to make sure you are ready. When I got on the floor though everything was great, events were held, and we even did community service. My manager was awesome, but sadly I feel like being a new hire I did not receive the feedback I was deserved. The managers are awesome, but I feel like the majority of there time is spent talking to seasoned people. Kind of leaving the new people to just fend and learn for themselves. I did get terminated but I was doing the same thing for over two months and I would have three supervisors come speak with me daily. Not including the managers who were available as well who received daily reports on your performance. I was terminated for something that someones bosses boss had to find. It made me feel like my direct management should of been aware of this issue day one. My only advice is if you are able to get the job take it, but do not rely on management. They are there for you but they seem to be to unresponsive with newer hires. My advice get the job do not rely on people above you when hired just stick strictly"
good,Offer great work life balance.  Decent benefits.Fairly competitive salary.  Onsite gym and medical office in some locations.  Too many organizational changes and redeployments within Technology. Your bonus will be based on how strong your manager will present your skills against others - so hope for a manager who will fight for you.... Very difficult to be promoted as each department is only allowed so many promotions per year.
good,"Was part of COF as the result of the ING Direct acquisition.  was not there long enough to provide a thorough review.  seems like a positive culture that fosters collaboration, learning and advancement.  "
good,Capital one  has a lot of location.  If you need a Capital one bank you can pretty much find one anywhere.  They are currently up on technology when it comes to banking.
good,Flexible work schedules great benefits. Very comfortable work environment. There is some help with career path. Cafeteria area in building makes lunch easy and flexible.
good,Challenging place to work with supportive management.  The project management role at Capital One provided an incredible amount of learning opportunities through new projects and mentors.
good,"Great place to work/wonderful people to work with my experience there was pleasant. I've learned to be a team player as well as you need to work hard to keep what you have. the hardest part of my job would be to meet quotas, the majority of my co-worker were a pleasure to work with."
good,"-Based on my location it starts off busy then slows down in the middle of the day and picks up in the last two hours of the day"
good,Capital One is an ever chagning culture and is pushing to move further into the digital world. There is a log jam for promotions but the work enviornment is still positive for the most part. There is a good work/life balance.
good,Working their was a lot of fun and very challenging my coworkers were great to work was sometimes to intense and to many changes and sometimes dishonesty among upper management
good,"Company is extremely sales/goals oriented. Great benefits. Hit or miss with fellow employees and managers- like any job. Overall, happy here. Really depends on your branch manager though how happy you'll be/ end up."
good,"I had a great time here, fun and engaging with employees. The managers help you as much as possible and understand when situations come up."
good,I look forward to going to work everyday. Never settle always try and move up. Mangers need to interact with agents more. Co-workers are team player. The monthly activities -offsite lunch with the team
good,"Capital One is a great place to work, if work-life balance is your number one priority. Managers generally are very considerate when it comes to respecting personal commitments, and the culture within the company is collaborative and relatively non-cutthroat. Unfortunately, this results in a lot of unmotivated associates and some questionable hires above their competency levels. Double-standards are also prevalent, as different groups often have dramatically different requirements for promotions. Superstars advance more quickly than average by Capital One standards, but are not compensated commensurate to market value; meanwhile low-performers are often allowed to remain on payroll."
good,"A fast-paced environment with high levels of attentiveness and customer service skills required."
good,"I help on projects, reports asked from management team to help the production of the other employees. "
good,"from a current employee..."
good,"Enter data into Mortgage Servicers Software. Complete Checklist for Foreclosures, Collections, Bankruptcy and Loss Mitigation. On a team that was Auditing Bank of America to see why homes went to foreclosures. Complete Special assignments due on monthly basis. Perform review of customer mortgage transactions to ensure accuracy and quality of the data as well documenting any findings. Ensure compliance guidelines are met with all Capital One and regulatory requirements. Complete reports where issues are notated and include resolutions steps and follow up responsibility. Verify monitoring results. Partner with Quality Assurance Specialist to research exiting operational process and monitor risk. Work independently and meet stringent deadlines by entering 300 entries a day. Detailed oriented with strong organizational skills."
good,"Working at Capital One has provided some excellent opportunities to learn more about the credit card industry.  The organizational culture is supportive of its' employees.  There are numerous opportunities for advancement if your a driven, goal oriented, solutions-minded worker that knows how to network."
good,"Overall it was good."
good,It was a nice place to work at and the people were friendly. The place was very welcome made you feel welcome. 
good,"This particular position is very demanding. You must be commited to working long shifts and have strong customer service skills. Must be able to multi task and work well with fellow associates. The hardest part of this job is the ability to balance all of your duties, esp. operational while working as a teller and being consistantly understaffed. "
good,"Serve as part of the Enterprise Services Team in developing and implementing next generation banking systems architecture. Provide daily administration of Financial, Risk, Fraud, and J2EE/Web related systems. Monitor and proactively support capacity planning and analysis. Develop system administration standards and procedures to maintain consistent practices."
good,Hours were flexible. Either 8am-5pm or 3pm to midnight with 1 hour lunch break and 2x15 minute breaks. On a desktop most of the time with a headset. 2-2:30hr work sessions.
good,Working for FIS Global/Capital One has been a rewarding experience. They work witih you and give you opportunities for training.
good,Multitask phone lines and making sure customer was satisfied with the answer to question. Invironment of work was not that great. The most enjoyable part of the job was when the day was over with.
good,"overall good place to work, descent pay, work with your schedule, descent benefits."
good,Capital One had some great managers but the management turnover is insane! I have 6 managers during my 2 years there 2 of which are no longer with the company. The HR department is awful! Had a terrible experience during a harassment and stalking incident and the HR department basically said it was my fault in different words. Benefits and work life balance was great. If my safety wasn’t threatened on a daily basis by a coworker I would’ve stay s there for the long haul
good,Capital One has closed way to many branches! I worked at Capital One for 17 years and in 1 day my job ended! Great Company to work for but no loyalty just business
good,"Great work culture but too many branch closures. Also, they are cutting back on many useful departments such as mortgages, financial advising, etc...."
good,If you want to be technical moster? then choose capital one.Technology they are far ahead from the market and they will upfront on implementing new technologies available in the market.
good,Great pay and benefits. Lots of driving. good managers. Company grew to fast and ended up laying off most sales staff in 2008. Traveled a lot at nice locations.
good,"The best part about working at Capital One was the benefits, they are awesome!  Its takes a while to move up in the company and it is very competitive. Management is awesome and they work with you.  The company plans different events that force you to work together. As a teller you are forced to upsale customers on products and get them to sit with a banker which makes it easier on the banker. Pay is quite low. Do not expect to live the lavish life working here."
good,One of the best benefits i have found is flexible scheduling and ability to make those decisions without feeling like i would be judged negatively. This is huge when you have a family and need to be able to be there for them.
good,The culture was very nice! The rallies were the best part and thy recognize employees for their hard work. The games they set up were fun and the food was great!
good,"Capital One is ok for a banking institution. If you want to have a lengthy career there I would suggest headquarters because, the branches are doing that great."
good,"I love the story around Capital One and what they stand for, "
good,"I would open at least half of the days in my work week, I would conduct surprise weekly. monthly. and quarterly audits on the teller line as well as spot checks. I loved doing the compliance side of branch banking. The hardest part about my job was keeping my tellers happy and amicable with each other, which some times was very taxing!"
good,"I do believe that Cpaital One is a pretty good company to work for. I think Capital one can be more than a ""good"" company. If Capital One valued their employees just as much as they value their customers."
good,"I worked with and for really great people. I enjoyed the culture when I arrived, but things changed. The culture was changing to something I wasn't enjoying and we seemed understaffed, which led to a very stressful work environment. I would recommend this job for anyone in the area, especially students, because of the direct managers being so great as well as the great pay for the area. It's a great place to work in St. Cloud while you're in school. There are some areas for advancement, but they are hard to come by."
good,"Capital one was a great stepping stone, but not a destination. I would say get into the business or executive side to advance. There was a lot of change, which caused for high volume work loads."
good,"CSST at Capital One has really taken a turn down a bad path.  Current leadership in the department have no clue what they are doing.  The environment used to be exciting and fun, but recently it has turned into more of a prison.  You can't laugh, or have fun.  A lot of heavy rules.  I wouldn't recommend working here until upper management has changed."
good,"Capital One is a great place to work day to day.  They respect highly the work life balance.  Family first.  "
good,"My time with capital one has been stressful for sure. The upside is the benefits are great (Medical, Dental, vision, 401K) but the stress of the job can be overwhelming. If you have a problem taking 80+ calls daily, this job isn’t for you."
good,"Productive and fun work place with team activities. Opportunity for growth within the company.Spacious break room with numerous food, snack and beverage selections."
good,"Every job is different, however my experience here has been pretty slow and unproductive so far. My personal team training/on-boarding experience has been slow to non-existent to the point where I am still not up to speed nearly 3 months in. Communication has been very poor. That being said, the benefits are amazing and almost everyone else I've spoken to loves working there and the team they are on."
good,"If you are looking for a laid back working atmosphere then capital one is the place to work.  the dress code is relaxed, the work is easy to learn.  The drawback is that the company does not pay a lot and advancement is difficult due to the massive layoffs"
good,"Senior Management makes the best effort to keep employees at all levels involved in their strategic decisions."
good,Great benefits but they care so much for penny savings that it ends up affecting us agents and customers by outsourcing our jobs and lower our pay because of this decision. Bad business decisions.
good,"This was an awesome job, the hours were wonderful and they also had great benefits. The only main set back for this job is that they closed the branch i was working at and they are not opening anymore from what i can see."
good,"Growing in Chicago, but still not a lot of room for advancement due to overall size.  Leadership in Chicago isn't as strong as other markets."
good,Company has great benefits and in some cases flexible hours.  Job security is in Richmond Virginia and Dallas.Like all places co-workers are good and some are difficult to work with.
good,"Capital One is a great place to work.  The CEO has a great vision, passion, and is able to communicate that vision all the way down.  The culture is not the same at individual sites."
good,"Great company to work for.  Job/Life balance is not very good, but the benefits, and competitive pay are great.  New department still a learning curve for management on Quality Assurance."
good,"The work culture is great and it seems like the deadlines and jobs were easy to manage, the work ethics are very good, and the mangers and the leads are pretty easy going."
good,"High Expectation performance wise you need to be willing to put your  whole heart into this job in order to succeed. Time management is huge, productivity on the job, not a lot of down time. You will always be 100% tuned into the job during productivity time."
good,"Its a great company still needs work on advancement.  they know how to have fun, but not alot of room for growth in that department and you cant move out until you've been there a year."
good,"I would count large amounts of cash, handle customers needs like printing statements out, account balances, customer credit card payments, cash advances, split deposits, cash withdrawals, balance cash vaults, fax signature cards to back office for new account holders. I loved my co-workers, they helped me grow with knowledge and allowed me to make mistakes so they can show me what I did wrong and how I could have done something different. I was top sales associate in my branch and was number 11 in the district on an annual rating but was not with the company for an entire year. I enjoyed my customers and their stories, I enjoyed making sales, and working with my employees who made this all a great working and learning experience. Management made a lot of changes and worked for new people who didn't have the same work ethic as I did, and I therefore leading to a conflict in personalities."
good,Haven't starting working with the company yet but I'm hearing lots of good things and lots of bad things as well. The recruiting and interviewing staff are really nice and professional making sure they set u up for success. I got the job offer but I've had a lot of people tell me the fire employees if they mess up on scripts or if they can't satisfy customers on their calls and they don't give much chances even if your a great employee. Please if someone could give me feedback concerning this that would be great! Thank you!
good,"Daily focus on sales, operations, customer service, and motivating associates to the next level."
good,"Good working environment"
good,Answering incoming calls from customer on their credit card account.
good,"My typical day was working with upset customers, deescalating and attempting to stop corporate complaints.  I learned many things with this job including further deescalation tools, processing refunds and working with change that happened nearly on a daily basis.  My co workers were wonderful, my team was like a big happy family.  The hardest part is not being able to fix a customers issues, the most enjoyable, when an upset customer gets off the phone happy and glad they talked to me."
good,"As a lead customer rep, I not only lead a line of 12 tellers, but also managed international funds and transactions for clients. I ensured that financial rules and regulations were continuously adhered to on daily basis. I also took management training quarterly to train tellers in performing financial transactions successfully and spot any fraudulent activities that is about to occur, thereby eradicating it totally. I also aided tellers in attracting new customers by educating customers on products and services that is offered. I attended meetings with senior upper management and board of directors to initiate ongoing development of the bank as a whole among its competitors in the Maryland and District of Columbia area."
good,"Capital One prides itself on doing the right thing when it comes to customers and employees. Though the is the foundation the company was made on, unfortunately not all managers live by the companies core values. Growing within Capital One can be difficult if you do not know the right person."
good,"A typical day at work opening the branch would be making sure it was a safe environment to enter and exit at all times, taking care of customers transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, transfers etc Maintaining appropriate cash limits and verifying proper cash amounts each night. Staff was always short of staff, co workers were team players, the hardest part of the job was referring people to upgrade their accounts due to the economy, its harder for people to want to open a new credit card or additional checking/savings account. I enjoy being able to assist anyone I can while having fun at work."
good,"The benefits at the company are great. The cafeteria is convenient and affordable. It's a great company to work for but not the Irving, TX call center.  Compared to both call centers in Plano, TX, this place is a dump and hires mostly ""ghetto people"". Some days you feel as if you walked into a club, not a work environment. The elevators are always breaking down, it takes 5/6 minutes to return and can make you late. They dont take this in consideration. Parking is horrible. The two managers I had were both new so it was horrible.  One of them was in my training class and he came to us for answers. He never did anything. There were always calls in the queue and they would have random fire drills twice a month. When we returned from the fire drill, there would honestly be 250 or more calls waiting and they would walk around making sure the calls were taken and asking if we would volunteer taking our breaks later. Reliability is a big issue. They don't adjust your breaks if you get stuck on a call. Like I said, great benefits but the Irving call center isn't worth the 12/hr. The Plano locations start you with 15/16.25 hr."
good,capital one is a good company and the people and managers you work with are generally great.  collections isn't for everybody
good,"this job is amazing. Great benefits, and good time off allowance. "
good,"Great company for working mothers and new college graduates. Nothing bad to say about the company, I am just ready for something different."
good,"Flexible work hours, can work from home, onsite cafe with healthy meals and reasonably priced."
good,-assisted business with their treasury management products
good,"As a Relationship Banker for Capital a typical day at work required having great customer service skills while interacting with many customers that came in with a variety of questions and issues. It also is a sales position so cross selling products that the bank offered was a must. We strived to offer the customers the best possible solution with the many products that were offered. Capital One offers alot of useful trainings that can be used outside of the bank and even help you with other career choices.The hardest part of the job was the stress around the sales goals, but I always enjoyed working with customers and helping them find solutions to many of their problems."
good,the people that you work with are great. customers are usually friendly
good,"I learned fantastic customer service skills and was at the top of the department every month. I got to teach/coach other associates on how to improve their quality scores by performing side by sides, meetings, and sharing best practices. I learned how to manage those employees as well. The hardest part of the job was taking calls from irate customers or taking escalated calls from those customers, but I usually was able to talk them down. The most enjoyable part of job was the people were friendly and the benefits were fantastic."
good,"A typical day at Capital One begins with me taking customers deposits, withdrawals, and bill payments. I also am required to greet the customers in the lobby area at some point during the day. With each customer transaction I am required to make small talk with the customer and though the interaction with the customer I am supposed to determine his/her banking needs and try to have the customer sit down with a banker to fulfill their banking needs. What I learned at Capital One was really good people skills. I was pretty shy before working there, but I was forced to break out of my shell. My co-workers were the best people I've ever met. The company culture was very relaxed so my co-workers and I would make jokes all day and have fun even while working. The managers at the branch were I worked were really knowledgeable and excellent at what they do. The hardest part of the job was the cross selling that I had to do on a daily basis to meet referral goals. The most enjoyable part was interacting with my co-workers and select favorite customers."
good,"Fast paced, strong teamwork and challenging goals"
good,"Disappointed with the way they handle things."
good,The job was easy. The environment was nice. But I could not handle the repetitive calls after they changed the work. I didn't feel like I was going anywhere in life while I was there.
good,Great place to truly help customers and build relationships until recent reorganization No job security at all. Benefits are top notch and management truly tries to live the mission.
good,Capital One Bank was acquired by Hibernia National Bank in 2008.  Hibernia Bank was one of the most enjoyable places to work.  The environment was of such that promoted was encouraged from the top.
good,Team was incredible and very supportive. Opportunities for learning and advancing were always encouraged. Customer service was very important. Schedule flexibility was understood
good,All the tellers hated being there and made anyone that enjoyed being there miserable and felt like they were doing the  most to be in managements favor.
good,Capital One is in transition right now and it really doesnt have a direction as to what they want to do with there retail associates. They are just making people take on more and more responsibilities without proper compensation. The management at my branch is amazing but I cant speak for others.
good,The culture at Capital One was exceptional. Upper management was always an ear away with any problems that arised with lower mangement. The most enjoyable time is when there are team building events.
good,"Capital one was a good clean place to work. They had a good work life balance and provided many extra benefits for employees. They would take you out for lunch, worked with you on career advancement, and recognized accomplishments."
good,"I really enjoy working at Capital One. It is always laid back, nice perks. Diverse culture was nice. The hardest part of the job is the work doesn't match the compensation."
good,"Capital One is a great place to work. They offer great benefit packages, and volunteer to help out the community. They put their customer's #1 at all times. Another great benefit working for Capital One is they will look at for their employees offering tons of benefits and training opportunities to grow in your career."
good,"Capital One is a great environment, you can grow here, easy to move around and expand in the company a lot of opportunity here. the managers are friendly and there to help."
good,I really enjoyed my work there. It was a relaxed environment for the most part. The culture was great to be a part of. That is until they laid off everyone.
good,My manager and coworkers always make my day. Everyone is very encouraging and helpful. My manager is constantly pushing our team for excellence and to be the best we can be. I love that I can come to work and help customers in difficult situations. I'm able to build a personal relationship with them and together create a strategy to overcome their circumstance.
good,"I processed all loan information given to me by the loan officer, as I had always worked on the closing end of mortgage this was a opportunity to learn a new aspect of the industry"
good,Typical day at work consist of customer transactions and daily duties. Management dictates how the work day should go. Hardest part of the job is getting referrals and the most enjoyable part is interacting with different people everyday.
good,Capital One management has the vision to lead the entire organization into the future via disruptive technologies and ideas.  Always looking foe the best and brightest talent.
good,"Capital One was probably one of the best companies I have worked for. We were always professional; however, we had fun as well. We went to baseball games, had picnics and even had a field day. Management was always helpful if we had a problem or question. We had a bonus system at work for services sold and monthly I would receive 900-1200 dollars in addition to my pay"
good,-The day starts out reviewing loans booked the prior day for accuracy. Following up on e-mails for loans in the pipe line with pending closing dates etc.
good,"I worked as a teller at a Texas Branch and Louisiana branch. Loved the staff I worked with in both locations,hours and benefits, it just seems now all capital one is starting to care about is numbers. They want you to do more for less money. I would still be there if it wasn't for the pressure on meeting the referrals goals and the mandatory coaching.It took forever to hire new staff so being short staffed at branches seems to be something that happens a lot. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and working with my co workers and management at my branch."
good,"a typical day at work is doing mostly customer transaction, we have a good team, very easy to get along with the co workers, management is good. There are days slower than others but it still a pleasent day because we all get along with one another. great 401k plan, and vacation, but the pay I wish was alot better. Teller are the ones I that deal with the customers the most so I feel our pay should be more that what it is"
good,A typical day at work for me is assisting customers with getting their auto loans current. I've learned that no matter the circumstances that caused the customer to be in this situation you can always be that light at the end of the tunnel. The hardest part of the job is not being able to solve every customers delinquency but the most enjoyable part of my job is hearing the thank you's and how much they appreciate the assistance given to get their account current.
good,The normal workday at Capital One was always very predictable however rewarding. You come in there is a gym you can work out in while getting mind ready for work. Breaks are sceheduled and you take your break when scheduled.
good,"I enjoyed the workplace environment. Training was very thorough. "
good,I recently lost my job after 17 years due to role being eliminated/Dual Managing branches and Branch closures. This is the second time in 3 years.  I was an Assistant Manager and that role with Capital One was also eliminated
good,Of all the jobs I have ever had.....This is the one I enjoyed and miss the most. I wish I would have never been laid off but I was one of thousands. Miss it a lot
good,"I was a contractor with this company and did not have a good experience whatsoever.  The manager I worked under was informed that the other employee was taking my work out of the computer and re-entering it as her own.  Nothing was done about it and the manager told me ""To deal with it or leave"".  I left after accomplishing my mission for transportation."
good,"Cap One 360 would hire just about anyone..the pay is great, great coworkers, great environment, benefits, all that.. but the customers lack way too much common sense to even bank there..and taking 70+ phone calls of that a day is just tiring...so it wasn't worth it to me. Wish I could've gotten a position there off the phones..I'd be willing to go back if that was the case but most start on the phones.."
good,"•	Worked towards developing a Member Compliance Portal that integrated the core Member Regulation applications. "
good,Cultures and values are very posittive. Great place to work.
good,"My typical day started with helping customers, selling products such credit cards and saving account. i also help co-workers with customer with opening banks accounts. as a teller we had quoted that we had to hit every month an which we had to sell credit cards and open bank accounts. i enjoy working with my co-workers."
good,There is a very distinctive lack of advancement available. They do offer great benefits and above and beyond pay scale. Job duties change daily can't make their mind up about the position you're supposed to be working in.
good,"If you are a nice person DO NOT WORK HERE. Customers will abuse you during calls. The company doesnt help too much with this aside from saying you can have a moment to walk away if needed. You begin to sound robotic and you personality is hard to maintain. Raises and promotions are based on metrics being met. Can be high stress due to not wanting to provide the wrong information to members. Training was 4 weeks. And at the end of the second week you are taking real calls. Its terrible. Once you move to the floor, hopefully you have a good team/manager. They celebrate a lot and often have events with food etc.. After training there is a small celebration for that and they set up the cubicle for you so you feel welcomed. Overall the company is very nice. I however, had an awful experience from almost beginning to end."
good,"For the short time i was at capitol one, I find it was a great work experience. However they do protect their own and will release anyone who tries to better the work area."
good,I was able to be employed by this company once in my life and it was the best company I have ever worked for. The culture of the people at the time wasn't cool but it could've gotten better.
good,Great place to work. But compensation for your work is not. Bonus structure in all of the departments could be better
good,Employment at Capital One was fun competitive creative and comfortable. The teams there were very energetic educational and financially driven. Management supervisors were not on the same page left call center agents and any other Personnel kind of confused and looking unorganized. However Cutthroat to the Core people were turning their backs on others and taking people's positions getting people fired. You just will want to become good friends with the right people Network with meticulous actions. Overall it was a great place to work flexible schedules overtime paid time off good pay for those that qualify raises every 6 months based on performance.
good,Capital One Bank encouraging associates to think independently and to present creative ideas to senior management .I gained a great experience while working there. Great benefits.
good,best thing is the benefits I was able to have my needed surgery without paying any out of pocket cost that was great but they say you have job security but you really do not
good,"No career growth opportunities outside of the main hub location in Richmond, VA. Departments are being eliminated at other locations and being shipped back to Richmond."
good,No salary no job security. Lot of work.work pressure is more than the salary. Even after streaching alot customer never satisfy woth performance. Lot of layoff
good,A day a Capital One was very enjoyable because the staff was very friendly. I learned a lot about FDIC compliance and how to communicate with business owners with high values.  
good,"good company to work for, very family friendly and it was a treat working their. Management need more training, learning how to handle tough situations need improvement"
good,My experience at capital one was interesting. Great people to work with but is not very rewarding for the task at hand. some days are overbearing but some days are laid back.
good,The company provided a great experience while they were competitive.  When they didn't get FHA approved it drove the company into the ground and left a lot of causalities.
good,"CEO seems to be doing the best he can to move the company from traditional banking in to technology, but there is a lot of turmoil in this ongoing shift.  Company feels like it still has not defined itself.  Lots of downsizing and 75% of employees had been there for only 2 years or less.  Senior leadership was very cut-throat and there was a lot of turnover at the top which limited ability for middle-managment to hired under prior leadership to move up.  Benefits remain great and seemed to keep a lot of people around despite a culture that is otherwise lacking."
good,Good Place to work and lots of benefits. The call center was fun but lacked the flexibility to have a life outside of work. the management is great and coworkers are very supportive.
good,"Good company with terrible ""people practices"".   Rewards cut-throat behavior.  Strong desire to innovate but don't fail or you will be gone - quickly.  Great work environment with some very smart young leaders."
good,"Good company, great benefits but no job security. Constantly sending jobs oversees and no opportunities to  getting promoted. Management was ok can definitely improve."
good,good company but advancing was almost impossible and benefits and vacation were very good. managers were very good and attentive. emplyees were generally happy.
good,"Capital One overall is a great organization; great pay, great values and great employees. However, aside from all that, the sales department for Capital One 360 in particular is awful. If you're a professional, looking for a career, this is not the place for you. If you want to party and have fun, while receiving poor training and then being reprimanded for it, then by all means, work here. "
good,"great company to work for, but not enough room for advancement"
good,"I had worked for this company for many years and had a lot of fun, learned a lot. I enjoyed the people I worked with and everyone treated each other like family. I cannot say I wasn't disappointed when I was laid off but understood the reason for the company making this business decision. It was a very large layoff, but the company made sure everyone had plenty of notice and provided services to assist with this change in their lives."
good,I enjoyed writing for capital one however the company makes it extremely stressful and the days run into nights. Getting cussed out all day wasn't the hard part . The company's standards and what they wanted from us is what makes it stressful.
good,The company offers a fun work environment for a call center.  Participation makes all the difference.  This business site unfortunately does not offer growth opportunities if you start at an entry level.
good,"The pay was great however my manger didn't want to help me advance. I only met with my manager 5 times throughout the year, and I didn't even have a year end review. I ended up getting promoted however my manager did an investigation through HR and I couldn't even advance. So I left"
good,As a contractor I was unable to participate in any workplace activities.  No room for advancement if you're a contractor unless you apply in the normal way.
good,"Great culture and teams elsewhere, but Chicago is a mess!  They are attempting to grow their footprint here, but have hired new leadership that is a large comtrast to the Capital One values and culture.  Bery high attrition since theor arrival."
good,It was a great place to work. Work environment could have been better but otherwise then that great. Loved what I did there and enjoyed all the people that I met.
good,Fast paced work environment with not much assistance or guidance from management.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that each ARM (Assistance Relationship Manager) had a designated territory that they were responsible for. This helped a great deal for the ARM's so that we could build a relationship with the dealerships and the customers.
good,this is very good for benefits and ok on bonuses they fed us lot i like that use to just come by give like root beer floats and candy some times and dinners for top people
good,All the managers were great. A lot of haters working there. They don't like to see you doing better than them. If you are watch out because they will be trying everything they can to get you fired especially if your a contractor. Stay to yourself don't get involved with a lot of people.
good,"Good opportunities for advancement however management has favorites and tend to allow them to do what they please, overall a good company. great benefits and wonderful environment when managers are not playing favorites."
good,"have amazing and helpful co-wokers, getting long hours, enjoyable place, i have learned at work, hardest part is dealing with customers"
good,Good overall data analytics and procedurally sound. Overall good place to work for job satisfaction. Unusual job culture where politics is emphasized at times.
good,"This is a great entry level place to begin your career. "
good,"A typical day at work involves researching and investigating specific details and breakdowns of consumer complaints, speaking with customers and different lines of businesses, drafting recommendations for business improvements, typing formal response letters to federal agencies and consumer complaints with a very small margin for error. The management staff is composed of one click that reminds you of mean girls and that is the worst part of the job itself. Other management varies by department and can be upbeat, fun, a pleasure to be around and learn from to the people you avoid because they will bring you down. Most co-workers are there to work and we all try our best to get the job done right and in the quickest most efficient way possible. The hardest part of the job is saying no and getting up to take breaks. We have to ensure to stay with in our SLAs. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help our customers and my peers."
good,This was one of the lowest paying jobs I've ever worked for. I was completing so many tasks so well they kept throwing on more responsibility and for the same low pay. Extremely nerve-racking never knowing when could actually be your last day. Between a penny difference and how many notices you have it made me have high blood pressure I was only 21.
good,capital one is bank that does not meet the social net of their employees. Employees are not rewarded for their work. They only care bottom line. There is no jobs security and the leadership style is on fear and intimidation.
good,"Mostly a good job if you can do collections. I personally could not, but I would still be there if I could. I paid next to nothing for health with this company, bonuses on how much you collected. Cool gig if you can collect."
good,"My role was not complicated, but tedious and repetious, Lots of applications to use to grant customers request, laughed a lot  . Great teamwork. Friendly co workers."
good,Branch work implicate lots of standing hours. You are expected to work every schedule day so calling sick was not well received. manager are nice but are under lots of pressure from upper management.
good,"If you have a good/great supervisor, you will enjoy working at Capital One.  If you don't, working at Capital One is stressful and makes people unhappy.  Perks are the ability to work from home 2 days per week and making your own schedule."
good,"Lots to do, not a clear work/life balance. Kept everyone very busy. Need to understand that work goes home with you. I learned I could push myself beyond what I thought I could accomplish"
good,The leaders that we have  back then were not really supportive to the team mates. All that matters to them is their incentives and the agents don't get that much incentive thinking that the agents are the front liners of the company.
good,overall cap one is a good company but management is terrible. nothing is the same across the board it all depends on who your manager is. Its very hard to get a weekend day off unless its the end of the year when most have ran through their pto.. ptoU is on a 12 month rolling calendar.. they say you get 40hrs of ptou but at 32hours you get a coaching
good,"if you can work 12-15 hour days and get nicely compensated, then this is the place for you.  Agile teams, collaborative, forward thinking.. but just exhausting. After a year of 6-7 day weeks and 12-14 hour days, I just burnt out."
good,in. Costa Rica call center work is one of the most sought after for low skilled persons and offers some opportunity for those who wish to advance into low level management i.e. team leader positions. the work can be very rewarding helping customers resolve problems and even advocating on their behalf with merchants
good,Great bank to work for if you dont like sales. They took that compensation away. Quarterly bonus is just on customer service now. Overall relaxed but show little interest of updating the system to be competitive.
good,Company seems in constant flux in both positive and negative ways. People interact widely across locations and departments and strong personal branding via websites.
good,"Capital one is a good company although management needs more training."
good,Good company with good culture.  The people seem to matter here.  Management is approachable and will hear you out.  On the negative side they don't pay as well as their competitors do.
good,Capital One has its pros and cons. The CEO is amazig but as you move up on the company your work/life balance begins to fade and at times hard work is not recognized. The culture and the benefits this company has to offer is amazing!
good,"Hard working job.There was not too much interaction with some of the management, especially people that you would report under. Management seemed as if some of the employees were not as important as others."
good,At the time of my employment the company was Northfork Bank. The rating I gave is based on my experience at Northfork Bank. I was a part-time employee. The pay was decent but there was no benefits for part-time employee.
good,My experience with capital one was a unique experience working in the fraud division I was able to see 1st hand how people commit credit card fraud. however the process in place to catch the bad guys impacts the normal customers on a huge scale I would say half of the time I was de-escalating a upset customer who was at Wal-Mart trying to make a 300 dollar purchase that we declined.
good,I enjoyed the team of people that I worked with.  I enjoyed this company because they would reward you for your hardwork.
good,"I was responsible for opening and closing accounts, processing loan apps, and various other tasks that needed to be done throughout the day."
good,work life balance was not very good but the option of remote work was very convenient. Management was good depending on where you were.
good,"Capital One is a progressive, mission driven place of employmnet. The mission is centered around excellence and being customer service oriented. Career advancment is available, as long as you have a clear understanding of your goals."
good,"Great people yo work with but the stress that you have to put up with is to much,"
good,The only thing is that i think they dont value their employees becuase they terminate people that was their for over 10yrs. They dont have enough coaching timing to asst you with getting better. out of a 10 month relationship with them I only had coaching about 3 times
good,This is a great company with great benefits but the management lacks professionalism. There is no room for growth now that everyone has the same position.
good,I had the misfortune of getting two managers in a row which were not supportive.  I felt I had no one to turn to for help. I wanted to transfer out of the group i was in to work as a recruiter. Manager blocked me from leaving.
good,"Overall not a bad place to work but there wasn't a lot of room to advance and they kept changing policy and not keeping you informed until you get a meeting or ""coaching"" session with someone who tells you you're doing a bad job when you're doing everything as you were trained. The sad news, I would have recommended still until I heard they let the permanent employees go and now are outsourcing.  Very sad."
good,The job is really stressful at times but the customers and the actual company is really good. Did not work directly through Capital One I worked through a 3rd Vendor but I loved the work just not the facility I worked in.
good,"I have No Comment on my relationship with capital one.  "
good,The company has lots of technology and provides excellent lap tops and software.  The culture is dicey and enjoyable if you find the right group.  The hardest part of the experience is communication and understanding the request process.  The people are very collaborative.
good,Great company with excellent benefits. Very stressful environment but it is what you make it. What I learned from working at Capital One Bank is to work smarter and not harder...teamwork always makes the dreamwork.
good,It was fun to get to meet new people everyday. The only thing that got annoying was the constant pressure the relationship banker and branch manager put on a employee to pitch bank products.
good,Something about the Boston Market specifically is completely off. Management encourages and participates in favoritism and workplace drama/hostility. The company is amazing but I do not recommend the Boston Market for these roles. It's definitely a temporary stepping stone.
good,"Very productive, mangement in some departments were very negative and rude. Good benefits, job security is not promised. They did set up fun events to appreciate their employees. Work life balance could be better."
good,Capital One used to be great place to work. Lately there's been change in management which reflects poor management so is employee satisfaction. But it is a very good place that encourages one to be update with the modern technologies.
good,"Great place to gain experience. Enjoy  team environment. Mission  is clear at the top of management, however gets muddled further down the chain. Benefits are excellent for parents."
good,It's a mix. Work/Life Balance was great but the flexibility also depends on the manager you report to. Culture was not the best. Too many cool kids club if you are not part of it no one really cares. You can say I was not cool.
good,"I was the engagament lead from wipro for Capital One customer dedicated to  retail LOB. I was also able to get a new business  where i was involved in the transition and hence typical day involves"
good,"-I typically made mostly out bound calls to customer based on the outcome  the fraud transaction cases. "
good,Company is okay to work with and has the standard corporate issues like any other company. I have learned a lot working with this company and I do enjoy the benefits and moral
good,You get to work with incredible talent. Great product and great mission. Salary increases have slowed significantly as the company exits cities with high cost of living. Layoffs happen far too often.
good,"A typical day at work often starts with a staff meeting to discuss projects in the pipeline and also go over changes to processes and procedures, which seem to happen weekly.  Over time I learned a great deal about risk management, although the company seemed to change it's appetite for risk based on criteria that was not always relevant.  Management (which also changed often) never seemed able to settle on an operating model or strategy, which made it very difficult to complete the job function for which I was hired.  Workplace culture deteriorated over time, which also appeared to be part of the management agenda.  Quantity became more important than quality."
good,Capital One has a great benefit package. Some departments are more mature than others. Agile practices are ok for some areas but the company has departments that interface with each other without understanding the big picture therefore causing redundancy and overlap amongst external and internal team members and managers. This is a good place to gain experience and learn new things.
good,"The work place is a great place to work, that is why i have worked here for going on 7 years. over the years a lot has changed regarding the culture of the company. it expresses changing banking for good and the associates work life balance but it has become more about the lack of regard for employee's and compensation. we are being used to furfill multipul roles without the compensation. They don't make you feel like a valued employee anymore"
good,The people there were fun to work with and the work was challenging me to become a more patient person.  The environment was fun to work in but there wasn't much room for growth and the management didn't listen to their employees very much
good,"All in all, a great place to work for college students. Quick fast paced ever changing environment. Hours vary, and can impact outside obligations. The benefits are are very competitive."
good,"everyday you serve the customers at the best of your knowledge by taking the time to resolve the problem, to make a connection and actively listen the main reason customer called. since the company that hired me is the 3rd party of capital one, management is the same then the previous calling center, hardest part of the job is actually trying to help the customer when both you and the customer know that nothing can be done due to company policies and procedures. But the best pasrt is the social side of it, when you get a minute or two, get the chance to connect and have a few discussions with your pairs, most awesome great people to work with when you need answer to any kind of issue, there is always someone there to give you a hand or help when needed."
good,Great place to work at but management has to go. Managers do not do anything. They promise you advancement in your career but they do not do anything about it just to keep you a bit longer. The turn over rate for employees is very high. Tellers barely last 1 year there.
good,"Not a bad place to work overall, fairly fast paced, great support when you are new. the harderst part of the job is dealing with difficult customers screamig in your ear."
good,"You meet a lot of great people working here. But Capital One has a very high turnaround rate. They bring in fresh college kids, work them to death, spit them out and then hire another set of fresh college kids. But at least you work with your peers and make some great connections while there."
good,"This job is pretty easy and laid back, staff is both friendly and welcoming and management is also very nice. Not too easy to speak to and they don't really have much to offer as far as advancement and growth in the company. In-addition this job doesn't come with benefits such as health, vision, dental, 411k, etc. On the other hand, this is a very good job for learners, in customer service and clerical skills. The most difficult part of this job may be trying to de-escalate customers who may be upset, but the most enjoyable part is the friendly peers/co-workers who are always pleasant, respectful, and willing to help out."
good,"Nice work environment, long hours work life balance a little difficult with no exact end time.  "
good,"busy , always busy."
good,Capital One is a great place to work. It has excellent advancement opportunities. The work life balance depends on the position you hold. The company does take pride in taking care of its employees.
good,"Household provided all employees the ability to help customers and listen to their needs, while offering products that can increase value for both the customer and company. While their was changing to keep up with the growing banking industry, the transition was handled well. "
good,Face paced and superior customer service.  Ability to multi task.  Driven to deepen customer relationships.  Team/family environment.
good,"My main objective here was providing high-end service and serve as the central point of contact to our most profitable customers.  Along with answer the phone in a courteous manner, I was able to accomplish offering customers a breadth of advice, personalized service, and an array of customized banking solutions to help customers with their sophisticated and complex credit card needs."
good,I've learned a part of HR I've never been involved solely in before with Tuition Reimbursement and the auditing process.
good,Capital One included typical Banking duties. Was going through a lot of growing pains when I was there. Loved my Co-Workers and District Manager by the way.
good,"Typical work day is learning process of banking, learned the steps and process of auto finance, management is a circle of friends, co-workers are helpful, job not hard at all."
good,Great place to work.  Working for Capital One was very intresting and always something new going on every day.  supervisors and management too controlling
good,Capital One has a flexible work environment which makes it a really great place to work.
good,"I would personally say this job started as a fun worthwhile place to work, but after we had random and constant management changes, it cause for the employees to be a little unfocused and unmotivated to do the tasks  hand"
good,"Repetitive tedious work, but the people are lovely. "
good,Great company.  Minimal opportunities for advancement outside of the department.
good,COAF is a great stepping stone to bigger things. The people that work there are great and always willing to help you out. Benefits are awesome and pay is very fair.
good,making deposits cash withdrawals balance cash draw refer customers to personal bankers
good,It's a typical business. I learned how to talk to people on the phone very well
good,"Great place to work, but as USUAL, political agendas for upper mangagement prevails."
good,"Wouldn't recommend here. Staff turnover is high, like working with children. Pay isn't good. Systems are awful."
good,Work friendly environment. It’s not about what you know but who you know at Capital One. The benefits are great! Important to document everything to cover yourself.
good,Fantastic company. Remote locations farther away from Richmond aren't as amazing. Overall job is easily accomplished with minimal assistance. Good autonomy to lead using your style. Fun up-beat work environment. Advancement can be difficult as call centers are bottle-necked for promotable positions.
good,"If you want to be challenged this is the place to work.  They promote work life balance, but that really isnt the case.  You will learn a TON in a short period of time."
good,"Overall, it was a good place to work.  There was always more work than time but what company wouldn't want that problem. There were some training sessions on new items that were changing."
good,"Hard to move up once in a position, you have to wait 9+ months to post out of your starting position. This is not usually stated within the interview process but after you have completed training."
good,"Company is great to work for on the credit card side the banking side is poorly managed and hires inexperienced people to micro manage the employees, They treat you like you are a child with so many do's and don'ts and on the bank side they are extremely unwilling to listen to your ideas and lack of interest in your career development. They are a company designed for young people and entry level workers. Unless you are an advocate for yourself it is extremely hard to get promoted. Do not work for call center if you have any ambitions in life.They stress how important development is but management does the least to assist you  and does not try to maintain good employees with education and experience in the call center they rather have newly hired employees who just entered the workforce.It is some kind of discriminatory practices going on here but you cannot prove it."
good,I was expecting to be able to move from contract to permanent when things drastically changed and contractors were cut hence my need to be back on the job market Thanks
good,I felt like Capital One is an amazing company to work for. But with every company they have they’re good points to their company but also not so good points. I feel like working for the company you’re constantly learning about what the company is trying to evolve into. But as a employee there’s isn’t room for error. No one is perfect and people do make mistakes but they don’t give you enough tools in helping you correcting your errors.
good,Capital one has a very competitive benefit package.  it focuses on investing in their employees and services.  The culture is fun and open to team cooperation.
good,"The work day is fairly normal and everyone is friendly to an extent. As long as you get the work done everything should go smoothly. You""ll get some bad eggs here and there but nothing too stressful that you""ll end pulling your hair"
good,incentives were once good but taken away year by year.   base pay not adjusted fairly.   very little room to grow and learn new skills that will elevate you to the next level
good,"Great place to work a typical day is handling our customers complaints and issues with their accounts, opening new accounts, learing interesting facts about our customers and their family.  I've learned so much about the banking industry, loans, cd's trust, POA beneficials how the courts operate with legal matters that concern our customers as far as banking is involved. the workplace culture at Capital One is very relaxed, we can were jean every day if we chose to we have a cafe style environment.  the hardest part is not being able to move up past the banker or teller manager level due to CapitalOne having dual managers at several branches where associates that would like to move into management positions don't have the opportunity. The most enjoyable is the relaxed atsmophere the the work/home life balance.  We are encouraged to take vacations and time off to spend time with family."
good,"Typcial day:"
good,"This is a very political organization. Mind your business, keep your head down, and kill yourself to do better than everyone else and you'll do fine. "
good,Capital one the company was amazing to work for. I was promoted every year. Used capital one university for skills upkeep and was working on my Business Pricess Management while I was there.
good,"at the time, I worked there, my mgr. didn't have the knowledge to carry the team, she was clueless....and, showed too much favoritism....team suffered b.c of her."
good,"benefits were great, company always growing, a lot of turn over management was not good all the good managers were let go, not fun sitting at a desk all day"
good,"The Company stresses improvement in every aspect of the work performed, and the services provided to customers. However, their methodology for communicating and tracking these initiatives is self-conflicting, and ultimately self-defeating, depending on how Management chooses to view it. The stated values in their Blueprint program are contradictory to each other and to their classic dictionary definitions. Studying the Blueprint, and attempting to follow its stated ""pillar"" principles, is a futile gesture, as they lack true meaning. Because of the vagueness of the written philosophy of Blueprint, Management can use its content to show both favoritism and prejudice toward their employees without overtly violating its ""pillars"". Essentially, if Management likes you, you can do no wrong; and if they don't like you, you can do nothing right. The team can be blamed for one person's poor performance, and one person can take credit for the success of the entire team, all at the discretion of Management in accordance with Blueprint."
good,"Earn as much as possible, give input, be knowledgeable regarding computer technology. Try to find better ways to improve the processes. Manager played unfairly, made it impossible for me to apply for a job because she wanted a specific person on her team and later changed my rating so I could apply. Alot of favortism being played. Just be visual and vocal and  friendly."
good,Fun place to work with good benefits.Free coffee great coworkers. Working with the latest technology is good. The downside is unpredictability in workload and teams being worked over capacity.
good,Currently very unstable as strategies change. Major impact on many families as branches and departments close. Providing affected associates opportunities to relocate.
good,Company is very progressive in the way they see banking going in the future. Their branch experience is suffering from this by sending customers away from the branch to help themselves either online or over the phone
good,"Benefits and pay are top notch, but there is no job security.  The work environment is very good with lots of smart people to learn from.  Their biggest weakness is their performance review system.  Instead of measuring you against a set of competencies, you are measured against your peers.  This creates a culture of competition and reduces the likelihood that your peers are going to help you out."
good,"Good place to work, fast placed astrosphere, co workers are really friendly and willing to assist team workers in a positive way. They feed you to death don't be on a diet here. lol"
good,"I was hired into a leadership role that I was not fully trained for; but, I was still held responsible for the duties.  I found that it was not about what I knew, but who I knew and at that juncture, I didn't know anyone."
good,"In spite of my unfortunate layoff, I would recommend this company, especially on the credit card side, the risk management side, the HR line of business."
good,"Great company - poor management. "
good,I was contracted so there was no job security some upper management was great but mostly all the floor managers lack common sense they give these people the title but the majority of them are clueless there is changes constantly what they need to do is put all the floor managers back in training so they are better equipped to help the agents. My team manager started with my class and unfortunately I had to be on this team she didn't know zip about anything and always involved other manager and trainers to assist with her decision making there were temps there that been there for 6 month to a 1 year waiting to go perm. I loved my roll at capital one and the trainers every thing else I would give them a negative rating.
good,Nice place to work but many changes. There are many benefits to working at Capital One. There is great culture and team building. I would definitely recommend Capital One.
good,"It is a good company to work for with a lot of great benefits, however, not all the managers are great. Some of them lack any people management experience and are playing favorites. If you are working under a good manager, it can be a very relaxed job for the employee."
good,"I worked at Capital One when they first acquired a mortgage portfolio. The management team initially came from Auto Finance, so there wasn't a HUGE mortgage knowledge at the executive level in the Dallas Office.  Training was slow, but once implemented, moral sky rocketed."
good,Great place to work! My only complaint is watch your manager. They can make our brake you. I have heard of managers giving false information on employees to other mangers with negitive intentions. Be careful what you say and to whom. They don't like people who question authority.
good,"No Processes, management unwilling to embrace change. Old school thinking, No possible advancement. It's good for someone starting their career. However, hard to advance in mid-management to executive level."
good,"The role started off exciting and fun. My 6 week training was wonderful and my trainer was awesome. However about 6 months into the job they decided to ""colocate"" my department which meant that they broke up the disputes department from sitting together and placed people from unrelated departments in the disputes area to make ""space"" and to help streamline certain processes for customers. However the colocation was a HUGE FAIL and ended up destroying the morale of employees and impacting our work environment."
good,Capital one was invested in diversity of staff and valued each employee. Having gone through health issues Capital one provided support and encouragement as part of their employee wellness program.
good,"My time at Capital One has been overall satisfactory. I have been given many opportunities to work on interesting and meaningful projects. However, recent years have stressed the average associate's morale due to sudden downsizing across the board. This is part of the normal Capital One culture (boom and bust years for costs) and is difficult to understand the rationale."
good,"I worked with a lot of wonderful people at Capital One, and overall it was a fun environment to be in. The management in most departments (in my experience) was very poor and run by people who shouldn't be leaders."
good,Capital one company is great the pay and benefits are great but the management sucks. Enjoyed the training they really make sure you are trained before going into the job.
good,"This job has taught me more than any other position. I do enjoy the company but our coaches do not know they job very well. We are micromanaged and I never felt my talents, drive, or effort was recognized. We have a lot of team morale which I feel is what kept me here so long. I have helped others after they were promoted before me and knew less than me at my position which really brings me down and is a huge reason on why I feel the need to look for new opportunities."
good,The Company is very proactive in providing training and additional resources to  its employees for personal and professional growth. Also for the departments that offer work-from-home schedules they are very flexible and convenient.
good,i work close with the supervisors an they was always around if you need their assit. you was never alone your whole shift. once you login your all set
good,"Great work environment"
good,"Phone agent turned QA."
good,"A typical work day consist of 15 minute daily meetings, pull reports, quality checks, remediation, and meetings with Sr. Management."
good,"works stressful and draining its hard to balance life and work with the type of work in collections, hard to set your own emotions aside from hearing all the stories"
good,"I worked at Capital One for almost 14 years before being laid off in December 2014. It has been very hard for me and some of my former co- workers to find work associated with back office banking here in Houston. In today's workforce it is not easy getting a full time job. Also if you don't have the correct contacts, it can be hard to get a good job and I don't have a degree or know a second language preferably Spanish. My job at Capital One was good and I have no other complaints. My job was not hard at all. I have nothing bad to say about my co-workers. I do think training needs to be implemented for people who have experience and not a degree. Its not like you won't be trained to learn a new job anyway. I'm not taking away anything from anyone with a degree, but I don't think it is fair to overlook someone who can do a good job because they don't have a piece of paper. Just my opinion."
good,"The company itself is great. From twice yearly events for employees at each site, to once yearly meetings facilitated in person by the CEO. More training needs to be provided to managers on things like favoritism and honesty. Contractors are excluded from any perk an associate receives, such as holiday parties, team luncheons etc."
good,"My job/life work balance was not in sync during my tenure at Capital One.  I worked 60 hours per week at the end of my employment."
good,"Overall company culture is outstanding. However, there are some rotten apples that may slip through the cracks and not fall in line with the company's mission and goals."
good,"Good place to work. Diversified environment"
good,Happy to have been with this organization for 15 years. Great benefits and compensation. Great work life balance. Not much of an opportuity for advancment. Complete diversified workplace.
good,A call center environment is the same any place. If you want a start then this is a place for you. Do your time and go home. Management have no clue of what they are doing. It is best to teach yourself.
good,"Good Job for College students and or for a part-time job."
good,An typical day at work log on the computer an get set up for the first call of the day. The hardest part of the day was when an customer call in an could not use their card for someone else had use it and we had to close it.  The best part of the day is when an customer call in to thanks you for doing your job.  For co-worker meet some real nice people.
good,During my short time there 2 years I had had 3 different managers. Never given any direction as to job description and expectations. There were no projects officially given it ended up with me being told to just do what I did at previous employer. This direction was from the first 2 managers. Then the third manager was put in charge of our group and we had almost completed the conversion from HSBC. He within 6 months eliminated my and others positions.
good,"Capital One once was a great place to work. However, the morale and the culture of this place has changed since the Collections dept has closed. I was place in another dept where I feel the processes need to be improved and there are resources or help available if needed. The management lacks the ability to assist the associate and they strictly rely on a computer software to answer any questions that you may have which create problems within the company. Associates are not treated fair. Associates are told to adhere to dress code and rules within the dept however you will find that Management sticks together and they also break the rules together."
good,wonderful company select departments are not wonderful. The compensation is lack luster but the benefits are great and pto is even better. Plenty of ways to advance depending on the department your in and the manager you have
good,Call center environment. I learned how to handle all types of customers.
good,Lots of smiling faces and fun co workers.& wonderful management team. Just didnt feel there was much room for advancement and benefits weren't very great.
good,"Enjoyable job and peers; a great group of people with whom to work. Everyone was willing to help everyone else out, communication was solid. Issues were usually easily and quickly resolved."
good,Capital One (Formerly Hibernia Bank) was a good place to get me feet wet after college. It proved to be a challenging job that taught me how to cold call and establish business within the community that I worked. I learned a lot about myself and how to develop lasting relationships with customers. I also learned how to be part of a successful team. 
good,Many aspects of the job I liked but I was simply tired of all day phone work.
good,My goal on a daily basis was too complete as many cases as possible. My computer organization skills avanced. Getting slowed down by a deposit reconstruction was a hard day. Production could not be as effortless and efficient due to the case length. Our work environment was relaxed and enjoyable.
good,Having 15 years of IT with around 10 yrs in US . Worked with many clients and enjoyed working with the different kinds of people and co workers.
good,A typical day in capital one is like a day in a department store. We offer our customers 10 items at once hoping they will get something. I've learned that it is very important to ensure that our customers are satisfied 100% or else. The hardest part of the job is getting referrals and meeting your goals. The enjoyable part is meet new customers and old customers and ensure they are 100% satisfied.
good,"I worked from sun up to sun down. I worked a ten hour shift, and i also worked every weekend. MKy work day was very slow, and it wasnt hard work, it was just a boring job."
good,"Fast-paced environment and many hats to wear within my role has challenged me and allowed me to grow in many areas. Looking to move back to my home area (Frisco, TX) and support business objectives from the back-office side of the house"
good,This role was a great way to get my foot in the door at a large company. It was a customer service role that was not my ideal role however it allowed me to learn about investments.  The hours were not desirable (mid-day start and late evening finish) and there was little room to improve processes.
good,"Capital One leads the way with its focus on tomorrow. Innovations in tech, re-thinking how banking is done and its customer satisfaction is all inspiring. They truly have a great (but small) range of products at a consumer level. Their reputation is becoming better and better, even improving during my time (slightly over a year) at the company. You are selling yourself short if you stay in retail banking for more than 2 years."
good,"Management was really engaged with team members and pushed for excellent customer service. "
good,Good company to work for and it would be a good place to work especially for AWS developers as Devops is highlighted and much needed experience for those looking for Devops jobs
good,I enjoyed my time at Capital One and I would love to work for this company once again. The atmosphere and the people are incredible and I know that growth and development will take place.
good,"calls are back to back"
good,"Productive Fun workspace, learning environment. Provide equal opportunity to work and grow as a team. Good overall experience and growth of individual career."
good,"Working as a commission based salesperson, it was easy o make your own money as everything you sold in this workplace went straight to you, although having no base salary could be an issue if sales went dry"
good,"paid on time HR line worked not stable constantly changing positions "
good,"Great benefits, great people to work with, with some flaws. Management needs improvement mostly. Was excited. Glad to have a job. Great benefits. Good opportunity"
good,Connection first is very important when it comes to speaking with a customer even though we are a debt collector we still should understand each situation
good,"It is fun to work Capital One as UAT Automation Test Developer.  "
good,Progressive company. I have had several contracts for various roles at Capital One. Flexible work schedules is a nice perk. much appreciated. It is difficult to get a meeting space as all the buildings are quite crowded.
good,"I worked with some of the best people in the company, in my opinion. It is truly a family. Working at capital one has allowed for me to discover my passion for helping people."
good,"Overall, my experience at Capital One is pretty amazing. Your team will have fun outings quarterly that they pay you to attend. There is a huge party at the end of the year that is a formal black tie affair. The company likes to feed you through catering almost every holiday and sometimes just because. "
good,"Productive and fun work place to work. "
good,"I'd go into work and set everything up for all kinds of calls, and there wasn't very much wait time on the phones. Many times I would be saying the same thing to multiple people on the phones which was ok."
good,"Okay to work in this company, no standard process. anything can change anytime. Very dynamic work culture and flexible. Moving fast pace towards cloud"
good,"It was a good experience, I think working on the phones gave me knowledge that carried on into other jobs with etiquette and treating those who work at call centers better."
good,"I was a contractor with a 1-year contract. the environment was nice, the people were focused and nice. The company provided a lot of perks such as on-site medical office, free coffee/tea, etc."
good,"I'm glad to have been a oart of a very fast paced company and I'm thankful for all the things that I learnt during my stay. The job is stressful not because of how it was managed but it just the nature of the job. What broke me is just the shifting schedules, I just cone to the point that my body can't cope up with it."
good,"Great benefits. Lots of travel opportunity. Great for some (not for everyone)— especially for people avoiding their families or trying to have an affair."
good,"Capital One  is a great company to work for "
good,"Difficulties moving ahead. It's all about who you know. Also, once jobs are posted internally they already know who they want for it. Last, they should post jobs internally first prior to posting externally to give current employees a better chance to move ahead."
good,Its a great company to work. The technologies are latest and in demand in the market. The work is very productive and there is a home and work life balance.
good,"When at the call center be prepared for constant change...shift, management, and policies. Your entire career is based on your performance, both as a team and individual."
good,Was a great place to work but was let go because my daughter caught the flu and then I caught it and was not able to work. My Co-workers were wonderful but management could have used some improvement with listening skills.
good,"Capital One is a great company. Training was mediocre, the customers are very needy, the system we used to find information for customers was poorly developed - so lack of easy to access resources makes the job stressful. Very fast paced most days, sometimes you barely get a chance to breathe or get a sip of water between calls. To be on the phone all day, breaks should be longer. It can be stressful. The company culture is very cool. It’s a fun job, the worst part is the customers can be difficult. Capital One itself, is a great company to work for."
good,Even though the company is great to its employees and fair to their customers. The role I was a part of was not a good fit for me and my skills. Being more focused on customer satisfaction and quality rather than collections.
good,"When I target a particular company, I determine if I am a good fit professionally, and I also try to determine if I am good fit personality wise. I believe Capital One at the time was a right fit for me professionally. Maintained 24*7 Availability by implementing standard processes and troubleshooting live issues within defined tight SLA times. Monitored and also optimized database performance, troubleshooting performance issues using OEM, AWR, ADDM ASH and the Explain Plan. Performed SQL Tuning and provided consultation, such as, creating Materialized views, adding indexes, dropping unnecessary indexes, and using hints wherever possible."
good,"Great place to work, doesn't pay that well starting off, but plenty of room for advancement. Fun, paid company outings to local restaurants and other places."
good,"-Benefits are great "
good,"Performed account maintenance, financial advice, and payment arrangements to create simple solutions for delinquent customers’ accounts provided customers with technical support, billing inquires, special account activations, and future payment planning."
good,I worked there for 7 years. I  was promoted several times. The management there were great. Everyone was there to help each other. Pay was really good.
good,"Hostile work environment and very unprofessioanal, management was clueless on how to resolve certain issues, they tended to take frustration out on their employees,"
good,Good company to work for.  Great benefits and vacation policy.  The facility is taken care of and clean which provides a good working environment. ...
good,"Love the associate centric and employee centric culture at Capital One. Not only do we have an awesome internal culture, there are lots of growth opportunities and this organization is also deeply involved in the community."
good,Need more Compensation for the work that we do is very demanding. Management was understanding to personal life situations which was nice but the bonus system wasn’t structured well.
good,promotes continued learning and recognizes skill and job fit.Supports certification of technical skills and a flexible work/life balance environment.    Promotes an inclusive and diverse culture
good,"Converted Capital One and HSBC Bureau attributes SAS program with HSBC filter methodology and audited modeling bureau production data with SAS attributes aggregation "
good,"CapitalOne Sr. Automation Engineer great workplace, good people, collaborative environment, strong technologies and high expectations, strong tenured team."
good,"Nice place to work and good working culture."
good,capital one was great while i was there. tons of benefits and tons of opportunities. great to learn about banking and great people. would recommend people to go and check it out for a career.
good,A good company to work for.  Seems to be a bank that has alot of employees from other banks. I counted 6 differrent banks where I knew people from.  When I was there the Cafe idea was floated around.  4 years later its finally happening.  Wish them well.
good,"- work was a good environment with a good crop of co-workers"
good,We worked in sprints and the sprint is properly planned ahead so we would meet the deadlines as planned and the environment is always relaxed. It is a good experience working here.
good,A work place with a great deal of diversity and culture that offers a great friendly atmosphere and alot of development in your job role and in life in general.
good,"Great company with excellent technologies, it had very good work culture. It also had good flexiblity. They used Amazon webservice heavily and due to that I was able to learn AWS"
good,Many opportunities to learn new things.  Challenging work with bright people. Mission and Vision from the co-founder that much of the organization can relate to.
good,Capital One provided a GREAT PLACE FOR LEARNING new skills and meeting people of various backgrounds and career levels. They also provided great resources for learning new skills.
good,"Pros"
good,not one negative thing to say about this company. I enjoy working her and have definitely increased my skill set and productivity. the collaboration is free-flowing.
good,"I enjoyed working at Capital One"
good,"Capitalone is a great place to work, however, currently there are no advancements opportunities for me and my career.  I would like to move into a management position and unfortunately, Capitalone doesn't have those positions available and with the upcoming plans they may not be available in the foreseeable future."
good,"Good culture; nice people to work with; team dynamics can be a little difference across geographic regions; unlike traditional banks, Capital One focuses on technology."
good,"Pros"
good,"good work environment and professional.Brilliant colleagues, excellent engineering standards, a clear career progression, ample mentorship, challenging and interesting projects, exposure to the bleeding edge of technologies, excellent work-life balance, top-notch code standards, great benefits, delicious food, beautiful work environment."
good,A very involved and leading management team with great team members and team work. Regular group meeting highlighting the daily targets and reporting.
good,"productive and fun place to work, positive work enviornment, great training classes. positive co workers great scheduling for employees, just and great overall place to work"
good,"I enjoyed my five years with Capital One.  A typical day for me started at 6:00 AM at the on site gym which helped me start a productive day and providing our customers with great customer service.  Capital One is a diverse company and lives it's mission and value they set.  The Campus is very beautiful and peaceful place to take walks,breaks, eat lunch or just to collect your thoughts.  Each building have cafes that offers different lunch selections at affordable cost."
good,Capital One is a Great Company to work For!!  I would encourage anyone to work with the company.  They have great work and life balance for their associates.
good,"There are several opportunities to take advantage of for career advancement, such as classes/seminars, tuition reimbursement, etc. They offer extensive training for the position you're hired for as well."
good,"This was a great place of synergy. I truly enjoyed the camaraderie I picked up, there. I don't know if I'd go back, but I sure would recommend it to others."
good,"Its very difficult to get projects completed on time due to the red tape that everyone has to go through to get permission on anything. The employee evaluation process is horrible. Each Capital One department  has to rate at least 12% of their staff in a ""failed to meet standards"" bucket during annual evaluations. This means if your teams consists of 10 people and you all did exceptional work, one of you has to be rated within the 12% required."
good,Capital One has great benefits and is great place to work as long as you do what you have to do and stay away from the workplace drama . Management is not approachable only when visitor come around
good,CEO and management has an intelligent outlook at the banking environment. The idea of banking Café's is going to revolutionize the way that many Americans service their banking needs
good,Capital One only hires incredibly smart people.  They've done a great job transforming themselves into a digital company and continue to run compelling advertising.
good,Loved the 10 hour days and the systems which worked well for dealing with customer problems. the company had on site cafeteria and very good benefits.
good,"Highly Analytical place. You get to learn a lot. Most people have grown within the company and so have a limited world view and only appreciate people who think like them. Top management will pick high potential winners and take them through to the top. If you don’t end up in that group, no chance of getting ahead despite your performance"
good,"Capital One is a great place for young people to get their start in Digital, and for families looking for solid benefits. Culturally sound and ""inclusive"" they certainly have great values. Mid-career professionals lack challenges and opportunity."
good,Didn’t see layoff coming. Great company and benefits. Management can be cliqueish. Atmosphere is pretty much well rounded. Hard to take days off. Overall I would work for capital one in the future.
good,"HSBC sold their credit portfolio's to Capital One.  In the agreement, the subject matter experts were to be delivered to Capital One.  I was the Subject Matter Expert that was transferred to Capital One.  Upon legal day 1, we were offered to relocate to Delaware or take a package to leave."
good,"j'y ai travaillé deux ans et je me sens bien, toujours à l'écoute et prêt a accommodé tout le monde"
good,"Excellent benefits - better than any other company in the area. Work/Life balance, ability to learn and grow skills, great management if you land yourself in good team or organization."
good,"Audits were frequent, business attire always, promotions rare with heavy nepotism. Human resources needs to work on assessing their managers before hiring them from outside of the company."
good,"Enjoyed the work that was requested of me. Call center environment, floor supervisor were helpful, a lot of favoritism in the office, but the company itself is great to work for"
good,"I was only a temporary employee during my time with Capital One."
good,A typical day at work includes meeting with potential clients (internal and external). Drumming up support for new company-wide initiatives was non-stop.
good,Capital One does have a great culture but the dept I was in at the time was shipping their work overseas and there wos no room for advancement where I was. The manager I left there was not knowledgeable and he was often misguided
good,"worked at a fast paced call center, very performance driven. Leadership had great events planned for employees. The department was closed in the city I worked in."
good,Come in to work enjoyed helping customers and my teammates good environment due to capital one has team outing ever 3 months. At least giving you some since of they do care.
good,"Don't take a weeks vacation; you will come back and be a month behind.  Exciting, fast paced, very youth centric culture.  Great campus, great perks, like pastry shop, bikes, walking desks.. but, rather cliquish.  If not part of the in crowd, hard to get your ideas heard."
good,Rapid workload . It was a strain attempting to use the accumulated PTO. Coworkers make it fun to come to work. Holidays were not compensated. Not many incentives were available.
good,"Great company to work for...work to be done from a diversity and inclusion perspective (especially in the top ranks), but the spirit and energy of the company and culture is truly fabulous. Much more good than bad."
good,"Nice place to work with motivating team members. Most opportunities for advancement are based on your performance but with such a wide variety of  markets, its really up to you how far you can advance within the corporation. Good luck!"
good,"Claims intake was a relaxed environment. Some days were really fast paced with back to back calls. Others were slower/ steady with a few minutes between calls."
good,"Great folks to work with, and great insurance. Pay was lower than I thought it should have been, and they went through a consolidation of sites and the site I was in Irving was closed and many people laid off."
good,"enjoyed my time at capital one as a brand manager.  great culture, smart co-workers but lacks strategic direction.  mainly based on efforts to become the best technology based bank."
good,I was dealing with customers and their queries and complaints. It was enjoyable trying to help them as much as possible. Caring workplace with friendly people.
good,"Capital One was a fun environment to work in. The work itself can be very stressful, and some of the management there is unfair. They have great benefits, 401K, and if you work hard and it's something you enjoy doing, it's pretty easy to advance in the company."
good,"Great 401k. good work environment, Fast paced, with several new initiatives in progress. However, have heard of some site closures recently that leads me to believe some of these may be a result of frequent strategy changes."
good,Roles within the company will allow you to challenge yourself daily as well building the skills to provide a quality service.  Seeing the results of your hard work.
good,I began my banking experience with Capital one bank during their merge with NorthFork i enjoyed my learning experiences here and i gained a knowledge of what was expected of me from a banking field
good,great place to work laid back but proficient. wanted to go to work everyday. great management. Great pay and benefits. would work there again if I could
good,"Capital One is a good place to work.  It got good workplace culture.  Company sponsor training through tech college."
good,This company was a diverse progressive company to work for with a twist of challenges and growth. Good work environment giving you a chance to do a variety of duties.
good,"Overall a decent place to work. However this is a top heavy company. Unfortunately their investment division is going to close soon. Again, this is a good place to work with all things being considered."
good,"Typical day consists of 60% calendaring for 4+ leadership staff, 20% meetings, 20% working with admin community to problem solve and event planning. I learned that being adaptable, considerate of others, innovative, and open to all ideas can create the best place to work. The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships built in your working environment to better the customer experience.The most enjoyable part of my role is planning events (all sizes) and celebrating success as a company and our employees."
good,"a typical day at capital one was dealing with nice and some difficult customers,management needs to be trained better, the culture is great. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting wonderful people."
good,"On the whole, a great place to work. The company hires some of the smartest people I've ever met. Some teams struggle with doing too much - and management isn't always good at pushing back on requests that are unnecessary."
good,"Great company overall, however the culture among co-workers was good management different story. Most enjoyed the work environment hours, location , culture. The company does fairly compensate for your performance"
good,"Very supportive environment to work in, however shifts were based on length of time working there versus actual performance and pay was low for the job given."
good,"I loved this job and would still be there if I could. I reviewed the applications, contracts, and all the legal documentation needed to get an auto loan. You have to be very fast, multitasking like no other, and able to make quick decisions. I myself am too much of a perfectionist I couldn’t stand for there to be any kind of mistake in my deals and took a bit too long reviewing them instead of not worrying about it and moving to the next. You had to complete at least 150 tasks a day, proving employment, income, title, reviewing the contract itself, making sure everything was in there and was correct, and I was getting around 120. Now my QA score was always 100% meaning I made no mistakes but after scoring that for almost 2 months and they grade you every week, I was let go. If I could have another chance I’d stop being so indecisive and just move as fast as no one thought I could. I would recommend this job to others if you’re up for it. It’s not for everyone but if you are one of them, you’ll love it.  They also give chances to advance very often and quickly and have bikes to ride around on campus during breaks or your lunch. How cool is that? Also depending on you metrics score, you received monthly bonuses and all you had to do was pass and you’d get at least $250 all the way up to $700"
good,"worked a lot to promote the brand and drive new business.  Mortgage division was closed down.  no longer a player in the marketplace.  While they were in the mortgage business, they were very competitive but had a limited product menu"
good,"Great growth opportunities at Capital One. With the right manager and team, you will learn a lot. There are several resources they provide for you to help yourself also."
good,Started working at Capital One as a teenager and loved it. Great start up job with valuable training. You will meet great people and have a chance for growth.
good,My typical work day consisted of me trying to have three meetings a day. My Colleagues were great. Everybody was a team player.  The most enjoyable part of the job was my colleagues. The team I supported was like a family
good,Good company with great compensation. This bank lacks performance since they want to be different. very customer focused. Employees are evaluated based on sales based.
good,"Great place to work. Lots of work perks. Open office plan takes getting used to. Expectations are high and as with anywhere, managers will have favorites. Be a favorite."
good,"Productive, systems always had glitches. Had about 25 systems to work out of on a day to day basis. Highly competitive.If not on board for changes which happen often then that is frowned upon. Digital adoption sales are not able to attain due to system glitches."
good,Capital has many benefits but the pay is not competitive compaared to other companies in the same industry. I found that they cater to a younger fresh out of college people to low ball them on salary.
good,"ping pong tables, game systems in break rooms, great work environment, typical call center, no real advancement, hours are no good. they say schedule can change, but it really doesn't."
good,great IF start out perm if starting out temp it will always take longer than they say to go perm and make the money you need temps do not make as much money and have no benefits but perms have great benefits
good,"Management is horrible, there was favoritism. Must be a brown nose. I wanted it to be a company i cold retire with. Not a fan of management. Wish they would have a better way of training."
good,"Great company, strong vision, poor growth process, under-compensated, lack of cohesiveness across orgs, free snacks and drinks, digitally savvy, agile"
good,"Loved my job and the responsibilities that went with it. Customer and employee contacts were great."
good,"Non Micromanaged environment, but  new management (inherited)were not aware of the job functions of the team.  Focused on numbers in a Quality environment.  Lack of support and visibility."
good,"Loose, not very corporate, culture.  Not like typical bank.  Too many drastic changes that customer facing people have to deal with which impacts our ability to do our job."
good,Not a bad place to wok. I just wouldn't expect a long term career development opportunity from any of their call center location. Management was great and super friendly but were seen as clicky towards some.
good,Capital One is an expansive company with countless opportunities for advancement. Capital One offers amazing benefits and allows for a healthy level of work life balance.
good,"Good in technology implementation and work life balance. Has Startup culture and new cloud based stack implementation. "
good,Capital One was great for benefits.  No real process for advancing upwards within the organization.  Lack of diversity and homogenous culture made it uncomfortable working there in the end.
good,"I took a position that was unfortunately not what was promised in the interview. The biggest issue I had was that I was held responsible for the actions of others but I had no control over them. In other words, after action plans were discussed in detail and agreed upon, those responsible parties had so much work on their plate that when our plan wasn't executed, then I was to blame. My job was to recognize risk and and come up with a plan to remediate it. Being that I did not have access to the necessary systems to clean up the mess, I felt that the blame falling on me was unfair. Capital one had since closed that position so I left before my department was made extinct."
good,It's a great place to work. The most enjoyable part of my job is the work it self. It's not very hard BUT is tutus. If my jobs was not going away and had a different manger I would stay. But things are always changing at Capital One for the good.
good,I enjoyed working here. No micro managing as long as you get your work done that is all that really matters. The campus was very nice and i learned good information as it comes to management.
good,pretty good cant complain.  It has its up and downs just like every where else.  it was ok i was miserable taking the same calls all day long i dont recomend
good,My time at Capital One has been an amazing learning experience. My typical day at would be arriving early and work immediately. Have an early morning from time to time. Once doors open customers come in and help them in whatever it is they needed.
good,"if youre looking to start your career, capital one is a good place to start. They are customer service focused but the management in my experience changes too often."
good,"normal working pace"
good,"Great benefits. Lots of travel opportunity. Great for some (not for everyone)— especially for people avoiding their families or trying to have an affair."
good,"Frontier Secure even though it was new with the Capital One contract, was a good place to work. Even though there were growing pains as far as management and procedures, work was even paced. Not room for improvement or advancement."
good,it is good and nice so useful very helpful i have learned a good work and great insights to strengthen my thoughts so overall it is genuinely working site
good,"Structured environment"
good,"	Established behaviors within the team and increased customer service scores to be ranked 45 of 990 branches, which subsequently set the standard for the rest of the district to adhere and follow. "
good,"My first job out of college in 2006 "
good,Great company to work for under the correct management.They have awesome benefits and the hours have changed which gives you more time for yourself and loved ones
good,"When I was transferred from a consolidated location to a new one, the management was poor, but I stuck through to the end. Unfortunately, I was forced to leave so that my work stress would not interfere with my school stress. Management was extremely poor (a 0 out of 5, honestly)."
good,"Excellent place to work, great ammenties, and campuses.  Laptops are a plus.  Worked there 2 years.  Come as you are dress.  Flexible schedules.  Informative and interactive meetings"
good,Stressful environment. However I did lean a lot about customer service.  The hardest part was just not being able to take a break as needed between calls. The moral was great far as recognitions for your hard work.
good,Focus on training and considerate of employee's time  - compensation above average - cooperative teams who are focused upon client satisfaction and delivery.
good,"This was my first real corporate job and I must admit that it will be my last within banking going forward. Although I worked for a contact center, it felt as if we were treated as such and it was very obvious that we were not in a branch level. The amount of worth that all employees gave each day was amazing and it's a shame that it didn't feel too much appreciated. Capital One states that they have many positive goals and believe in a strong culture but it seems to be mostly talk to improve their image to their newly hired associates and high paid management."
good,"Great place to work, wonderful benefits!! Great atmosphere, and helpful people all around to assist! Very thorough training, lots of change but they always keep you up to date."
good,"Capital One is a Decent company to work, good opportunities in some groups. But some groups are stuck with legacy technologies and it is hard to change them and several people are not so happy with it."
good,"great place to work - and as with any company, depending on what your skills are- the possibility exist that your job may be outsourced or relocated. A great place to work."
good,"Sales focused environment with great rewards. Rewarding when goals are reached. Good communication skills are a must, as most of the interactions are with agitated and curious customers."
good,sir i urgent job please sir  give me job sir my poor is family sir this work is beautiful sir give me one  chance so kindily urgent thankxxxxxxxxx sir
good,"Nice fast paced agile development company, friendly environment encourage learning. Big contender in automation and in using AWS technologies. Teams are supportive and collaborative."
good,Constant change mgmt makes it very stressful.  Pace is unreal.  Performance calibration creates a hostile work environment.  Glad for the tough learning years but would never return.
good,it is def a great company to work for. very goal orientated and very laid back and relaxing. sometimes work can be a little stressful but then again thats with any job.
good,Capital One will help you get your foot in the door. The benefits are pretty good. Expect micromanagement. It is a corporate environment. Make sure you are nice to your leaders.
good,"great place to work, work/life balance is constantly being preached as well as team work and employee encouragement. They host events that promote diversity in the workplace."

good,"Company is good, and has great benefits. Management really needs to understand and redefine their definition of work life balance."
good,"they treat the employees well, lots of benefits and employee appreciation events. moving up is a tad bit hard but doable. Management is less than mediocre as the managers are subjective and can have a lot of say as to moving up of even your termination basedo n their emotions rather than your performance."

The company promotes something but it's not enforced by management which is why it can be a great job if you can get in with good management."
good,It was a great company to work for im just not a all day at the desk kind of person.  Great benefits and 401 K.  The best part of the day is daily team meetings the worst part is the limited interaction with your co workers which is typical of any company that is a call center.

The company puts a lot of emphasis on team bonding and and offers creative incentives to improve production and have a little fun at the same time.

good,I had a great time working at this company. Management cared about the employees and wants everyone to succeed.

My coworkers were intelligent, friendly, listened to suggestions. It was a relaxed, yet professional atmosphere to work. Management was outside of New York where I worked, and there was sometimes a disconnect, due to not interacting daily with his staff. That was the hard part of the job, management was not supportive where it was necessitated to do so. I enjoyed finishing projects with my fellow co workers. We all get along great.

good,"For a bank and credit card issuer, Capital One has undertaken a very customer-centric approach to delivering service.  Jettisoned are the old ways of focusing on AHT and selling products (with the attendant sales metrics enforced on servicing agents).  Another plus has been the movement of servicing jobs back to the US from overseas locations.

good,Capital One in my opinion was a great company to gain professional experience but the chance for advancement is quite difficult.Overall my experience in Capital One was a positive one.
good,They try too hard to be a tech company instead of a bank. Some managers focus only on using tools they read about or heard about at a conference intead if what’s the best solution
good,Complicated and archaic corporate culture from corporate offices in Virginia that make it challenging to succeed in a rapidly changing company trying to compete in the technology world.
good,Loved working for Capital one.  A place that does give its employees the options to learn more and advance.  If I did not relocate I would have never left.

good,"They have a work hard, play hard policy. They really care about their employees. I learned a lot there about customer service. My only real complaint is all the drama that happens there. They change some of their policies while I was there, that cause several employees to be terminated. They didn't take steps to prevent this from happening until after the fact. They also worry so much about quota, that sometimes customer service falls behind."
good,"Agile culture, focus is to migrate to the cloud, so many tie ups to companies to learn new skills. Good pay, rewards as well. Health benefits. Middle Management sucks"
good,"The company is great and the location you have dictates the team you may work with. The work life balance could be better as there isn't much flexibility when it comes to scheduling but it can become tiresome due to it being more of a retail job than a banking job like in the past. I'm used to the job due to my past experience and while you do work at a bank, you may find yourself running around doing a bit of everything at times."
good,"Capital One pays well, but the review process is awful, promotes favoritism over production. Your peer and your own self review is taken with a grain of salt.  It up to how close you are with your manager."
good,"A typical day of work is relaxed yet productive. "
good,"Let me start my review with, I turned in a 2 week notice of resignation in which my direct manager completely ignored & did not enter, therefore I am ineligible for rehire. My coworker submitted her 2 week notice of resignation on the same day as I, and the manager properly processed her notice. I guess I wasn't ""teacher's pet"". Secondly, my brother in law started at $10 an hour, I started at $14 an hour, and my best friend started at $16 an hour. I was the only one with previous auto finance experiment. We all worked in the same department and got hired within the same month."
good,A great place to work. I would recommend it for anyone interested in developing their financial skill-set.  High paced so be ready to learn fast and dedicate your time it.
good,"I was in ""swap My Card,"" a department that lets customers know that we can upgrade the benefits on their credit cards. We called it the ""Rainbows and Unicorns Diviion"" because we rarely ever had to deal with unhappy customers. Unfortunately the company moved out of Sioux Falls and there was no option to relocate."

good,"Would have been better if it was something more than hotdogs and hamburgers ."
good,"The biggest perk is your fellow co-workers. The moral is held to a decently high standard and the company is pretty great at motivation. However, for the type of work you do in a call-center can really get you down. 80% of the calls you take are great and the majority of the customers are wonderful to talk to. However, that 10% can really really get you down and nothing you say or do will change the customers mindset.  The biggest downfall in my opinion was the management -- a large number of team leaders were rarely available and don't take customer calls -- which I feel is crucial to understanding your team; teaching/coaching is not the same as doing the job--anyone can critique the work with a set of guidelines, but not everyone can handle the work it takes to meet those requirements."
good,There are many benefits to working @ Capital One.  The programs and events they have are well planned and beneficial to associates.  Most leaders do a nice job of making work fun for their teams
good,"Its a large company with multiple levels of bureaucracy. Difficult to get things done quick, many levels of red tape, and meetings to achieve even a simplest of tasks."
good,"It was nice working for a company that provided its employees with opportunities for education and advancement. Capital One Has that."
good,"Culture was wonderful, everyone acted as a team. The staff were wonderful, you always felt that they would back you when helping your customers. Great company, not enough job security."
good,"The department that I worked in was technical support. I did a lot of troubleshooting with customer and their devices. Customer service was very important. I made sure I was understanding to my customer and her needs. I was their to help out with any questions about their account. I provided knowledge about technical issues, credit and how our system works. Capital one provides lots of training and workshops."
good,Training is long but good. Good pay. Fun company activities. Day is always busy. Good benefits. Perks are handy. Management is open for the most part. Flexible
good,The company isn't bad to work for. I think it depends overall on the department itself. My current role was for 9 months with the promise that due to the high demand of stress and roles that I would be taking on that it would look really good on our resume and seeking opportunities of advancement within the company would be seamless. Needless to say that wasn't quite the truth. Now I am approaching a year in this position and cant seem to post out of the department no matter where I seek to apply to. Its almost as if there is a hold to keep agents from leaving from within the company. The stress can begin to wear on you after a while.
good,Nice place to work the people were very friendly and extremely nice I liked the environment and the atmosphere the work wasn't hard at all. I enjoyed working at this company and would tell anyone how nice it was working there.
good,"This is a great place to work if you are open to being coached. Most positions are very performance based and they do ask for you to deliver, but they give you the tools necessary to succeed."
good,"A very good environment to learn new technologies. Once a week, Lunch and Learn sessions."
good,Met some great people while working there that mentored and taught me all that I know. I gained majority of my work experience from the company.  They also offer a lot of training programs that help you grow personally and professionally.
good,Capital One is a great place to work. The benefits are great and the vacation time is excessive. The workplace culture is great and the people are very enjoyable.
good,"Capital One is a growing Tech company with a great mission and values.  It is an every changing environment with respect to leadership, responsibilities and structure"
good,"Culture and environment for development are amazing.  Calibrations for role levels are unfair and lack merit, IMHO.  Managers have too much power in determining futures and does not appear to be oversight from senior managementl"
good,"Good work environment, for the most part. Management does a decent enough effort to develop associates. As a junior associate, you are expected to seek out work instead of getting assigned something from a manager. Having initiative is crucial to success. Sitting around and waiting for work to come to your desk will not get you anywhere."
good,"Great salary and benefits, but lots of entitlement among associates. Management bends over backwards to help associates, and there are fantastic employee assistance program."
good,"Great place to work"
good,"Capital One is fine as far as working in a large, corporate environment goes but they lack trust in their employees to make decisions and thus place so many particular rules that even the best employee is bound to make an error, even if by accident, and even accidental errors are treated as if they were due to negligence or ignorance. "
good,I enjoy working at Capital One. The IT hardware I manage is being phased out and AWS is replacing it. I hope to move internally. I am open to other opportunities externally.
good,"Depending on where you're working, the company overall is great. My management was the cause of me to find elsewhere to work. I would say definitely try for it as I know people who are happily still there and moved up."
good,Taking calls and collecting on accounts. You are expected to meet department goals even if you are only working part time but your schedule is full time.
good,"The Management and Staff in my department and area departments were super nice and helpful."
good,"Capital One was a competitive environment where taking risk was encouraged, but choosing poorly was generally met with pessimism."
good,Capital One was a very good place to work. The people were very easy to work with. Working in Loan Admin. there was always something different to do every day.
good,"Capital one is a fast paced fun place to work. As the company is leaving one of it's markets it is going through some major re-organizations so it may take it a few years to get back to being one of the ""best places to work"", but I am sure it will!!"
good,I enjoyed the work life balance as this was very important to me.  I really enjoyed my employees.  It's a shame they were closing offices forcing employees to look elsewhere.
good,"Capital one is a great place to work, they are grounded with their values which revolves around doing the right thing and committing to excellence. They ensure that everyone is the organization strives to live these values."
good,CapitalOne is a great place to work with lot of learning curves and every day challenges with adaptation to the growing technology. The workplace culture is great and all the employees are greatly respected. The company is very supportive of all the employees and its a place where work life balance is really a possible and not just a dream.
good,Cap One really tries to take care of its Full Time associates. It has a wonderful culture for employee involvement. Pay is a bit low compared to other large companies.
good,"Capital One is a great company and they really care about the associates.  Many developmental classes are available to improve on self."
good,worked with many intelligent professionals.  Culture of the last few years was changing for the better.  Focus on diversity training and structured job performance reviews.
good,They have a great culture with high expectations for maintaining a high performance level.  They are becoming a leading technology company with focus on digital technology.
good,Not bad for call center work. Attendance policy is rough because they do not accept doctor notes and leave not covered by fmla is unexcused no matter what
good,I learned the importance of  work life balance. Although my position was very fast paced and demanding there was a family environment.  I enjoyed my time there
good,"Its years ago but was a great company to work for, can give much detail now because I don't know the company positions and goals today. I will probably followup with my co-workers then at that point I can give a full review"
good,"its could be stressful sometimes with the amount of calls. I have gain a lot of knowledge about the different type of personalities that call in, the work place is relax atmosphere"
good,"- cannot beat the benefits offered"
good,"The workplace culture is one of the best aspects for this company.   "
good,"I loved this company.  It was great while it lasted but when the economy started suffering, our entire center was cut out and our jobs were moved to Texas and Maryland."
good,Capital One is an excellent place to work with room for advancement within the ranks. Advancement is provided from with in. Company has a beautiful campus.
good,I enjoyed working here but was expected to work all the time.  Management is not knowledgeable of what it takes to get a job done and did not provide appropriate staff to support me.
good,Emphasis on development but can be challenging to find capacity while completing your work.  High frequency of turnover in managers.  Performance management can feel forced.
good,"could use better leadership from managers who have more product knowledge "
good,"Capital One is one of the newest banks that has quickly risen to the Top 10 in terms of size. It is still run by founder and CEO Richard Fairbank. The company has a really strong and associated focused culture at the corporate level. At the individual division level, the culture may end up being very different. Overall, it is a great place to work."
good,Loved working at the headquarters but there are constant reorgs therefore job security is not always guaranteed. I loved my managers and I was supported while I worked there.
good,Just was not something that I was interested in doing. Wanted something that was more towards the line that I went to school for. Its not a bad place or job just not for me
good,Teams are well organized with frequent meetings and one on one every week.  Team leaders are helpful and coaching is done in a respectful manner. The connection between the higher up and the employee's needs improvement.
good,Work Life Balance is touted but frequent downsizing puts pressure on employees to work long hours.  Great training and educational opportunities are available.  Campus is a like a college campus.  Very social.
good,Capital One is a great place to work! The work/life balance and benefits are exceptional. The people are great to work with and your voice is heard. Working at Capital One has allowed me to explore many different areas of the bank through my project work. The diversity at Capital One is robust and the environment is very inclusive. The people are generous and great to work with each day!
good,I really don't have much to say about this position in that it was a good transitional job to tie me over until something better came along. This job was the typical 8 hour day.
good,Capital One was a great place to work while I was going to school and the environment was great. Unfortunately they decided to close the Boise site.
good,"it was a good job, i learned new things,like mixer machine operation.made new friends,i had a fun and enjoyable expierience"
good,"Good Facilities, many parties, lots of freebies. The company overall is good. They give you different avenues to express yourself and give back to the community."
good,ok for a college student. NOT a FULL TIME JOB like some like to think it is. Coworkers would leave after paid training. Management was going nowhere and passes stress onto the other coworkers.
good,A typical day at work involved lots of interaction with the public which was also the most enjoyable part of the job.  Learnt a lot of customer service skills.  Great work/life balance.
good,"The company is stellar when recruiting the millennials, staying competitive with the more popular corporations with the likes of Amazon, Google, and Facebook. The Associate Development Program recruits these young scholars with a great advancement potential."
good,"NPS STINKS!!!!!!!!! great group of people to work with.Training not that good,Technological tools for work great.Management have all been brought up through the ranks."
good,"I have been at Capital One for 5.5 years and it is generally a good place to work. Lots of perks such as on campus gym, decent work life balance and good training opportunities."
good,It's good company to work for. Overall good benefits get an opportunity to learn new technologies. Work culture is not so great.Management seems to be disorganized.
good,"Capital One is an excellent company the drives on our customers while balancing work/life culture. Amazing campus amenities : gym, cafes, health center. Amazing benefits that seems to supersede most companies. Starting off with vacation upfront and increases with tenor."
good,Very hard to deal with certain managers and not knowing what attitude they will have day to day. Constant fear for your job on a daily basis when you are trying to do your best with what you have is very difficult.
good,"this was essentially a call center, but they were very good to their employees.  the pay was low, they were very good about team building."
good,Productive and fast-paced workplace with great people.  This organization is on its fourth year of their Agile journey.
good,There are several different lines of business at the Plano campus making it possible to vary your career path. The campus offers several different amenities to include workout areas and a nurse.
good,"From my experience, Capital One has a lot to offer in terms of working on new and exciting efforts. The big picture view of the company is that they have grown from a sub-prime credit card company to a large, multi-line diverse financial services company in a span of 20 years. Along with that has come several acquisitions and a couple of major pieces of legislation that mean there is always a ton of challenging work to do. That is fun. The downside is that sometimes you will work on something, only to have it redone or scrapped after a year or so."
good,"I've had several different roles while employed at Capital One. I work in bank office bank and support multiple customer service teams.  In addition to paperwork, my job requires that I communicate with a varied amount of teams throughout Capital One including general customer service, customer advocacy, and the Office of the President.  While a good deal of my communications take place within Capital One's internal system, I also provide correspondence with attorneys and state agencies to ensure that our process is compliant to current laws and banking regulations. My job allows me to develop my analytical skills as our team must always pivot to accommodate changing financial regulations and customer needs. The most enjoyable part of my job is breaking apart complicated situations and figuring out solutions.  I've been disappointed in the management on my team because it has changed so often making policies and procedures inconsistent.  I've learned a great  deal during my time at Capital One including valuable tools in business process management and lean management."
good,"Open branch, check logs, stock stations, review lobby, morning huddles.  Set Goal for the day. Help customers, look for cues , satisfy customer's needs.  Learn new products or benefits.  Inform co-workers of any change in policies, or logs.  The most enjoyable part of the job was enjoy the time working with my co-workers and helping customers."
good,Looking into the finger print of fraud was exciting. After 10+ years working with some of the same people all that time made going to work feel like family all worked together.
good,"I worked in a small branch which recently closed. We were required to reapply to continue employment at another branch. Although there were openings, no one in our branch wanted to continue working for the company, simply because of our DM and his associates. You are constantly treated as if you are replaceable and your job is held over your head daily. There is no room for growth in the district unless you are willing to move 3 hours away. The ladies I worked with were excellent and I truly enjoyed the ins and outs of working there. The customers were great and I got to know each of my customers on a first name basis. There were great things such as the benefits and the PTO, the holidays off and the incentives, but ultimately, those things weren't enough to outweigh the poor management and the drama."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Capital One. They only thing is that the are closing a lot of their Louisiana branches. The incentives were very nice. I looked forward to my monthly and quarterly bonus. There is opportunity for advancement, but only if you are willing to relocate. The job is very easy, as long as you are good at customer service then you will enjoy it. I would work for this company again if I moved to another state."
good,"travail intéressant"
good,Managed a great team doing UAT for mortgage products.  It was great to work on a task that will be used by the whole department once deployed into production.  Team is being moved to another state so must look for new employment.
good,"We were told lots of great things in the beginning that seemed to change over night. Nothing was as it seemed and everything was different, we felt lied to."
good,Difficult hiring process.  Excellent culture.  Young and progressive atmosphere.  Structured and complex bi annual reviews.  I really enjoyed Capital One.  They are unique and in the banking business.
good,"was laid off "
good,I had a great experience working for Capital One Bank.  Working in this role allowed me to gain some great experience in Financial Services.  My favorite part about Capital One was the ability to drive meaningful change within my organization.
good,It has been fun work environment.  We have fun contests and spirit days.  Everyone is positive and tries to help each other.  We have fun networks and volunteer activities. We have team outings once a quarter.
good,"Overall a good company experience, but as most large banks they care more about profits than their people, so unless you are Samuel Jackson on the 360 commercial do not expect to have any job security at all."
good,Technology is really looking into the Open Source Movement. It is making a true moved to software engineering culture.
good,"I believe this is a solid company that treats it workers very well.  You  work hard but play hard also.   Must be able to work at a rapid pace"
good,"Great place to work and company culture is good to work. Company provides great encouragement and good motivation for Associates. Fun place to work with lots of facilitators and team to keep the associates stress down from workload. "
good,"good company to work for, great opportunities to move up in the company, some of the managers really care about the agents"
good,"It's a great feeling to wake up and not have to go anywhere for work, but this is still a call center position.. Definitely an interesting place to work for and they have great and amazing customers, plus, all the co-worker were very sweet and nice, but this does not give you any benefits if you have really young children. The job is very strict with background noise (and with a 1 yr old and 5 others in a house.. it's pretty rough for our home to be really quiet) please consider that this is still a call center job, so adherence and attendance is very important. Capital one also does not pay or give any reimbursements for cable expenses that you need to have like phone and internet services, so keep that expense in mind, you also have to have a hard wired internet service that no one else in your home can use while you are working (we had to have a separate company install service because we could not order two separate routers from our current provider).. However, if you do not have pets, live alone or with older children or adults, then this is a great position.."
good,Great company but a difficult company to grow with unless you are 25 years old.  Management is hit or miss on good or bad.
good,always a chance to move up or around in the company with understanding people
good,I love being a banker in all aspect of the word.  Great career and plenty of growth.
good,"productive positive workplace with many opportunities for advancement, the best part of the job was my coworkers and being able to work as one unit"
good,One of my building blocks. Taught me alot about corporations.
good,Good company to work for. Great benefits and compensation.
good,"The actual company is excellent to work for. There are a lot of opportunities in the company for moving up, especially if you are a very sales oriented person. In my specific role, I was more focused on customer service and operations. I loved the operations part of the job because that is what keeps everything in regulation, and I looked forward to audits because I knew everything was done properly. My team was a fun team to work with, and we constantly bonded in and out of work. This is a very very very sales focused company. If you do not make your sales even by 1 mark, you will be terminated. While this is not what happened to me, I left on very good terms and even stayed a week after the date I had given for resignation, It did happen to coworkers all around me. To work for this company, you have to be willing to stay after hours for long periods of time, with no gratitude in return. However, that is not the company that is ungrateful, that generally has to do with the specific manager. Because I have children, one of which is sick quite frequently due to a very preemie immune system and heart surgery, I would not reconsider this company for reemployment , due to the fact that you have to be willing to stay hours after your scheduled leave time."
good,Strong company new to retail banking but leaving a strong mark on the indrusty.
good,"Capital One as a whole is a great company to work for. However I believe banking and ""Retail"" are two different categories and job performance should not be based on the ability to sale products"
good,The mandatory two-year limit on contractor engagements and the heavy concentration of off-shore contractors creates a serious impediment to progress.
good,"I enjoy working with people and I'm very enthusiastic on my job. My typical day is to review what job expectations are needed to be fulfilled for that day, My goal is to met or exceed the job for that day. I like staying ahead of anything I have to do. I plan how I will do this each day. I feel if you don't enjoy your job and give 100% then you shouldn't be there. I'm a team player and listen to the good and bad. I motivate and maintain a high level of engagement for co-workers. The most enjoyable thing is to help my manager, co-worker and business to achieve and provide the values of the business. Follow the guidelines reduce operating cost but not quality. Provide feedback limit operational risk in accordance to company and regulatory standards, policies and practices. I enjoy seeing a project grow from the ground up. The hardest part of the job is when I have to write up a cc-worker. I have a heart and love for people but I also can't put the company at risk for a co-worker that does not want to follow the policies of the company."
good,monthly bonus and other fun things. managment was decent and coworkers are great.
good,"Resolve customer complaints via phone, email, or mail."
good,"As a floor manager I run reports, monitor calls, approve vacation time, and monitor the agents log in/ log out times. I work with our morale committee to keep the associates engaged creating contest for the floor and organizing quarterly team outings. I keep accurate records of associate conversations regarding trends that must be addressed. Being efficient and detail oriented is a requirement as a floor manager."
good,"I enjoy going to work every day, and find that there is something new to learn constantly. The work is challenging sometimes, but it's worth it to know that I'm helping people."
good,A typical day at work for me is coming in and counting the vault before any customers transactions take place. My co-workers and I take turns greeting customers in the lobby to make them feel welcomed and to let them know we really appreciate their business. I learned a lot about customer service as well as operations and being organized and reliable when it comes to paperwork and important documents. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing i have clients who are happy to be doing business with us.
good,"This was a typical supervisory position with 10-15 associates reporting to me at once. The one thing I learned was patience and how to manage multiple associates and maintaine that the associates maintained their pre-set calls per hour, as well as call evaluation.  The hardest part was to find the time to provide the proper feedback to all of the associates within a given time."
good,"Capital One is a good place to work, however I do not feel as though I was properly compensated for the work load."
good,"In general, the working enviornment is friendly. people are busy in office but the life-work balance is not bad."
good,"Fast paced call center dealing with credit card issues. Fun atmosphere with team competitions for stats, best decorated cubicles. Fun days such as hat day, pajama day, flip flop day, etc. Great employee recognition for good stats, compliment calls from customers. A company that truly cares about its employees and not just about filling chairs.  Hours weren't the greatest but different shifts do open up every so often. Also opportunity to advance with good stats. Decent benefits."
good,"The work environment at Capital One can be unpredictable which involve many repetitive transactions, busy traffic, and solving both customer and technical issues at the branch. With great training provided by capital one, strong management and supportive a team, nothing was too difficult to handle. The manager and co workers were very helpful and knowledgeable. The difficult part about the job was the repetitiveness in general which were goals and task which can became mentally exhausting. Job security was risky, one mistake can potentially get you fired. But the many things I did enjoy was learning the technical part of banking, developing problem solving skills, and being analytical. Developing personal relationship with customers was a plus also."
good,the company is great and so are the managers and fellow collegues. The downside is the wage. It is not a good living wage.
good,I enjoyed the challenges presented day to day and working together as a team within each department.
good,You can learn a lot working in the branch unless you have the right team to support and teach you.
good,"My typical day was to set up virtual and physical servers for end users. I created and maintained the project schedule and provided progress reports to sponsors and management. I learned a new Change Management system. I learned how to use Clarity. Everyone has different management styles. At Capital One some of the management staff used the permissive style of managing and some were very autocratic. Overall I think there was a good "
good,Lots of processing. Learned multiple systems and management techniques.
good,"Overall a laid back atmosphere. Basic call center protocols. However, as a single mother of 3 children (one with disabilities), not as flexible a job for me. I enjoyed helping customers find solutions in resolving delinquency."
good,co-workers are great and management is usually hands off.  Work life balance possible with option to telecommute when needed.  Lots of interactive with co-workers and other teams
good,Unasalable focus on customer service. Fun place to work. Few oppertunities for advancement.
good,"a Day at work can be described as an inter personal interaction with customers diversity and needs. Great Teamwork and Partnership with peers. I have learned to be proficient by organize time and task through out a daily plan with goals and expectations. "
good,"Capital One is a great company to work for. However, depending on your department the hours can be very long."
good,"As I would enter the work place I would open filing cabinets and vaults. Access all night drops along with putting out the working cash. Then our daily routine customers would start flowing in. Made certain that all mail, emails, work was processed in a timely manner befire end of day. "
good,a typical day at Cablevision was taking incoming calls from account holder with inquries on accounts. working at cablevision i  learned many bank procedures and different account types and products. management was very knowledgeable and willing help when ever necessary. Hardest part was irate customer with issues on account most enjoyble part is solving to satisfy the account holder.    
good,"Great co-workers, New challenge each day"
good,Great Co-worker. Alot of favoritism between managment and associates.
good,The call center metric was very understandable. The environment was easy going.
good,"Capital One is a great environment for those who like heavy team work and exposure to a lot of different business areas. Broad knowledge, rather than deep knowledge is an asset here due to the nature and size of the projects at hand."
good,Awesome plans on paper just needed to get some of the technical difficulties out of the .
good,"Working for Capital One 360 is great, the toughest part of the company would be the advancement process."
good, Responsible for testing various modules and interfaces to establish a smooth flow of data between the integrated components & lead integration tests.
good,I have learned many things while working at Capital One Bank. The core values are admirable. My co-workers are wonderful people and the benefits are great.
good,Productive and a great place to work. This is an great organization with the resources to help you advance in your career goals. I enjoyed the campus environment and the atmosphere.
good,"Working for capital one was a wonderful experience for me. It gave me the knowledge of the banking world, it also allowed me to show my wonderful customer service skills. My managers were ok as long as your job was being done and being done well. The bank is a team enviroment and that is exactly how we were a team. There wasn't anything about working at the bank that was hard, and the most enjoyable part was meeting the different types of people everyday and being able to help them when they have a problem."
good,"Pretty dull. Nothing particularly special. If you have ever been in banking you will understand that there is a good amount of time to kill. Unfortunately, management wanted to monopolize free time with menial tasks."
good,Nice company with only job security. Fun loving people. Nice values. Basic facilities. Less Salary
good,The hardest part of the job is knowing that we're getting laid off in a few months.
good,"has excellent benefits. Main job duty is sales, no matter what occupation is. constant coaching on this job, assist customers and provide excepional sevice always a must"
good,"This is a great job for someone who is just starting out. This job is ideal for college students, but for people with a family the pay can be a difficult."
good,"spent a lot of time with service,helping customers. very busy."
good,Company is very agressive in the banking industry and wants to be on top. Must make goals and complete all tasks with achievement.
good,"Ability to advance at a regular pace. Unfortunately, the division of the company closed."
good,"Capital One was a great company to work for.  Capital One is not the highest paying company in the AML industry; however, they have a great culture that consistently boosts morale."
good,Great work environment company always provided an upbeat atmosphere that was about growing and learning. they also feed everyone tons be careful you may gain alot of weight working there LOL
good,Allows for flexible work schedules and work from home opportunities depending on the organization and role.  Allows for diverse ways of thinking and challenge.
good,"Great environment and opportunity to work in cutting edge technology."
good,"Month end legal entity reporting for FINRA regulated Broker Dealer, Registered Investment Advisor and associated investment companies. Preparation, review and analysis of monthly financial statements, month end reconciliations, capital expenditure monitoring and calculation, journal entries and preparation of internal reports to support monthly regulatory FOCUS filing and quarterly Form Custody filings."
good,Excellent company to work for if you want to e in environment of cutting edge latest or to be latest technologies. Capital One works closely with AWS and most of the advancement are latest AWS offerings
good,"The review summary says it all. Has it’s day’s some better than other. Senior management is okay, it can be better. Too many unnecessary managers and not even pay."
good,"Great place to work at, with great benefits and flexible work schedules. Management may be supportive depending on your manager. Career pathing is not 100% clear, so you will need to own your development."
good,"Its a good place to work, they try to help people to find a career and feel ok with their jobs and the amount of work is ok. Recommendable place to work"
good,this company is a good company and work culture is good and the management team cooperative and very professional environment. Nice to be part of this company
good,"The environment was very stressing, with high work volume and demand and low compensation. Management was more about meeting their numbers than providing support for staff. My co-workers were great though they made the days easier"
good,"they are advocates of employees success. Have decent benefits. No much area to growth in retail banking. They are turning to strictly online banking, credit cards and commercial banking."
good,Capital One hires all cultures. Lots of growth within the company. Modern campus and eating places on campus. Capital One has several lines of businesses in the Plano area.
good,Great place to work especially if you are in this line of business. It is pretty tricky as they don't give you to much room for error even in training. They do care about the employees but its best that you know people. the more you know the better. Some of the management looks out for their team were as other managers go exactly by the book. Not a bad place to work. good Vacation time and wonderful benefits
good,They're good to pay bills but just not for me. I enjoyed the job to a certain extent but it was just a job. I do have a disability that they did not want to accommodate for due to favoritism but I would recommend working with them. It's a great company overall.
good,"Very fast paced with very regular change. If you're not comfortable with a lot of change, this may not be the place for you. Outstanding co-workers; some of the smartest folks I have ever known."
good,I worked here for more than two years.the pace can be fast but you learn so much in a short time. You get to work with so many different layers of people. Many of them have so much expertise and experience.
good,"I enjoy my work, and the workforce is cohesive, but my current position is not conducive to taking the next step in personal development or promotion."
good,"Learned several new technologies during the 3 years in CapitalOne"
good,"Great work-life balance, "
good,It was a fun place to work for the most part.  a very friendly familial environment where diversity is prevalent.  Management took time to work with and build employees careers.
good,I had very productive and knowledge gaining experience at Capitalone. My manager and Tech lead were supportive and they give you enough time to research on new technologies before working on them. Really had a great experience there. I wish i come back here again.
good,I probably would have never considered leaving if it wasn't for management. The culture is the main reason many stay at Capital One.  They have great benefits and there are fun times to be had on an 7 building campus.
good,"This position was great and fun to work at during college. I personally could not see myself with the company long term, but it was a great job as a middle ground. They provided competitive pay and a chill working environment."
good,"***********************************************fast-paced work environment. "
good,Pay could be better. Not enough for the cost of living. Work environment was clean and friendly. Management was open and friendly. Not a lot of room for advancement.
good,Working  at Capital one went as go as can be expected.  The Capital One financial investment department was closing down. All the permanent Employees were losing there jobs as well.
good,Great place to work....until it wasn't.  Very young culture. I was downsized and was the oldest and highest paid person in my department.  Job became more about competition.  It didn't match to where I was at that point of my life.
good,Stay professional and do not get lost in the political part of the job. Go with the flow and just be you. After all that’s what got you the job in the first place.
good,Capital one is a bank that wants to be a tech company.  The benefits are amazing from top to bottom.  The price you pay for those benefits is a frustrating culture.  The loudest voice in the room is valued over anything else.  There are countless meetings prior to any real work getting done.  Most frustrating is the need to jump at every new technology before wondering if it's practical or useful to the task at hand.
good,I was managed by someone that was not able to adjust to the person they were managing.  They only had one way to try and teach someone which does not work because everyone learns differently and needs to be taught in their own way to truly understand.
good,"Performance management process is the challenging part of working there. Despite communications to the contrary, calibration process felt very subjective."
good,Very good atmosphere. Very hard to move up with the company due to the unfair acts of promotions for people. General work experience was good overall.
good,"Back in the early days, CapOne was a great, fast-paced place that was super busy, but very enjoyable since it seemed like everyone was moving toward the same goals.  As time went on, the culture shifted a bit and more politics came into play as parts of the company were outsourced (and then later brought back in-house).  It seems that every few years there is a big re-org and they let people go, only to rehire them 8-9 months later when they realize they are needed.  "
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working with Capital One. The people were great, management was solid and for a large call center everyone has a voice. I would recommend Capital One to anyone."
good,"The company offers a variety of roles and locations, the pay is always the most competitive in an area and the health insurance is awesome but the schedules for lower level employees are unreasonable weekends are mandatory unless you work nights which is horrible for parenting"
good,I think Capital One is a great company except there was no sick days and all time off had to be earned monthly. It was hard to build that up. Also the bonus structure never got figured out.
good,"I think they needed to give the some more hands on training for the employees especially when policy and procedures change every day, and there was a position change. (No proper training for position change, and the position change was NOT optional)"
good,"Good people, great work environment with many opportunities to grow and succeed. Management structure is deep and is not consistently experienced or always very supportive. Important to manage your own career interests, no one else will. Corporate preference for youth over experience."
good,"productive & fun workplace. very laid back. the managers are not over your shoulders at all times. I would highly recommend this location for anyone currently looking,"
good,Capital One offers a great benefit package along with a competitive salary. benefits include tuition reimbursement. Shifts make it difficult for a work life balance due to the inconsistencies. They offered a wellness plan that rewarded you monetarily.
good,Capital One is a great company that challenges individuals to be their best.  Capital One strives to promote a good work/life balance.  They are extremely customer focused.
good,Worked as a contractor or 4 months.  Great environment and company seems to care about their employees.  Room for advancement.  Benefits offered to employees were generous as well as amenities available onsite.
good,"Great benefits, paid holidays, 401K, employee discounts, great work atmosphere. Great career guidance.  Adversity guided, very supportive of education."
good,Capital One was a great place to work. The stress level of a financial services industry contributed to employee turnover. Focus on quality product is a plus.
good,work is fine but there is a culture of cliques and haves and haven nots at capital one. An introvert will find it very hard to advance there. There is backstabbing and a ton of turning a blind eye to things that just should not be allowed to go on.  Pay is average and the benefits are what makes Capital One a great option
good,I worked at Capital One for over 8 years and I would have been there longer if I wasn't laid off. I recommend Capital One for work/life balance. They do take care of their employees. A lot of great ammenities.
good,"Typical day includes calling accounts that are 60-90 days past due. Metrics are based on variety of things that you cannot control and your bonuses are dependent upon how much you collect and your rank amongst other collectors. QA dept is very unfair and will lie and probe your phone calls just so you won't be eligible to receive bonus. Alot of ""red tape"" at this company and moving up is highly unlikely unless you are buddies with management or a tattle-tale on other grown up. Only thing good about this company is the the health insurance (BCBS) that you pay for."
good,"it was great. best thing about capital one is they do not push product to customer. so you can help customer. the management is very good . they teach you everything. you have to do everything by  yourself,"
good,Awesome workplace culture. The campus is amazing with onsite café. Capital One also has onsite medical center. The ability to work with my manager regarding my work schedule.
good,Capital One is a great place to work. Great work/life balance and great flexibility. Capital One strives to be diverse and inclusive and does a great job with that.
good,"Great benefits, great work/life balance. Intense culture that makes you feel like ""if I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere."" In other words, the business acumen you develop while there is unmatched in most business, corporate or academic settings. However, the intensity can be tough to handle year-over-year."
good,They're making a lot of cutbacks and trimming the fat...not great job security. Company seems to be trying to figure out its direction...which isn't communicated to employees at all.
good,"Capital One was an empowering place to work where no one job title was more important than another.  The culture is pull up your sleeves and get the job done."
good,"Great work life balance, Management wasn't that good, Top notch Facilities.. Co workers were awesome. The direction the company was taking was unclear and not executed properly."
good,"Capital One is a decent company to work for however there is a lot of room for improvement. Unfortunately the culture seems to mainly benefit ""yes men""."
good,Creates high performing teams with Agile and Lean specialties. Lots of competition internally and best to continue to upgrade your skill set on a continuous basis.
good,"I truly do enjoy working for Capital One. It has a very friendly atmosphere, the benefits are out of this world and you have a chance to become life-long friends with some of your co-workers. I believe it would be beneficial for managers to have previous experience and mandatory knowledge of the department over which they lead. Once someone has proven their hard work and stats, it should be easier to move up into a back office position."
good,Capital One is changing within a blink of an eye. Recent cuts to lower bottom line. No one is really secure in their position. Many branches are closing. Working low on staff. Great room for growth and development in oneself. You definitely learn hands on sort of speak.
good,"Capital One was a great company to work for. Lots of positive things to write about: benefits are awesome, work/life balance is good, and opportunities to meet a lot of wonderful people."
good,"Great place to work, the hours and the staff are very flexible and understanding that the employees have live outside of work and I received some of the best training ive ever had in this field."
good,"bottom line is for the stockholders not employee focused.  "
good,"Despite the layoffs, Capital One was one of the Best company I ever work for. They gave me the opportunity to learn how to Fund, Close, and process loans."
good,"Started as a great place to work. Working in the fraud department can be draining at times. Lately it seems as it has taken a turn towards micro-managing. Alot of our decision making discretion has been taken away. The team that manages schedules, called workforce, is atrocious. Not really sure what they do all day besides make everyone miserable. One day your lunch could be at 10am and the next 1pm. Great PTO benefits, never get to use it. I believe about 4-5 people a day get it out of a department of over 80 people so that is cool. A little bit of favoritism is seen but not to bad."
good,Working from home eventually became a challenge for me personally due to the lack of face to face interaction with others on a regular basis. Performing the actual job was actually great. My manager was awesome and provided above and beyond support 24/7. I left the job in great standing in terms of meeting my objectives and requirements ...including my annual evaluations.
good,"Good benefits, solid pay, and in most cases a pleasant place to work. There are moments where morale drops massively and job security feels at risk for large groups but there is usually a balancing factor that comes after."
good,"I have met some amazing people there. Too bad the branch was about to close. If it was not the case, I would have continued to work for the company. I did enjoy working in that environment. The hardest part was dealing with frustrated customers especially when the line is really big. You have to act at your quickest."
good,"Provided safe work environment, provided opportunity to train, competitive salary, great incentives, fair treatment, gives back to the community, opportunity for career advancement"
good,typical work day was 8-5. I learned that they have a free spirit environment. the culture is very laid back. the best part of the job was the on site gym and the cafeteria they have on site.
good,"workplace was great and very cultured. Las Vegas site was welcoming the cafeteria, gym and onsite doctors were a great perk for working there. Enjoyed working in the office and the people employed by the company. MY management was great to work for."
good,Learned a lot about the business. Great people to work with. Customers are always having a rough time but thats just life. Meetings every week to collaborate on any trends.
good,Great environment to work in
good,Corporate culture. Very few promotions and very competitive.  Frequent reorganizations with layoffs. Work/life balance depends on the department/role.
good,"If you are looking for a nice place to work and to advance in the company, Capital One is for you. The culture is friendly, the environment is peaceful and you can receive many benefits for performing your job well."
good,"A typical day consisted of regular standups, sometimes grooming and writing and maintaining automated tests. I learned about how things operate in a large company."
good,"Being part time was hard, since the hours were so inconsistent. However, I loved working for capital one. Great company. Learned many operational duties."
good,"Great work life balance; ample vacation days and holidays to use whenever you want.  Enjoyed coming to work everyday, pleasant atmosphere and friendly people."
good,"Wonderful people and opportunities, just poor management skills.     Once, again, the experience was worth it, but as a first time job I unfortunately had a bad experience."
good,"C1 is a fun, flexible, and constantly evolving place to work, but the long term vision is shaky/ uncertain.  Upper management appears out of touch with each other and do not present a cohesive front."
good,A competitive job within your team and can be very stressful. Benefits are very good and pay is in accordance with industry standards. Team outings can be a lot of fun.
good,Cetain manager make you and certain break you.  Upper managements needs to hear the agent out on the ones that break you and allow them to find a field that they are passionate to work in rather just checking off the list.
good,"*** Pros"
good,"Excellent work-life balance, benefits, and flexibility. Vacation time, sick time, training, independent work, great managers who care and give you independence."
good,good company to start with and very nice place to start. learning opportunities
good,Capital One's benefits packages are great and the majority of the people are great to work with.  My only complaint is with the current performance rating structure.  Being good at your position and doing your job well isn't good enough anymore.  You need to go above and beyond to get any sort of advancement.
good,"Great benefits and flexible time off, the updated commission structure is  based on team performance rather than individual achievements. The commission pay out also changed from monthly to quarterly which is tough when you have bills to pay and the taxes take most of it"
good,i liked it. unfortunately i was laid off due to the selling of the investing division. I would have liked to continue my career there. great people and a friendly culture
good,"Capital One is a good place to work. It has good benefits, good salary. It also has PingPong table in almost each building. Gym is my favorite place which provides a lot classes. They would like to use new technologies, like AWS, Machine Learning."
good,I don't like how once you are terminated by a manager of the company you reported to HR repeatedly you are unable to work for Capital One again. I think that is the silliest rule about the company because everyone's circumstances for termination are different. My training was horrible and once I was able to finally communicate with my manager he told me everything I was doing wrong without probing what might have been the issue such as inadequate training and support not to mention the fact he was on vacation for months before we finally got to meet. He terminated nearly most of our team members so that speaks volumes to his lack of good management.
good,"Capital One was great, however it left a bit to be desired from a salary standpoint. Other Companies paid more for the job I performed at Capital One."
good,Fast paced.  Ever-changing technologies and changes by management necessitated constant training and re-working of projects.  Competitive reviews made for a stressful environment.  Great benefits and good pay made up for much of the stress.
good,"The environment I worked in and the team I worked with were equally wonderful. They do not micromanage the least bit and allow for so much creativity and innovation when it comes to your work. They also are very supportive of work-life balance and are flexible with remote work. There was little to no direction when I first joined and they don't have any training for new employees but I personally enjoyed that aspect of having ""free reign"" in what I could do with my work. But you have to be a self-starter and be able to figure out things on your own to be successful.  "
good,"Capital One Investing is a decent company for whom to work. COI offers competitive compensation and a great benefits package. The culture is relaxed and dress codes are nearly non-existent (imagine jeans, shorts, t shirts, sweaters, etc) within the bank environment."
good,I enjoyed working for capital one. I was there for 9 years until my old manager retired. When new management came in it was horrible. When being with a company and new management come in everything goes down hill. Vacations and benefits are great!
good,We had loans to be funded by a certain time daily. We stayed extremely busy. Worked on weekends on a volunteer basis. Very productive team worked delayed loans cut checks did wires and ddas
good,"I was included in an Involuntary Separation Program, due to Organizational Restructuring.  I was an SME with 17+ years business experience and knowledge.  They brought in replacements and gave us less than 3 months to complete knowledge transfer. This was completely insufficient and although I voiced my concerns with the new teams readiness to support the business needs, my concerns were ignored.  It was a pretty sad situation, especially for the business user base, which could have potential financial impacts.  But the response was that they were willing to accept the calculated risk."
good,"Nice campus and great benefits"
good,"they really think about what they can do to make employees more happy at work, because a happier employee is a more productive one.  lots of project managers and analysts to help ensure goals are set appropriately and met consistently."
good,People are friendly and it’s a great environment to work for. Can be a fast paced environment. Should be focused and detailed ordinated. I had a great experienced working with the company.
good,Capital One is a great place to work and learn however the quality managers that prepare individuals to lead have been redeployed and performance process needs major overhaul.
good,Management need to be better. They need more training skills and professionalism skills. Capital one need better hours for working parents. They should be more flexible with the hours.
good,The daily workload is balanced.  Management is not necessarily open to employee opinions or voicing their opinions.  Benefits are great and Paid Leave is great.
good,"It was a good company, I really don't have any other things to say. It was a good job, I did my job, got along with everyone. I was an amazing employee and they were amazing employers"
good,COF is huge in to AWS and being the cutting edge of technology and information.  If you are not super tech savvy then this is probably not the place for you.
good,"inbound calls from customers can be great some hours.  sometimes customers are going go get upset at everything or anything you do.  i was taking 60 to 100 calls based on hours.  prior to the wells fargo opening false bank accounts it was sales based and the leadership was focused on helping you do that.  after the wells fargo telephone banking and sales changed.  the culture changed to no more monthly all stars, little to know update on information from management, managers didnt know how to manage people.  The managers new how to manage sales people, they seemed to be loosing focus on how to manage people."
good,"Capital One is focusing on digital and on-line banking, as such they are closing branches and cutting employees.  There is no job security anymore with Capital One."
good,"We are encouraged to use our voice. "
good,"Overall a good company to work for. Good management, salary, benefits, career opportunities and training. For the most part, they take care of their employees. Although, they do have some work to do when it comes to work-life balance. Employees are talented and sharp and work together. Everyone assumes positive intent."
good,Not much room for advancement w/o playing politics and leveraging with management. Forced distributions during reviews are horrible. Good performers get overlooked for those that make more noise and get the better ratings (which affect bonus amounts).
good,Capital One is undergoing a lot of changes in their business model.  The cahnges are requiring a lot of branch closures which results in a lot of layoffs.  Upper management also has been changing strategies a lot over the course of the past year which means targets are constantly changing.
good,Consistent training for each and every job. Great bonus and growth in the company.  Several Managers and employees had seniority with  company.  Credit department sold to Capital one.
good,It is great for the work at home options but that position doesn't allow for much advancement. When something does come up there are so many agents that it is flooded.
good,"Here at Capital One our days vary, there are very few typical days.  A typical day would be come in QC the work done the previous day of the application being filed.  I learn to be super flexible because change is inevitable.  Management  styles.vary throughout the company,  If you like challenges and diversity then this is the place for you.  The people you work with will make the changes worth going through."
good,"Capital One is a great company to work for from a work - life balance and benefits perspective, but is very competitive internally and can be cut throat at times. This is largely due to the continual nature of employee evaluations, and the way in which the company sets employees up against each other. Rating similar employees in different roles makes it difficult to feel comfortable in your position as somebody else may be working on projects that are more high profile that yours and you will be rated, bonuses, and ultimately retained based on this. You are not always rated based on what you are doing, but rather on what others are doing as well regardless of how much you achieve in your role."
good,"The benefits of the company and the work/life balance are great. "
good,"Good Place to Work, Work Culture is good, Good Employee Fun culture with fun activitites, Occasional late nights deployments. Management and HR are superactive"
good,This work culture was a good fit with team work encouraged. This was an agile technology shop that was fun to work at. Work/Life balance was frequently sacrificed though
good,"Great benefits, good for an advisor who like to work in a bank setting. The higher ups are not putting enough into developing cohesive tools for the advisors."
good,"Great company to work for, however, it is at will employment. Therefore, to keep up with the market, they make a lot of changes which could involve you being re-deployed"
good,"Good work/life balance, good benefits, with good career growth opportunities. As with many large corporations, it's easy to feel like a small fish in a big pond, but the company works to be inclusive and ensure growth opportunities for associates.  The CEO and executive leaders have worked hard to create a culture where everyone's voice is heard."
good,"I was put in collections , but I was hired for inbound representative."
good,"One of the best and most fun places to work. Unfortunately, their procedures started getting muddles and constant change in management made it difficult to keep up with the objective of the role."
good,it is fun to work with capital one team either front end or middle and back end. and plus Devops  with AWS. i got a wonderful time for the pas two year with capital one.
good,"In my experience, the company really does value work/life balance.  I was directly involved in activities that affected the end customer, and felt that the company has good direction and a noble mission, despite some mismanagement in how to achieve the mission."
good,Capital One was overall a good place to work.  Great work-life balance plenty of paid time off.  I was lucky and had great managers for most of the time I worked there.
good,"Capital One and the Collections Department has provided well for me and my family.  The environment, while comfortable, lacks progressive motivation for its employees to advance within the company."
good,"Capital One's culture is that of none other you will ever experience.  The level of professionalism and the bar that you are held to is extremely high.  This is a fast paced, high energy, and ever changing environment."
good,"If you're a contractor, watch yourself. I had a very small number of absences (2 of the 4 actual company holidays) and was supposedly terminated for this. These were medical situations and I was assured early on the company was very compassionate and understanding. I felt that way right up until I was told - via my contracting employer - that I had been let go."
good,"A typical day involved the daily, weekly, monthly responsibilities for each of the managers you support, as well as one off projects and tasks. Most often the workplace culture provides a work/life balance, but that can also depend on your direct manager and what division you work for.  The hardest part is the lack of consistency for similar roles within the organization.  The most enjoyable part was the people I worked with.  My direct team worked really well together, had each other's backs, and truly worked as One Team,not strictly as individuals for the success of our Markets."
good,"Productive workplace - creative personnel to work with from all different areas of the country.  Their initiatives evolve, from waterfall to agile to kanban to cloud"
good,"Management was never that great in any of the departments that I worked in. Benefits outweighed the bad. The best part of the benefits was all the paid time off, as well as the tuition reimbursement"
good,"Good company, good place to work almost free of unnecessary stress. The team work is encouraged while there is a lot of flexibility. The leadership values the workforce."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Capital One. They have a great culture that is associate focused and they have great benefits, There are a lot of great leaders at Capital One."
good,"This is a great entry level sales job, you are able to get real world sales experience with out being held to a standard.  you are able to interact with people all day long."
good,A great company to work for as a whole. A lot of your experience will depend on the department you work in. Decent pay. Can be a lot like high school if you are from the area
good,"good job to start off with, competitive  can be hard to move up. a lot of locations don't get too comfortable would love to see more diversity in upper management"
good,It was pretty easy to set up account and start sending applications!!! Building resume was simple. Site is easy to read and view job decriptions. Will recommend.
good,While the company has a wonderful work environment it's hard to move up in the company without leaving the company and returning a few years later. The only other flaw in the company is favoritism. It is a know issue that still has not been properly addressed.
good,This is good company to start out with and gain experience. Tons of ways to get bounses and other good extras. I just wish management and less drama filled.
good,"it is a good company to work for if you can get a one of the good jobs, any phone jobs are very stressful and hard to deal with. if you are able to get a job out of the phones its great."
good,Capital One offers excellent benefits and sets excellent strategic  goals to grow its business. Great visionary leaders makes this a great company to work for
good,"I've have enjoyed working for Capital One but my passion is accounting. I'm looking to for more  opportunities in the accounting/bookkeeping, which I have been looking  within Capital One as well."
good,Only worked here for a short period of time as a contract employee but found the culture to be inviting and the workforce pleasant.  Large company with a variety of job opportunities to meet most skill sets.
good,"Perhaps to the detriment of its core banking mission, COF is desperate to not having the FinTech revolution leave its card and retail business in rubble.  And I can't blame them."
good,"Answers inbound calls from customers and service providers in a call center environment. Resolves customer inquiries and issues while adhering to all Capital One polices and procedures. May assist customers with the application and funding process. May also make outbound calls to customers and/or service providers. May handle account activations. Some positions include cross-selling additional products and services."
good,This company is huge of course and there are alot of teams to move around to but the management on my particular team did not encourage professional development very well and also did not provide opportunities for advancement and mentorships
good,Great salary and company that offers positions globally. Fast pace environment with challenges that push you to develop and grow. Loved the clients. The challenges is the hours you may be scheduled.
good,"Onsite training is very good. It is a fast paced environment but they provide onsite training for both associates and contractors. There can be times of high demand for projects, but the overall structure is of a more mature company."
good,"Fantastic work/life balance, the ability to work remotely for some roles, fun work environment, great company culture and values, corporate citizenship and volunteerism, open communication, visibility to and from leadership, onsite campus amenities (cafes, gym, health center), great benefits, awesome people and opportunities for training and growth"
good,Capital one really look after the you as an individual. Support development and keep you engaged on a day to day basis. Good support for the community
good,"Work hours aren't the best and neither is the pay.  However, they have plenty of room for advancement and their environment and culture are tops!"
good,"-Organizational culture overall is good.  They truly strive to improve any areas of opportunity."
good,"Job satisfaction and advancement are largely within your own control.  You must be aggressive, declarative and go after what you want.  The office environment is pleasant, convenient and has lots of perks -- onsite gym, bank, copy facility, health facility, pharmacy.  They provide shuttle service to other buildings.  The culture is spotty...some teams are great and others are disastrous.  This has a lot to do with your individual leader.  They encourage participation in outside organizations, pursuit of additional training and education and have a generous compensation program.  Overall, this is one of the best places I have ever worked."
good,I loved my time at Capital One.  Work life balance in the branch network is non existent but overall corporate life is good.
good,Great benefits and flexible work hours. If you work in Mortgage or Auto you have great opportunity to advance within company in role and duties. 401k is 7.5%. Maternity leave is 16 weeks!
good,Daily sales profiling to acquire new relationship services. Open all depsoits accounts for consumer and small business. Process all loans applications.
good,"Design, develop and deliver learning materials/tools, from ideation to evaluation. Leverage effective needs analysis, diversity/inclusion, project management, course development, and evaluation skills. Demonstrate a solid understanding of adult learning principles."
good,"Working with capital one client is good. with good team work environment . working hard and solving the bugs which occur in the project . working in several servers like Hp., Dell, IBM . and working on different operating systems like windows, Linux,Redhat, fedora"
good,Over all it is a fun and fulfilling place to work. The hours are okay and so is the pay. I have learned so many new things from this job. example how to run a vault daily or how to open up new accounts. The management is very helpful although when you ask for help at times they just give you the run around. meaning if they dont know they send you to another person and so on.
good,"Loved the job, customers,  completed workers, my team and Department. I loved my job. Missed personal leave time at end  of employment due to daughter terminally I'll and her death. Received cooperation and empathy in that situation and I was very grateful for that. I left however since over 5 years if I could have gotten on ai compromiseable shift for mine and business needs I would not have had to take leave. Which resulted in no pay, bonuses, raises, shift bids or vacations  now rolling into second calendar early.  All of this while having one of best metric times in my department and EXCELLENT  NPS surveys while in cuss.  Along with 14 months of quality assurance and surveys all great range conducted with 75% of my computer systems did not even give me authorization to use after management knowing this was an issue yet it was counted against me in quality assurance.  However I still managed to maintain above average or standards for depart with these road blocks yet I could not get hours to best suit my daughters medical needs which could have worked better than it ended up working out with business needs. My previous cuss management Jay,  melody, time,  Taylor etc would gave been proactive and compromised best for all needs. I love capital one though! The company has Ben masterly engineered by an intuitive visionary rich Fairbank.  Marketing has been unbelievable.  I say the company should be more proactive but so difficult with such amazing and phenomenal growth. Recent focuses on customer digital experiences and security offered by cap one to customers is phenomenal "
good,It is a good company and good benefits. We're fun working there. The company provides a lot of training to employee. It is a good company working there
good,"Good work life balance, good opportunities to learn, good salary/benefits."
good,"Typical work day: Worked off reports, auto inbound and outbound dialer systems. Worked on specials projects to preview special incentives to motivate customer paying options."
good,"There a lot information and systems to learn with in 3 weeks and will over 6 different systems in that time. For me it was difficult, but for other is was easy. Being my first time doing call center it was a new experience for me I must say."
good,"Typical day consists of me monitoring card holder accounts and filing fraud reports. I learned essential customer service skills that are needed for any job. My co-workers are nice and always willing to help out. The hardest part of my job is when you can't make a customer happy. The most enjoyable part of the job, is the Morale."
good,"In a typical day I enjoy working with my peers, my direct reports and my leadership.  "
good,I am not comfortable writing a specific review. My work day meet the companies requirements and I believed in providing 110% of myself to the job. I was recognized and awarded because of my desire to perform.
good,"Capital One is a challenging work environment offering multiple opportunities for professional growth."
good,"Excellent interaction between the group, which foster great office relationships and a positive workplace environment.  Co-workers were more than willing to help in any way to get the job done.  The hardest part of the job was troubleshooting automation code issues."
good,"Capital One Tampa is a corporate call center. The pay is fair, the benefits are great! Everything you want from a job Capital One offers it, but you have to be able to tolerate back to back inbound calls your entire shift. If you don't like call center work this job isn't for you."
good,Capital One is a good company to work for. The hardest part about the job is not being trained. The most enjoyable part about the job is not being micro-managed. I'vw learned a lot about the mortgage industry.
good,"Worked with wonderful team, management was always supportive and encouraged associates to perform at best levels.  Incentives were fair, many events to keep the location a fun place to work."
good,"A place that will allow you to grow and develop. Capital One is a company on the grow and as it grows, it employees grow. Be always ready for a change as a employee of Capital One."
good,"Job secutiry is low as favourism is more and constant changes are there.Management is less aware of what goes in ground level.Differentiation and even though not all but some staff shows  it very obviously."
good,capital one is a wonderful place to work. but has little to no place for advancement . It is a wonderful work place but I would love a change to use my skills I have learned over the years to move up to a higher management position.
good,Typical day at work is to make sure customer is happy and assisted . make sure all questions are met at a professional level.
good,Pretty cool place to work.  cool people and managers cafe is good also there is a bonus but the system is complicated and difficult to follow
good,"I was working for the Capital One only a few months when I found out I was pregnant. The benefits they offer are great,they fit every accommodation my doctor recommended. It was a bit stressful with keeping up with policy changes. Due to pregnancy I was out a week. I came back and I thought I had a whole new job so many things changed.

good,I loved every moment working at capital one. They have an amazing team of associates who make the office a fun place to work.
good,"Fast paced, diverse and ever changing work environment!  Capital One taught me how to lead people through the good and the bad!  I love all of the people I worked with and I built a lot of great relationships over the 12 years that I was there.  The hardest part of the job was being limited in the amount of time I could spend interactive and quality time with my team.  The rules and regulations were clear and maintaining within the law was expected and executed daily.  The atmosphere was fun and inviting!  The benefits were great and my schedule matched what I needed to balance my work life and home life."
good,"Capital One is overall a great place to work with a culture that is associate friendly.  I enjoyed many years working there with opportunities for growth throughout those years.  However, at some point I was put in a position that stagnated me that had no more oppourtunity to grow."
good,I learned a lot from my managers and other team members. The hardest part of the job is that it is a call center environment and it is stressful. It is fun to talk to a different person each call.

good,"In a typical day at capital one you would be informed of any necessary information such as changes to policies or updates to systems required throughout your work day, you would have complete contact with your manager via in person, email, or messenger, as well as direct contact with your peers the hardest part of my job is when I cant directly correct a customers concern in one interaction. the thing I enjoy most about my job is being able to advocate for my customers and provide them with an exceptional experience and exceeding their expectations."
good,"- Processed customers’ banking transactions and maintained referrals each quarter"
good,Learning development was always consistent and informative.  Leadership is heavily involved in promotion and personal development.

good,"Wonderful company to work for.  Excellent benefits.  Management Cares, Company Cares.  Unfortunate set of circumstances led to my lay off."
good,"Great company, unfortunately the change/shift in culture is making it hard for most people to advance within the company."
good,A typical day was very good. Manager and other team helped us . It was user friendly environment. I learned new tools and technologies.
good,I enjoy working for a good company. Capital One has a focus for employees to have fun while working. That made it enjoyable to go to work everyday.
good,Never a dull moment at Capital One. You're surrounded by very smart people. Compensation is very good but the operational tempo can take it's toll.
good,The do have a lot of constant policy change which can sometimes be very frustrating. Sometimes the Managers have No clue of whats going on.
good,I learned how to review the creditworthiness of businesses and guarantors. I was also able to complete my MBA while working here.
good,"This company focus on technology and information based on decision. They take themselves as a technology company. They have a very good training program. During the training, you don't need to work."
good,"Its good Company.Pleasure working with capital one."
good,Typical day is processing various types of transactions and balancing drawer at the end of the day. Benefits were great! Compensation was the only downfall.

good,"Great place to work"

good,"A good and fair place to work."
good,"Capital One is a analytical persons dream destination.  Within the organization there resides many great thinkers who are looking to make a difference within their respective roles and projects.  With this you have various pockets of strategic execution teams, exceptional data miners, and very strong technology team. The management structure is one that allows you to lead and carve out your next steps within your career.  That is the part of the job that I loved the most.  The ability utilize my drive, knowledge, and natural skills to build a brand for myself."
good,typically call center job. it was challenging to deal with unsatisfied customers at times but we usually had tools available to us to resolve service issues. members of leadership were interactive and very involved in daily operations. overall good place to work.
good,"HSBC was bought out by Capital One Services. When the takeover took place everything was great, new managers, Great Company to work for. Friendly people, Fun place to work. Only thing is since  the takeover Capital Ones monthly bonuses were not good. At HSBC my monthly bonuses were 1,200.00 . Capital One 200.00 to 300.00. Overall great place to work."
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Capital One.  Everyone who've I had the opportunity to work with has been bright and on top of their game.  I was never in a meeting in which I had to explain things a second time due to someone misunderstanding something said.  "
good,"I enjoyed working at Capital One bank, and atmosphere was good for most of the part"
good,A great bank with a lot of potential. Opportunity for growth is limitless
good,Enjoyed working at Capital One. The most enjoyable part of the job were my customers.
good,"Capital One is a great company for Work-Life Balance and Community Engagement.  Community service is not just a bullet point on a powerpoint presentation--they take this very seriously, even going so far as to have company funded community service days during the work week. They believe in ""Doing the Right Thing"", and this applies to all aspects of the business, except for Human Resources.  This is typical of any large company where HR sets the rules but oftentimes chooses not to abide by them. The greatest example of this is flouting a company-wide mandate that manager's must achieve a certain job level before managing people.  HR is rife with managers well-below the mandated level."
good,"a typical day at capital one requires a lot of self discipline because for my position, i work long hours and talk to different people on the phone everyday with different moods. but i learned patience is the key to be successful in this line of business. management is great, when you're in need or have a question, they're there for you right away and they're extremely knowledgeable. my co-workers are wonderful, they really lighten up the mood, so its impossible for you to come into work in a non pleasing mood because of your co-workers. i would honestly say the hardest part of the job is not knowing if the incoming are going to be back to back, or if they are going to be slow. the most enjoyable part of my job has to be the fact that we have teams that like to do team themes, potlucks, outings and celebrate birthdays."
good,Coaching and training associates to make sure they are taking care of customers needs and handling calls efficiently.
good,Capital One was a nice place to Work. They show their employees appreciation.
good,"Typical day included answering calls and assisting customers with concerns about their credit card. I learned how interest rates worked and how confusing they can be. Management went one of two ways, you either had a very good supervisor, or a very bad supervisor. If you were lucky you would stay on one team. The hardest part of this job was switching teams especially when you got along great with your previous supervisor. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to help my customers and take good care of their accounts."
good,Collaborative team atmosphere and provide great benefits. Extremely easy to manage work/life balance and relatively stress free
good,"Overall good company to work for, but i as a contractor, it was difficlt to become a permanent employee."
good,I feel job Satisfication when I complete my work and feel happy on the same.
good,"I been working with Capital One and in the auto finance industry for 9 years, I work with great co-workers everyday, as a Credit Analyst I enjoy talking to customers and to do everything to help them by telling them what documents they need to complete the funding process, previously I worked in the Repossession department was able to make the goal by keeping customers in their cars by putting them in a great payment plan to get them caught up in their payments. I get to learn new things everyday from my team mates and from our managers. I'm always looking forward to  to expand my career and specially to help customers and to do everything to bring more business."
good,"An average day is taking calls assisting card holders with any disputes on their credit card. What I have learned in doing my job is that you can dispute just about anything if you have a reason. Not saying you will always win, but you can dispute it. My co workers are awesome ,very informative with each other , everyone works well with each other.The hardest part of my job is letting a card holder know that we are unable to assist them with their dispute. The most enjoyable part is the interaction with different customers on the phone , I love meeting new people."
good,Management could have been better for the people on the last shift.
good,"Capital One is a results oriented workplace which allows for a great deal of flexibility in terms of working location and schedule. As long as you can get to the internet and have your laptop, you can work. "
good,"Fun staff, good perks of the job, but as heard about many of these collection jobs out there, it is a very cut throat style job."
good,My manager Rick Hussey and my coworkers were great.  We worked together and if needed coverage for a courtroom I always had it.
good,"Capital One is one of the best companies i've ever worked for.  The pay is great and the mobility within the company is impressive depending on the department you enter."
good,The management was good and I enjoyed my co-workers. The hardest part was the always changing the systems
good,"I started my career at Chevy Chase Bank which was purchased by Capital One Bank in 2009.  Since becoming part of this company, I have noticed that managers and company figure heads were accessible.  Capital One Bank create a culture for creativity, ownership, and allows associates to contribute to overall growth."
good,"fun place to work and a laid back environment"
good,"Capital One has been good to me, has great benefits and is a good place to get your foot in the door."
good,"Loved working for this company, which only made it sadder when my job and the jobs of my coworkers were eliminated.  This is a company that is great at what it does, not so great at what it does not know.  Had they understood the virtual world of working they would have been able to keep some very talented, well trained and dedicated staff!"
good,"Besides taking transactions from customers such as deposits and withdrawals, I deal with the compliance of the branch. I make sure we are up to code with all the required regulations such as Reg DD, Reg E, Reg Z, CRA, and all the other banking regulations that exist.  I make sure the teller line is in compliance with the money vault, cash dispensing unit, and night depository.  I deal with shipments of money coming in and out of the branch, as well as count it all individually to make sure everything is correct.  Documenting every little detail to make sure we are in compliance is very vital to the banks reputation."
good,"Role is quite challenging since you consistently deal with irate customer all day. Can be rewarding if you can overcome that. Management is great. They always work with you to help you improve anything that you may struggle with, because when you succeed, they succeed. Co-workers are ok."
good,Better growth opportunities; learning environment; smart workforce; analytically driven; valuable experience; fast-paced; dynamic; cutting edge technology; early adopter.
good,"Answered inbound calls and helped customers apply for healthcare loans. Provided information to Dr offices with status of loans and paper work they may need. Transferred customers to correct department such verification, sales, etc.. Dealing with irate office on check that should of arrived days ago. Or maybe an office that wanted to sign up but did not meet qualifications to do so. Another depressing part was letting customer know they were not approved for the loan. Had pizza parties once month for setting goals on productivity. Won gifts on raffles such Christmas parties and they also gave my kids gifts for Christmas."
good,"A typical day at Capital One is always part of the unknown. You never know if that day will be slow or if the day will be filled with back to back calls. What I learned at Capital One is that they are a very diverse company. Management for the most part is very good. The most enjoyable part of the job were my co-workers, the diverse group of people you work with makes for good conversations when in between calls or on those slow days. The hardest part of the job is being there and not knowing if there would be a system issue that day."
good,Working for capital on was a great expiernce. The job provided a lot of advancement and flexiblitiy. The job duties i performed on a day to day basics was easy and made the day past smoothly
good,"I enjoyed working there, my manager was very nice and understanding.. I miss them at times"
good,Cap One has an environment that really encourages teams to challenge each other into providing the best solutions and working together
good,"I feel that the company really cared about their employees.  Even though the company choose to close their Buffalo location, Capital One tried to assist in the best way possible to try to help the employees.  They provided training classes, allowed you company time to job search, and go on interviews."
good,"A typical day , would be to take Inbound and Outbound calls, collect on debt , resolve clients concerns and issues on a daily basis. To meet monthly goals based performance and Production."
good,"Routine days and work"
good,The business plan was different shades of gray; the focus changed from day to day. It was hard for middle management to align with the flavor of the day while managing operations accordingly.
good,"Over the last two years i learned alot about banking as well as the BSA.  A typical day at work would consist of reviewing Alerts for possible suspicious activity, as well as writing SAR fors the AML department as well as the  Fraud dept. The job can get stressfull and overwhelming but the co workers are what gets you through the day. "
good,"I loved their focus on employee development. They seemed to value their associates although, they would cull out the more seasoned ones from time to time."
good,Was a great place to work but my department was closed.  When it was Hibernia Mortgage it was the best place to work and unlimited potential
good,"It is one of the most stable organization in the US. Many people are satisfied working for the company."
good,"Great Place to work, Fun atmosphere, one of the best places to work in the Dallas, TX METROPLEX."
good,Good work life balance. Good Benefits. below market standard salary. latest technologies in the market. lots of trainings. lots of politics if you are not in a good group. 
good,"I enjoyed my job, however the strict policies of the company is why the turnover rate is high.  You must dot all your and I's and cross every T."
good,Been there 6 years not a bad place to work.  Could be netter at work life balance.  Some managers think there is no life outside of work.
good,i worked for Chevy chase for almost 9 years and had a great experience with the company i started as an Part time teller and moved my way up as an assistant manager. 
good,Learned to deal with 60 plus associates. Learned to stay organized
good,This job is very fast-paced. It starts early in the morning and sometimes last late in the day. I have been here for over 7 years. I'm determined in my job because it's a challenge every day. I learn more just about each year that I was here therefore making me the only one in my department to know just about everything about the job. Everyone has been there 1-4 years or less.
good,Its a growing company that provides great benefits to employees. You get to learn a lot as time goes by.
good,a typical day at work
good,Cash Checks
good,Taking Inbound calls assisting customers with their bank accounts
good,"Capital One is a great place to work. A typical day at work includes meetings with direct reports, immediate managers, and peers as well. The hardest part of the job is building a platform for the work at home program. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the change and growth in the front line agents."
good,Co-workers were very friendly. Management made job very easy. You were able to go with them for anything.
good,Very busy area to work in at capital one. we deal with customers disputes in regard to fraud or to a dispute they have with a merchant. we call customers if we have not recieved documentation to dispute the claim they have made. Managers are sometimes accessble but most not managers are mostly in meetings. hardest part of the job is having to deal with that one difuclt customer that wont compile to what we need. the best part of the job is when we are able to sucessfully help the customers out.
good,Providing customer with great service.
good,"Working at Capital One has been a great experience. It help develop my management skills, and my personal skills. A typical day at this company involves working with customers to resolve any concerns, or issues that they may have, to ensure that customer service standards are met."
good,"It was a good experience with Capital One. I was working with a Temporary firm, and my contract was over."
good,"Great place to work, get to meet many people that depend on you to provide them with the best service possible. However wish there was more job security"
good,"Capital One Bank has some outstanding benefits and the location in Irving, Texas and Plano, Texas had some very nice work areas. There were great incentives to workout in our new gym to counter balance being at a desk all day. Flexible work hours were offered. Did not have good management. Management on this site was extremely poor. Other than that Capital One Bank worked hard to comply with banking and state laws and was a pleasure to work for."
good,Great company but management is lacking. Compnay has a lot of job opportunities in different areas. Great Benefits. I made lots of great friends and enjoyed my time.
good,"Work/Life balance is incredible but the basis for promotions is rather puzzling and seems to be random or based purely on seniority. Working the with latest tech at a bank is rare, so definitely a plus not to have to deal with legacy systems."
good,"Our work goes in front of millions of customers, helping people understand and manage their finances."
good,"- Excellent opportunity to come in and swing for the fences."
good,If you live in Las Vegas can be with company years fire you with no explanation and that’s what’s confuses me but overall good company so give a try if not in Las Vegas
good,I have been with Capital One for 10 years and have seen many changes over the years.  It is a great company to work for and the benefits and compensation are very competitive. The performance management system needs some work and the environment is very fast paced to be prepared to keep up ith the latest and greatest technology.
good,It was a great place to work. I had an amazing manager and team. The work load was manageable and I was able to work from home occasionally. The perks and appreciation showed to my team was amazing.
good,"Job security is a factor within the banking centers. They are closing a lot off branches, and with only one role within the branch its hard to direct the next advancement"
good,"problem solving and use to learn different things everyday, also work environment was competitive and if have to survive then have to be productive and survivor."
good,"good company to work for good work culture "
good,Very solid company overall but lots of management changes in the hr/recruitment side of the house.. they changed more than 4 times in the year I was there but overall very solid.
good,"Benefits are great compensation is fair, and the work life is excellent. Only favoritism will award you advancement not work performance.  I learned a lot about the banking industry and the regulations that banks must adhere to."
good,Capital One is a great employer to work for. There are many opportunities for advancement. The pay and benefits are competitive which provides great compensation to its employees
good,"The company was transitioning from traditional banking to a technology company that did banking, which was a positive thing as a Software and DevOps Engineer."
good,maintain a high reinstatement goal each month plus work with other departments to have the most updated information to help provide our customers the best service possible
good,Loved the company but beware they are always looking for the next cheapest hire and have done too much outsourcing. I've watched thousands of people lose their jobs despite performance and complete locations shut down.
good,A typical credit card company growing into a bank. Technology department desires to be world class however that do not maintain a strategic plan long enough to realize their goal.
good,I really enjoyed working at Capital One!  I relocated from NYC to Charlotte NC and there are no Capital One office located here.  Capital One overall is a place to work!
good,"I learned some of the best skills received some of the best training, and worked with some of the best people at Capital One. You work hard, but there is time for team building."
good,Great place to work.  Love the work/life balance with my current role. Love the people.  Love the location.  Very innovative way of thinking and environment.
good,"During my time at Capital One, I worked for two departments: Disputes and Fraud.  The job requirements and management styles for the two departments were vastly different, however rewarding in their own ways.  The leadership in the company was very personable and compassionate towards their employees.  Truthfully, the only reason I left the company was because of personal events that caused me to do so.  Had it not been for those, I would have been happy to make Capital One my career."
good,"Growth is primarily limited to lateral moves. If you decide to move to a department beyond the branch, be prepared for reduced job security. Stress is limited to those customers who incite conflict as a means to get what they want. Security is questionable at any bank, but when the branches here get robbed little is done to secure your future and what little empathy is shown comes across as bare minimum to cover their bases."
good,It was a good job for me at the time. But there wasn’t much I could to grow with the company. I excelled quickly then it came to a stop when I got as high up as they were available to do.
good,Cap One is an excellent place to work if you enjoy a fast paced work environment.  The benefits are very good and I felt overall the compensation is good.
good,Leadership and management is not at its best. The SBLC team focus on working hard and not smart makes it a stressful work life situation.  Culture is an issue not all being treated fairly or valued.
good,Capital One really cares about their customers and will continually invest in themselves as well as their employees. Great family environment. Great benefits.
good,Worked at Capital One for over 15 years and learned alot about working in a business setting. The company offered great benifits and started you off with four weeks of vacation.
good,i would review them as a decent company to work for but nothing was ever communicated and they chose people for positions before anyone even had a chance to interview it was not very fair
good,There are lot of opportunities to learn from the seniors and it helped me to go further in my career along with my studies. Training sessions were little bit hard in the beginning but they are like helping us to dive dive deep into the business world without any hesitation. All the members of the team helped and taught each other with something new everyday thus i can say that work is not a boring place.
good,The job was fun and constantly learning with a good manager how ever once management changed it became unbearable especially since new manager had know clue what being a manager inteled nor had people skills to keep the branch success going
good,I enjoyed working for the company. I think other companies can benefit from learning how Capital One makes their employees feel valued. Amazing benefits great compensation.
good,I enjoyed my job but had two small children and would not work with me on hours until I became full time hired on and then had to wait for everyone else to make a decision before I could and my options where nothing by that time. Great job though and learned a lot there.
good,"I love the company, culture, and idea of Capital One. I've learned so much here and the benefits are amazing (they fully covered a surgery I had, in addition to 5 weeks paid leave with no decrease in vacation time). The only issue I have with this company is how difficult it is to be promoted and how convoluted the performance management structure is. I've seen terrible managers get promoted in 1/10th the time that amazing managers are, and this leads to poorly managed teams at a higher level. Even on a career fast-track program, I still need to ""wait in line"" behind other pending promotions for years due to this system. It's a shame because everything else is so amazing about this company. I would still recommend working here for some time, but maybe after you reach the level you want."
good,"Capital one auto finance was great, the pay was lower than I'd like but overall I think it was a nice, fun place to work.  People there seems to love their job."
good,Great experience working with the Capital One. Collaboration between developers and operation team members to increase the productivity. Great culture!
good,"You get paid quite well with excellent benefits and workplace amenities, but you are expected to perform at a high level.  Performance based environment."
good,"The pay was great, but there was no way to advance. The job description kept changing. I don't think they knew what to do with the position. They have great benefits."
good,"The San Francisco office is extremely well designed, and most teams are extremely collaborative and want to help you succeed. You’ll definitely learn a lot here."
good,"The only two problems I had with Capital One was the constant prodding to make people open unnecessary additional accounts or to see if they wanted to sit with a banker.  Also, the pay was low to say that they required so much of you."
good,"The day mainly consisted of team meetings and doing your work. The culture at Capital One is great. Unfortunately if you do not have great management helping you, more than likely you will not enjoy the time you spend trying to progress within Capital One"
good,"I Learned new methods, Dynamic environment and your opinion is listened. The environment is supportive and there are experts at each corner to suggest a better way to do things."
good,Days start with standups followed by core hours for teams to check in and communicate impediments.Rest of day dedicated to assignments and additional meetings as needed.
good,Capital One believes in technology to drive solutions with their banking solutions.  The culture is one that is extremely competitive but at the same time a very casual dress code & work place.
good,"Working with Capital One was a great experience. I really hate to have left. After having my son in April 2018, I could no longer work until 8 pm. There was no flexibility to change my shift, even though I was the only person on my team to work that schedule. Everyone else was off no later than 6pm. Outside of that and management everything else was awesome! Really a mission driven company, great diversity, the pay of great. Again, I was extremely sad to have left."
good,"Its a very secure building, for employees and visitors, they have an excellent cafeteria, people is very helpful and collaborative. They also have a gym."
good,Capital One Bank is a wonderful place to work. I learned so much about Business Banking. Before leaving my Manager was such a delight as well as the fun going nature of the culture. The hardest part of the job is to deliver a No to a customer asking about their finances or lack thereof. The most enjoyable part turning the previous situation around also the fun that the company allows the workers to have.
good,"Free lunches from time to time, good work / life balance, nice co-workers, good work conditions and amenities, good team building experiences - depending on the Manager you have. Its all about your type of Manager."
good,Perfect job with great banking hours. Off on Sundays and Holidays. Management was on and off. Very Short lunch break and not enough advances in making extra money. Working for Capital One was a decent job. Compensation was not enough to raise a family from and therefore a lot of employees leave and search for more adequate paying careers.
good,Great work environment with work life balance. Enjoyed co-workers and incentives offered to employees each month. Culture was good however management need improvement.
good,"capital One is a good company to work for. Depending on the department you work in, there is great opportunity for growth and advancement. Work/life balance is fair."
good,Made outbound calls of a sensitive nature to investigate exposure to fraud in credit card services.  Use of several investigative tools to try to find the true person who may have applied for a credit card.
good,"Amazing vision with improvement in execution needed."
good,"A typical day at Capital One would consist of coming in, logging in, checking emails for work updates and team announcements. The hardest part of my job was dealing with some of Capital's One's practices of not allowing people that work hard to move up and further their careers. It became more about politics than actual hard work. Over the 14 years I worked there I saw this change a lot in my later years. The most enjoyable part of my job was building relationships with the people I worked with and being able to demonstrate leadership on my team. I enjoyed many of the activities that the company offered the employees and teams as well."
good,"The workplace is pretty relaxed with most people coming in with jeans and a button down, but you will see many people with T-Shirts. The focus for employees is constant improvement, so be prepared to work hard at completing self-evaluation goals and compete with your fellow employees in a good way."
good,"Ok place to work if you get on the right team. Good People and lots of activities for associates, but contractors are not able to take part. Very political as well."
good,"There was a lot of pressure to make customers pay on their bills, even if they had just made a payments recently, because they were technically still behind.  This was often an escalated situation.  Basically the job was to deal with people who were angry that we were calling.  So it was very stressful, but I was compassionate and patient."
good,"I learned a great deal, enjoyed what I did and grew professionally.  I met many other professionals and learned of new businesses, how they operated, and their overall vision for the respected industry."
good,"It was a fun place to work at times and slowly stopped being so. Incentives started to be taken away. Work started becoming more and more strenuous and stressful. The people were great though, the manager I had was fantastic"
good,"•	Monitored and keep up to date with inbound and outbound CSR calls performance for evaluation and improvement."
good,The work environment is every competitive but cooperative at the same time. The workplace culture is liberated and open. The hardest part of the job is taking many calls non-stop. But I enjoyed working in capital one because I learned a lot and enjoy speaking with foreign customers. I learned how to deal with angry customers and good one's too. The management is very helpful and they support their employees all the time.
good,"For the most part, I enjoyed my 15 years at Capital One.   Work life balance was a struggle at times, but I was able to work through the challenges.  In the last two years, Capital One started a major transition to a Technology focused company, which as an IT person, I was happy to see.  My struggle was our promotion of management as we progressed through the evolution of the change.   Managers became less involved with career discussions / development and more focused on getting recognized for delivery cutting edge technology."
good,"I really enjoyed my time as a contract employee there. The environment was fun and fast-paced, and I was able to work on projects that I enjoyed while having the ability to develop my skills."
good,Lots of A-type personalities and lots of energy. The downside is lots of bureaucracy and red tape to get real work done. Way too many people tracking the work other people do.
good,I preformed Customer Service Representative Job Duties such as answering product and service questions; giving information about other products and services that the company had to offer. Maintaining customer accounts by recording account information and updating account information if needed. I also was able to retain accounts and credit accounts. I have deal with a lot of different scenarios and was successful in maintaining customer relations.
good,"Great culture and company to work for. "
good,"I had a great time working at Capital One Auto Finance.  THey kept us engaged, involved with company decisions, and involved with the department's growth."
good,Capital one was OK. I dont get why i have to write a paragraph about it. fraud protection was actually kind of cool. i should have stayed there probably.
good,"Good work-culture and extremely talented people.A lot depends on your direct management, that is something which needs to be changed. Lots of opportunity to learn and advance in the field that you like"
good,"Excellent company, plenty of growth opportunities. Open door policies- you can talk with management. Closeness with team members. Tuition - paid, holidays are paid."
good,Agile environment that values input of associates. Employees work in a fast-paced environment and are empowered to make decisions. Internal training opportunities are excellent.
good,Capital One was one of the best companies I have worked for. As a whole they put their employees first and ensure they are given the proper coaching to improve every day.
good,Capitalone has great benefits-They have a very great attitude concerning diversity. It is a good place to work. Not a great deal of opportunity for advancement.
good,"Capital One Customer Service center is an excellence quick paced environment to begin a new career. The building is full of diversity and the options to participate in additional groups to promote ones interest. Team building exercises, management coaching, and customer incentives is a bonus when working here."
good,"Working at Capital One was a great opportunity and experience, I had the ability to learn first hand how to assist clients with opening new accounts that fit all of their needs. I also learned the steps needed  to help clients apply for mortgages and auto loans. While employed at Capital One, I made advances in the company and was promoted from a full time teller to a UBA which allowed me to assist my colleagues at anytime with the things the needed because I was knowledgeable of the teller & bank representatives position"
good,"Lots of freedom to do your job with excellent working conditions (including a standing desk). No separate office culture so must be able to tune out  distractions around you.  People tend to be very pleasant but demanding work environment. If you are lucky enough to be on the main campus in McLean, there is a gym and nice cafeteria.  A new building is just opening (the tallest office building in the Washington, DC area). So they are growing."
good,"Depending on the process you're assigned to, workload can be heavy to very heavy. Management is somewhat understanding, but bottom line is you have monthly stats to meet, heaviest being the customer service survey scores. That can be difficult, depending again on the process you're in. Luckily, for those who have difficulty meeting their monthly metrics, the company is forgiving and they have an array of programs designed to help boost performance."
good,overall a good place to work but must be self-driven and determined. extremely competitive and very rigid in corporate culture if you find a successful and accomplished mentor and follow their lead you have a winning recipe for success
good,"OVERALL A NICE COMPANY. Good pay with smart people, new technology. but it has same pain like other big companies(politics, change is slow, sometimes micro management depends on your manager...)"
good,"It is disrupting the banking industry using cutting-edge technologies. The data science team is pretty strong.  Data analyst could explore a lot of new tools, like AWS, Python, D3, etc."
good,"A new company acquisition ended up ruining most of the Design culture, so it's max exodus now - so, designers, beware! "
good,"It was a decent place to work. It is customer service so you are subject to all the different personalities of the world when doing your job, Management seemed out of touch with employees, and instead seemed to focus on their bottom line. But, the pay seemed fair and benefits were decent."
good,i love working for cap one it can just be a lot mentally talking to customers all day and starring at a computer  all day. Also the hours can be funny until you work your way up
good,"When I started at Capital One, it was the best place I had ever worked. The company spent money on their employees to ensure that their morale was good. Over the years, that has dwindled, along with the morale. Goals have increased while incentives decreased."
good,"Fast paced in bound call center. Company culture is awesome. However, monthly performance bonuses were recently eliminated in favor of increased base pay salary. This was not beneficial to most of the staff."
good,"Capital One is a good company with a good mission. They have good compensation and benefits and provide interesting and challenging work. However, your experience can vary widely. Some areas of the business are better than others in terms of work life balance. In 4 years, I have been in multiple roles (same job family). This is also good and bad. there is a lot of time spent ramping up in each position and things can get dropped in transitioning. However, if you were with a manager you didn't like or under leadership that didn't value work life balance, or working on something you weren't passionate about, you get an opportunity to try something new."
good,Fun environment. Great benefits. Good colleagues. Lots of amenities. Does not feel like work. Always a fun place. Lots of recreational events. Work and life balance.
good,"I was free to run the inbound call center as I saw fit. I had the authority to make financial decisions up to $10,000 without getting approval from my superiors."
good,Lots of sales quotas and alot of the times the managers can be very pushy. If you work in the right bank it's okay..the pay is decent and the benefits are good
good,"not a bad place to work, but i have also had many other jobs that i have enjoyed more than this one. i hope my review has been helpful to someone out there."
good,A very good company to work for. The management uses risk management to manage its products and business model. The people are intelligent and focused. The team-work is really good.
good,Nice place to work. Love public interaction. Great coworkers. restructure was a bit offputting.  But business is business. most customers are friendly enough.
good,"I actually work for Plus One Health Management, Capital One is the client.  Plus One has phenomenal health promotion programs to offer the employees at Capital One.  I feel honored to be a part of that and to offer input in development of these programs."
good,"The transition from Chevy Chase Bank ( the best bank) was painful and it took a few years for Capital One to get the things right, we worked a lot to make this happen, great DM, great Management, the training was good, inside culture with a lot of activities and full paid meals, busy branches, stability is the worst with so many changes and reestructuring branches or closing places, they are more a credit card online company."
good,"It was a decent place to work; but unless you know someone in the department you want to move into, it takes forever to try to advance in the company."
good,Good Management. Really focused on employee growth and training. Very sales focused especially around lending. Not a good fit for me. Felt morally conflicted selling a product that isn't always good for the customer. Reducing brick and mortar banking approach. Going to more online self service banking to meet market needs.
good,"Great people and great place to work."
good,"Great place to work."
good,"Good work, good people. The opportunities for advancement are limited and it takes quite a long time to progress. Not worth the effort from that perspective."
good,"My manager had favorites and it was evident in the behavior, other than him most of the other people I worked with were very nice. Some were rude and again had favorites, but once you were focused on your job everything was fine. The best part was building a relationship with the usuals who came in. I learned patience and how to work quickly and accurately under pressure."
good,"Capital One truly cares about employees work/life balance. However, their poor choice in management has been the reason many employees have left. PTO is very generous even for part time employees, and all employees are automatically enrolled in 401K program."
good,"Capital One is appealing for the entry level associate. However it has been noted that most promotions are based on who you know and ""leadership"" experience versus actually knowing the business... I enjoyed the benefit of pto, health, vision and genrally the people I worked with. However I would caution anyone looking to move up as it seems that most of the management seem to work against each other creating a toxic work environment."
good,"The culture at Capital One generally promotes a positive experience from day to day, but restructuring often impedes progress.  Additionally, management frequently sets very aggressive targets for large projects which do not account for the difficulties inherent in developing interconnecting systems.  There are ping pong tables and other games, but some teams will treat you poorly if you choose to use them.  Security and the enterprise approval process are taken so seriously that they will inevitably impede development and/or testing efforts.  Cross-team coordination is often difficult or impossible without escalation.  All that said, they do regularly take employee surveys and make some adjustments."
good,"Objectively the company is amazing and good for anyone who wants to live in a big city. I was apart of the TDP program right out of collage. It was hyped up a lot and didn't meet my expectations. I was a software engineer put in a data engineering team. I learned a lot but not really what I wanted to do. I lived an hour away from work and was having a hard time balancing work and life. The company was really great though, I really liked the people I met and the benefits were great."
good,"A nice place to work w/ some great perks but sometimes it's too big of a company to feel valued... however if you happen to have a great manager who is dedicated to their job and helping you, that can make all the difference and Cap One has a TON of great managers."
good,"Great company...good work environment...great culture! If you are hardworking ...results oriented...and ready to adapt to change, you will do very well at Capital One."
good,I like working for Capital One. I have been lucky enough to have several great managers and leaders while at Capital One. I am exploring other opportunities for growth in the Richmond area.
good,This was a great introduction to corporate employment. The great benefits and diverse culture with incentives that you could not imagine. This atmosphere makes employee morale a priority so that the customer experiences are also pleasant.
good,"They no longer do mortgages so my job closed down with them. But during the time it was going, we did very well offering mortgage products to the public."
good,"I experience at Capital One was good and bad, good because of the atmosphere, people and all around work area. Bad because the Higher authority was pretty cutthroat and did not live up to what they would say"
good,fast paced environment. High tech with many group meetings. The organization looks to grow quickly and incorporates consultants in accordance with full time staff to get projects done.
good,"Great workplace with smart productive people. Everyone is pushing themselves to be better and get to the next level. Your manager can make or break you, if they're in your corner then you can be successful."
good,"Great place to work.  Fast paced, high energy, cutting edge technology company.  Excellent benefits package.  Leadership is focused on developing top talent."
good,Technology-based learned a lot about banking tech. Fun workplace culture and the most enjoyable part of the job was working with a team of digital designers.
good,Good place to work. Just went through large layoff with their entire mortgage division. Otherwise I really enjoyed working there. I was only there a year and would have liked opportunity for more.
good,Expect to work.  My typical day was spent answering between 50 and 120 call a day.  Management was ok although I was not a fan of my own Manager.  Shift bids may place with you a good manager or not.   The hardest part of this job is deadling with angry customers basically all day.  The time off the phones are great and usually a gift when it happens.
good,"over all it is good.. I supported a large client group in a fast paced environment within the employee relations area. My years in role taught me how to prioritize, work collaboratively and learn constantly."
good,I really like working at capital one to be honest. it is a fun environment with the right people and management. the one thing i did not like it sometimes there is favoritism with employees. the reason i wanted to leave is to pursue something else. they have been getting rid of a bunch of people due to the movement they are heading to as a company.
good,"The hiring process is rigorous but the quality of talent is really high once you get in.  Very competitive environment given the performance management system is performance based and you are stack ranked against your peers.  Leadership changes frequently so you need to invest in building relationships across job families, divisions and levels."
good,"Capital One is a great place to work.  There are many opportunities for lateral movement and also some upward trajectory if you are in the right business at the right time.  The people who work here are highly intelligent and sought after.  Very collaborative environment with great space planning and technology capabilities to enhance productivity.  Moves much faster than a typical bank.  Talent management is rigorous and has error tendencies, but overall I would highly recommend it for anyone who loves a fast paced, competitive environment."
good,"My experience with Capital One was that it was a positive place to work, and I feel it helped me advance my career.  I worked for a great manager, who encouraged me to challenge myself, and promoted me."
good,My position at Capital One consisted of a great deal of data analysis that was comfortably broken up into a workable time line for project completion. The work place allowed for many perks and worker activity benefits.
good,"There is a lot of flexibility in terms of work hours till the time one is ready to complete the assigned task on time"
good,I like capital one because of the professionalism they show cased. The location I was at did not have a permanent manager so it got to be a little chaotic at times
good,"Flexibility WFH"
good,Seems like I have to type my opinion with a minimum of one hundred fifty characters. This is intended to only meet the guidelines of my review. Have a great day!
good,"Great place to work. Great atmosphere. People are friendly. Pay is good as well as great benefits. Employee stock purchase plan, Employer contributes to RRSP."
good,The company has made a significant shift over the past several years moving from a traditional bank culture to one that competes directly with the likes of many Silicon Valley bean-bag and lava lamp cultures. It is heavily entrenched in software development and thrives on near bleeding edge technology adoption to give it's business a competitive edge over its competition.
good,"Its a great place to work, just make sure you are always ahead of the curve in technologies. Always bring new ideas and be forefront in everything. If there is an opportunity take it and it is ok if you fail as long as you show initiative."
good,Great company to work for.  Energized and fast-paced.  Overall management is young and very competitive.  Overall culture is collaborative.  Decision making is consensus-driven.
good,"a typical day at work was fairly laid back depending on your location I've learned so much about the requirements of banking as far as check cashing policy, the rules governing policies, FDIC limits and just cash handling experiences from a day to day work day"
good,"Loved the company culture and the room for advancement. Lots of employee perks, and flexible hours. The ability to receive a monthly bonus was a great motivator."
good,a day at capital one come in sign in and statrt making dials and if you were not dialing a customer would probably be calling you find out why customer is late  see what program or tools that best fits the situation or best helps the customer get current sooner
good,Working at Capital One was an interesting experience.  While the department I worked in wasn't the most exciting the work often was exciting and allowed me to be creative.  My managers were great.  It was a familial environment.  The hardest part of the job was the down time.  I don't like to twiddle my thumbs so it was difficult to focus when there were lulls.  I mostly enjoyed planning our team events.
good,"Went though a lot of  change   with  mergers and  and shifting roles."
good,"As long as your not a temp or contract worker capital one is a great place to work, But if your a temp no chance to flip as the requirements are something even perms cant meet"
good,It's okay if banking is what you want to do as a career. The first and the third is the busiest time each month especially if the first and the third fall after or before a major holiday.
good,The  Benefits are the best I have seen across the financial world. I am now looking for a job due to lay offs and the PTO and all the benefits Capital One offer is hard to find.
good,"The good stuff: "
good,You're stuck in your schedule for over a year. There is no changing it unless extreme circumstances and it'll be temporary for 60 days. When you have children then its very difficult especially when certain circumstances may require you to be off for your children. It would be nice to rotate shifts
good,"The company as a whole is great! But your job is not secured! IF you are a contract and work is reduced you are at risk losing your position! "
good,Capital One is a great place for work-life balance. The design team and stakeholders I am working with are driven to improve the experience for customers and employees.
good,Capital One has a very friendly and inclusive work environment.  The training was very comprehensive and the management was most helpful.  They really bolster your self esteem and will work with you if you have problems acclimatizing to the business.
good,productive with fun things to do there is a need for better training processes and there should always be consistance across the company and departments
good,"Great benefits. Lots of travel opportunity. Great for some (not for everyone)— especially for people avoiding their families or trying to have an affair."
good,My typical day at work was mostly self directed with mostly quarterly deadlines. I learned more about the substance of the work than from the work environment. Overall senior management was strong. Many middle managers were inconsistent in their management styles and expectations. Good workplace culture. Worst parts of the day were the far too numerous meetings. I made some good friends
good,Loved working here. I learnt some scripting and python. Manager is good. work culture is friendly. requirements gathering is tough part here.changing the sql queris is  most enjoyable here
good,it has a great culture. I have worked here for over 7 years. I do believe I deserve better pay but I love company and the work like balance. I would recommend anyone to this company.
good,Every day was different in a good and interesting way. The position I was in did not allow for a ton fo flexibility or advancement. A good position for what it was.
good,"Capital One is looking to expand into the digital market.  This is great for IT and Software Developers.  Not so great for business and finance professionals.  It does have great benefits, bit moving up through the company is hard."
good,"Great work life balance. Company provides training, campus atmosphere is great.  Would recommend the company for highly skilled employees and technology buffs."
good,One of the best corporate companies I have ever worked for.I keep looking to see if they are going to have other job openings. They trained me to assist customers with online support with Capital One Investing website. But I also learned about the stock market and creating an investment portfolio. I was able to transfer my 401K plan from my previous employer and create a new investment portfolio for my retirement. Not too many will show how to do that. Capital One was a great place to work at.
good,"Work peers are great fun work environment. Learn collaboration skills, team working environment, independent work and thinking quickly on your feet...."
good,"Been at the bank for 5 years, have been able to move across lines of business to learn new skills and round out my marketing expertise. Though, it's competitive, there is definitely a ""Capital One"" way, and if you can navigate the environment and make alliances, you're golden."
good,Capital One has been a great place to work and supported my personal and professional aspirations for a number of years.  It is highly competitive and full of extremely bright individuals.
good,"Capital One is a great place to embrace diversity at the workplace.  "
good,Capital One provides an avenue for all types of job seekers.  My current role enabled me to work with a small team and develop skills to detect and prevent fraudulent banking transactions.  Capital One is competitive and advancement can be sudden or not at all.  Staying focused and positive is a must to succeed at Capital One.
good,"The company job culture is phenomenal. The hours are not good for families. Due to certain schedules and shifts, you may not have much time for family if you are family oriented. Management could use more training. A lot of them are highly ambitious but do not do their jobs properly nor do they care much about their team. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the customers and not feeling that you have the knowledge to handle some of the calls. You may be a digital agent but you are expected to know some customer service job tasks even though you were not trained in customer service."
good,"Good place to work        "
good,Capital One creates an environment where it can be a fantastic place to work. The biggest issue is you have a new boss every few months. Each one has a different view of what you need to get promoted. When you get that great one you only enjoy for a few months. When you get a bad one things get go from great to horrible in a week.
good,Fast paced environment. Management/colleagues are very friendly and create a positive work atmosphere. Acquired valuable analytical skills. Receive recognition for hard work.
good,Capital One was big on work life balance. Pay was not as competitive as I would have thought. Growth opportunities were few and far in between. It was a good experience and I appreciate the opportunity I had while I was there.
good,"Despite of the graveyard shifts in this BPO account I am satisfied with the salary and benefits given especially, medical benefits with free medicines and vitamins."
good,The work day at Capital One is very fast paced and I enjoy working there. We attend briefing at the start of shift to review any updated information that may be trending I have learned how to lead teams and develop new projects.
good,"Capital One acquired our company in 2014. The acquisition came with great benefits and pay opportunities but two years in, they decided to relocate our office from Seattle to Plano, Texas. "
good,I really enjoyed working for Capital One we went through a lot of transition with the mergers of new Banks but it was handled well. I left the company only do two a conflict with my spouse's work schedule which did not allow either of us to be available for our children after school.
good,"Capital One has great paid time off policy but it is also offset with the amount of work and the pace of the day-to-day activities. They do not have advancement opportunities and management does not look after the employees, are only results-driven instead of people-driven."
good,"Always tried to find the best products for our customers.  Training was good, kept up with certifications.  Coaching was extensive and excessive.  Hours, pay and benefits were comparable to other financial institutions"
good,Capital One seeks to be at the forefront of technology in the sectors it participates in. Culture and associate development and emphasized on a regular basis. Being available and connected to work at all times is perceived as a way to demonstrate commitment.
good,Love working at capital one. Coworkers are great and always willing to help. Most managers are flexible and understanding. I would definitely recommend Capital one as a great place to work.
good,"Capital One is a diverse workplace with ample opportunities to grow professionally in analytic fields, such as risk management and statistics.  The leadership is generally inspiring and challenging."
good,Good place to work with good pay and benefits.  Demanding work environment with some throw away work.  Must be able to process a lot of change at any point in time.
good,"A great company to work for. The Amount of learning and cutting edge technologies used ,will hone the skills at any level. Great work-life balance and competitive compensation is a sweetner"
good,"This is a good company to work for. If you need a flexible schedule, this is the place to work. Cafeteria onsite, good team building skills, open to hear your thoughts on new process."
good,I very much enjoyed working at Capital One. It was a casual atmosphere but very professional at the same time.  I really thought that I would retire from Capital One.  I'd go back to work for them any time.
good,I worked in the auto refinance department and I loved every minute of it. If it paid a little more I'd probably still be there but definitely a great work environment with great people
good,Capital One believes in helping customers and have demonstrated my time being there. They've recently changed their hours from 9am-6pm to 9am-5pm so their employees can have a work life balance.
good,"Capital One is a fantastic company, but make no mistake, it is a revolving door. Employment is tenuous at best, but coming with this comes a workplace with an extremely high standard and fantastic professional demeanor. The culture at Capital One is one of pride and principal based servicing, and if you feel like you've got what it takes to thrive in this competitive environment it is certainly a fantastic place to work."
good,Capital One Healthcare Financing was a well run organization with good management and strong talent from sales to marketing to finance and data mining.
good,"I like working at Capital One due to the great benefits they offer, Drs office, gym, cafe, to name a few.  I would like to promote within my department, however there are very few openings to do so.  I also would like to work in our fraud department as I have my Criminal Justice degree, however that department is in another location.  Unfortunately, I am unable to relocate.  I love the benefits at Capital One, however I am looking for something more challenging and that isn't available at this time."
good,"overall the company supports their associates and help them find ways to balance their personal and work lives.  They offer a lot of flexibility and have an awesome campus filled with perks.  There are some minor cultural issues which greatly vary based on where you specifically work but can make it difficult to get work done, advance or develop personally."
good,"I have truly enjoyed my time at Capital One, mostly because I've had good people to work with and the benefits. But with most jobs and probably a lot more than other companies there's always a feeling that your department or group is on the edge of being cut; and no department is immune."
good,"Capital One is a great place to work, they care about their associates, Management takes the time to sit down with associates and listen.  Capital One has great benefits including PTO within your first year and medical benefits."
good,Capital One is a great company to work for because of the workplace culture and great benefits.   Employees are recognized and awarded for doing excellent work.
good,"Capital one is a great place to work, but very hard to move up or even laterally in the company. Once you are working in a position you have to stick with it and take a multitude of workshops online for  advancement, many of them seem useless and the workshop structure is confusing. To many workshop videos with no direction from management on what steps to take. "
good,"I had a very good time working at Capital One Bank. working at the call center taught me very much about customer service. As a representative you get to help people from all different parts of the country, but you never know how you can make an impact on someone's life working at a call center."
good,I love this company the benefits are amazing and so are most of the people. BUT if you get stuck with an incompetent manager there is little that can be done to make your forced year with them better. Senior leadership is not intune enough to get rid of dead weight people
good,"This company has amazing benefits and that is by far the best part of it. Some managers are very angry and take it out on their associates. The managers here are more worried about numbers and being number one than their associates well being. Not all managers there are like that, some are great and will do anything for you. You do have to be ok with basically harassing people to work here."
good,"Management was high energy and very accessible. Worked in a small team structure divided by regions serviced.  Competitive environment with a focus on team building, and individual accomplishment.  Hardest part of the job was managing a growing pipeline at a quick pace, while also reaching team goals set by corporate. Workplace culture was light and high spirited, and encouraged developing relationships among coworkers that crossed job lines."
good,Bangalore location has lot of politics and your growth depends on your immediate manager.The only advantage is flexible timings
good,"•	Received 60+ calls from customers, employers, and auto dealerships verifying Credit Bureau information and auto contracts"
good,Its Good company to work. Having very dynamic and agile environment and everyday is new learning. Learn AWS as a upcoming hot skills. Its Learning hub for people who want to do some thing innovative.
good,Daily intake of customer calls and being a problem solver and solution finder for customers issues. The management team was always available to help and assist with questions. The team oriented culture made it an exciting place to work and thrive. Hardest part of the job was not being able to solve every customer's issue or solve their problem within a certain timeframe. the most enjoyable part of the job was knowing the positive impact I had on the customers that called and I was able to use my customer service skills.
good,"Great company to work for."
good,Capital One treats its customers and employees very well.  Overall its a great place to work.  I would recommend Capital One to individuals just out of college.
good,"good place to work, always a group of fun loving colleagues and a management team that is ready to assist you in any way to achieve your goals. A very diverse culture."
good,"Productive, critical thinking  to solve issues. Team work environment, management encourage growth but no direct path. Compensation is a difficult aspect. Enjoyable atmosphere"
good,Working at Capital One was a fun experience. You get to help and educate customers on banking and how easy it can be. Staff was always great and friendly.
good,"Good work environment, enjoyed investigating cases. Not too fond of management. Great place for growth and advancement opportunities. The schedules aren't that great-no shift bids. Generous PTO available."
good,A company with a honest mission statement and great core values.  There are bad apples in every bunch but for the most part great place to work.  Great benefits and great co workers. Lots of room to move all around the company.
good,There is plenty of room for advancement and good healthcare and retirement benefits; although be prepared to work! I worked in a call center where you definitely have to work your hours with little downtime.
good,While the compensation is up to par for today standards their is a lack of room for growth within the company. Work life balance is good and the overall moral of the employees is high.
good,"A typical day is fun, diversed, and quite busy if you are in the right area. There is never a dull moment when problem solving and working to find the right solution. Collaboration amongst the employees is something you will always see at Capital One."
good,Some of the best team mats I have ever worked with in my career.  They have a great set of values and mission - just some departments and managers do not follow them.
good,"Good company to work for, would be happy to boomerang back in the right situation.  There are frequent reorgs and change is constant."
good,Great training and support from district leadership.  Every opportunity was given to try things out to increase business.  Weekly communication between branches/peers resulted in great level of camaraderie.
good,Best Call Center experience I had ever had.  If my department did not downsize I would still be working there.  The pay could be better.
good,Good company. great benefits. management can be great depending on who it is. high call volume at times and can be stressful. work at home positions which are nice too.
good,"Have learned agile and other software models and many other things in terms of technologies like .net , node and angular which i learnt recently. The most enjoyable part is the team which is worked with and the hardest part"
good,"I enjoy working with capital one bank, all the staff and management was great.great team work ,,customer come first .paid vocation, the only thing was, I had to drive a long way to work."
good,"here a very good tip:"
good,Working environment has changed since last two years. Bank is converting branches in to satellite branches with only ATMs and one banker with no teller access.
good,Capital One have great team work. Capital One have what they call Fun Day every quarter which allow the team to come together and enjoy a have day of work.
good,"Fast paced company.  Excellent training opportunities for career advancement.  Lots of communication, great team support from top down, Realistic Company Values.  Work hard, play hard company culture."
good,Le travail est bon. L'environement aussi par contre il y a toujours place à l'amélioration.
good,"A typical day working at Capital One is assisting customers with their credit card inquiries, whether it was about a charge on their card that they didn't know, or making changes to their account, making payments, or just any questions that they may have regarding their account. The hardest part of the job was not being able to help people that needed an extension to help with hardships. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking with people all over the United States."
good,"I absolutely love this company! I have learned and developed immensely over the past 2- short years. Remaining grateful and humble for the various opportunities I also remain understanding to the fact that every company poses opportunities and room for improvement. My department is a smaller department that is currently in transition. Although transitions can be difficult to overcome, the culture evolves as we move forward. My peers/agents come to work as if they have no end date, we  continue to do the right thing for our consumers and motivate one another to strive for greatness."
good,"Great People, Great Ambition, Needs to give change time to settle before making more"
good,"I had many opportunities at Capital One, it was a very enjoyable time working for the company and I met an awful lot of people which I learned something from each of them, some our still my friends today. They had excellent benefits which included incentives for staying healthy"
good,Valiant effort of management to hear the voice of the associates clamor for growth and development. Upper management is always willing and able to take action to help improve their associates motivation to keep the customer happy.
good,"Capital One is quite a decent company to work with. However, the working paces is not as fast as technology firms. You need to take control of your professional development."
good,Capital One is a great place to work. They foster a culture that is second to none. They also provide great benefits and services to their employees.
good,Capital One is a great place to work and it has amazing benefits and work life balance.  Flexible work hours and you have the ability to work from home.
good,"Capital One is an extremely energetic company that bases is success off its devoted employees. They put the employees needs first, which in turn is a direct reflection on the customer. Lots of energetic people always around to keep you motivated."
good,"Capital One promoted a fun work environment. The company assisted employees with learning new skills and taking on additional responsibilities. "
good,Great learning opportunity. Good Co-workers. Exceptional work life balance and flexibility. Good benefits. Often had free lunch at least once or twice a month.
good,"With any job there is tension that arises from customers or out of balance in your cash drawer, but with a talented manager to help smooth things out in his/her opinion or knowledge goes without a hitch. On a daily basis you are challenged with customers who just want simple guidance or fast and easy service to access their accounts with out any hassle. I have learned over the years that as a consumer and an employee to be acknowledge is key to making everyone happy in the end. The co-workers should always help each other out in a civil manner not delegate on time limits of how much a person knows. The most difficult situation I have came across is having an irate person blame you for their mistake. My most enjoyable part of being a teller was knowing that at the end of my day, I helped someone gain knowledge of how banking works and how much more they can accomplish at saving or investing."
good,"COAF is a really fun place to work, management is helpful and I did not experience many overly stressful days working for the company. I worked as a operational employee in the change in terms department where we managed accounts in Bankruptcy, Hardship, SCRA statuses, etc. I learned a lot and gained a great deal of operational experience in 3 years working for the company. Co-workers are great, the gym is awesome and we had so many fun company activities. The only time the job got somewhat stressful was at the end of the months where we had to finish our accounts because of credit-reporting concerns, those were the only times we really heard from upper management, but all in all once you have the job down and build your own little system that works for you then you can be really successful. The only thing is the position was hourly and not real good pay, if it was I would no doubt still be with the company."
good,Looked forward to going to work each day as no two days were the same.  Full support from management to make critical decisions regarding incident reporting.
good,"As a manager, I loved working with my team, mentoring,  development, 10/10's, performance management and supporting.associate engagement.   "
good,"A typical day at work would have me reviewing accounts for potential fraud.  As needed, I would contact customers to complete fraud reports.  Working in this particular field has helped fine tune my attention to detail.  I also used great customer service skills to assist frustrated and scared customers.  My management was a great resource for me.  They were able to help identify skills in me that I had not noticed.  This afforded me many opportunities to participate in special projects.  I enjoyed my co-workers the most.  I worked with a great group of individuals.  They offered divers perspectives for me to consider in my job and personal life.  The hardest part of my job was trying to keep up with different fraud trends, which changed almost daily,  The most enjoyable part of my job was gaining the experience and knowledge that it offered."
good,Great company with great people!  My only criticism was the frequent change of managers.  I resigned to care for my mother who became terminally ill.
good,"i had worked with different people with different dept. Worked in Accounting, GL & Loan dept. All over it was great exp. Co-workers were very supportive. Learned a lot during my working there. Management were good. Our team of people were all cooperative. very helpful to all."
good,Good life and work balance great coworkers fun place to work with great benefits learned great team work and how to calm down the most difficult customers
good,"Great place to work, but hard to advance. The goals are extremelly high and very difficult to achieve."
good,I loved working for this company. You have to truly take ownership of your career. The leadership could be better but the company is always evolving! The CEO is down to earth and I would HIGHLY reccomend this company to anyone!
good,The amenities here are great! I love the variety of food choices.  Getting coffee at Starbucks is very convenient.  People really want to help you grow and be successful.  A collaborative atmosphere that permeates throughout the organization.
good,"I worked at a call center.  If you weren't on a call and had no other responsibilities, it was okay to study on the job.  They even helped to pay for tuition!"
good,horrible management - they had an agenda in this department and really did not provide what was needed to succeed but tried hard to get people to leave.  The job itself is very simple if you can recognize patterns.
good,"Great company with great people, very energetic staffing groups. Lots of learning opportunity, fast paced. The hardest part of the job is to get promotions."
good,"you have a lot of tools to do you job."
good,"If you like a very challenging, fast paced, and dynamic environment then this is the place for you. The culture and the people are the best part."
good,"I worked for Capital On 360, formally ING Direct for 13 years and 8 months. Constantly learning and proud to be a part of the brand. The company provided wonderful benefits such as vacation and family time, and year-end bonus. The culture was positive and family oriented and a great place to work."
good,Capital One has great aspirations and therefore requires a culture of great talent and innovation.  It has been a fun and educational place to work as a contingent employee.
good,"I've been with the company for 8 months and feel like I've hit my ceiling already.  Good co-workers, some managers lacking, good leadership overall."
good,"Love my co workers, and managers. Also love the work life balance. Not too fond of the job security though, and there isn't a lot of room for advancement, unless you are located at the headquarters in VA. Also the fact that they are shutting down the Portland Oregon site and laying off 900 people doesn't help matters."
good,Ive had a great last 3 years working here at Capital One. They have however decided to close the Sioux Falls Site at the end of 2015 and i will need to find a new place to work. i am looking for something that can utilize the skills i have learned in my last 12 years working in the customer service/collections/sales/Office data entry field.
good,"The company is  a good company to work for. The benefits are not that great. There were leadership courses available to take. The back office is a great help, There is always support."
good,I was generally inputting data that the new systems weren't able to handle automatically. The work was a bit monotonous but it had some interesting aspects.
good,The best part about this job was the food. I loved the fact that they always tried to keep employees engaged. Work is tough but you play and play hard.
good,"The team were very friendly and willing to support my development and training."
good,"Typical day at work was always productive. I absolutely loved my team, my management and my customers. Not a day went by that I didn't love going into work!"
good,"there could be better accommodations for working moms, benefits are great and lots of paid time off required to work one weekend day which is a downside"
good,"Not everyone is always on the same Page... Lots of different information gets mixed up and delivered incorrectly so that can cause some issues.  Also, some employees are very immature. But overall, not such a bad job if you don't have a lot going on at home. Great benefits!  Just come here and do what you have to do... don't get caught up in the Drama!"
good,Capital One is a great place to work! It's a work-hard/play-hard environment that promotes work/life balance and focuses their efforts on associate engagement.
good,"Provide project support for various HR initiatives and ad hoc projects as needed "
good,"I loved being a Bank Teller and loved working at Capital One.  I would be bank teller again in a heartbeat. I learned how to communicate with people and handle money professionally. My co-workers were amazing and i have made a few life long friends. The hardest part of my job was trying to get referrals which means, getting a customer to sit down with a banker to see if there were any further products or needs we could offer them. The most enjoyable part of my job was making connections with my customers and learning there names and being able to greet them knowing who they were/are."
good,"At Capital One, the possibilities are endless. The skills and competencies may allow you to pursue a career path in a particular field or challenge yourself to grow in new areas as they push forward in the industry with innovative ideas."
good,"Work 7-3:30, handle all aspects of onboarding, offboarding new associates so I get ot meet all new associates, friendly co-workers.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with unhappy people (every dept. has one or 2).  Saddest part--being deployed to a new dept and leaving all my freidns and co-workers behind."
good,"The culture at Capital One is amazing. Every manager I have come in contact with has an open door policy. All levels of management are supportive, they stay in constant communication with all employees.I love working for Capital One because they are constantly looking for ways to improve by requesting feedback from not only our customers but from all employees."
good,"You have to be eager at Capital One and a go getter.  As a banker you are customer facing 100% of the time so customer service is important as well as product knowledge.  You must be able to identify customer needs and cross sell.  Incentives change, they listen to the employee about what they want and don't want.  Benefits package good."
good,"Company treated employees with respect and dignity and received the same in return,  All in all a great place to work in an extremely nice community.  The staff was extremely cohesive and accomplished all goals, usually as requested by upper management within a determined time frame.  Unfortunately due to the economy at the time back in 2007 this company had decided to relocate from Orange County to an out of California location in the southwest part of the USA or I may have still been here.  The easiest part of the job was getting along with staff, and a typical day would entail solving complex customer issues on a strictly inbound call basis, where you would need to research and handle about 50-80 calls per an 8 hour shift.  The hardest part of the job was the research to find certain items that customers dd not know.  The most enjoyable part was the freedom that management allowed to get the job done right the first time.  I learned about credit calls, resolving disputes and how to research within the auto financing industry."
good,Overall Capital One is a great place to work . The work can be challenging and you are rewarded for doing a good job. The company is going through a few culture changes related to acquisitions and there can be a large difference between the culture of LOBs
good,Company provides many opportunities across the entire enterprise. The culture is unique in that it provides employees many environmental advantages and it's performance management process is very competitive.
good,"A fairly young bank who is inspired of technology, sales driven work environment, and customer focused.  A great company to start as your first banking job."
good,"The day would start 30 minutes early. I would open my computer and go over the communication sent to see if there was information I needed to pass on to my team. Or training that needed to be scheduled that day. If new procedures came out that day I would schedule a meeting with the team and get the material needed for the training. We would run contests weekly and I would keep the team up on who was ahead and get them motivated. I would have supervisor calls during the day. Attend meeting with my peers. I would listen to calls and coach 5 associates per day. Best part of the day is working with my team. Listening to calls and coaching. The hardest part of the day is when we would be called to meeting and I had to rescheduled the coaching for my team. Working for this company I learned to multi task, be organized, flexible. I enjoyed the fast pace."
good,"This is where i started my journey . learned a lot of things ,  Team was helpful , good leadership. I was working on this project , development just started on it , need to work a lot , nevertheless i enjoyed working there."
good,"Work culture is not micro managed but yet productive at the same time. Beautiful campus with 7 buildings including a conference cetner, gym with basketball court and on site doctor."
good,"Vacation is good, but depending on your department, getting time off can be competitive. Many great long time managers. Forward thinking company, cares about associate development."
good,Good platform to learn new things as a fresher as well as a developer. Individually handling the projects.
good,"A typical work day consisted of responding to about 120 plus emails. Attorney’s calling to discuss potential suits and possible remediation, Meetings with department heads. I've learned I can do anything given the opportunity. Management trusts my opinion and knowledge, Sr. Management and V.P.s value my multi-departmental knowledge and values my ability to map out processes to help eliminate waste. My Co-workers are a combination of many personalities from many different back grounds I've taken the time to try and understand them all. The hardest part of my Job is, knowing when to say enough for today, let’s start fresh tomorrow. The Most enjoyable part is the people."
good,I love the people I work with. It does make it easy to work with people who are supportive and have positive perspective of life.
good,"Productive fun place to work"
good,Very people oriented and focused on helping the customer. Smart leaders with a strong vision for the future. The hardest part of the job is working through the red tape of a financial services company and meetings some of the high expectations.
good,"Its a great company. Great benefits and a fun place to work at , depending which branch I guess"
good,Enjoyed every minute working and team building over the course of 13 years.
good,Capital One was a great place to work. I had nothing but a positive experiences working there. The site I was at closed or I would still be working there.
good,Capital One has been a good company.  A lot has changed in 14 years.  It is very fastpaced and always changing.  I have learned that flexibility is a must.  I have worked with some great people and I have worked with some very different people.  The hardest part about the job is that your location may change that's more of an adjustment then the work changing.  I enjoy learning and the diversity we have.  I enjoy the flexibility of my department witht the work from home options that are limited but  available.
good,productive place to work and fast learning system they have
good,"Dedicated to opening up new business and bank accounts. Known for filing and processing transaction paperwork ( Investigated claims, statement recreation, stop payment, schedule transfers, loan payments credit cards inquiries, Insurance payment verification , lines of credit etc..) with extreme accuracy and providing follow-up with customers. Proved ability to identify customer needs and match them to the best banking products and services. Assisted customers with payroll ACH options. Capital One Bank offer and sell financial products and services to customer. I love interacting with customers to ascertain needs. Transferring, filing claims, handling loans, faxing paper work and manage various customer request were my primary duties. Demonstrated ongoing commitment and a tireless  work ethic complimented by knowledge of credit/fraud-related situation.Also very advanced with Microsoft word, power point, excel and etc."
good,"The jobs required of me were rather simple and I mastered them quickly, therefore I was offered a permanent position. The process to become permanent was a little silly though because one questionnaire kept me from getting the position even though my manager knew I was a great fit."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was speaking to the customers, as they had many stories to share."
good,Career advancement limited and salary reviews and. grades could be better.  Good benefits package.
good,Gain experience dad to day experience varies on the clients. Management was helpful and informative there was no hard point with my job I enjoyed working with and helping others.
good,"Very laid back atmosphere. Always changing, always different."
good,"Work/life balance is great, as is the pay. Benefits cannot be beat. "
good,Working for Capital One Bank is a fast paced customer focused experience with high expectations and accountability of all associates. I've learned so many things while working at Capital One but I think the most impactful knowledge is that by living the values of the company I have changed countless families enjoy a more financially secure future. There are many long tenured associates at Capital One and I believe it is because the mission is a common one and there is a strong sense of community effort.
good,I work as a quality assurance agent that monitors the casework of the production workers to ensure they are properly enrolling Military members into the military program.
good,"Collabera and Cap One are a good combination. Progressive and forward thinking."
good,Risk operations is  challenging.  there is a lot of work which needs to be accomplished.
good,"A typical day at work for me begins with an Instant message from me to all my co-workers wishing them a great productive day, then I start a ten hour shift of answering customers questions, concerns and complaints about their capital One card. The hardest part is not always being able to give the customer what they need, but the most enjoyable is always helping the customer to my fullest potential!"
good,A typical work day includes assisting representatives on the floor wit direct questions and system issues. I have learned to work with a smile. Direct customer contact was a easy duty but now that I am face to face with my customers. I would love to work towards managment with the company but it's not much advancement in leadership postions. I love my co workers they are the best part of the company. WE all come from different walks of life and we help each other get through the day. The hardest part of my job is feeling out the loop. Agents are considered frontline to the customers so since i'm not speaking directly to the customer it's a little diffcult adjusting to policy and procedure changes when that is not a daily job function for me anymore.
good,Great company to work for. Great benefits. Family-oriented company.
good,Great opportunities to work cross-functionally in strategy development and execution.  Flexible work arrangements such as telecommuting were a big plus.
good,"It is a great place as far as benefits go, pay is better than minimum wage but you hard held to very high metric standard. And management leaves a lot to be desired"
good,"My branch is fast paced, learned to be patient while working under stress."
good,"Capital One is a great place to work, the only downside is their attendance policy. Especially when being sick and having a doctors note. Other than that, it was a great place to work."
good,"It's a good company to work for, offers pretty good benefits. The salary and promotion process is not clear, which leaves room for favoritism. Most people are great to work with and that makes the day much more pleasant. The job becomes a bit challenging when management makes decisions without the full understanding of system capabilities, which means that a lot of times things cannot be automated and they have to be done manually, which takes more time and leaves room for errors. The most enjoyable part of the job is when management takes the recommendations of the analysts who know what they are talking about."
good,"I typically placed outbound calls and took inbound calls in the late stage collections department, I learned keen negotiation skills and lots of problem solving resolutions.  I believe everyone was there to earn money to support their families not necessarily a passion.  I enjoyed helping the customers with their reasons for delinquencies and offering long term solutions to the debt they had incurred.  The most difficult part of the job was the pressure to perform in a call center environment with some very competitive people.  Although I don't fault them for anything."
good,"Flexible great place to work, fun environment, friendly people"
good,I loved the environment at Capital One.  I enjoyed working on a large variety of projects with a talented creative team.
good,"Capital One 360 retains many of the positive qualities of ING Direct. The priority remains a customer focus environment. The sales floor is still a high energy place. The model of a performance driven environment has not changed. And performance is still rewarded. While Capital One has imposed some of their culture throughout the company, The culture of ING Direct has been smoothly transitioned."
good,"My typical day at work is review my customers accounts and see if any payments posted while i was away, call my customers and work out payment plans, deescalated calls when needed, had explained how this affects the credit. I learned to never say never. Managment was very helpful. The hardest part of the job was giving up when collecting, and the most enjoyable part of my job was the bonuses and making goals every month."
good,"I enjoyed the many benefits that Cap One afforded its employees. Working there allowed me to be the mom I need to be."
good,Great Company to work for. I have been able to meet great people and grow while here with the company. The PTO is great as well as the benefits that are offered. The hardest part of the job was the location. I live in Dallas and the location was off of a toll highway. The most enjoyable part of the job is the environment.
good,"A typical day is signing in on the computer, checking paper work for the previous day or week. Observing teller interactions with customers to ensure the highest level of customer service was provided. I've learned how to become a better supervisor and taught my staff new material that can be beneficial for there own career development. The hardest part of my job is when its slow and there is not much to do because the day can drag on. The most enjoyable part is the staff I work with because we are all from different cultures so we all bring a little something to the table."
good,Capital One in Nottingham is a great place to workwith friendly staff and good benefits. Unfortunately i was only employed there on a temporary contract basis.
good,"Lots of work locaiton flexibility - telecommuting, work form home, flex hours.  Work life balance is taken very seriously."
good,"A great place to work for working moms.  The flexibiltiy to work from home is terrific. I've had many great experiences and have opened up to new things.  I've meet people I know I will be friends with for a lifetime.  Management can be hit or miss. Having a manager who genuine about your growth in the company is great, but having one who only cares about their growth can hinder you from being the best you can be."
good,"Taking calls from 85% heavy spend type customers and deal with their rewards issues. Most calls are recorded and 5 a month listened to and graded. Minimum score for passing is 85%, monthly average 85%.  If certain things are not touched on, score comes down leading to possible failure. Considering the way how certain calls my flow with the particular customer, not everything can always be hit on. Even if customer grades agent highly on their emailed survey, that isn't taken into consideration; only calls listened to by management are. It was enjoyable working with most of the other agents as were the team outings and other events when we got to mingle (especially as someone that worked from home)."
good,Friends made on the job were great and management was good as well.
good,Great place to work... Great staff to work with...........................
good,"Capital One offers opportunities to grow within the company; constantly changing and creating new challenges; managers, staff, and co-workers are friendly and willing to help"
good,"Productive workplace with table tennis."
good,"A typical day at work was to come five to fifteen minutes before your scheduled shift, greet your co-workers, ask how the day has been progressing with security or transactions on PC teller, Unlock your teller drawer, set up teller station, sign into PC teller and other banking systems, interactions with customer majority of the day, processing transactions, counting out substantial amounts of money the majority of the day, taking a lunch always, take a fifteen minute break most days, sitting most of the day, balancing out teller window and locking up teller drawer. I learned how to navigate different banking systems, to ask the right questions to refer different products and services offered, banking policies/procedures, how to recognize certain actives regarding fraud, supervision of others, opening and closing procedures, etc. The management here seemed to be very condescending, ""matter of fact"" and dictatorial. The co-workers here were pleasant most times. The hardest part of this job was dealing with the attitudes of others. The most enjoyable part of this job was doing everything you can to assist your customers with the excellent financial services that you provide."
good,Very good work place with advancement. Great employees and managers. 
good,"My experience working at Capital One was extremely unique and exhilarating as we worked in an open space and Agile environment. While I originally thought this would be very distracting, this type of working environment facilitated cooperation and knowledge sharing which was invaluable to my role in communications."
good,"busy work day, helping customers and their needs. ive learned leadership and business alignment. i enjoy the flexiable work schedule and open options"
good,"A great company for working mothers, excellent benefits and bonus structure."
good,"A typical day would be to be at work own time, assist customers with their banking needs: checking, saving, cross selling product.....etc"
good,"After almost 8 years with Capital One I walk away with a BS-Accounting Degree they helped me pay for, outstanding consultative sells skills, and a ton of leadership and training experience. I've given Capital One my time and I've been compensated with a multitude of transferable credentials. I will not miss dressing up for ridiculous sprit days but will absolutely miss the relationships I've developed with me colleges."
good,"If you're motivated, technically-oriented, and eager for advancement, this job is for you. However, in order to do well you are expected to spend many hours on your work besides the standard 9-5."
good,"The hours are flexible and the work basic, but I had trouble getting as many hours as I wanted."
good,On a normal day it was a good place to work. The bad days were robberies.
good,"Very hands on job, learned to work in team enviroments, learning about banking systems."
good,"Answered inbound calls from high value service customers in call center environment who have requests to dispute charges to there account, APR or credit limit, or close their account. Provides customer service and uses consultative sales techniques to retain customers. Uses computer programs to view account specific information to use during the call, and also to document any changes to the customer's account, while contacting merchants to resolve issue."
good,Loved working with public but banking isn't what it used to be with added sales referrals required to meet.
good,"It is a great company to work for. At times there are some break downs when it comes to communication through out the company. Depends on the manager if they care about family values. Benifits are great, especially PTO and health care. If you are treated unfairly, there is a number to call and they dont take sides and will investigate the entire situation."
good,"A typical day at work is greeting customers, doing their bank transactions and looking for opportunities to refer customers to a customer service associate. I've learned to know my customers, their needs and how to keep them satisfied and happy while doing business with the bank. I consider my co-workers, management and myself a team. We work together to achieve our goals and get the job done at the end of the day. The part I most enjoy of my job is to interact with the customers and be able to provide excellent customer service and see how they come back smiling."
good,Typical day was to start working with loans that were in review for a modification HAMP (Home affordable modification program). This included working with traditional modifications that needed to be approved by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae also known as GSE loans. These were the loans that I would put more time and effort into due to the sensitivity of the loan being from an investor. In most cases I would be working with a representative from the investor who would give me either instruction on how to structure the modification and what was needed from the borrower to make sure that the traditional modification was not going to falter once the modification was approved. I also had the responsibility to perform 2nd looks or reviews on HAMP loans that were being denied and if I noticed that there was a mistake and a possible chance for the borrower to qualify for a HAMP then I would start the process of researching all aspects of the loan and recommend for a 2nd review to be made for HAMP.
good,Capital One is a great place to work for. They are family & employee oriented and my direct team leads & manager have taken a vested interest in showing me as much as they possibly can to teach me in my 4 years here.
good,I tend to get the assigned work done on time efficiently.
good,"My typical day at work consisted of overseeing the corporate wide Record Retention Program by assisting all levels of bank staff with the storage and/or retrieval of record retention boxes as well as providing instruction in using The Jordan Lawrence Enforcement Solutions website. Additionally, I interacted with vendors and co-workers by arranging for the delivery and/or pick up of Innowave water filtration systems, Keurig coffee systems and beverage supplies, and shredding bins. I also maintained a department data base of all branches, including those scheduled to open and/or close, together with the various office equipment located at each site. Finally, I processed monthly vendor invoicing for the corporate beverage, shredding, and record retention programs which involved the resolution of any/all inaccuracies."
good,good place to work if your like to cook .you prepare food for corporate workers everyday
good,"My typical day included ensuring timely completion and sorting of incoming documents from every bank branch office. Additionally, I had to analyze the documents received as well as staffing to ensure service level agreements were met."
good,"A typical day at capital one starts off with breakfast and the phone ringing non-stop from clients who want balances, transfers, and account questions at 8am, but since capital one are very strong about customer service and sales we answer all questions to the best of our ability. I have learned how to open and close accounts, put holds on accounts, help clients apply for personal loans, and I've also learned how to be more great in customer service. The management team that i work with are good and they are sympathetic towards your needs and help you to the best of their knowledge; and my co-workers are productive such as I, and we try to work as a team but every group of people with different personalities have differences. We manage to control our differences and get the job done; different work ethics and skills. The hardest part of my job are really none because I've learned how to transform my weakness into strengths and i always put my best foot forward. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with people, I'm very extroverted."
good,Woring with Capgemini is very nice.I have gained more knowlege in cards/Banking domain.Improved business Analysis skills.
good,Capital One is a great company to work for.They have great values and are very flexible.
good,Typical day at work - everyday is a challenge because anything can happen in a network environment.
good,The company as a whole is a good place to work. Some divisions have more room for improvement than others.
good,"The people are good to work with, they are helpful and friendly.Great place to work."
good,When you did you work and did it good you got incentive bonuses which could range from 20 to 500 dollars extra to your check. We had pot lucks for the best team. The customers could stress you out but the work enviornment would over shadow that.
good,"They no longer are in San Antonio, TX   Overall, great company to be part of. "
good,"Its a good company to grow.Great work environment company always provided an upbeat atmosphere that was about growing and learning. "
good,"My time in Capital One was filled with learning experience, from a beginner to an experienced professional. Met competitive professionals who helped to hone my skills and become better at facing difficult situations"
good,"There are many different avenues there. If you don't like where you start, you can wind up anywhere. My experience there was excellent. I had hoped to stay on but they were downsizing at the time."
good,Overall its a good company to work for. No complaints. Management is awesome and the benefits are even better. I was in customer service and work itself was stress-free.
good,"Capital One really understands work life balance and allows us to make sure we're able to take care of our family first when needed. With the technology and tools we're provided, we can do our jobs on the go."
good,It's a great work culture and motivational. Nice environments and flexible work timing. Opportunity to learn lot of new things and roles would be a challenging one.
good,The benefits are good but the pay is low. Poor management in some departments. Not a lot of diversity in Management. Lower level position had the most diversity and high turnover.
good,Nice secure environment. Pay was low but you could get overtime. Loved my 7-3 schedule. Would go back if paid at least 20/hr then I wouldn't mind returning.
good,"Capital One is a great place to work for balance, decent comp, and innovative plans to be more tech forward.  They still struggle with an incredibly conservative compliance and legal group that will always be a massive source of friction for the type of advancements they claim to want to make. "
good,They recognize and respect their employees. If there is an issue the department head will take that manager and employee out to eat to get it resolved. It's like family.
good,"I enjoyed working here - they made their employees feel valued and not expendable as most places do. Relaxed environment, goal oriented, great people to work with."
good,"Want to work on your customer service skills this is the best place to do that. Once you find a great manger to work under, you will be set. The mangers make the job enjoyable"
good,Overall good place to work. I’ve experienced worse especially in banking. No longer competitive based so more goal oriented and customer care focused. Management good just very limited opportunities for upward mobility seen.
good,"Analytical research, light coding, collaboration across departments to design efficient strategies for growing markets for financial services products such as auto and home mortgage."
good,Gained invaluable experience working with various associates at Capital One from technological to soft skills. Training opportunities are great and every opinion is valued.
good,"I had a great overall experience working at Capital One, Like any company there are some poor experiences but would work there again in a heart beat in a role SR to previous role. I am no politician so it was a little tougher to get promoted internally. If it was not for such a jump in my career I would have stayed for the long haul."
good,"Great place to work over all love the benefit and allow me to manage myself. also allow PTO to be schedule whenever I needed it . "
good,I worked at Capital One as a Customer Service Representative. Management is there for you want to make sure succeed. Customers are not bad either of course you will have some who will try you but otherwise not bad. PTO is awesome you receive 160 hrs and you buy another 40 hrs that will put you at 200 hours
good,Its was a great job. The schedules were negotiable to a point. The money was great and there was almost always overtime available. Great tuition reimbursement programs.
good,Interview Testing was unreal.. The project I was one was micro management style and it really drove alot of professional away from the company.  The testing didnt make sense to me
good,The company culture focuses on providing the best solutions for customers to reduce their financial anxiety.  All products created are meant to achieve this goal as a result there is a high rate of Innovation and product releases are done every hour.
good,This is a great company doing good things and generaly speaking treating it people well.  the down-side is the forced ratings in the performance management system that forces many good hard-working associates to leave the company...
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with.  I was fortunate to be given multiple roles with increasing responsibility and skills.
good,Management style varies a lot across different managers and the team turnover is high. Lots of trainings and learning opportunities. Lots of team changes.
good,"A typical day starts with a stand up meeting. Management gives a lot of freedom to use new technologies if a person has time and willingness sky is the limit."
good,"It is not stressful at all to work at Capital One, they a great work balance with a workplace culture second to none.  The hardest of the job is to know how to work with certain managers and the best enjoyable of the job is when we get together as a group for training, meeting and party event."
good,"I have learned alot working for CapitalOne. The culture is amazing and there are alot of opportunities out there. It is not as easy as it sems to move up in the company, you will hear alot of nos before you hear a yes. The hardest part is working hard to meet all of of your stats to move up and still being stuck in your current role. I do love that the leadership tries to make it fun at times to help ease the stress of back to back calls."
good,"does give you very fair and equal opportunity for growth, promotion and to achieve your ""Someday"". The system and the rating procedure is very transparent and gives you full satisfaction"
good,Capital One is a great place to work. The culture is fun. The pay and benefits are great. The products solve clear needs. The problems your solving are compelling. But incessant reorganization leaves people feeling unstable.
good,Nice workplace with a lot of thought about employee welfare. The management is concerned about staff welfare and makes sure there are enough facilities and tries to balance job and extra curricular activities.
good,"Great benefits. "
good,"I enjoyed my time at Capital One.  the work was challenging, and the people were generally supportive.  I would recommend Capital One as an employer of choice."
good,"They mainly focus on assisting and building new employees careers however past employees tend to be left aside. Working there was great on terms of benefits, they had the best insurance program I have seen."
good,"Worked for almost 5 years. It is the best company I have ever worked for. Felt like I was being paid to learn. However, advancement is a somewhat artificial and feels like a popularity contest."
good,I enjoyed working for Capital One as a contract worker.  Employees and Management treated each other with respect. They had lots of fun of activites for theire employees. As contractors you cannot partake in their events
good,"Capital One is transitioning to digital I found that there wasn't much room for advancement, so I decided to leave. Good benefits and paid time off. If you want a job that'll pay you decently not bad."
good,Very good training for Customer Service. Competive environment some manager a bit toxic and do not take the time to follow policy because of competitiveness of bonusing.  Some wil do anything to bonus.
good,"Great place to work, nice pay, great benefits, and a good over all culture. Learned a lot groomed me into the person I am now. Capital One also has been very active in the community which I enjoyed a lot while there. Only downfall is that management is not always on the same page. Also advancement and promotion is often promoted but never really awarded."
good,"I felt like I was stagnant, and after the many departments lay off, I felt stuck with no room for growth and no one had answers for my questions as to whats going on with the company. Most people just say, I don't know. it was too unpredictable. one minute you have a job the next minute you may not. it was driving me crazy to know that anyone could be laid off at any moment."
good,"Capital One is a good company to work for.  Depending on the department you work in, there is great opportunity for growth and advancement.  Work/life balance is fair.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the people.  Everyone genuinely has an interest in seeing the company be great and are willing to collaborate and roll there sleeves up where necessary regardless of the position held."
good,High volume trouble shooting laptops and desktops software and hardware. Setup laptops for new contractors. Collaborate with our team as well other support teams for problem resolution.
good,Loved working for capital one and their benefits were amazing.  The leadership left something to be desired and there was very little career advancement opportunities.
good,"The typical day at work was spend in a call center environment answering as many as 75 calls in an 8 hour shift. The pace could be face paced with back to back calls."
good,"Plano Campus is awesome with all the amenities that one could imagine and need. The culture exceeded my expectations and if it was not for them exiting the mortgage space, I would still be there."
good,I liked capital one for the most part.  Management changed way to often though and they laid off my only friend along with all of the QA members 1 year into my 2 years there.
good,"I started on the phones and was able to move around for different opportunities while gaining a foundation in the banking world. The atmosphere is great, the people are friendly."
good,I did enjoy working at Capital One. I made friends and met a lot of good people. Capital One provided a type of company that really showed that it appreciates it's employee's. It provided a lot of different programs and opportunities if you knew the right people. I would recommend this company for anyone who wants to work for a really great company.
good,I worked for Capital One for 17 years and was happy there.  Capital One offered the maximum education that I needed to do my job.  I felt confident in my duties and appreciated their thorough training.
good,"My day at work used to be very exciting, productive, challenging and learn new things every day. Entire team was very understanding and "
good,"I enjoy my time at Capital One. The people are smart, driven, and genuinely caring. The work is also very interesting as well as challenging. It's a good place to work. "
good,Great training and opportunites to grow within the company. Capital one had many areas to choose from. They promote a team atmosphere with activities to boost moral and fun.
good,I learned a lot from my more experienced coworkers teaching different operations in order to learn more and become more advanced in the work place. It's a great work enviornment.
good,"Would recommend to work there but only as a temporary position but the growth potential is an illusion. You can work your way up but if you start as a person taking calls like I did, growth is harder. Skip being a customer support agent!"
good,The work environment is very inclusive and everyone is great. i learned alot of new skills that i will able to take along with me on my career path. This company is very transparent with all it benefits.
good,"A good place to work, but did not see the opportunities for advancement as it was perceived when I started with the company. I was able to learn more about bank operations, and better understanding of financial products. The benefits are competitive."
good,"Great company to work for but not in Lincoln, NE anymore.  After September, there are only 26 jobs that aren't ""call center phone representative"", no advancement in the local area."
good,I have enjoyed my working career  at Capital One. I would not have left had my position if it was not  for the downsizing. Great company and great place for work.
good,"It's a call center, so it gets busy and stressful. "
good,Capital one is a great place to work for. Especially like that we can work remotely when needed. I have great working hours with flexibility. I would definitely recommend Capital One for employment opportunities.
good,"Capital One is a great place to work. The management team is supportive. And it us a very creative workplace. It is a tech firm, that happens to be in the financial industry."
good,"Advancement opportunity exists, but it's not rampant. Decent place to work while in school due to positive work/life balance. Benefits are out of this world which balances out the below market pay scales. Advancement depends on whether you are liked and how you are perceived as opposed to how well you do your job."
good,"Traveled between NY, Richmond, and McLean. Was a Contractor working on the Salesforce rollout for Commercial Bank. The challenge was getting the clients (internal) to use and understand the new system and the capabilities."
good,"Capital One is an excellent place for graduates to work! They have excellent benefits and have many development opportunities. The biggest issue with Capital One is there can be confusion with how to do certain jobs. Sometimes people do not have the right answers and time is then wasted. The good outweighs the bad however, there are many things that could be improved. Each person's experience is different for sure."
good,"The part of Capital One that I worked in is a call center, which has a very different culture than non call center jobs in the company. Personally, I felt that being required to sit for almost the entire 40 working hrs had a very negative impact on my health. Going to the restroom during shift or walking around is discouraged because that takes away from productive time on the phone. My location provides a lot of benefits such as an on site cafeteria, gym, and doctor's office, but they all have very limited hours and all have their own drawbacks as well. The cafeteria food has almost always made me sick, but many of my colleagues loved it. The gym is not open for evening or weekend hrs (and it's not free- this service still cost $) and the dr office didn't have consistent staff. Another big topic for me is having sick days when needed. Capital One uses the PTO system where you are given 120 hrs at the start of the year but there is no separation between sick days and vacation days. Additionally, if you need to use unplanned PTO there are only 32 hrs alloted for a rolling calendar year. So unless you are lucky enough to be sick only when there's same day PTO available in your line of business and to never be sick for more than one or two days at a time then you may have an issue. There is some opportunity to move up and around within the company, but it's less about the job you do and more about who you know to vouch for you."
good,The culture is like no other company that I've ever worked for and my work experience stretches to alot of different banks in the area. The company allows you to have a voice and welcomes most ideas. There is alot of focus on networking and building your brand. I love the fact that this company allows the employees to volunteer during work hours and is huge on giving back to the community.
good,Capital well has a strong compensation plan and they expect you to perform at all levels. Leadership turns over and promotes internal growth with in the organization every two to three years.
good,"It is nothing special, it is very regular work place nothing excited me while working there. work place and life balance is perfectly maintained. learned a lot of things here."
good,"Capital One constantly has changes that are hard to keep up with.  Constantly having org changes and the job I was in changed all the time as well.  The facility was absolutely amazing though.  I did enjoy being able to work from home when needed and was able to check email from my phone.  The calendars are very fluid and constantly changing.   I did enjoy majority of the people I worked with and the people I worked for, but I was hired to support one VP and for the past two years have been supporting an MVP and two VP's.  Looking for a change."
good,"- Work place culture is enjoyable "
good,Great work environment with amazing people who are they to help you if you need it or just encouragement. Just have to deal with a thousand customers a day and they make contest out of helping customers
good,"I loved this company, but they recently went through some restructuring and lost sight of their values. They are trying to be innovators to prepare for the future, but ignore today' business needs."
good,"very busy with lots of projects and day to day processing."
good,"Good place to work and grow and leave to gain more money and experience, then go back for the benefits and the more money. You can make more money by leaving and returning than staying and advancing."
good,"Relaxed environment with lots of amenities for downtime."
good,"Capital One laid off small business department in New Orleans not long after I left to come to Iberia.  Some top managers from my department came over to Iberia and called on some qualified employees to come work with them and I was one of them.  I was a small business banking lender for up to $50k at the time and wasn't able to advance.  So, I thought it would be a good opportunity to learn more and be able to decision loans up to $250k.  It was a hard decision, since I had been with Capital One since 1993.  But, I felt the chance for advancement was worth the move."
good,Pleasant environment that was fast paced.  Learned a lot working there.  People were friendly and always willing to help when needed.  This was a contract position that I truly liked.
good,Positive learning environment. But some old dated practices still linger from managers who been there long. some teams dont work proper AGILE practices.
good,It's really bad when Capital One is set to get a massive tax break which the company will turn into a profit windfall all the while the lower level employees such as myself had their pay decreased as the company eliminated the annual bonuses without compensating for them in a different way.
good,"Workplace culture was a top  priority with Cap one and felt company wide to create a create work environment."
good,I think and love Capital one i think overall is a great place to work for and grateful for the opportunity it gave me to be a part of something great and changing others lives
good,"Typical day at work was organized and structured. I learned the basics of negotiation, listening to detail, and microsoft office. Most enjoyable part of the job was the long lasting friendships."
good,"Capital One is a great company overall"
good,Capital One is an awesome place to work - it is filled with smart people who work hard and believe in what they do! The company is growing and has a positive outlook. I love Capital One.
good,"Good Culture, Great People, Innovative Company. Pay and benefits are best in the industry. Good diversity and there was a lot of opportunity to learn new things."
good,"The atmosphere was good, stressful some days. I've learned a lot at the company such as de-escalating tough customer calls, and picking up experience in Microsoft office. The management was great."
good,Overall good job for young people!  Great pay but hard to make any movement.  It is also a good job to get a base into the banking industry and an understanding.
good,"Working at Capital One was fine. Great benefits and perks, laid-back work atmosphere. Nice work-space and break rooms."
good,"Lots of food, lots of entertainment. It's as if they want to keep you distracted.  Doesn't work for someone like me who is looking for advancement. Stay focused on the goals you set."
good,"Capital One has been one of the best places I've worked so far, however, there is little job security within the organization. national sites seem to open and close within a few years."
good,"Perfect job to maintain work- life balance. Every member's opinion is taken in team meeting. No peer pressure on any work to be completed in a given time frame. "
good,As a contract employee I was exposed to only my tasking so I can not honestly address much of a review. In my role it was fast paced and challenging requiring much adapting to company practices.
good,"The primary reason I left is because they shut down a few branches in my area. Also, there was absolutely no room for improvement. One fellow co-worker was there for 4 years and got nothing but raises."
good,I truly enjoyed working for Capital One.  My manager was located in another state and I had to travel at least once a quarter for meetings but I didn't mind that much.
good,"i would recommend working here,relaxed atmosphere,great teamwork,flexibility,offer at home positions allowing you to balance your home/work life,great management support for employees,education reimbursement"
good,Good place to work. Lots of opportunity to learn and develop your career. The co workers and team are very smart and great to work with...........................
good,"This place has a great culture, great coworkers and great managers. Even among  adversity there was always a close-knit feel to everything. Career wise it can feel like it takes awhile to move up but it will/can happen."
good,Good place to work.Nice diversity and good projects. They are venturing into the AI areas and company has a good future. Good work life balance and understanding management.
good,"Fast paced working environment. I learned how to communicate with others a lot better. I learned how to ""break the ice"" with customers. My coworkers were very helpful with whatever I needed."
good,"Great company to work for but this was before they started in the banking industry,  When I worked here it was strictly credit cards.  Great benefits and recognition but hard to advance."
good,"I had a good experience while working at Capital One. I really liked the culture and the trainings on personal development. The pay was not that great, though."
good,The job was nice. The  advancement with the company is not there. The management teams need help. The culture was nice until I went too a store that spoke only Spanish and I wasn't comfortable because they knew English but decided to only speak Spanish around me.
good,At first I was very scared to work for such a large company but in the end it was one of my most favorite jobs. I learned a whole lot about helping customers and how credit cards worked and how the company ran. I also learned how a good manger took care of their crew. I had a few different supervisors which was okay because I kept advancing to different departments. I enjoyed every one of my supervisors and they were all close with the employees which in turn made it to so that the employees were able to enjoy coming into work. there was always bonuses and drawings and chances to win prizes along with good pay and benefits
good,"Capital One has a lot to offer especially for those just starting out in the Financial Services industry."
good,A typical day at work is on the phone from clock in to clock out. I learned about repossession and how long it can take before it happens. I learned there are options to bring your account current. Management was great at first then the staff changed and things went downhill from there. Overall Capital One is a great place to work and they really care about their employees.
good,I'd rather not do this since it will be public.  Even though it says it is private I do not feel comfortable participating in this portion of the process.
good,"Cap is a cool company to work for. benefits out the A**  from day 1. the environment in where i worked was great. Colors nice people, majority with great attitudes. But the way capital one is set up once you get past that Associate roll and you move up you can kinda do your own thing per say. Long story short I witnessed a few unsavory things that do not match up with capital ones wanted workplace image. Like i said in all, great company but, if you get on someones bad side and their in a position of power, mind your manners. It can turn into high school there very quick, put it that way."
good,"Capital One is a great place to work when you have the right support structure in place.  Benefits and pay are competitive, but job stability is a concern.  However, Capital One does take care of individuals they let go."
good,Good company to work for. Great Family and life balance and Benefits are fairly decent. Good advancement opertunities. It is sad that this company is being sold
good,Capital One does a great job in bringing together a cohesive culture and a fun working environment. A great balance between personal life and work. I have worked here for over 10 years (since ING Direct) and have thoroughly enjoyed working for the company.
good,Capital One's benefits are great!! The company allowed 8 weeks paternity leave which has given me the time to bond with my son. I wish I could stay with the company but my specific division was acquired.
good,"A typical day working at Capital One Bank in Largo, MD was busy. I didn't care much for the hours when I worked there because Mon-Fri the bank was open until 7:00pm. However, the hours have changed now. The hardest part of the job is the customers. You definitely have to have patience. Some of the customers are just rude, and others are sweethearts. Overall a good atmosphere!"
good,"As a Customer Service Rep, a typical work day consist of dealing with card holders."
good,"great place to work. Fast paced with attention to their employees and their needs. plenty of room for growth with excellent benefits ,401k, and stock options"
good,I enjoyed working at Capital One. It was my first job out of college. The environment and workplace culture was very relaxed. The management seemed to care about your career and development.
good,Great benefits with 401 k.  A lot of sales as a teller.  Good training.  Employees are like family.  I would still be there if not for my bank closing their location.
good,Capital One is a dynamic organization. The opportunity to join the team is one that will benefit your personal and professional growth in a great way!
good,A typical day in the office would include managing your personal call while provided excellent customer service. Keeping track of average handle time and resolving concerns as quickly as possible.
good,Basically the work environment setting is typical for an IT organization.  Very collaborative and a huge campus where all kinds of nationalities could work together.  Diversity is the main potential here where a collaborative platform is created where everyone is encouraged to contribute towards company's goals & objectives.  Regardless of where they are employees are empowered to make creative decisions to assist drive these goals forward.  Communication as well as IT platforms are ideal.
good,"Great company to work for, love the people I work with. Great flexibility with schedule shifts. Perfect work life balance with fun activities and good food provided."
good,Great place to work with management that really cares about their employees. The work life balance was great as you get 20 days of vacation after 90 days. The benefits were great.
good,Fun but fast paced depending on stream. Great environment laid back when work is done. No micromanaging everyone if friendly definite can learn a lot at Capital One Auto Finance.
good,"Very fast-paced"
good,Processors had high work volumes and management was not always qualified. Had many fun activities and catered meals when production was at high volumes.
good,"I loved my job at capital one. There were opportunities to advance and get out of the office with volunteer hours. A great group of co-workers. However, they closed down so many branches and many people in my area were out of a job due to bank closures."
good,I did collections. I started in early stage and moved to mid than late stage. Once you get in late stage it's harder to collect. These account are over 90 days pass due.
good,Capital One provides an inviting corporate culture. There is plenty of collaboration between managers and employees which is a big benefit. Unfortunately the career opportunities in any location other than the headquarters is very limited. Also your end of the year rating is based on every other person with the same job title even if they work in a different department. You are rated against people who do completely different things.
good,I was one of the original groups of employees to be hired at a brand new facility that was built in Tampa FL. Wonderful company to work for with definite room for growth.
good,I only left for the opportunity to start a branch with the future potential to build from the ground up. I appreciate every opportunity they gave me and they helped me develop as a person and leader  of my team. Capital one was a positive work environment and a great training program
good,Nice place to work only no job security; plenty of lay offs.  If you can get on it's a pretty good work environment.  Just a little to far from Glen Allen VA.
good,Capital One is a great company to work for. You meet a lot of great people and you learn a lot. Capital One really takes care of their employees. There is also room for growth.
good,"Great people. Smart, driven and compassionate. "
good,"General banking, withdrawals, check cashing, deposits, payment, referrals to bankers, excellent customer service, professional workplace, referring is the hardest, regular customers are the most enjoyable"
good,I worked in the loss mitigation side of the company and really enjoyed my co-workers. It was hard work. Pay was good and bonuses too! plenty of break rooms and very relaxed environment.
good,Great benefits. Co workers were great to work with.  Dealt with a lot of difficult customers as with any retail job. The company really cares about it's employees.
good,Benefits are good and the office is nice. Work life balance is good and flexible working is accepted. Environment is great with opportunities to expand your role.
good,Management has a strong influence on the mood of the environment. The older Capital one influence had a strong sense of work life balance and connecting with others.
good,"Capital One's Tampa location is a great place to gain useful professional skills.  The work is fun and whether you continue with the company or move on, the skills you learn will stay with you throughout your career."
good,"Four positions in 3 years. Eight managers in three years. Great Training, pay , and benefits. Relaxed dress and attendance guidelines. Role with the Flow because it's constant change."
good,"I really like working at Capital One and would highly recommend anyone looking for work to check them out. They have a great corporate culture, awesome managers, and offer lots of career advancement opportunities! Great place"
good,"Great Vision, Poor Execution (in some groups),  CEO and executive vision is great, the company has a great future and is really on track on not only setting but achieving the goals."
good,"A lot of change going on, so if you are comfortable with that, then this is the place for you.  On the retail side, you will see the way branch traffic affects FTE and staffing"
good,Working at Capital One for the last 15 years has been a great experience.  I have met some of the most awesome and smart people ever.  The flexibility of the company as well as the people will keep folks around until you can't stay anymore.  Unfortunately I was impacted by a redeployment that happened this year and would love to find something internally but am also looking at what is out there outside of Capital One.
good,"Great place to work. It is not for everyone, but there is job security and a steady paycheck coming. Encouragement to grow as a person and employee with professional training and tuition reimbursement, focused on healthy workplace and incentives given, lots of catered lunches/fun days and company parties or pep rallies, fair pay and nice bonuses, job security - it's tough to get fired if you're doing your work, management seems to listen to employees.Environment can get stressful, ot can throw off work/life balance, morale fluctuates and tends to stay low longer than high, some favoritism with promotions"
good,Capital one had very good training classes. I was promoted from supervisor to unit manager along with the 6 other supervisors in my dept. it was stressful at times but a nice comp to work for. call monitoring was the hardest part of the job. it was like a family  at work.
good,"Capital One is an Excellent Company to work for. I have been there for a 23 years. However, they have a high rate of laying off which is what I am going through right now. I am in currently in re-deployment."
good,I enjoyed my time working for capital one. very secure facility and the company respectfully and constantly endured the security and well being of their clients and employees.
good,"Good Morale Both Management and Coworkers, and Honestly a Great Company.  They truly have a ""put client first"" attitude. My job, working with clients  is highly rewarding."
good,Reviews are unbalanced and unfair as they rely on calibrations of all in a given group.  If all are performing at the same rate - so it is not a balan
good,I really enjoy the ability to have flex time. I can work from home if I need to. Capital One focuses on work life balance. They really care about there employees.
good,"Work/life balance is great. flexible options for parents as far as daycare, work from home and time off. management is fair and always understanding. not too stressful"
good,"Fun Place to work,lots of extra curricular activites...very laid back,treated VERY well...they treat you to many diff things from dinner to trips to the salon/movies etc for accomplishments...its a really great place to work...as long as numbers are your friend..many treats...just because your there!!"
good,"Overall, a solid company to work for. "
good,"Working at Capital One is great, but moving up in the company leaves much to desire. You get to a point where your skills and work ethic mean less than who you know. "
good,"The above star ratings are based on the Mortgage division prior to being acquired by Capital One, since the Mortgage division was shut down shortly after being acquired."
good,"Capital One is an excellent place of employment, they work with you to reach your goals and understand work-life balance. The benefits are amazing as well, they had exactly what I needed. I  had amazing managers that really took the time to help me reach my personal goals as well as the goals of the company"
good,Going away from sales approach but more of a customer service approach. Very flexible workplace culture. Technology is a but lagged but they are trying.
good,Working at Capital One was a pleasure. The biggest problem with working there was long shifts that didn't allow for much work/life balance. The staff was very tight knit and made coming to work fun.
good,This shouldn't be a mandatory thing for a review. It should be an optional thing for people to share their views on something. I am just going to fill this space with some non related stuff.
good,"Took inbound calls to resolve issues with customers business accounts. It was a good place to work throughout college, they focus heavily around college students."
good,"I began here when it was North Fork Bank which was more laid back and less of a corporate rigor."
good,"Starting from an entry-level customer service position, there was a clear path to growth and advancement. After a couple levels of advancement, however, it became a little more difficult to find a role that would continue my growth."
good,"I enjoyed meeting with business clients, learning more about their company and helping them grow their business.  I enjoyed striving for goals and getting the team from all 3 branches involved with referrals. "
good,"Review analysis reports to see who is sending applications/contracts and identify problem areas (no apps or apps in only 1 area such as prime and not subprime). Also, insure I am converting apps to contracts by calling on applications and help capture a deal when necessary and close. Hold dealerships accountable to the commitment they made with us and the value we offer for that commitment. Coach all dealerships on program enhancements and make sure they are using portals we offer to help them make more money."
good,"It's a great company. I just didn't like the work. I also didn't feel like the opportunities to advance were granted equally. It is a call center, so that is something to consider before working there."
good,"enjoyed working here, always personally saw as a stepping stone never a career. Was a Full time student and Full time employee, new higher management does not seem to be flexible to having a work life balance which is discouraging and opposite of Company culture."
good,"Work/life balance is very healthy in COB, and management seems to really care about their employees: the reasons I worked for them in the first place. However, like any other company there are other problem areas. for starters, this is a place that other than the credit card offers, its not very competitive in the market place, the product suite is growing, but as it stands its weak. the company is in growth mode and relationship managers coming in should not expect a strong portfolio of client to be given to them. "
good,This was probably the best job I ever had however I had an issue with career advancement. I gained lots of people management experience and for the most part it was a positive experience.
good,"Capital One has a great corporate culture and gives back to their local communities. They hire the best and brightest and expect high results. Hours are often long so don't be prepared for set 9-5 hours. CEO is top notch. Many VP-Sr VPs have been hired from the outside and while they bring amazing talent to the table, they often run up against cultural challenges that have been embedded since the inception of the company. This can cause churn with associates."
good,Capital One has a lot of great programs for employees. Lots of opportunities to grow. The employee networks and community service are very active. The pace is very fast though and tons of work all the time.
good,"•	Worked with the governance, risk and compliance for customers to process procedures and policies."
good,Great place to work. Fast pace. Remote from within.  Lots of advancement and training . Great customer service great balance of home life and work great staff and wonderful customers. Moving along with technology
good,Capital One has an inclusive culture and open door policy. Work-life balance is valued greatly. Most managers don't care about work hours as long as the work gets done.
good,The people are great. They believe in teamwork. great cafeteria available at all times. management is great. meetings available at times where you meet them
good,"CapitalOne is nice place to work . As an organization it is really comptetitive with cutting edge technologies and the culture is good."
good,"Good Place to work for work /life balance "
good,"Good Company to work for, work and life balance is good. Great growth opportunity. The company is highly innovative and always emerging to become on of the best in the business."
good,"The job culture is very good. You have access to supervisor throughout the day.  There is only one drawback, Sitel the, Capital One contractor is closing down some of their sites."
good,great place to start your career coming straight out of college. Should not  stay more than 3 years unless your being constantly promoted. people are nice
good,I have learned life is what you make it. It order to succeed in life you must give 110 percent.If you are constantly busy and doing something productive in the work place time will go by fast.. If i just do my  job and work is easy.. There is nothing in life that cannot be accomplished.
good,"Great place to work flexible schedule's, great work life balance, diverse, strong values, room for promotion. Fun campus"
good,"Culture is great and pay is fair. Managers seem to play favoritism at times, but for the most part are there to help you advance your career. Good benefits and PTO. Takes time to get promotions."
good,"Fun and interesting meeting new people everyday. Also, you have regulars you build a relationship with. Fast-paced environment. You not only handle every day banking, but also many of Capital One's products."
good,"Capital One is a fun and creative place to work.  You can call it home."
good,"I came to Capital One from the public service sector, and the transition was an easy one.  My experience has been very positive and the people have been one of the best parts of my new career.  I have learned a great deal about network security and cyber intelligence in what feels like the blink of an eye.  Anyone who applies for this wonderful company will enjoy the diversity and work groups that provide mentorship and support."

There are a lot of great managers and employees in general at Capital One that make it a great environment, however the amount of layoffs and closures that it make company wide make it hard to feel secure in your career.

good,"I would come in to office on time, greet all my peers, turn on my desktop, once I was set, I would start taking calls from customers who needed help to reinstate their auto loans from repossession. The hardest part of the job was to be very patient with customers. You have to have great listening skills and patience to de escalate most calls. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a great team to work with, knowing they will always be there for support and suggest better ways to solve and improve the customer experience."
good,"A typical day at work was answering various questions regarding customer's accounts, resolving issues, educating customers on banking processes and products. I worked with wonderful, helpful co-workers and a great manager. I learned that no matter how difficult a customer or call may have been, every call must be greeted with a smile.

The benefits are great and they have tuition reimbursement. Compensation is not up to industry standards and people are not paid well enough. Job is very easy and there is a great work-life balance. Overall good job to work for but you cannot make a career out of it."
good,"I greet customers on the phone on every call and use my customer service skill to fulfill customer requests.I have learn you have to have patient and really put yourself in the customer shoes. I have worked around co-workers who will let customers get to them because they are upset about their account and had to remind them, ""Put yourself in their shoes wouldn't you be upset if you have no idea what is going on"" just that statement alone made a difference. The hardest part is knowing you will like to help the best way you can but sometimes policy and procedure will only allow you to do so much. So what I do I educate my customers and provide feedback on ways they can avoid a lot of situation.The most enjoyable part of working with capital one is that our job is not un-noticeable. Everyone receive recognition for a great job and the ones who tried and could do better still get notice. This what make a job worth going to!"

It's steady work and as long as you get to work every day on time you shouldn't have many problems. I worked there over two years and some people have been there for decades. It's all about what you want to do. A lot of great people work there and most of the managers are great.
good,"A typical day at work was overall fun but always on my toes. I've learned to adjust to every situation and to always be professional. I've learned how to develop a personal relationship with customers and have also learned to operate while making important decisions. Management was fair and worked well with me. I was also fortunate enough to be a part of the management team at Capital One Bank. My co-workers were diverse but helpful. All were strong in different areas and all respected me as their Supervisor. I had a lot of fun working with them. The hardest part was not feeling secure at Capital One. I kept hearing about branches closing and positions being terminated. Unfortunately, my branch closed for good and now I am for the first time in my life on unemployment. The most enjoyable part of my job was having that personal relationship with not only the staff but the customers as well. I've made many smile and many laugh and they've done the same to me. I will miss that experience for sure."

good,"A typical day at work consisted of servicing customers, balances, checkbook balancing, ordering checks, looking for other sales opportunities, loans from start to finish, issuing debit cards, greeting customers as they entered the branch, pending work (things to make sure were completed). Things I learned, A LOT, customer service skills, sales habits, communication styles, ect. Management was micro managing, was mainly the reason I left, I have a job to do and was unable to comply with her standards. The hardest part of the job, being micro managed, wanting me to meet with the manager every morning with my line up after access was granted to my work calendar, wanted me to write everything down, pending, line up, information customer was telling me. My co-workers were wonderful, I have some everlasting friendships from working with Capital One.

At my current employer I have learned about financial and credit card industry.All management are knowledgeable of our purpose and goals that we all have. Co-workers are all people persons, caring and team players. The most complex thing about my job is not be able to assistance customers because they may have an issue that we can not resolve because it is against company or government regulations. What I enjoy about my job is being able to assist a customer without being timed and being able to answer all their questions on one call."
good,"A typical day at work would be assisting customers via email through a secure message about their account.

good,"The culture here is very collaborative, with the chance for anyone at any level to provide input at all times.  Change is a constant, which can be both a positive or negative thing depending on the circumstances, but daily responsibilities require you to always be flexible and team-oriented.  The most difficult part of the job was that the company is very geocentric with the majority of their focus around their headquarters.  Since I was hired outside of that area, I was sometimes viewed as an ""outsider"" and some would forget to include me in meetings/emails, etc.  In addition, the company is very project-focused, almost as if they were a consulting firm operating as a bank.  So many projects would be going on simultaneously, and sometimes there would be duplication of effort due to a lack of awareness or communication.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my team.  I met some truly fantastic people who are extremely intelligent, hard-working, and a pleasure to collaborate with on a daily basis."

The management was always approachable and helpful. The hardest part of the day was when call volume got really high. There would be moments of non stop calls. The most enjoyable part of the day was interacting with my co-workers. Everyone who works there has a great spirit."

Interaction face to face on a daily basis was one of the most enjoyable parts of my job. I am a people person, so building relationships with my customers helped me build a foundation to assist them with their financial needs. In turn this helped me achieve my goals in sales and growth. The management and co-workers all played as a team to each other. Without them, the branch would not be as successful as it is. Leaving this company, I took with me a lot of customer service and sales knowledge as well as confidence in satisfying every customer, every time."
good,"I believe Capital One is an excellent company. They provide a good work environment that allows you to balance your work and personal life. My role at CapOne is critical, and I take great pride in my work and am very passoniate about what and who I support."
good,"The money is great, the work is very easy. as long as your manager is cool, so he won't be on your back all the time, as long as you do your work. Co-worker are easy to get along. The hardest part is handling the customers some can be rude, and handling the money you have to be-careful! Most enjoyable part, making new friends, and the money end of the week, great for a part-time."
good,"I absolutely loved this job. A typical work day consisted of helping and building bonds with great customers. While there I learned how financial institutions work, how ATMs work, and that there are plenty of great people who are customers in my area. The management and coworkers are amazing.

I have learned to priortize and manage the workflow based on the greatest need and resources available on any given day. The hardest part of the job is scheduling vacation for team members while still meeting the needs of the business and saying good bye to all of the wonderful people I have worked with for twenty years. The thing I enjoy most about my job is seeing associates develop and move into other positions of worth. I also enyoyed forming lasting partneships that created an avenue to share best practices.

good,Enjoyable to work for. A lot of opportunities to advance. I came back as a contractor and got the opportunity to work in merchant disputes. It was challenging and great to utilize tools that I got to use with our customers.
good,Cognizant is a good company to work for but the salary is not really good. The work life balance is okay and management is okay too compared to other service company this is a better company to work for. I will not recommend anyone to join unless they are not getting any other opportunity.
good,"Overall great place to work."
good,"Capital One strives to think more like technology companies and less a like a bank. That said, the pace of innovation is dramatically slowed because of being a highly regulated entity. Capital One is an excited place to work, but certainly has its frustrations when trying to move at the pace technology is changing."

good,"Capital One has repeatedly been voted the best place to work in Oklahoma, including this year, and for good reasons. It is a fun environment to work most of the time. They often prompt for feedback from employees, and use that info to change work policies when deemed effective to the goals of the company. They often offer fun activities for the employees throughout the year, including going to the Tulsa State Fair"
good,Working at capital one was okay we had the same ups and downs as other bank we strive to do Goid at all time Costomer sand their satisfaction was our main concerns . Never let a Costomer leave unsatisfied . If it is some circumstance you cannot help because of your position tell your manager or someone with the authority to help. Do your best to take the opertunity to make a sale atwith w
good,"Great place to work! Home and life balance was always treated equally. Staff extremely friendly which was a plus. The location of the place was not in the best spot, right under the train tracks."
good,"Working for Capital One was a wonderful opportunity to work with a group of culturally diverse people. A typical day started and ended on the phone, but with such a supportive management group ... Our day went by pretty quick. I learned a lot while working on campus, however, the layoffs didn't leave a lot of opportunities for advancement opportunities. The hardest part of my job was leaving my job."
good,"Capital one is a great place to work if you can handle a lot of stress. The pay, pto, and benefits are great, but to me your mental health is way more important. You have customers screaming and yelling at you all day especially being in an escalated collection department. On top of that you have to collect on accounts when customers are already angry. Management is decent you're not micromanaged. They do different things for the company like team meetings, outings, and innings."
good,Working at Capital One was a positive experience.  The general atmosphere was positive and they have a solid understanding of good work life balance.  The vast majority of people that work there seem very happy to be there.
good,"I enjoyed working in Capital One I learned a lot and its a good place to grow up and get good experience, good working place with good pay. loved working there"

Look into case studies to root out fraudulent activities.  Meeting to update management in reference to daily activities.  Lunch with teammates, share sport results and family gatherings.  Birthday and accomplishment celebrations.  Hardest part of the day is if not able to find threat and fraudulent activities.  The most enjoyable part of my job is to be able to create rules to monitor and to shut down fraudulent activities before they even have a chance to do damage of course we have to find a balance us to not affect customer service and experiences."
good,Branch ambassadors are trained to assist customers as Relationship Bankers and Tellers. Capital One Bank is a great place to start your Retail Banking journey and get hands on experience. Then you can use this job experience to search other jobs that will help with career growth.
good,I will look into working for capital one in future. I like the work culture and the track of their daily things. Less stress and cool management. Lucky to experience a pleasant work environment.
good,"If you have a strong work ethic, can easily grasp new technologies, self motivated, and enjoy working with talented people/teams...this is the place for you!"
good,"Start out with 15$/hr in a 5 week training period; 3 weeks of class, 2 weeks of monitored calls. Ultimately the best training I've ever received for a job. They really care about their employees and offer amazing benefits and de-stressing activities."

good,"awesome work place, nice environment, supportive people. I have learned many things from here and also given my best. People here treated family members"
good,Working from home was a great experience.  I did not feel disconnected and i was always able to access my team members and managers for any support or questions.  The culture at Cap 1 is rich and i really enjoyed it.  I took the job because my previous employer had terminated my contract and i needed work.  It was more than a 50% pay cut for me.  I guess i havent made that little in a very long time in my career so maybe the pay is right for the work but $16 per hour does not work for me at all in the long term
good,I just need more money.  It is a typical call center work place.  Too far from my home.  Call center employment place which use a call center work model.  A lot of micro management style implementation through out.
good,"The banking industry has advance tremendously as technology continues to evolve. This has made work somewhat interesting. If you enjoy a fast paced work environment where you are constantly learning new software, and applications to further the financial planning for personal and business clients then this is the right place. I enjoyed working because there was always something new coming up, but some higher level managers like to micro manage which prevents some employees from developing their own skills."
good,"A perfect place to work. Great opportunity to learn, advance your career, improve your skill set, emphasis on innovation, Flexible Work time, great benefits! Etc"
good,"Working at capital one was a great experience because i've learned a lot of things with my mentor, supervisor and specially customer on how to deal with different people and different situations they've had.

good,"Nice company, with good management & very awesome environment for work."
good,I enjoyed my time with Capital One. The people were really great and the pay wasn't bad. The hardest art of the job was the same call coming in over and over again.
good,Good learning experience worked to handle the bulk amount of data. CapOne invest good funds in their IT budget and they use the latest and updated technologies to get the work done.
good,"Get the chance to work on complex projects using state of the art techniques and tools.  Generally, work environments are excellent - depending on your role.  Annual performance appraisals are competitive."
good,Capital one was a very fun environment  to work in. I learned a lot doing collections on credit cards. The office environment was always fun and competitive
good,Your success will depend on the team you land on.  Very hard to move teams.  Lots of communication problems exist.  But a great overall place to work.
good,It was a great place to intern. The facilities were great. They pay was very competitive and the people were smart and helpful. I don't think banking is the industry for me.
good,it's a very peaceful place to work and willing to work with you and your needs. I would advise anyone to work here always having fun at a very fast pace.
good,"productive family like environment, friendly staff, great culture, working at capital one is a very good experience to be able to be exposed to the culture of working in a financial institution that really allows you to be yourself and pushes you to move up in the company."
good,you have to take inbound while dialing outbound for people who are deliquent on their loans and have to learn to handle the stressed customers and learn to de-escalate them and resolve their past due loans
good,Great place for your career! I learned a lot while working there and would recommend. The people there are nice and there is room to grow. I would go back.
good,Great place to work. Team was great to work with. Unfortunate that they experience many lay offs which can leave you without a job in two or three years.
good,Capital One is a great place for professional upward movement as it takes the skills that you employ to do the job well and maximizes them to propel one for the next level.
good,Capital One was a fast pace environment and an excellent work place for proffessionals. It has great culture and prpovide a good work life ballance. I enjoy their many social gatherings.
good,"Great place to broaden your skill- set. Also, Capital One has an excellent multi-faceted training program. For example, FINCEN, Anti-Money Laundering, and other finance related orientation."
good,"By participated in Daily Scrum meeting, Stand-up meeting, walkthrough meeting, weekly assessment meetings with business analysts and developers, i was able to keep up with all that was going on. Working with good people always makes the job more enjoyable."
good,Capital one is unlike any traditional banking job. Its more customer oriented. No pressure to open accounts or force credit cards on people. Everything is all about satisfaction.
good,"I loved the low-stress environment and especially the work-life balance. I wasn't much of a salesperson, therefore getting new credit applicants was my weakness."
good,"I love Capital One and as a company they are wonderful. The job itself can be very stressful dealing with the public and internal changes that are constant and not always well-thought out or executed properly. Training programs could be much better; the best way to learn is to just do it and learn by trial and error. Extremely disappointed that our incentive program was taken away, it's almost like doing more work for less money."
good,"the environment was productive, fast paced, and demanding. Nevertheless, I enjoyed the every day challenges that were presented to me, and look forward to facing them head on."
good,"Capital One was a great place to learn and develop your skills, most managers and senior employees were actively involved in your advancement. The division I worked in was not a high earning division or the focus of the company direction at the time, although we didn't get the attention from corporate that other areas got, we were respected and given all opportunities to succeed."
good,I enjoyed my time with Capital One. They invest in employees and ensuring good associate experience. I always thought keeping your associates happy causes a chain reaction. Happy associates means higher engagement and then a happier customer.
good,"Working at Capital One was rewarding because I had an opportunity to help my customers and my co-workers. As a senior Branch Manager, I was in charge of to improve on different key measures for the production of the branches I covered"
good,Capital One has a great working culture.  The work environment is very diverse and very inclusive.  As an employee you are empowered to help improve processes and create opportunities for others to become more engaged.
good,answering customers questions and concerns and making them feel proud to be apart of the Capital One Family. Building teamwork through out the facility to reach goals. the hardest part was speed and accuracy. being able to complete task at a fast pace. Working with capital i got a chance to speak with so many amazing customers. I got a chance to make a person smile and be happy that their credit cards were secure and bills were paid.
good,I was on a high priory project and m experience was good as an consultant.I went in with a 3 month contract and it kept getting extended. Overall a great learning experience.
good,An amazing opportunity to work with some of the smartest people I've ever worked with.  Strong training programs  and ongoing mentoring programs were highly beneficial.
good,"Pros: Great people (including managers), work/life balance was excellent, good compensation & benefits"
good,"Good to place to work, could have used more direction as a contractor once work was completed and the next project had not been assigned yet. I would recommend working there."
good,"you must be a people person, the workplace culture was great you are celebrated for your great work. the hardest part of the job is not letting customers get to you, you must follow procedure and some customers will not understand that."
good,"Its Fast pace environment, it has migrated to cloud now. so many new things we can see in capitalione as development. Culture of IT is really good to work."
good,"Great job, long fixed hours but can work from comfort of home. Good management and training program, all around good job if you like to be on the phone problem solving."
good,"answered and/or made phone calls to people who were in the collections department for their visa or mastercard.  Not always the most fun job to have, but the pay was pretty decent as a part timer."
good,"If you don't mind sitting at a desk all day,  then this job is not bad. Some of the expectations dealing with customers was too much stress for me. But I'm also not a people person!"
good,The management was cool and they made their teams fun. The corporate culture was great and inclusive. Everyone had a place to be them. I enjoyed my time working there.
good,"My time with this company has had its ups and downs, but I have been blessed to meet some of the most amazing people during my time here. The company provides great benefits, and compensation. The downside for me was the management. I was able to enhance my skill set to help me to move forward in my career, however, my career advancement was not genuinely supported by top level management. My immediate managers were never a problem. A typical day would be taking calls and staying abreast of the constant policy changes so that I was able to assist my team. The workplace culture is that of a typical call center.  The hardest part of the job would again be the feeling of not being supported in career advancement. The most enjoyable part of the job for me would be my peers and making sure that the wealth of knowledge that was at my fingertips was absorbed and passed along to my fellow peers. I have vowed to take the things that I have learned (good and bad) along with me and utilize the things I can, and discard the rest."
good,I ran report and also collaborated with other co-workers in order to complete the daily tasks. Contacted insurance adjuster and appraisers to insure the application process.
good,"Great learning experience, great colleagues, and great culture. Granted every group is different. Good work life balance and good benefits. Senior leadership is very mission driven. Most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with great colleagues."
good,"I was a contractor employee.  My project team was great and treated me as a member of the team.  I enjoyed my time there.  I did, however, find it easier to join Capital One as a contractor than as an employee.  Although I had experience in the positions I applied for, I struggled to do well on the assessment, hence I was not able to move forward for a face to face interview."
good,Our training was cut short because of a lack of desks. Because of this lack we were not able to do side by sides that gave us knowledge of communication skills
good,they pay really but they closed location. the benefits are great they start since the day of training . Management was good. was given 200 hours of vacation and vto available.
good,You had to help people with their car loan accounts. You had to educate them on what type of loan they had. You had to help them with payments of loan
good,Capital One is a great place to work. The company is committed to creating a culture where people are valued and customers remain top of mind. Fun place to work with great benefits.
good,Great company to work for. Good work environment.  Nice benefits Job Sr Software Engineer. Good workplace culture. Great snacks and services. Good hardware
good,Capital one is a good company to work for. Always stay focused because you can mess up and it can cause you your job. It has good benefits and good pay
good,"My immediate supervisor is ok.  However, many problems begin to surface as you go up the ladder in management.  They are out of touch and are tone-deaf when it comes to the needs of their people."
good,"Good place to work, Good benefits. Room for advancement. Everyone is a team player. Management will always assist you."
good,I enjoyed my time at Capital One.  Capital One left Boise so the choice to leave wasn't mine.  I would have stayed with Capital One for a long time had they stayed in the Valley
good,"A typical day on campus in Plano is great.  You learn about different cultures and you won't be able to tell whos in management by dress attire so be aware of how you carry yourself around campus at all time. The hardest part of my job was learning how to relax/disconnect from my work, on my off days.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the people I worked with which made it exciting to work at Capital One.  This might not be true for everyone however it was very true for me."
good,Very customer centric.  Focused on doing the right thing.  They are focused on building processes with quality to ensure customers are receiving the best experience and that Capital One has efficient and effective businesses.  They utilize six sigma ideology to develop and enhance processes.  Typical day is that you will spend time with your teams communicating and in a daily huddle to ensure there is a plan of attack everyday.
good,"Cap One follows the mission.  I believe in the direction of the company.  You can't hardly beat the benefits they offer.  You have a huge amount of autonomy to run your branches the way they need to be while keeping you in line with the mission.  The hardest part is not having goals or real direction.  You have to be very self sufficient and driven.  It is hard for some to lead without exact direction.  Also, being a digital first company, the locations are becoming fewer, making advancement more difficult unless you are in a booming city.  Other than that, it is fabulous."
good,The atmosphere was very laid back. Management did not bother you as long as you completed your work. They had a ping pong table. They also had chances to advance within the company.
good,"Capital One is a great place to learn and work with people that you don't wonder how they got the job. Very energetic, ethical, very collaborative. You can work yourself to death, and 50h weeks are typical. Lots of training opportunities. HR screening is serious stuff - be prepared and be ready for a math problem as everyone is analytical. "
good,"Great benefits. Lots of travel opportunity. Great for some (not for everyone)— especially for people avoiding their families or trying to have an affair. If you don't like your current team, you can often move to another one or relocate to another location."
good,"Very Productive to work and learn about new technologies.The culture is inclusive and friendly, with a great deal of energy around the company's mission."
good,"Great place to work - thoughtful ideas to continuously improve customer experiences. Plenty of opportunities to shine, however advancement is pretty limited and performance rating system is highly subjective."
good,Good company to work for. Plenty of training and opportunity to advance. Team work is key. You learn something new almost every day. Working at Capital One kept me sharp and up to date on all new products and services.
good,"Capital one was a great place to work, if capital one was still in Sioux falls I would still be working there. great benefits, great pay and people to work for"
good,"Capital One was an awesome company to work for.  Although I was a contract employee, I felt like part of the team.  Great work environment and the infused water was always something to look forward to."
good,"Working at Capital One was a rewarding job. I learned a lot from this company, things that I can use on my next job, as well as in the future. I will recommend this company in the future as a great company and will always do business with the company."
good,I was sad I had to leave if they were to hire me back id take the job back in a heart beat. I felt at home there and the culture and the people were Amazing. It felt like a hobby instead of a job.
good,"Capital One is a very employee-centric company.  They excel when it comes to work life balance.  They go above and beyond to demonstrate that they value their employees, EXCEPT when it comes to compensation."
good,"I enjoyed working from home and was impressed with the way the company promoted teamwork, including team building events. There was great communication with management and co-workers."
good,"If you can do call centers, it's a good job. Make sure you can do long hours doing the same repetitive customer requests again and again. The training will teach you a little but you won't feel prepared for the real job."
good,"Capital One was a good place to work. They offered many perks, such as Flu shots, wellness packages, gift cards, team outings, and Christmas parties. They had chances for advancement, and raises every year. Capital One was a good place to work, I am sorry I had to leave, but I had to do what was best for my family.  I think they had so many perks, because it was a stressful job, being on the phones, and having people curse you out, and call you out your name was hard to take every day."
good,"Capital One acquired HSBC, my Supervisor and team remained the same as before the merger. I enjoyed working at both companies for a total of 21 years.  My husband becoming terminally ill is the only reason we did not relocate."
good,Healthy environment. Empowers employees. Great training. Offers performance incentives. Promotes healthy company culture. Encourages employee engagement and input
good,"The management team is very understanding and work with their employees to help them."
good,Such a wonderful company to work for! You have such a large opportunity for career growth including finding what you are truly passionate about! There are so many programs and benefits that after 2 years I am still not fully aware of-that is how long the list is!
good,Always enjoyed my time at capital one. it was the one place that gave me a chance. Sad that i was terminated unfairly. I still bank there and still push others to bank there.
good,Capital one uses all the latest technologies and its a good learning curve. People are very talented and can learn more from them.Working at capital one will be fast paced environment.
good,"The coworkers and managers I worked with were always nothing short of wonderful, no matter the location I was currently working at. I was always helped when needed, and learned a lot very quickly thanks to them. However, company policies that affected both the employees and customers changed quicker than I could have expected, and didn't allow for much room to adjust to them."
good,"The mission really drives the company forward, great working for a company with a founder/CEO.  The card organization has the best resources.  Lots of mentor-ship and development opportunities for those who want to go after them.  "
good,"The company is a Great place to work,  If you are interested in working in auto or credit cards.  I would easily refer Capital One to one of my family or friends."
good,they stated  i was unrehirable  for working  there and  its  been  5  plus  years  due to the  fact  i did a  3  month  assignment and i had  a  miscarriage  on the floor  there  so they  had  to let me go early from the  contract thats  insensitive to  me  but  other  than that  it was  pretty ok
good,Lots of opportunities to work with or around cutting edge technologies. Experiences managerial burden tied to being so large and having so many levels.
good,Interned for the summer and it was a great experience and introduction to the Commercial Bank. Management helped me with task and answered questions if I needed them to.
good,"Great company"
good,"Very nice environment to work at."
good,"It is a good company and people in there are friendly and nice. However, some of managers do not have leading capability. You have to keep asking them to assign work to you."
good,good and company love it.  pay and growth is there you just have to want it great company to work for out of the 3 banks I have worked for supervior and staff was reall nice
good,"The workplace at Capital One is challenging and exciting place to work in the process, quality, risk and compliance.  The ability to build a Center of Excellence for process improvements with the Model Risk Office was very exciting and rewarding."
good,"My process of joining capital one was pretty seemless although competitive. The work environment is fun, intellectually stimulating and exciting. However, upon joining the company I identified a very consistent pattern of minority colleagues being brought into the company 1-2 levels lower than their non-minority counterparts with identical or similar skills and experience. "
good,"It was a great professional work experience. I learned a lot and I like the work environment and the culture. They are always looking for room of improvement,"
good,Capital One was a wonderful place to work. Everyone their is very driven and willing to help. Great place for advancement opportunities or to try a diff scope of work.
good,"Nice company culture, decent compensation with generous benefit package.  Strong leadership team.  Very dynamic performance measurement.  Smart people to work with"
good,Compared to the headquarters retail is a job that has limited mobility. Plano is the place to move around and really experience job culture. Work Life Balance is great at the headquarters
good,"Fast paced employer looking for individuals willing to challenge themselves.  Not your ordinary credit card company, Capital One provides an excellent work/life balance all the while allowing employees to have a little fun throughout the work week."
good,very productive environment. management was professional and opportunity to succeed was there. typical day of work consisted of over the phone customer service and sales.
good,"Worked there for almost 5 years. Changed departments twice at the Las Vegas location. There is nothing but phone work at that location and they don't plan on changing it. If that isn't your niche the only thing you can do is get into management. They had no positions available for HR, Quality Assurance, Process Management, or even IT. Very limited opportunities. But they do offer free healthcare site, on-site cafeteria, nice break areas and a courtyard, on-site fitness center. The benefits were also good and you were potentially eligible for a raise every year with your review. The managers are very transient though and I was let go due to a mistake I was making that my manager should have told me about before it became a problem. So the management could be better. But all-in-all I enjoyed my time there, had fun times with co-workers and teams."
good,Great people. Nice building.  Completely paperless.  Contractors weren't considered to become full time employees. Affordable cafeteria. Job responsibilities were narrowly defined so extra responsibility was frowned upon without title change.
good,simple job computers do most of the work for you. a day at work would be answerings phones helping caount on the business lines and assisting clients into and out of the vault as well as reffering them over to custmer service
good,"At the time of my employment, I was pretty young and this was my first corporate position. At the time I did not have the focus I should have but I knew that the company had opportunities for growth and I enjoyed working there."
good,"Awesome place to work, the work environment is great, and the connections you get to make with certain customers is one that you could not get anywhere else. The time I am spending here is well worth where I am going to get to and since its my first full time job, it will definitely help in the long run for my actual career."
good,The culture is pretty competitive; leaning on the fly and not a comprehensive training program.  It's a good company for self starters and independent workers.
good,"As a contractor , I worked for their big data team (Hadoop) and I was part of a huge team which worked on moving data from different sources into Hadoop ecosystems ( offline)."
good,"Capital One is a good stepping stone on your career journey. There is plenty of opportunity to learn, including free computer based training that you can utilize at any time. If you are looking to gain knowledge and experience, Capital One is a great place to achieve that goal. However, employee and client retention is severally lacking. Job security just isn't there."
good,"-It was a very easy job"
good,"Very customer service focused company with supervisors that are very nice and a easy to work with."
good,"This bank was my first job. This company opened so many doors for me in the work life. Staff was very friendly and nice and they taught me so much things I can apply in the job and to life beyond it. Only issue I has was that since I was an intern, the hours were rather low. Otherwise a great company to work for."
good,"Lower pay at non-exempt levels, adequate compensation at exempt levels. Great PTO package, as new-hires start with 20 days of PTO (this is for both scheduled and non-scheduled days off) As with most call center jobs, some teams had more fun at work than others."
good,"My coworkers were great and my manager was amazing. Built many personal relationships with our customers to better understand their financial needs as well as helping the day move along by talking with people. Capital One started closing a ton of branches on LI and fired my manager and relationship banker, who in my opinion were the hardest workers, as well as my friends and left people who shouldn't have been left, so that whole situation I disagree with but other wise it was a great experience."
good,excellent customer service/ rapid environment. Grest communication. Very informative with training. Employees and customers very friendly. Information provide to customers was very informative for the customer. Made sure customer fully understood the policies and guidelines of the company.
good,"It was a fun place to work and they wanted you to do you best, but much like any banking job there are a lot of rules and regulations with the job to make sure you have to follow"
good,"Good exposure to learn and apply technology."
good,"This is a great place to work. Fast-paced and exciting, the culture supports individual growth and team participation. A full supporter of the community’s need for volunteers, there are a variety of opportunities to fulfill personal needs. Teams are generally well managed and work at a sustainable pace."
good,Good Company with a good culture.  Friendly environment. Advancement opportunities possible with balancing your work and spending time for training. Availabilities of job enhancement tools could be improved.
good,"You get out of it what you put into it.  There was never a dull day and I met some really cool people there, some of which I still keep in touch with."
good,Loved the many years I worked at Capital One ..Job was interesting and enjoyed doing fraud investigations on a regular basics Love my job death of my father is why im no longer with the company. No understanding during this time ..
good,Capital One was a good place to work with talented people. Salary was on the low side. Opportunities for advancement existed and management worked to identify capabilities of team members to help them advance.
good,"Great environment at the branches, awesome benefits. "
good,"Capital One is fast-paced and competitive environment. One must be ready for change continuously albeit work location, manager changes, job duties, and work schedules."
good,This job was through Accountemps but I did enjoy working at Capital One. I like the set of a campus life style. Great perks you can walk to different building for lunch and paly sports on you break.
good,"My daily work day would be attending to customers everyday banking needs such as deposit, loans, opening a new account, whatever financial needs fits the customer. I managed the floor and tellers, did schedules, opened and closed the branches. I enjoyed working for this company as it made me grow and taught me the financial background."
good,This is one of the best companies to work with and has got good working environment . This is one of the best place to work in. I really enjoyed my work
good,"Working at Capital One honed my interpersonal skills since it's also a part of our job to collaborate with our designated teams to achieve our organizational goals and by interacting and providing quality service to our clients . The management also made sure to keep their employees happy and satisfied through their employee engagement activities, team buildings and generous benefits and compensation."
good,"The best job I’ve ever held! The diverse culture is very inviting, never shy to be themselves. Love it! Games very week to help de stress the employees. Monthly “town halls” for rewards and goal focus calibration."
good,I enjoyed working with the teammates that I had while working at Capital One. I would trade the experiences I had for anything. It made me a better customer service rep.
good,My time at Capital One was a great learning experience and one that I desire to go back to if an opportunity is given. The culture there is family and for the clients.
good,Typical work day at Capital One was actually fun. We focused on team work and customer satisfaction. The compan0y was awesome with keeping staff engaged with up and coming events with- in the company.
good,"Capital One is a great place to work and if it was closer to home for me then I wouldn't want to leave.  The pay is good, the benefits are good, and the people are great.  There is flexible hours, ability to work from home when needed, and casual dress code. They do offer training classes to learn new technologies but they do not provide you the time to take the classes due to the amount of work.

good,"Great place to work"
good,Capital One is a great place to work. Their employee benefits are amazing as well as their continuing educational program. The hardest part of this job for me was being in a call center environment.
good,Good benefits and opportunity for advancement. Good job culture and management shows interest in your career goals. Not a lot of micromanaging which is good.
good,Capital One puts a lot of money towards the sales teams but if you work as a processor or ops you will get forgotten and not have a budget to do much. Software used in a lot of departments is old and you have to create a lot of workarounds and patches to get stuff to work.

Hardest part of my job was keeping calendar organized and seamless for the Executive.  Most enjoyable was being part of the organization and feeling appreciated."

Without the constant worry and stress of losing your job or trying to over-perform to keep your job, you live and work your day-to-day with relative ease.

In an era when a good many people are unemployed, any sense of job comfort can instill a deep sense of gratitude, fortune and luck."

Capital one did a good job at providing a good work environment and management team i truly enjoyable working with them. However there were some thing that did make the job not as enjoyable as it could of been. Since moving to lakeland the drive on I4 was a horrible experience and driving 100 miles a day for work was very hard on me and my car. What kept me going ever day was that i got to help people from card holders to other agents. I love to help others in any way i can.

Also love the excellent benefits such as top health, dental and life insurance, monetary incentives to be healthy, associate discount program, and tuition reimbursement (up to $5000 per year).  Opportunities exist for diversity in leadership, otherwise, the company supports diversity in lower ranks.

good,A typical day at Capital One Auto Finance is placing outbound calls collecting car payments. Some people you may call 3-4 times a day. The hardest part of the job is meeting and maintaining productivity goals.
good,"Great company to work for however moving up is all about who you know and not your experience, skills or competences.  The culture is laid back and fun at times.  You are expected to meet your goals and you receive incentives monthly.  Your opinion as an employee is not really taken into consideration or valued.  There is fear of reprisal when you speak up.  Hopefully under new management this may change.  Love helping people, its the most enjoyable part of the job.  There is no such thing as change management, everyone just works."

good,"The worst thing that happened to capital one is its growth. It became so big it not longer could focus on its employees. During the yearly and semi annual reviews it was all about numbers not about the people. It was about meeting a numbers distribution. which turned into X number of people needed to be in the bottom percentage. This became a numbers game and wasn't fair to the people who didn't belong in that bucket. It became we need to let X number of people go each year. This isn't who we were in 1996 and it wasn't right. I didn't get let go I left on my own I no longer enjoyed my job, it was a sad place to work."

I learned how to use any situation to my advantage so that I can efficiently finish my job whether the customer was angry or happy.  The hardest part of the job was to determine if the personal we were speaking to was the actual client or the fraudster.

In my history with capital one there have been many focus sessions on handling different types of customers, ways to change your communication style etc to help you excel to the very best of your ability. The hardest part of the job is the monotony. Though the culture is always changing, quality assurance expectations, incentive changes, etc, at the end of the day the job is still the same and can grow tiring. The things I enjoy most are the people and the extras. We have team outings quarterly, snack carts, merchandise, and competitions to keep things lively and interesting. The benefits are also phenomenal."
good,"Enjoyable place to work. Very relaxed atmosphere and open door policy. Learned a lot about banking and credit card operations. I helped with other agents to obtain their metrics and get them on goal. Management was always very easy going and approachable, co workers were always willing to help and lend a hand.  Most enjoyable part of the job was the atmosphere and work environment. Since it was work at home, it was all digital, but we were able to have a team building day where we would meet face to face.  The most difficult part of the job was handling customer complaints and having to give the customer negative information or not being able to complete a task requested by the customer due to company policies."

good,"Capital One Bank is a generally good company to work for as long as you like talking on the phone and dealing with some difficult customers. Working at the contact center you never knew what was coming in on the next call. The job itself is somewhat frustrating but the company has good benefits that makes it worthwhile. They offer a monthly bonus incentive and its not hard to meet the requirement to earn it. They do expect a lot from bankers when it comes to efficiency, they want you to take the calls back to back with minimum after call work, they don't want to allow any time to recuperate after a call which I don't really agree with , you don't have time to take a breath after a call before the next one comes in on some days.

In this role, I learned various strategies employed by fraudulent individuals/entities, as well as how widespread fraud has become overall. My co-workers were nice but serious for the most part. No real drama or anything. The hardest part of my job were those times when you really had to just take your 'best guess' as to the legitimacy of card activity, as this has a high potential for negative impact to both the customer and company (and me). The most enjoyable part of the job for me was the fact that I was actively helping people."

good,"Working at Capital One has been amazing!  I love the company, their culture and most importantly, the people I work with.  Recently, due to a change in their strategic approach, my job was eliminated.  Business is business and I have every right to be upset but I can't.

You learn hoe to multitask while making sure your client in front of you is getting the service that they require. I have learn that you have to be able to work well under pressure and still keep a smile on your face and be able to work by yourself because many times that is what you will be doing. My coworkers are great to work with, sometimes things aren't coordinated but it usually works out. management is okay they are thery're but they let us do our jobs with out micromanaging.

Depending on the nature of the call I sometimes work with my colleagues to resolve an issue that needs to be escalated or I may have to educate customers on computer related issues that may have an impact on them accessing their accounts. There is a weekly team meeting that I’m responsible for conducting and reviewing new policies and procedures. I’ve learned that not everything is in black in white; you have to be very patient and give each customer special treatment. My management and co-workers are amazing, we really pull together as a team and give each other the support we need to maintain department goals and keep moral high. The hardest part of my position is when I know I can’t fix the problem but because it’s not in my scope of practice according to the company I’m not allowed to perform the task whether it be fixing their network issues or router or general computer problems. The best part is when I turn someone’s day upside down. We receive a lot of irate customers, when I’m able to resolve the problem and turn their whole emotional state into something positive brings me joy."

good,"I loved my job, however I felt that I had become bored with static environment, I did not feel as if I were growing or advancing my skills and knowledge. The hardest part about my departure was that I had earned my place at the top and in one error, I was thrown away like my contributions meant nothing. Indeed I was the best teller Capital One had in a while with awards and recognitions that I could not even begin keep count if I tried.  However it was for the best because when I ask God to do something, his answer was surprisingly unexpected. I thank God for his will over my life because I am better than I have been in a long time."

The most enjoyable is the fun aqctivites that the company host such as BBQ and discounts.
good,"Capital One was by far one of the most demanding jobs I ever had; however, I must say that the job taught me discipline. Everything from having to meet certain quotas to gaining company incentives was always a race to see who can climb the top of the mountain first, but it also gave me a sense of drive, determination, and fulfillment when task were completed and recognized. The part I enjoyed most about working for Capital One was the fact that they helped pay for college and the incentives/bonuses. The worst part about Capital one is the non flexible work regime."

good,"Capital One was a great place with a lot of opportunity to take on new challenges and grow. The people in the department I worked with were very much team players and balanced productive competition with putting all employees success very well. The downside is that like at most big companies, many times there is a block between the upper management and the frontline management. There were a number of decisions that were delayed or not conveyed to frontline managers with appropriate time to react well."
good,They typical day was get here 30 minutes before the staff set of the work drive so that the staff running the numbers for the staff to check to see the members of the staff I need to work with so that we all would be as successful as possible. Great place to work but the company was small so it wasn't much room for advancement

good,outbound calls to customers with delinquent accounts and try to receive payment over the phone
good,I enjoy my job as a business analyst. I was able to bring in new methods of building user stories and tracking the progress of the project. The project was awarded the best managed project and is a model for other projects.
good,"Capital One is a great company to work for. There are plenty of opportunities for advancements if you fit the culture and have the competencies. The work is fairly easy but can get monotonous. The work/life banace is what you want to make it. If you want to rise, you'll put in the extra hours but you can be comfortable and make good money working 40 hours a week."
good,"At Capital One, I learned what team work is all about. I was fortunate enough, to be in a working environment in which we helped one another. My biggest challenge, was opening up to customers and obtaining my referral goals. Eventually, with the assistance of management in coaching, I mastered that skill. That fear, grew into confidence, allowing me to make second tear almost every month after that."

good,"Provide customer service, refer bank products and customers to personal bankers to help people with their accounts. Who handle large amounts of cash making deposits and withdrawels. On occassion would train new bank tellers. The relationship amongst co-workers was great. We all got along and worked together as a team. The hardest part of the job would be managing to retain knowledge of the various bank products in which to refer to customers. The most enjoyable part was the frequent customer interaction."
good,Unisys has a nice contract account with Capital One as a servicedesk. The pay is decent but I am looking for a higher pay grade oppurtunity.

good,"Capital One's banking division is a company on the rise. My branch is a very high volume branch in a diverse area. I take a lot of transactions of all different variety.

Overall everybody is pretty easy to work with and they train everybody on everything."
good,"A typical day at work consists of accessing multiple computer systems used to perform my daily work tasks. I take calls and resolve customer issues according to the policies and procedures required by my employer. I learned how to resolve issues on a one call resolution basis in a timely and efficient manner that will leave our customers happy. My co-workers and I interact in a friendly manner and work together to help and motivate one another to do our best. I don't believe there's anything hard about the job as long as you are driven and motivated toward success, it's very simple. The most enjoyable part to me is finishing a call knowing that the customer is happy with the service and their issue was resolved."
good,"Great company to work for. Benefits are awesome, great opportunities within the company."
good,Some cons and some pros.
good,"Looking for a stable job, with room for growth."

good,For the most part it was a good company to work for.  Pay and benefits were wonderful.  I enjoyed my time working there.  The people friendly and nice to be around.
good,I was a contractor at Capital One for 4 months. During my short time there I had a good experience. We worked from home twice a week. The work life balance was amazing! They also had bikes that you could ride around campus and amazing cafeterias.
good,"Capital One has taught me a lot about my career, my future and myself professionally and personally..The location is great and the people are wonderful."
good,I was able to get my primary work done as well as my degree.  I was able to to my master's certificate while working full time.  They were understanding and flexible.
good,They provide tools for you to succeed. Very good communication from upper management to employees. Gave you the opportunity to travel to different locations to learn new things is you wanted. All in all it was a positive experience.
good,It was good to work at Capital one. The work life balance was good. I had good experience working in Capital one. I would hope to work their in near future.
good,The culture is very rewarding but the competitive salary scales are a little lack luster.  The opportunity for advancement could be more frequent or possible a management training program.
good,The company is great to work for. It is high paced and stressful. But does work hard to provide work life balance. I love the fact that they promote from within.
good,"A lot of customers, a lot of good solid training, doing two jobs as a teller and banker. Customer service is considered high. Staffing turnover high as well."
good,"My only complaint was inability to have person's to call on my behalf for health issues which was requested to avoid ""no call no show"". "
good,"I have the opportunity to work remotely and have the option to set my own schedule. The benefits package is bar none, though the cash comp is low compared to other banks in the AML space. I get tons of time off, the insurance benefits are great, they have great 401k matching, and even contribute into FSA accounts."
good,I started my work at 9 and ended around 6. I enjoyed everything about my job. Would prefer something part time and i realize my pay would not be close to what i made at Capital One but would prefer $20+ per hour.
good,"I love the atmosphere and the fun days. They taught me a lot about the customer service experience, and what it truly means to be apart of a team. I love Capital one."
good,If you are looking for a fast paced dynamic environment where you can champion change this is the place for you! I thoroughly enjoyed my journey at Capital One as I learned a great deal here and was able to move forward into my new role at Bank of America Merchant Services.
good,The most enjoyable part about the job was the customers you had the opportunity to interact with on a regular basis. The conversations were always the source of my happiness but the work tends to drag after awhile.
good,". Proper use of emerging technologies in reshaping products. "
good,You work as a team or individually but support one another. I have learned time management in order to get things done as well as prioritize to meet deadlines.
good,Capital One not only concentrated on technology but also employee development. It has one of the best work place cultures in my experience. Ideas were constantly reviewed and encouraged to bring new ways of doing things.
good,"I have a lot of respect for the company.  It has been my primary financial institution for over 20 years.  I admire their technology first approach to their vision and mission.  "
good,"capital one is a very good job to haev the benefits are amazing as far as heakth and dental, you get a 401k plan with a % matched as well as pto. they are community driven and have a lot of peer bonding events to let you get to know your coworkers as well as their familys. they are fair in their pay and advancement oppertunitys are there for those who seek it. they also pay for any kind of college classes that are business related. they are real people too and they understand how life can be. the perks were amazing"
good,I had the best manager that made life easy there. And help overcome the obstacles. He was always there through work and life. One of the things I recommend CO for the fact that they gave employees time every quarter to be off phones and have fun with the entire team.
good,"Never worked with friendlier people. The extensive training process really makes you as prepared as you could possibly be when you get to the ""on the job training,"" and into your regular schedule."
good,"Working at Capital One was pretty chill--they were really flexible with where you could work (remote or otherwise) and the work they gave to interns was really impactful."
good,"Job was ok, easy to perform just like starting back at Verizon I had started from the bottom, sitting at desk all day long. Very  stricter rules for Call center."
good,Love the management and they allowed us to work on hobbies while on the phone which helped de-stress from demanding customers. The rules changed which made it hard to deal with some long hours.
good,•	Provides support for AIM provisioning team
good,Cons are no room for career advancement and the promotions that are given are based on social status not metrics or ability to do the job. Great place to work for work life balance.
good,"Capital One is great for benefits, encouragement, placement, and paid time off.  However, after 9 1/2 years I was not able to take a leave of absence because my Mother is/was terminally ill.  I love the workforce and environment.  My only issue was not being approved for a leave when I was there for almost 10 years with no write ups."
good,Benefits are awesome!!! Family oriented fun place to work meet a lot of people to network with and create longtime relationships. You feel like you are the company.
good,Capital one was a great company to work for with great beneifts and incentives and the moral of the company was great. They also had company team outtings
good,"Overall, great company with lots of benefits!  As noted in prior reviews, the performance management review process (tied to bonuses and promotions) is tricky.  Many without strong work product or work ethic get promoted because they kiss a**, and when they subsequently get promoted they lack the skill and mindset to manage their people as they're only thinking of themselves and those above them.  If the company fixed this performance process, they would be stellar all around."
good,"I enjoyed working there. Strong leadership from the top down. Great culture, benefits and payed time off. Exceeding customer expectations was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,I had a very good experience while working in the company. The work environment was very and and the colleagues were very helpful. I am glad that I got to work for this company
good,"It was great working there fun people to be around. "
good,"Capital One was an excellent place to work. Capital One afforded me the opportunity to learn how to lead, manage and coordinate important deadlines. I worked at Capital One for 12  years and was proud of the work I conducted. I worked with a great group of people and will forever be great full for the time I spent there. "
good,"Unmatched work life balance. Promotions and biannual reviews can be arduous. Really depends on your manager. Seems to be a shrinking footprint in the Chicago area. Once you’re in, they typically try to keep you."
good,"Capital One has great benefits and takes care of their employees. They are focused on work/life balance and will actively promote wellness programs to benefit not only the employee, but their entire family."
good,"Capital One is a very nice place to work. You have lots of fun going to the Rallys. They serve free lunch from time to time, Pizza, Cowboy Chicken, Golden Chicken. You will compete against each other in monthly expectations. But it can be fun. The people are friendly. There is a lot of room for improvement in the Repo  Department. It need a change of work strategy in this department. Every employee could reach their goals monthly if  the managers would listen to their strategy in making the work better. But Oher departments have better work ethics. I would recommend Capital One as a god place to work."
good,"Very great work environment. I love my team so much . Work life balance was great ! Only open 9 to 5 pm . And my branches was close on weekends . Offer many different benefits , and plenty of opportunities to receive discounts. My only issue with capital one is maternity for part-timers , you only get 2 months . Which wasn’t enough time for me and my situation. I got a extra 2 months from ny state , but its sad that after 2 years i got two months. In all I had 4 months thanks to the added ny state leave assistance.  Full timers get 6 months. Thats way more ideal ."
good,It was a simple job and a lot could be made out of working there. Good people good setting and good management. They had a lot of oppertunities to love forward and people to help you along the way.
good,Unless you see a path within the company to advance within a few years or you know you will be qualified for higher paying roles than this is a job that is great for a few years.
good,Great place to have a work life balance. Great place to start a family. Modern establishment. Very diverse culture. 5 star food and drinks. Sociable coworkers.
good,I enjoyed working in this office. Compared to other offices I worked at this was the most laid-back environment. After receiving the proper training for my position I was able to complete my tasks with ease.
good,Good place to work. The pay is good. Management is good. People seem to like working here. Newly remodeled and modern feel to building. Good entry level jobs available.
good,overall it was a good job.  Hours could have been better for a single parent.  Benefits were good and the workout facility was great but that was a perk started by ING.
good,"I appreciate all that Capital One has provided me (great insurance, life / work balance, open communication with management & having people managers).  Capital One is truly a best place to work and grow your career."
good,"Capital One really does curate a nice environment for learning/advancement. While there, I never felt that any department move/promotion would be too much of a reach to pursue."
good,"Employee Friendly and Learning environment. The managers are very friendly and at the same time, they were vey helpful during the automation tasks and do on.."
good,"Good people, good work life balance. Reasonable opportunities for advancement. Decent perks, better than most companies but not necessarily as good as many tech companies. Good training opportunities"
good,"Great company to work for, most people are awesome.  Just never did feel real set in. This company Is known for laying off. Before I every started an employment there I had heard they were know for this, I loved working there."
good,"They really invest in each employee. They have so many resources available for you to build a career there or even at another company."
good,"nice environment. employee centric"
good,Pay sucks. Benefits are great. Amazing campuses and culture. Work-life balance was also awesome. Unlimited PTO as long as you have coverage. Flexible with WFH as well.
good,"work from home available, laid back culture and dress code, especially for a financial institution. Tries to imitate tech companies with culture and benefits."
good,"Capital One was probably the best company I ever worked for and I would probably still be working for them if they had not ended the line of business I was working in and laid everyone off. I learned a lot about process development, technology driven solutions and work life balance that focuses on high end results and not time spent at your desk. The training and development opportunities are endless and the willingness to allow internal employees, when the opportunity presented itself to move into roles completely different from each other is an added perk. If I could change anything it would be my salary and management favoritism. I just didn't think that I was being paid what I was worth and felt like I had to work ten times harder because there were a lot of managers managing their friends which makes it hard to stand out during performance reviews."
good,"A typical work day at Cap One consist of several meetings ref Project status, Planning and RISK.. We address BAU items throughout the day servicing clients as needed while maintaining progress on projects internally."
good,"Overall, Capital One has been an awesome company which I will highly recommend to my friends near the area. I've worked with the company for about 4 years and 9 months and the only thing that made me to leave the company is the travel time from home to work. It's taking me more than 2 hours travel time one way. It's giving me so much stress."
good,Great leadership with clear vision and mission. Diversified culture with opportunities open to everyone. Flexible working hours with good work-life balance. Impressive internal training opportunities covering most areas of work. Going digital environment preparing employees for future growth..
good,i love my job at capital one its a great place to grow with great benefits. I never had a problem with the company itself most people complain they fire people alot but most of those people have attendance issues. if you come to work and do a good job you can for sure go far in this company
good,The staff and management were a pleasure to work with. The training was excellent and everyone was always very friendly. I would work there again if I had the opportunity.
good,"This was my first adult job, I learned a lot about banking and finance. there was room for growth just depending on your location. The benefits were great, like any job it had its stressful day but overall not a bad place to work."
good,Capital one is very diverse and has a great atmosphere from the employees to the beautiful Campus.  The campus has 7 buildings with easy access cafeteria's in each building.
good,"Capital One was one of the best jobs I ever had and I would gladly go back if the chance ever occurred.  They work with you to be the best you can be and you actually make an impact on so many lives. The work environment is usually laid back and fun, the pay and benefits are awesome and they are very understanding. The only negative thing about my experience with Capital One is the attitude alot of managers and agents have towards temporary agents. It is a hire on process but I personally had a rough time with managers and getting things done due to my contract status. I personally would avoid going through a temporary agency for Capital One, the agency tends not to be very supportive, informative and lacks the motivation to represent YOU as their employee."
good,The workload is very heavy with not enough hours in the day to complete. Management does not consider the ideas of employees. There is a lack of development talent is being over looked and a lot of favoritism.
good,Capital One has a really good balance between work and personal life. The culture is excellent. The only downsize is compensation it could be better but it is below average.
good,"Capital One is a good place to work.  For a large organization, the company tries to maintain a strong corporate culture that promotes a casual feel.  Good benefits compared to other places.  Advancement can be slow."
good,"I liked my coworkers and the hours, they are very good with scheduling and work to life balance, but I don't like how they set unrealistic goals, you have to refer products such as savings and or credit cards and sometimes you can't get enough people to get those products, it not reachable and it will impact you negatively because you as an employee will have meetings of your overall performance. Thats something I didn't like because sometimes people don't want certain services and we would be asked to push It upon people, for example mobile banking."
good,"One of the best big companies to start at, but with that still isn't perfect. Strength of team can vary vastly, and with that can come major pains with dealing with old tech or an inflexible business team"
good,"A great place to work, but also very political. There are some good managers and there are some bad. Schedules for day shift are hard to come by. Be prepared to work many nights. Overall I would go back, but I put my family first and chose a job that bests suits them."
good,"Just when you think you have it figured out they change things,  processes, etc... They bite off more than they can chew. Understaffed and therefore very hard to have availability for requesting time off. You have to struggle in keeping up with so many different call types."
good,Most don’t appreciate a good thing til it’s gone. I’m still at cap one at the moment and most of the people I’ve seen leave for more pay wish they stayed after leaving.
good,"capital one was a good place to work ,however the site I was located at which was in chesapeake va had no room for advancement. I had to leave the company due to that."
good,Wonderful work life balance but you have to put in the time and effort to maximize the benefits if you aren't willing to work then don't bother but if you willing to work hard there is plenty of room for growth an opportunity. You must also be willing to network with people as that is the key to advancement there.
good,"Great company to work for overall, really laid back culture with lot of opportunities for growth. Constant training programs that helps enhancing skill set."
good,"My typical day at work consist of helping people face to face, performing transactions. problem solving and coaching my tellers. I also perform management duties, review and approve operational paper work. The most enjoyable part of the job is that we work together as a family and we all make sure that everything is done correctly. Excellent team player."
good,Ive been with Capital One for 3 years now and they take care of their employees. My manager  was great and he always fought for my to have the best benefits and promotions.
good,"he benefits are very good, and the people working there are, in general, easy to get along with.  They do like to do a 6-month purge, it seems.  Anyone on the border of meeting their metrics will usually be let go and new people brought in."
good,"Flexibility, personnel development, great talent and care for ones thoughts and decisions to get the job done. Appreciates diversity. I really enjoy working here."
good,Capital One is a great place to work & offers advancement opportunities. My only issue is that they lay off often. I have worked any many departments with this company & enjoyed the opportunity to explore them all. I started out through the temp agency ADECCO & later advance to FT employment directly with the company. They still frequently would lay off and rehire.
good,"Capital One is, overall, a great place to work.  The people are all above average, and it is a competitive environment.  The relatively poor performers, who may still be decent employees, are routinely pushed out.  Benefits and work life balance are very good.  Frequent mid level management changes can lead to some uncertainty, but if you work hard, are clever, and are comfortable with change, you'll find it's one of the best companies you could work for."
good,"-Great work culture and environment"
good,It's a great company with great benefits. Career development can be difficult as they don't really allow you to skip levels even if you have the relevant experience.
good,Coming to work in this office is enjoyable. The company made sure the morale was high with different incentives to keep us going. The team and manager I worked with was incredible. We made sure we worked as a team and supported each other if needed.
good,start the day by prepping to get on the phones take about 50-calls a day work place was ok to be in relaxed dressing the hardest part of the job was to take as many calls but you knew what you signed up for
good,"It's a high risk, high reward work environment. Extremely dynamic in every way possible. They take care of their people.  You manager is extremely important to your success."
good,Very competitive and millennial driven. The company will take care of you and advance your career. Definitely a place to retire from if given the opportunity.
good,"8 hour day, 70-80 calls on a normal day. management actually managed. culture was great morale was high. hardest part was the call volume. most enjoyable part was my coworkers."
good,"Great company, culture is amazing, tons of politics when looking to move up, amazing benefits, believes in the mission and it’s people to deliver on the mission"
good,"I regret leaving my job at Capital One Cafe. Though their was individual cattiness and drama amongst employees overall the company did several things to ensure that employees were motivated to do their job. We'd have a huddle to explore each person's agendas, their were always opportunities to work on projects that incorporate personal interests. Personal development was just a thing said but rather acted on. One on ones were constant and plan was developed between you and your manage as to how you develop certain skills during that period. Team bonding was emphasized and steps were taken to show appreciation to the team every month for a job well done."
good,"fun place to work, and a lot of young talents there, and a great culture.  The management was ok overall, as they were people who were willing to help."
good,"I love the company and think it is well ahead of its competitors in the financial industry when it comes to technology. However, I was on a team with a very difficult manager to work with, so that made working there less meaningful than it could have been."

I have the opportunity to learn the Mortgage process from the beginning to the end of the process.  This includes reviewing title, working with Underwriting and Post closing to make sure that alll of the documents are with in compliance."
good,"It's a good job for someone that has worked retail or restaurant hours, and they seem to like to hire people that have been in those kinds of customer facing roles. The hours are great and can be consistent even when you are part time. You are dealing with people's money, so sometimes it can be delicate situations and people will get upset with you even for things outside of your control. If you can handle that, it's an otherwise rewarding job"
good,Company is a great place for a starting job and the pay is good for a college student. Management and culture there are amazing. It is hard to advance though
good,"Capital One is a great company to work for.  There is a great culture, they provide a great work and home balance.  By far the best place i have every worked."
good,Nice place to work but only like to pay market rate. Not what you should be paid. But overall great company to work for. I love it no complaints just my in come
good,"Capital One is a world class company, with world class talent. Leadership has a deep respect for work-life balance. Advancement opportunities vary deeply on your role. Business Analysts, for example, advance exceedingly quickly. While Project Managers, or IT personnel tend to advance more slowly."

good,"I worked for this company for little over a year and the people were great to work with.  I worked in the call center with hopes of stepping into the IT dept eventually, after over 1 year and a promise that this would happen, I was kept in the call center.  This coupled with the fact it was too long a commute made me decide to resign."

good,It was a hands on daily work and the good part about it was that everyday could have a different challenge and had to resolve it. I always count with my managers support and it was all about team work culture. The hardest part was to determine when a fraud was occurring and inform it to the responsible parties. The good part about it was when we resolve successfully the issues that we had everyday.
good,"The company is a great one to work for, but you will find yourself stressed. A lot of people are staying merely because of the benefits if you have a role that requires you being on the phones you are made to take calls from a lot of other departments that you may have not necessarily had had training for. The time off is amazing, there is some flexibility in it. If you work for this company you are better off in a non-phone role unless you like being constantly back to back. There is also constant change of direction as to what to do which can, in turn, be confusing for the agents and create more stress... on the bright side they don't have an AHT, they trust that you will take the necessary amount of time with your customer."

good,"I enjoyed working at Capital One. I was able to meet very nice new people and some good managers. The benefits that they offer are very good compared to some companies. You get medical, dental, and vision insurance as soon as you start. They give good vacation time off, however, I do wish they separated vacation time and sick time."
good,Capital One helped groom me into a business professional. Training and support is top notch. Most enjoyable part of the job is the low pressure for sales but the high expectations for the Customer Experience.

good,"My day at work use to be everyday excitement, challenging, get to learn new things, sometimes very busy hectic schedule to meet deadlines but feel refreshing with the beautiful office environment with supportive co workers and good team work. I get an opportunity to learn everyday new things which have broaden my knowledge and skills on new technical systems, new environment, tools etc. managers were very helpful, supportive and provides guidance if i need some help. they were very organized and managed everything in a smooth manner. workplace culture was quite different from the previous one but i still enjoyed working there. the harder part is when there are so many things to do at the same time and had to finish in short duration then it would be hard.  I use to assist to developer sometimes in retesting when defects were found. The most enjoyable part is after the product is ready to release to the market or client. "
good,Since the 2 years that I've been with the company it has of course advanced my pay quicker than any company has but in the same toke there are plenty of changes with the company that is a bit of a turn off for working here. I'm looking to get away from the corporate workplace so I wont be here too much longer. But for what it is worth they are a great company with awesome health benefits.

good,"When comparing benefits to other companies, Capital One excelled in most. Even though my location closed, I enjoyed the overall experience. Capital One has started to update locations with the new banking experience (coffee shop / bank); therefore, several locations will either be closing or integrating into the future. Supposedly, they only need a couple team members per location, meaning less employees."

good,"I enjoy very much working for Capital One as it's a place of friends and family, not just coworkers. I have learned many skills and a lot about interactions during my time here.

good,Capital One is a great company to work for. Of course every department is different and because it is such a large company sometimes you can feel like a little fish in a large ocean.

I learned that I have great communication skills, ability to show empathy, while getting results that the company expects. It was difficult to hear the stories of worry, and confusion from customers.  They had terrible situations (some of them) and others had terrible vocabulary (foul language).

Management truly cares of about their associates and upholding the values of the organization.

I left to pursue my dreams about working in human services, not because the organization wasn't first rate."
good,"Great company, Great co-workers. Short staff working long hours"

good,I was in a group that did a lot of different tasks in any given day. I did learn a lot about the call center environment the good parts and not so good things.

good,Capital One is a great company and in all my years of being with the company I have gain experience that has allowed me to extend my knowledge in the corporate world.
good,This is probably the only place I've really enjoyed to work at. The management and upper level bosses really give credits to the employees. They recognize the work that's put in from clock-in to clock-out.

good,"I cannot give a good rating for job security since they didn't think twice about closing down the Mattituck Operations Center and moving it to Virginia, leaving many people without jobs, even after they admitted that Mattiuck was the most efficient of all the operation facilities, but I do have to admit that they were a good company to work for and offered the people who were losing their jobs positions at other locations, paying moving expenses and paying for training and schooling for those who did not want to make the move."

good,They now have a new gym on site with full court basketball area. You really don't have to leave work for anything. Co workers are good.
good,"I've worked in several areas of Capital One. Overall, the experience depends on your level, and your department. Having worked in IT most of my career, I can say that the IT department is the most difficult, least rewarding area - and yet that department is still probably better than working at most other companies. IT is highly competitive and resource constrained, so the hours can tend to be very long. However, the culture at Capital One is constantly changing, and IT is not exclusive of the culture."
good,"Working for capital one was a great opportunity for me to gain experience in Customer Service! I love all my Customers and my fellow tellers. I was responsible for keeping a balanced drawer keeping up with my daily sales gales and gaining each customer to sit with a banker.

good,"Love the culture, work life balance, values, mission and compensation :) Its a forward thinking company that embraces technology. However, despite all the innovative work, it's hard to stay fully engaged working only on banking, credit cards and auto loans"

good,A company open to driving you in a career direction you desire. Capital one is  a great place to start a career. They seem to value the tech side a bit more than others and they prefer to hire from within unless you're recruited from a school.
good,I took inbound calls & assisted customers with their accounts. I learned new skills & was able to use some of my previous skills in customer service as well. Capital One was overall a good place to work. It was a relaxed atmosphere and other employees were great.The hardest part of my job was dealing with some managers there. The most enjoyable part of my job was having the ability to help my customers.

good,They really take care off their people.  The CEO is visionary and still explains his strategy to every single employee every year.  Truly innovative company completely bought into fast fail and try again.  Very well positioned to become banking giant
good,spent 3 years there as a temp..never was i offered a full time position. i was working in the repossession dept for 3 years. The department was closed
good,Everyone is serious about doing their job. Workflow was constant in my department. We always had a backlog of work that was constantly getting refreshed. It was a never ending battle
good,"The culture is unbeatable. You have access to a big gym, indoor basketball/racquetball courts, healthy foods, ping pong, and TV's for the big games on. "
good,"I only worked 4 hours per day ,5 days a week...this was the perfect part time job.I was able to work a full time job with another company and still take advantage of the extra 20 hours per week with Capital One.Friendly and helpful atmoshere. Management was always willing to help you understand all of the new procedures."
good,"Great place to work! Very structured work environment with plenty of opportunity for career advancement. The company really cares about the employees, especially for being such a big company."
good,Great place to work love the option of having four 10hrs days or five 8 hrs days.  It was a fun place to work we could be in a red (phone lines) and  management would help relieve stress by maybe getting us a soda. If we were slow had option of taking time off with out pay.
good,"Great company, if you get on the right team with the right support this is a great company to work for. Excellent benefits, great locations with fantastic opportunities. Unfortunately sometimes the leadership can be weak."
good,"Capital One is a good company that has a focused company mission, which they adhere to.  Advancement in the company can be difficult to gauge, but networking is integral to the process."

good,"Capital one has a fun upbeat environment for the most part . At times the management staff weren’t on the same page , so that was conflicting but for the most part they accept everyone with open arms and try to create a positive work environment."
good,"Good job, Great benefits,  Very involved , a lot of room f or growth. They have bonuses based off performance or just because the company is continuing to grow. They are very involved culturally."

good,"Capital One is an exceptional company which is dedicated not only to the customers they serve, but their employees who help them get the job done. Positive work environment keeps employees relaxed throughout their shifts while being able to remain focused on constantly growing production expectations."
good,"Capital One has pretty decent pay and is a pretty good place to work at. The bank has pretty good customer service and a decent amount of product offers for customers. There is a perk of an hour break and above minimum wage pay, but it is hard to become a full-time worker if you are hired as part time. Full time hours are set to about 25 hours per week. There is a job prospect of getting promoted, but you must really wow your managers or be there for at least a year."
good,Capital One has a great culture and a great focus on work/life balance. They were flexible and demonstrated a true desire to support our community. I have enjoyed my time at Capital One.
good,Great managers and associates. Upper management and internal/corporate seem like they don't know what's happening at the front line. IT department needs to be replaced.
good,"Overall great place to work, work/life balance and culture is great.  Management is generally good to work with and the compensation and benefits are stellar.  Advancement is difficult and job security is a little unpredictable."
good,Capital One is a great company to work for if you're looking to advance your career in a fast faced professional and digital environment. It is a very employee and customer centric company.

good,"Great place to learn, awesome benefits as well as options to grow within the company. The most enjoyable part of the job is the culture the morale is always up.Everyday there's something going on in this place to lighten the stress of the calls. However ,the hardest part of the job is just when  you think you know it all, there's something new a policy, system change, system down, technical support issues that cause call volumes to sky rocket."
good,"Always a positive place to be, family like environment. Always knew you had somebody to go to, whether it be personal or work related. Managers recognized people that wanted to go farther in the company and helped them do that any way they could."
good,"I enjoy my time working here. people are great! "
good,This was a job I enjoy working at. It was a team environment. The hardest part of the job would not able to close cases without permission. The most enjoyable part of the job would be working as a team.
good,I worked like 40 hour work week. Don't ever have to come in early or stay late. CEO seems very bright and has a nice plan for the company. Benefits are solid and relatively inexpensive for employees.
good,Overall I am a promoter of Capital One. It is a great workplace to be. I love how people work and make you feel that you are part of a family. Productive environment and friendly management team.
good,"My time at Sitel was for the most part great. At that time in my life, before kids, I loved working the night shift. The co workers were great and the management were great to work for."
good,"Capital One is a great company. They take care of the employee. The only problem I have with them are the systems they use. They still do a lot of paper work. Other then that, I wish I would've stayed with them."
good,Hi I have worked as a financial advisory for Capital One for the past two years. I believe the culture and the leaders of this organization are top in class.

The workspace in Plano TX is wonderful, open and accessible.  Many great perks and facilities.  Benefits are excellent."

good,"Lots of work, lots of teams, loads of cultural activities, a massive workforce which allows one to constantly meet new people. A day passes way too quickly out here. Would love to come back."
good,Loved the people I worked with and the service we provided for our customers. I was a sales rep who took phone calls so most of my day consisted of helping customers and finding the proper need for our products
good,Capital One's  culture is that they want to make sure you  like waking up in the morning to come to  work. they offer lots of perks and the culture is incredible
good,Co-workers are great. Management is wonderful. A lot of room for growth as long as you want it. Close knit bunch. The work environment is rewarding.
good,"On a daily basis you would be able to help hundreds of customers stay out of financial hardship by offering them long and short term viable programs designed to help in there specific situation, which makes the work you do all worth while and gives you a good feeling to be able to help others that have fallen on hard times"
good,My time at Capital One was a great experience. I had a great time interacting with new customers. Capital One gives a great benefit package. Capital One also has a great training program.

good,"Inbound / Outbound calls to obtain payment on seriously delinquent accounts. Provide payment options to bring accounts current within a specific time frame. "
good,"Working as a teller, one of the good things about Capital One was the work/life balance and having your vacation days not taken from you. That allow you time to actually plan things outside of work. There are advancement opportunities but there on the bases of if and when someone leaves and usually they'll already have some else in mind before interviewing, depending on the position. Overall my experience was nice and all recommend it."
good,"Capital One Bank provides many benefits to its employees. There is room for advancement in Capital One Bank. I have only worked in branch, not in back office. Many people enjoy back office more than the branch."
good,"Capital has such a diverse, welcoming, exciting atmosphere.  If you're dedicated to your core role and can master it, there are so many opportunities for lends, and pilots to see other aspects of the company.  Management for the most part have a ""open door"" policy and it's quite easy to talk to them about anything.  They are very encouraging of your professional development and are a invaluable source for knowledge."
good,"I like the culture here, fun. But too many changes to structure and processes within the last year, could be overwhelming for some people."
good,"Capital One has a great people culture, most everyone seems genuinely interested in improving processes and maximizing customer satisfaction"
good,"I worked at Capital One for 10 years. Days were very busy and there are high performance expectations. They hire good people, but collaboration is key to success. You are responsible for your own development and if you aren't in tune with your boss or not meeting expectations, they are quick to show you the door. I worked with very motivated people (work-aholics) that had trouble with work-life balance. The benefits are great, the physical environment very stimulating and there were lots of places to eat (>12) on campus."
good,"Capital One doesn't just give lip service. Everything they do is centered around the customer and their mission: Change Banking for Good - Dare to disrupt, dream, and deliver a better way."
good,"En un día típico de trabajo se realizan pagos de nominas, facturación, altas y bajas ante el IMSS, realización de recibos, envíos de correos a clientes, resumen de ingresos, la dirección de la empresa es buena ya que se encuentra al pendiente de los trabajadores y sus necesidades laborales, mis compañeros de trabajo son tranquilos y les gusta el trabajo en equipo, realmente no encuentro algo dificil en mi trabajo ya que con la practica y una buena explicación todo se aprende, todas las actividades que desempeño me gustan ya que de cada una hay algo nuevo que aprender."

Even though we work independently on the phones we are encouraged to work together, whether its on call monitors or volunteering in the community.  Have formed friendships with my teammates and managers."
good,"Very easy work, this place is fast paced and the noise level is moderate depending on what your department is, you will learn alot within this company; however, room for advancement is very competitive. I love the fundraisers and games. I love love love the benefits and if I could take them with me to my next job I really would have. Overall, this is a good place to work."
good,It is a great company that focus on the consumers demand and needs of the customer while venturing into the digital era. Adhering to the policies and procedures is a priority but is encouraged through peer growth assessments. Strongly recommend anyone with a passion to challenge yourself in a fast pace but genuinely friendly environment that is just as rewarding as the effort you put forth.
good,"I really love Capital One. They have introduced to me true work life balance, great job culture, good benefits. The only thing I was concerned about was the compensation it needs be a little higher than average for the amount of work is demanded."
good,"Capital one was a really good experience for me. The pay wasn’t the best but the atmosphere was good and the people I worked with were the best! The company would often buy lunch showing appreciation for the work we did. There were always games going on, I even won a iPod and a kindle fire for getting good scores on my call’s. There was always opportunity to get over time and to move up with the company."
good,"I would rate Capital One 4/5. "
good,One of the best companies I've ever worked for.  Management is willing to listen to employees and provide opportunities for great work/life balance.
good,"During my time at Capital One, it has grown from a small credit card company to the major conglomerate that it is today.  It has a fun, family environment and people are always willing to help you be successful.  It can be stressful as the company continues to grow and their are constant changes.  But at the end of the day, you know it will all be worth for the success of everyone."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to provide information to LE to get fraudsters arrested and working with great co-workers.
good,"Capital one has  very competitive pay and benefits. We work hard and is often rewarded for our hard work. The staff an management are very friendly and lines of communication stay open. What I ,like most is that they strive to rewrite what customer service means and put the customer first!"
good,"I join Capital One in 2006. I worked with a great management team, who allowed my to train in several areas on a continuous basis. I was able to travel to other regions to advance my career. I enjoyed my staff and colleagues. The most rewarding part of my job was to volunteer and share my knowledge to young children. The most difficult part was being laid off."
good,"My workplace involved high call volume from inbound customers working a 10 hour day."
good,"Working at Capital One has gave me a chance to work with different cultures, learn different programs to progress my productivity, and also got a chance to experience management."
good,Capital One has a great work / life balance structure. It helps to work at a place where they understand that having balance in your life improves the quality of your work.
good,"We have a lot of ammenities to ensure that the employees are not bored. These would range from video games, internet stations, billiard and ping pong tables, a gym and a shower room; not to mention the sleeping quarters which you can use unlimitedly. All these make the place a conducive environment for employees and management alike."
good,Working with Capital one is very interesting. I really enjoyed my work. Productive work environment. Challenging work. Good colleagues with friendly approach.

good,Employees lived and promoted values on daily basis.  Great team to work with.
good,excellent place for working moms. Flexibility in schedule and great people managers
good,"Pushes each employee to do their best, and provides the necessary tools to accomplish the goals that are set. The environment is ripe for learning and developing each individual to what ever potential they aspire to achieve. The atmosphere and people are lively and vibrant. The hardest part of the job is the constant changes and modifications to procedures and expectations. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you have the pleasure of working with; they become family."
good,It strives to be among the best banks but just like any other bank it needs minor improvements to its system. I enjoy working for a company that puts its employees first and they certainly do that. It's a great company to work for. I just wished they would have it in South Carolina where I plan to relocate.
good,Love working here! But hate the hours and it's almost imposible to get off od second shift.
good,"Capital One is really a good place to work. The pay is competitive, the time off package is more than most get, and the hours are good. The ONLY downside that I  could mention is that some of the managers expect too much from their supervisors, but I think that is anywhere you go really."
good,"Highly recommended company, lots of great experience.  Advancement opportunities are limitless."
good,"Typicaly i would go over claims sent in from the branches and investigate the claim to either return the money issue a letter stating that or deny the claim and also send a letter letting the customer know why or why we cant return thir funds."
good,"Assistant Branch Manager"
good,"Great working environment with terrific benefits, to include a doctor's office, Starbucks, a gym, and a cafeteria in the building.  Daily I would maintain calendars, make travel arrangements, assemble PowerPoint presentations, and organizing department meetings."
good,"Exciting, good learning process"
good,"Typical Day At Work"
good,"a typical day on the job means helping the customer # 1. I think that if that is not your main objective in customer service, you should look for other jobs. I like a job where there are lots of multitasking answering between 90 to 110 calls and like being busy. I have learned over the years that when people are mad, they  are mad about a problem that happened and not the person who is receiving the call. All they want is resolution to the problem. I try to go above and beyond to get that done  because it is what i expect when I have a problem with something. i have a great relationship with my managers and my other coworkers because if you work as a team you can do anything.. The hardest part of my job would be satisfying everybody right there and then , but I know sometimes you have to look into things, talk to a manager, or supervisor. then get it done. the most enjoyable part of my job is getting a problem solved and putting a smile on  their face "
good,"As long as your doing what you are suppose to do, then there would not be any problems. They are laid back, just like any typical day at work, deal with customers and make sure you are Friendly about it. "
good,Pros
good,-work hard and the sky is the limit
good,it was kind of boring at the begining but then i started to get familiar with the faces and then i became a pro helping te customers and informing then with new products.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of our daily morning brief, gathering all daily reports and then continuous data entry, research and internal/external customer support. The end of the day consisted of gathering all End of Day reports and processing a daily proof."
good,Good company to work for.
good,"A typical day at Capital One Bank was a friendly atmosphere and very professional. I learned how to incorporate my experience from my retail and customer service experience to the banking industry. Management was very helpful and very hands on. What I enjoyed the most about working for Capital One was the customers and my co-workers, it really was a friendly environment"
good,"Responsible for balancing ATM cash and general ledger cash accounts in Louisiana and Texas. Monitor ATM deposits for possible fraud. Research each deposit to see if any adjustments need to be made to the customer account. Design, generate and review monitoring exceptions reports."
good,Handled tasks of opening new accounts.Increased business profit through networking and building solid client relationships.Assisted managers in identifying sales opportunities for the branch.Responsible for giving daily reports to the manager.
good,a wonderful job to get your foot in the corporate door. There is plenty of opportunities to climb up the corporate latter. Your managers will be very innovative as well as willing to help you build yourself up to what you want to be.
good,My time at Capital One has been very valuable. They have provided me with great starting point for my career going forward. All of the managers are friendly and helpful and there is a variety of roles available to cater to the strengths of employees.
good,"During my time at one of Capital One's call centers, I gained a lot of work experience and really enjoyed my job. Management was really great and the were supportive of a work/life balance. Only bad part was that the shut down our site."
good,I want to work in canada i'm a father of 3 kids. I need to work there because i have    a experience in this job.  I hope working in canada and bring my children to a good area.
good,"I’ve been working with Capital One’s Fraud department for about 6 months. So far it’s pretty good. Everyone here makes you feel like family and my manager is awesome. I am fully remote so having the ability to work from home has been amazing. Benefits are great as well. You can tell Capital One really cares about its employees. People advance in as little as 9 months here and the opportunities are  endless. Pretty much everyone that works here started on the phones. Call center work can suck sometimes but if you’re able to stick it out, and keep your metrics where they need to be, you’ll be moving up pretty quickly. You don’t get to choose your shift. I lucked out with an 8-5 but working in the call center, a weekend day is mandatory (at first.) shifts are usually Sunday-Thursday or Tuesday-Saturday. You’ll work anywhere from 6:40am to about 11pm"
good,Really nice ppl honest and chances of promotion. Great ppl really liked the atmosphere of being there. Would love to work there again. Good place to start
good,"Great company to work for, loved the overall culture and environment. Friendly staff, great training and online resource materials. Overall a positive experience."
good,"I think Capital One did a good job at meeting the baseline needs of their employees. My bosses were nice and supportive, compensation was good, culture was positive, we could work from home, we used up to date technology/systems like python/tableau, I got time to work on independent projects and when those were successful I found support in making those unique projects a larger part of my job. The biggest negative I felt was that my main responsibilities, especially for the first 1.5 years, amounted to essentially babysitting code. Making sure reports ran successfully, and stuff like that. Things I probably could have done as a highschooler if not a middle schooler. I suppose that everyone needs to start somewhere and such a role did allow me to gain familiarity with the systems they use but it was too little for me. I still recommend them as a company, especially as a first step out of college or if you find a role that suits you."
good,Capital one offers the greatest maternity leave/ maternity benefits out of most employers. They actually needed up leaving the city I was working in but took care of all of their employees well.
good,Overall great place to work with potential for growth. Outstanding benefits. Company has a great focus on where banking is going and growing with the times.
good,Capital One indulges in their employees. They create an environment that allows you to have a healthy work/life balance. The one downfall would be that it differs from one department to another.
good,Great company to work for. Amazing benefits. Good pay and bonuses to keep you going. The bosses are very nice they don't micromanage there is a cafeteria there as well as a gym they really focus on Health and Wellness
good,Great place to work. Great food on campus. Flexibility with working remotely. Wonderful maternity and paternity leave. Great people to work with. Bicycles on campus for you to ride on a paved path in the woods.
good,"Open concept, friendly atmosphere.  Just wish there was more transparency in what is coming down the pipes and there was more inclusion of the contractors and did not leave us out of group activities and snack time."
good,"I had a lot of autonomy, worked on cool projects and open source software, and had a great work / life balance. The people are friendly and the company culture is collaborative and open."
good,"Great culture. I wish the pay was better. My manager and team were encouraging and supportive. The calls are stressful, but the environment softens the blow."
good,basic branch banking environment relaxed atmosphere casual dress attire. really no hard part of job sometime you deal with difficult situations without a manager available cause they manage different locations.  enjoy the team
good,The people are quite nice and the work life balance is good compared with other companies in finance industry. I worked at a more technical office so there is not great pressure.
good,"Face paced environment, have to be able to keep up with change. My team is awesome, like a second family. Management is very cool, no micro managing, have to be able to work with limited supervision."
good,"Came in, and serviced my customers appropriately. Performed projects required of me. Straight forward position. Environment is great in certain departments and lacking in others."
good,"Conscientious of employee comfort and wellness of being while at work (Well stocked break room, optional [but finite] time to take a break from calls if needed or wanted, part-time associates available to receive PTO)"
good,Strong valued lead how the company operates and makes decisions.  Fun work environment that allowed for management to make local decisions.  Strong attention to needs of employees
good,The people are friendly and processes are clear and concise. Management could be improved but overall a great place to work. There were many perk and rewards.
good,"Hello, "
good,"Highly competitive and rewarding place."
good,I love the environment working at Capital One however due to the layoffs I was forced to look for work elsewhere. They have wonderful amenities at the Plano Campus as well.
good,"This is a job that provides excellent Work Life balance,"
good,Interview process is one of the most difficult I have witnessed in the financial services industry. The hurdles one has to jump to get hired is well worth it given the company's culture and compensation.
good,Fast paced and exciting work. Great team environment with many good people. Management was excellent. Pay (commission) was very good if you worked hard.
good,"I enjoyed working at Capital One. My managers were awesome,  and the work-life balance makes up for the stressful call center enviornment. The associate morale was impeccable."
good,Capital one is a fairly new bank with great benefits and opportunity for career advancement. Because they are new in the banking world compensation is low compared to other banking institutions.
good,Capital One is a great company to work for. It has a laid back atmosphere and fosters a strong team environment. Management values feedback however it does take a rather substantial amount of time before any process or policy changes take effect.
good,We all got laid off and everyone lost their jobs. I worked in Mortgage only and have no comment regarding other lines of business. Benefits and culture were great but no longer exist. I would not recommend working at Capital One Home Loans because it no longer exists.
good,"Great company to work for.  Unfortunately, closing mortgage loan program to include home equity loans. Excellent benefits.  Cares for the employee and customers"
good,I am so thankful with Capital One because the gave this amazing oportunity without any internal recomendations. they open their doors to a Young Dominican with high aspirations
good,"work life balance, compensation benefits job security and advancement and management and job culture. job work. rate this company. capital one home loans"
good,Capital One really respects their employees and show that by the amazing benefits that are offered. Capital One creates an environment where everyone's ideas and suggestions count!!
good,Days can be very hectic and busy.  Other days may be slower. Must be accurate to avoid overages or shortages in your drawer.  Great customers make the job fun.  Will meet a ton of people.  Management can ease the stress of the job at times.
good,"When I was there, I found that the culture was inventive, creative and encouraged expression and growth. I flourished throughout a variety of opportunities in different departments, and found my passion for my career in training through the guidance and direction of my supervisors. "
good,the work is very time consuming but once you get the hang of how to do the job the correct way for it to be done its pretty much smooth sailing . its also tiring after a while as well as any job. the job takes a lot of hard work and dedication.
good,a great learning experience.Like working with people to get them advanced in the work world.I enjoyed working with the staff. We treated each other like family and I appreciated that.
good,"This was a fantastic organization to be part of because coworkers, managers and supervisors were all approachable when questions surfaced.  This made our jobs very easy when expediting answer[s]  to consumer everyone was very well versed in their particular areas."
good,"Capital One is an amazing company to work for. They offer tuition reimbursement, competitive salary, and a fun safe place to come to everyday. Capital One brings family into work. They genuinely care about home and life balance."
good,Great job with great benefits. Community friendly. Wonderful staff where we all work together as a team. Putting our customers needs first was top priority.
good,"Capital One is a great place to work if you're looking for quick advancement--pending your performance and management's year-end review. You receive great benefits and can take advantage of corporate perks at all levels of employment. The workplace culture is very encouraging, challenging and fun. If you have  a great team, you will be excited to come to work, no matter how busy the day gets. If you want to advance within your first year of employment, you have to make yourself valuable and look internally for any open positions. In other words, it's possible but you have to make yourself visible and scope out new opportunities."
good,I still have many friends who also worked at Capital One and am in contact with them.  They alway worked closely together with employees to help them succeed.
good,Loved working for this company. The managers look at each individual to see what their strengths are. Great overall! Great work life balance.
good,Capital One trains their employees well and they want their employees to succeed. They have great incentives. They often have volunteer events that employees can be a part of and are taken into account at year end evaluations. I really enjoyed the workplace culture and how management wanted everyone to feel comfortable and for everyone to enjoy being at work.
good,"I worked with smart and nice people and I can't really complain about the company too much. However, I wasn't challenged enough, which was often disappointing. The data environment was outdated which prevented a lot of analyst to produce meaningful results in a timely fashion.

good,"Capital One is by far THE best employer that I've had the pleasure of working with. Capital One has a way of making you feel like a part of the family and whether you're an employee or a customer, you truly are a part of Capital One's family. This is one employer that values its employees as much as it values it customers."
good,"a typical work day was less structure, lots of autonomy and deadline driven, fun, team oriented environment. More focus and rewarded based on individuals goal and meeting targets.."
good,"Currently, I am the acting Supervisor for my bank branch. I oversee a small staff of four while my manager is away. I am responsible for opening the branch in a timely manner while adhering to policy opening procedures. I handle cash shipments, over-the-limit transactions, manage fraud risk, teller cash limits, branch cash limits, customer service and complaints, and monitor daily activities to ensure we remain in compliance with operations.  I monitor individual time-clocks, i.e lunch and breaks, to ensure my team does not go into over-time.  I am also responsible for managing our daily sales run rate to ensure that we remain at or above goal. I conduct outbound calling daily using calling scripts to generate new business and ensure customer satisfaction.  I generate new sales opportunities through lobby leadership and service interactions. "
good,Capital One was one of the best companies I've worked for. The management staff really looked out for the line level employees
good,"I love the support structure at Capital One. "
good,"Improved problem solving skills, great co-workers, excellent work environment, flexible work life balance"
good,"Recommend to anyone that's interested in this company. Typical day consist of numerous teller transactions. Management staff if very fair, really enjoy my co-workers"
good,Typical day consisted of responded to anywhere from 60-150 calls per shift. I learned how to communicate and diffuse situations. Management was great for provided feedback and tools to accomplish what they wanted. Co-workers were always eager to help. The hardest part about the job was taking an irate phone call before it was time for your shift to end because you have no way of controlling the type of call you are getting. The most enjoyable part of the job was the day to day interaction with co workers and customers alike. Even if it was just through the phone.
good,Overall Capital One is an excellent company to work for.   They put a TON into their employees and the benefits are extremely competitive and very hard to beat.
good,"Great work environment , very friendly and professional associates and the company has a great mission."
good,"Typical day at work was great, great customers and co-workers. I took so much experience from this company, management was always engaged and willing to train on all assets of the job. The hardest part of the job was not having enough time in one day to reach out to each and every customer and one day time. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to provide excellent customer service to each and every customer and working with awesome co-workers including management."
good,"Love the atmosphere, love to meet new people. enjoy going to work."
good,"capital one was always fun to go to, the staff was lovely the offices where aways bright and airy"
good,I start my day with managing my work and being a mentor for my teammates. I can do multi-tasking effectively and reach goals on a timely manner.
good,Capital One is an open company that allows the employees to voice issues and concerns. When view customers accounts and carefully impliment plan that allows us as specialist to give the best options. the hardest part about my job is not being able to satisfy that customer with what we have available. On the other hand the best part about my job is being able to help my customers restart the repairig of their account and their credit.
good,"A typical day at work is logging into about a dozen systems to be ready for the steady stream of calls. Learning new rules and regulations on a daily basis. Training cannot possibly cover everything you need to know. Barely scrapes the surface. A lot of fluff time in training to keep you happy or interested(?) instead of using the time to re-inforce what is important to keep customers and the government regulations happy (and to keep your job). The hardest part of the job was coping with the Drill Sargeant Training Mgr. who needs to practice what she preaches, should be trained in people skills and monitored for unprofessional behavior and dress. There are constant shift changes and seat changes. The company is in the state of flux right now so it is understandable, but somewhat annoying. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with a team of folks in a friendly environment where the managers and teammates are respectful, personable, and pleasant, having generous paid time off, having a gym with personal trainer, cafeteria, and incentive programs."
good,"I enjoyed every part of the job at Capital One. The only reason I left was because I felt a little cheated. We didn't have a head teller for 5months so I was filling in for that role, which I enjoyed very very much, but when I wanted to apply for this position I was told its not possible as I wasn't working there long enough. Other then that I loved my job at Capital One and I did regret quitting it."
good,Very busy day at work
good,Capital One was a great experience and a great place to work during the time I was there.
good,"Excellent benefits, good pay and monthly bonuses"
good,You learn a lot of new things. They give you full training so you are able to do everything from the teller and bankers side. You ring up transactions and you do everything from opening/closing accounts to sending out/approving wires.
good,Capital One ensures that you have the skills to succeed within the company. There is ample room for growth and development. Management staff is focused on making sure you have what you need to perform at your best.
good,Absolutely love the company. There are endless benefits! The job is not easy and there is a lot of competition. Capital One does compensate for any stress that you may experience. It's only a question if you are willing to be up to the task.
good,"As a relationship Banker, I enjoyed working with the clients and interacting with different people everyday.  This is a good company that will help you grow."
good,Capital One was my first real full time job when I was in college and It was great. The managers were very flexible with my school schedule. I learned so much while there and they really taught me how to be aggressive in the workplace and go after my goals.
good,Diversity and family oriented is a huge thing at Capital One. Capital One pushes work life balance for it's employees. They also offer fun days so as to de-stress and promote team work. Benefits are great!
good,"Capital One is a good company,  great benefits,  and pretty decent pay. The reason why I didn't enjoy the job is because I'm more of a free spirit.  I like to move around. You are literally stuck at your desk talking back to back calls non stop. It gets to be stressful and repetitive."
good,"Nice people and good culture, work-life balance is maintained and people care about you as an individual. As an intern, I wasn't exposed to amazing engineering practices, so I didn't learn much technically. For example, I never had any code or design reviews during my 3 months there."
good,I love everything about working at Capital One! I worked in the Auto Finance Department and I enjoyed helping customers with their accounts. I help them with solutions to bring their account current or gave better options that worked better for them.

good,"Capital One cares about their employees, ensuring that the associates feel important which makes for a positive atmosphere while working with customers coming into the branch. Positivity, empathy, and a keen eye are major keys for success with this company."
good,A day at Capital One would be assisting customers that have been victims of fraud. We would handle cases of identity theft and also someone gaining access to the customer credit card account and making illegal purchases. Also customers will call in to receive basic information regarding their account such as balance and payment due date.
good,"I have been with the company for 12 years and have enjoyed all of the benefits and options for growth within the company."
good,"Great place to work with lots of opportunity long weeks, learned alot, travel way too much to places like NYC and Texas. Too much food"
good,Supervisors were AWESOME and very understanding and helping.
good,Capital One rewards people that work hard and are looking to better themselves personally and professionally.
good,Customer service was more about service than sales. It was my first opportunity to work face to face with people. Management and co-workers where like family. The hardest part was the constant flow of staff. What I enjoyed the most was going out to see customers.
good,The culture and benefits packages are like no other.  The work environment fosters a cohesive atmosphere and brings everyone together including the community.
good,"This is an excellent company to work for.  There is plenty of room for advancement and it's based on your work, not who you know or politics.  Senior Management has an open door policy and they always welcome feedback for change.  Compensation is competitive, as are the benefits & bonus programs."
good,"I worked at Capital One for two years before leaving to join local law enforcement. I was hired as a Customer Service Coordinator and after 6 months on the production floor I was promoted to Customer Agent Advocate Team member (CAAT, which is a supervisor role). After another year, I posted for position in the Quality Assurance Dept. Capital One was great at providing performance feedback and rewarding great results i.e., team outings to the bowling alley and gas or grocery gift cards for exceeding goals."
good,Very employee oriented. Great customers and great overall staff
good,"Capital One is a veyr innovative, and refreshing company to strive and expand your skills. The modern morals and values of health management, charity and volunteerism, and overall equality are makes the company one that is diverse, and broad. Daily assignments are plentiful as well as engaging, teaching skills range from speaking to the general public, to being able to multi-task telephone operations and affidavit processing."
good,"It is a great company to work for, but not flexible enough for me. My supervisors were amazing and helped in any way they could. I dont have more to say"
good,"Loved this job, my manager was excellent, customer service and Collections representative, enjoyed the all of the medical benefits and tuition reimbursement"
good,I'm just an intern so I'm not sure how much my opinion counts for anything. For the internship they treat you super well and try to place you on great teams with good managers.
good,Capital one was and still remains the best job I’ve ever gotten to have. I would work It again in seconds and recommend it to anyone that asks about employement
good,"I worked as a customer service rep for the retail bank before it transitioned into 360. My manager was amazing, I had fun coworkers, the benefits were great and the location I worked at was very fun - there was a basketball hoop, pool table, ping pong table, and scooters to use on breaks. They regularly made efforts to show their employees appreciation with awards and competitions to win trips to other countries. My only complaint was the job - talking on the phone all day quickly burns you out, especially because the customers were rather rude sometimes."
good,"They take good care of there employees,  they have cook outs, ice cream days , they even shut down for a day to go outside on a Beautiful sunny spring day so we could go outside and fly kites that they got us.. they show there appreciation for there employees.  They pay good and room for advancement.."
good,"work has been great with capital one, we used to get maximum support from our seniors and have been a wonderful journey"
good,"Loved the experience I got from working at this financial institution. I definitely do have a recommendation. Towards the end of my life with Capital One Bank, it seemed to me that the financial institution was more number based rather than people based. While in the beginning, customers were happy to be at their favorite bank, as years went by, it seemed as if customers were beginning to loose interest. I understand that business is business, and the institution needs to make money. But I disagree in the was sales were being pushed on customers, even if they didn't want the products. Employees at branch level, should provide exceptional customer service in a genuine way, not so much of a robotic sales way. This drives customers away, and minimizes branch goals. I hope my review is of help, as this was a concern and a disappointment across many Capital One employees."
good,"Capital one is a fantastic place to work ! There's always positive energy , genuine personalities , and people are always willing to help. The pay and benefits are above average and they keep us engaged with galas , town halls , and other events like picnics."
good,"Great Job culture, Management and new technical solutions. "
good,Capital One is one of the best places of employment.  Even as a Temp- I still felt like I was a part of the team.   I worked with a great bunch of people- from management to my peers.
good,"ssist customers by solving any problems in effort to retain Capitol One Accounts. Make offers to customers in regard to credit card account limit, Annual percentage rate, and yearly fees."
good,Taking calls helping others solve their problems. Ive learned many things by working at Capital One dont let the customers bring you down find ways to help them so by the end of your call they are thanking you its always good to help others. Love my co workers we make each others day when you think your having a bad day we are a team so we work as a whole.The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work around positive people as well as being able to have fun as well as getting the job done.
good,I provided a short-term fuction for the organization. We/I were contracted through the accounting firm PwC and worked remotely from the the firm's location. The work involved was to meet standards and once the task was completed the contract expired. The total time of the contract was three months. Overall it was a good experience.
good,"No advancement, you sit in your cubical like a veal. Team leads only help if they like you, Once your on a team you have to help each other because the managers disappear as soon as your on the phone. The call center has their own groups, if you're not part of their group you are isolated."
good,"I love the company, the benefit package is very good."
good,"Keep business separate from personal, low management, coworkers were ok to work with, hardest part of job was mainteance of paper work and most enjoyable was succeeding at goals and requirements."
good,"Capital One is an excellent place to work. The company really shows their appreciate towards their employees by have food days, raffles, give always, and more!"
good,felt like I was in High school or middle school. The supervisor was a bit childish and allowed nonsense to go on that was offensive. If I was on another team I would still be there.
good,I was a ING employee who became a capital one employee through a merger. Capital one is micro managed and does not care about employees needs. I lost my daughter while working for the company they had no sympathy. When my son started a new school I needed to switch my schedule and they were not willing to work with me.
good,"I learned that when a company takes over another and in my situation the bank was bought and sold 3 times, no matter what, the new management team is always out to change things around sort of put their stamp on the company, A typical day in the last year was wondering if you were going to get fired as around you your friends and colleagues were being let go, what I learned was to work harder and always be myself, the hardest part of the job was the continues change of personnel. the most enjoyable times was when we were able to do our jobs after all I have known my clients for 10 years and I knew how to treat them and thus make more money for the company."
good,This company still has a lot to learn about treating their employees with respect. Also most mangers have to work 10 hour days
good,Incoming cold calls and call log daily.  Must meet goals weekly.
good,"capital one was a fun place to work. however, roll over rate for employment for contractors is horrible. they will end your contract without warning.."
good,nice job great atmosphere and coworkers take a lot of trips to places and coworkers are willing to help if you need it hardest part of job can be the challenging customers
good,"Capital one, in certain departments will grind you down until you have nothing left to give. They were voted the best company to work for 3 years growing and not in 2016. This comes at no surprise to me."
good,no opportunity for advancement once you reach certain pay or tittle
good,Capital One is a great place to work. I developed my skills as a self starter and hard working individual as well as working well with a team.
good,"Capital One is a great company that puts their employees first. As far as management is concerned that is a different story. I work in a rough sales environment which is not the issue. Management lack communication The raises aren't something to shout about. As far as advancement, if you aren't doing a super stellar job then be prepared to stay in your position for a couple of years. Life and work balance depend on your manager and business needs."
good,The Pay was not enough for the amount of money i was handling. There were robberies happening around the city and i didn't feel safe because we had no security.
good,"Great learning experience, great working team. overall the vacation hours provided to part timers were awesome. 401k was amazing aswell. Increase in pay was pretty horrible."
good,"I enjoyed working with my team of coworkers, my customers were great it was a fun but structured work environment. I would definitely recommend others to work there"
good,"We are encouraged to complete web based trainings during down time when we are not on calls. Team building events occur every quarter, usually we have 100 percent participation.  Our manager is hands on and usually gives us feed back on our calls, especially if we need training on how to handle a specific call type."
good,some managemnt is ok they kinda have favorits up there but for the most park i love the job i have fun everything its so fun there really enjoy the wow factor of capital one
good,"Loved the people I worked with, however my particular branch was so understaffed.  The branch manager was racisit and reported but nothing was ever done about it. So many complaints from more then just myself. So many people, 14 to be exact just walked out on the job."
good,"Focused environment, skill building and social engagement booster also eye opening in terms of advancement. Management was good and you could go to them anytime for work related and none work related counseling. Team work was efficient and the co-workers were a constant support system in fulfilling our goals and staying on task. The hardest part of the job was working while knowing that you could not advance to a higher position this often killed the working momentum. The enjoyable part was using team work and knowing that you were obtaining some skills I would be able to use in the future."
good,"The work environment fluctuated greatly between a dependable rewarding job and a quandary. I got along with my coworkers, the benefits were great and I learned a lot about financial solutions for my life."

good,Capital One is an extremely diverse organization that promotes excellence and personal achievement. It is possible to achieve promotions rapidly and the organization encourages personal growth.
good,"The culture of the company shows they care about not only the clients but the employees as well."
good,This company really does its best to make sure its employees are happy there. Benefits are great and room for growth. Took me two times to get hired but don't let that stop you. It is definitely worth a couple of attempts.
good,"I joined as part of the TDP program. This program helped me grow as an engineer and opened several opportunities for me through out Capital One. At Capital One you will work with one of the more modern tech stacks and be required to take ownership of your application(development,testing, monitoring, infrastructure, etc.) Overall Capital One is a great company to work for."
good,"Capital One is a great place to work. It is a collaborative environment, where your opinion matters. Employee satisfaction is at the top of their list and the voice of the employee matters. If given the opportunity to return I would go back without question."

good,"I had a fair experience working here. I did feel some of the employees could have been screened a little more as some where unprofessional but the training and job was fair,"
good,"helping customers with their request ,laughing and having a simple everyday life with co-workers..as a customer service agent for the last past 7 years, I have learned to never take anything personal. Managers are there for a reason, to make sure that you reach your goals, to correct you when you are wrong and encourages you. diversity is the key. the hardest part is when your customer is not satisfied with whatever you are offering and the only option is against the company's rules/policy. The most enjoyable about the job is when you are able to put a smile on a customer's face at the end of the call."
good,"f you know the right people within the company working at Capital One is a rewarding experience. They do take care of their employees from an on site clinic, to a health and fitness center, to gourmet style cafes throughout the campus. It's enriched with positive cultures and diversity, and even will help its' associates when they are in need of help in any circumstances. I often felt I could rely on my manager for anything I needed to further myself as an associate, as well as an individual."

good,"Great Job"
good,you can learn a lot from other people. i joined during a migration to the cloud using snowflake and amazon web services. there was volatility in the management when i was there.
good,Capital One is flexible on times to work and leave.  It offers many opportunities to advance they are willing to help with schooling and promotions it treats you as though your opinion matters.
good,"The work hours are extremely flexible and how long your day is, depends entirely on the work due that day. The hierarchical structure is pretty much flat and everyone is approachable if you need help or just want to talk about anything. It was overall, a very nice experience for me. The only con is that for some reason, movement between teams is a bit restricted in the beginning so you may have to work on something that may not be within your fields of interest,"
good,"Great company, quarterly bonuses, nice salary, good hours, advancement opportunities, corporate discounts, direct deposit, friendly/helpful coworkers s"
good,The work days were slow but the management was understanding of that and had downtime tasks that were approved. The staff was all very nice. Each branch was required to volunteer so many hours a quarter and I really enjoyed that company rule.

good,"Solid benefits, good work-life balance, and friendly coworkers.  Management was clear about goals and company reporting.  Learned a lot about finsv and digital products."
good,In house BPO in Alabang. Good benefits and compensation. Management and team are exeptional. However one downside is the graveyard schedule. Schedule bidding is not happening even if the employee is performing still we are not being assigned to a schedule we deserve.
good,"The benefits and working conditions were excellent!"
good,"The company is fair with compensation and bonuses.  They demand hard work from you and give you all the technology devices to work after hours so that you can leave on time but still get work done at home.  It's a large company so things work differently between departments.  In my tenure there, I felt I was treated fair, compensated well, and given opportunities that I would probably not have received elsewhere.  Would recommend this company to anyone."
good,"A fantastic place to gain your sales and/or banking experience. The management was great and your time and effort do not go unnoticed. Overall, no complaints."

good,"good company to grow with, very organized, great management team."
good,"Capital One has provided myself and my family a stable company with superior benefits, accompanied by a non-standard work shift that has met multiple needs over the short term. My typical workday is very predictable, in that associates have a very defined role that is not often varied. Capital One does a wonderful job screening applicants, so you can be assured you are working with true professionals. The distance I have to travel to and from work each day makes it hard to be connected to home when I'm at work."
good,Friendly place to work. Real people. Helpful. Flexible hours.
good,"Did not work directly for Capital One. I Worked as a contractor. Durring my time there, the environment was nice and I enjoyed the work. I may have gotten unlucky on the manager."
good,"A typical day is fast-paced. "
good,Management did not provide the requisite training necessary to be successful.  Newly developed department that had new management which were clueless about direction.
good,"Great place to work, wonderful team atmosphere, great training.  Constant changes with management only concern-- which meant you had to adapt fast to change.  The hardest part of the job was the constant change in managers and the most enjoyable part was the people/team atmosphere.  Lots of ""fun days"" where we would take off from work to incorporate Team Building in a fun environment."
good,"The overall environment was awesome. In other words, we were spoiled. I loved working at COAF but there was no room for advancement and the pay was not enough."
good,"Engagement associate is at a all time high at Capital One Bank.  As a part of the management team one of my core jobs was to ensure that associates felt that they were apart, and appreciated.  I did this by acknowledging what the customers had to say about them via KPI scores customer satisfaction.  Monthly theme luncheons for the top associates who customer were raving fans."
good,"Capital One did not support me through depression and domestic violence. Otherwise a great company to work for. Mangers can be very petty and conniving. Watch your back, do your work, don't get too friendly."
good,"Capital One had an amazing worth ethic, and they really valued their employees and any hard work that took place during my 2 year contract position with them. An amazing experience with so many area's of personal growth."

good,lots of ammenities benefits are awesome not well with schedule and adaption if you have small children lots of perks though.Parking is long if you have a later shift.
good,"The senior staff and coworkers at Capital One were like a second family to me. I have learned a ton during my time there. It was unfortunate that, after many years, I realized that consumer finance wasn't a suitable career field which made me leave the industry as a whole."
good,An industry leader that provided great working environment and training to maximize the potential of their staff. Dynamic leadership that was onsite and provided support with day to day operations.

good,"•	Performed Functional Testing, User Interface Testing, Regression Testing and Build Acceptance Testing after every deployment. "
good,"My position at Capital One was my first real debt collection position. I worked in middle collections so my duties were more varied. I had my own accounts which was really neat because I was the only one working with each client and that was less confusing for the client and for myself. We worked on teams and Capital One encouraged togetherness by having each team go out and do something fun. We would leave work early and go bowling, out to eat and have picnics, just our team members, and Capital One would pay for all of it. They are very generous employers. The pros were that work was so fun, that it very hard not love your job. The con was the scheduling. We worked 12pm-9pm, Tuesdays thru Friday nights and then 7am-4pm mandatory on Saturdays, which made Saturdays a little groggy. I worked from 12-9pm which meant driving home on dark roads with poor drainage, rain, sleet or shine."
good,Capital One has excellent work processes and training programs for employees.  You are not limited in your ability to advance your career as long as you apply yourself.  The benefits are excellent and the pay is comparable to the rest of the industry.  I found issues with work life balance as they provided adequate vacation but never afforded you time to use it.  The raises and bonuses were not what was promised.
good,"Capital One is a very great job to work for when it comes to stability, compensation, and benefits. I love what I do however, it can become a bit stressful when you have so many changes going on within the department you are in."
good,"The most difficult part of my position was being a contractor and not being a real part of the team.  I worked as hard but contractors do not receive any of the perks that associates receive. We all worked so well together, the social interaction seemed like a missing piece. I am a team player so this is a challenge."
good,Another Great day at Capital One. Learned building effective relationships with Card Holders.
good,Excellent Company with a great culture. Always looking to growth in all markets to become the primary bank for all consumers.
good,And exciting experience when I was there but the job quickly becomes repetitive and the excitement levels start to drop.

good,I worked at Capital One on more than one occasion as a Temporary Employee under contract and they continued to call me back in various roles. A typical day included review of daily work and completing required files or paperwork. I did not find the job hard and the most enjoyable part of the job was working with great people.

good,"The environment at Capital One was excellent, unfortunately the management has opportunities, workload was immense but manageable, Most co-workers were helpful, hardest part of the job was addressing the contingent population differently than the Permanent employees."
good,"Very enjoyable and energetic environment both on campus and  off.  Ratings for compensation and benefits plus security and advancement do not apply as I was a consultant.  Salary rates paid to consultants are very competitive if not more so than other financial institutions or employers for the level of skill required and experience across multiple platforms."
good,Capital One was a very good place to work. My co-workers were always there management was always there. I just want a different environment. Something smaller and more personable and of course more money. I was offered a large raise when I left Capital One to go to First National. The hardest part of this job was leaving my good customers. They all hated to see me go. The most enjoyable part of the job was my customers
good,Capital One took care of their employees even after they decided to close states call center to outsource to foreign country.
good,I would contribute and participate in the morning huddles. Once we opened I would wait on customers while doing scheduling and anything else that was needed.

I also got the pleasure of meeting new people from different backgrounds. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting and building relationships with the customers.
good,"Capital One provided a very positive atmosphere to work in.  I was a Sr. Risk Representative in the Collections Departments (Outbound/Inbound) 30-150 days past due.  I enjoyed touching the lives and providing help to the customers I assisted from a day to day basis.  I became number 34 our of 3,000 representatives in my first month on the phones.  I was offered an opportunity to advance to outbound past 180 days, a challenge I was looking forward to.  My team all strived to become better. I was very well respected and a source and role model for my team mates.  I spent my spare time reading company policies and guide lines that were essential to offer options tailored to our customers needs.  I was in the 98 percentile with my quality assurance monitors. Although the company offered an excellent benefits package they made it very challenging to use vacation and PTO especially.  My employment came to an end when my father passed away.  Great company to work for."
good,"This is one of the best places I have worked. I am hoping I am able to find a position in Tampa, FL soon. They love to reward the employees which is awesome."
good,"Fast paced invironment, limited supervision, had to maintain a certain quota."
good,I work in a remote drive thru. All the days were pretty much the same. I looked forward to seeing the customers to hear how their day/evening was. I loved all my co-workers. We really were a great time. We did a lot of show coaching to help one another. The hardest part was leaving. he most enjoyable part was working with the customers. I learned a lot from managers and employees.
good,"Capital One is a great place to work.  Unfortunately, like all companies, they had to lay off several thousand people due to the economy."
good,"We had such a variety of work each day.  It was challenging, it was fun, but we did get a lot done in one day.  I learned almost 87 different work types, from easy things as Name changes to the hardest like Affidavits. "
good,Good place to work. Capital One Bank pays excellent wages. I learned a lot about selling bank products.
good,"i loved working with my co-workers and i miss working with them, i can see the company value and culture which was very promissing. For me , looking back if i had the flexablty on work schedual , i wouldn't mind working 7 days a week and some. i loved my job. Enjoyable part of the job for me was when i uncover the needs for customer and solve customers problem, that probably from my i CAN DO attitude satisfaction. I always ask my self what could have done, if i was a manager? the answer to that is , i would be open mind, i would have two ways communications ,so can learn and improve ,be more flexable and i would have lead by example, that would have creat 500% dependable, comet ted, result driven and happy employee.

good,"Morale withiin the team is good, learned different department goals, and was able to work with different team to achieve goals together. We each had indivdual goals, and speak with our teams, work together to surpass goals."
good,"Capital One is a corporation to work for. The management team that is over the fraud department, is extremely knowledgeable. While the culture and management is great, this company should endeavor to pay their entry level employees at a higher minimal wage."
good,"Because I worked in a department that I was not fully trained for most days were stressful nevertheless I enjoyed my job. I learned a lot about the industry I worked in and met many cool people. Every floor has endless free coffee/teas & vending machines for your enjoyment. The cafeteria's are awesome...my favorite was Bldg. 6. Capital One definitely does care about its employees and customers but managers I worked under were either incompetent, power-hungry, just there for the paycheck, to name a few....with the exception of one manager who was awesome. Job Security/Advancement was great depending on who you worked under. They definitely pay you your worth and benefits are unsurpassed of any company I have ever worked for!"
good,"I love working at Capital One. The work experience, atmosphere, and benefits are amazing. However, I believe the management team could be a little more flexible with understanding how to juggle outside life and work."
good,This company doesn’t pay that much for the work they ask. Goals are hard to reach witting company and management favors others. I myself enjoyed working there but didn’t enjoy favoritism.

good,"i love working here but i am ready for advancements being that i just got my bachelors degree."
good,"Capital One offers many opportunities to earn bonuses and company recognition for above and beyond performance. If you have the drive and determination to apply yourself and give an A effort to customers and be a team player, then Capital One is for you. There are company sponsored events that allow you to let your hair down and even share with your family. This is a company that pushes each person to achieve their personal and career goals whether or not it is with the company. The environment is friendly but can be competitive if you so choose, with many resources to aide you on life's journey. The down side is you max out on earning potential. High performances are rewarded with raises but can cause you to reach the maximum salary for that classification within a few years. It can be a lot sooner depending on your starting salary relative to the maximum."
good,"Good place to work and further advancement located in Plano,TX. Management does a great job of ensuring you feel taken care of and that you matter. Great people."
good,"The company will help you grow and will give a lot of free trainings, food days, and a lot of motivation coming from the managers and coaches. Working with them is fun."
good,There are many avenues to improve your skill set and training and self-learning are strongly encouraged. The challenge can be to find the time to take classes when the work load is heavy.
good,"A typical at work consisted of performing a wide variety of transactions including check cashing, depositing, transfers, cash advances, and withdrawals. I've learned excellent customer service skills and impeccable handling abilities."
good,Great benefits and work life balance. Corporate politics advanced people unworthy of positions. Personal relationships were more important that production.

good,Capital One was the best company i worked for. There was no opportunity for advancement for entry level positions. The company created a very laid back environment with many perks.

good,"Capital One is a great company. "
good,We start our day. We may or may not have meetings due to scheduling but for the most part every financial center is on the same page with the culture and day to day communications. Best part is being in leadership and developing new team members.
good,"During my tenure at Capital One, I found it to be a company that wanted their employees to succeed. Many managers took pride in saying that they helped x number of people get promotions and move on to bigger things. Capital One helped you to build your resume, practice interviewing, and seek employment that would best fit your needs/skills whether or not they was with Capital One."
good,"My job was so rewarding, we got people into their dream homes.  I loved our operation partners and the customers.  The culture was amazing.  Everyone acted as a team and wanted to help each other."
good,"love the bank, but its unfortunate how much the bank is changing. The fact that they offer school benefits, but once you apply for school they cannot accommodate your schedule. Nor will they allow you to move up at a good pace. you have to know someone to move up"
good,I loved working at Capital One and I hope to go back someday. The pay is very competitive and it is a great place for anyone to apply skills they have acquired.
good,"Mission-driven company. Great place to work, except for too many reorgs and redeployments. Great culture. Colleagues are willing to help out each other."
good,"I worked for Frontier Secure, that supported Capital One credit cards.  Capital One has great products and focus, the management at Frontier Secure had little direction and was constantly changing, sometimes in the opposite direction.  Granted, it was a new company and it was growing.  It started out as a call center above and beyond any I had worked for.  The company put the employees first, the client 2nd, and everything else a distant third.  We had an excellent performance based compensation plan that drove our numbers to the highest NPS center in all of Capital One worldwide."
good,"Intense Work Environment and a great work place with good ethics and they are concern about the well being of their staffs."
good,"Depending on the branch and manager it could change the experience a lot. but overall a good place to work, Good training, very neat branches team work implemented"
good,"I worked here for a total of five years, started at the age of 20. The benefits of working for such a big company were endless, such as tuition reimbursement (up to $5000 a yr), paid time off, dental insurance and vision insurance cost me little to nothing for full coverage, monthly incentives starting at $800+, not to mention how much the company gives back to the community and their employees.  Downside is that I worked for Credit Card Collections, handling escalated calls, which is a bit messy. You need a strong sense of character to be able to handle the stress."
good,"Capital one is a great employer, they have great benefits and bonuses. Not that easy to advance in but definitely a fun place to work. Schedule is not the best as it requires weekends, can make it hard for balancing work and life but overall an amazing place to be a part of ."
good,I hear that now the commission is alot less then when I was there. The products sell themselves. Very fun environment. Just wish they promoted more from within
good,I choose not to answer. Because i am currently still working there and my opinion has not be fully made. But if i move on then i would create an review for company.
good,"Fun work environment the ability to work remotely for some roles great company values, corporate citizenship and volunteerism,  Visibility to and from leadership, onsite campus amenities (cafes, gym, health center), great benefits, awesome people and opportunities for training and growth."
good,Capital one is a great company. It is one of the best places I have ever worked for in my whole career. Sometimes staffing makes it stressful for me as a Teller Manger which makes my personal life also stressful
good,"Great company, benefits were excellent and flexibility, would recommend to others. Great opportunities to excel within the company and career advancement opportunities."
good,As a customer for my first credit card I was so ready to help others build credit learn to safe and overall help with anyones banking needs that came my way. The company gives you knowledge and once you become close to customers its easier to help with problems they may have with banking or ways to improve and make it easier.
good,"wonderful placed to work been here for 4 years"
good,"Banking is changing and will require both employees and customers to adapt to technology. As a result of these technological changes, there are many cut backs. "

good,"Typical work day- process debit card fraud claims phoned in by bank customers. I learned how much fraud there is in using debit cards and written checks.  Management was open and straight-forward, strived to make work place productive and enjoyable.  Most enjoyable part of my job were my co-workers and how we worked a one unit."
good,"Capital One is a great place to work when you are bringing your skillset and learning the company skillset.  I have learned to be patient, take constructive coaching and learned a lot of new tools via digital technology.  I enjoy my co-workers and the most hardest part of the job is not being able to cure all accounts worked.  The most enjoyable part of the job is to turn the customers day around and make it a positive experience."
good,Overall culture is great; pay/benefits are good; development opportunities are available for those that are driven.
good,"Capital One has an outstanding commitment to customers, associates, and the community. Fun and casual work environment that is also focused on productivity."

good,"Capital One believes in its employees and its mission to deliver the best banking experience to its customers.  It's a fun place to work with various challenges, that allows its employees to grow without feeling overwhelmed."
good,"I was with the company for 13 years doing a myriad of jobs. The most remarkable aspect for them was their diversity. They truly supported the minorities- asian, lgbt, etc. The compensation wasn't that great in my latter years there. The leadership could be astounding but that wasn't always the case. Truly an excellent company to work for. Highly recommended."
good,"Capital One was a great place to work and everyone was great to work with. Even when the day got a little hectic, we all worked together as a team to get our work done. I always enjoyed getting up and going to work."
good,"I worked for Capital One as a Payment Assistant during my academics. A normal day was talking to delinquent customers over the phone and helping them make their overdue payments. The management was absolutely brilliant and supported me with my studies. I worked for a fun loving loving team and got on with everyone in the team. The hardest part of the job was I guess with it being a collections job was highly target driven. However my immediate manager and team were so supportive at all times that it hardly felt like and issue. The overall working culture at Capital One was so relaxed and fun loving that I still miss being there. This job, as was during my academics, gave me a lot of opportunity to put into practise what I learned."
good,"I overall liked it but it was a temporary position, management was strict which kept everyone on their job employees all had differnet tasks throughout the day and we worked aroud deadlines that were always met no matter what."
good,"My current job tenure as a Sr. Advance Customer Service Banking Specialist for Capital One Bank has been a great experience. My responsibilities as a Sr. Banking Specialist is to assists associates when an Mgr is not available, maintain team morale with planned functions while performing my regular duties assisting customers with questions or issues regarding their Checking, Savings, Loan accounts.

good,"I really enjoyed and loved my job as a teller. I am a people person and love to help others while giving them an outreach of better life standards while at it. This job gave me the ability to do so. I love the fact that Iw hen in need of help, my co-workers and I always worked as a team to get things done. I can say the hardest part of the job was trying to get a very firm person their word to sit with a banker for some offers we may have had for them. Although it may have been hard, the very convincing person I am, I pretty much succeeded. I enjoyed everyhting about the job, the customers, my co-workers, the atmosphere, and so on"
good,Culture and people were great.  I had to travel a lot which made it hard for my young family. I needed a job with less travel. Overall it was a great company to work for.
good,great company with great benefits. always does right for their employees. Salary is always competitve with capital one. annual reviews are honest and help their employees grow
good,after spending multiple years and working for multiple groups my experience has always been pleasant. Individual leaders have their own styles of management so aligning to that is important.
good,Family like staff. Works around life problems most of the time. Training was long but its easy to keep the knowledge. Most managers were easy to approach.
good,"I was very impressed with their change management process after they announced a site closure. While I was offered the chance to work for them again, I would work for them again!"
good,I have nothing to put here. There is no way to skip this process.  I did not want to fill out a review at all.  You should have an option to skip this.
good,"Capital One is a great place to work. Great benefits and competitive pay. As with all companies, certain areas are tougher to manage than others. Would recommend."
good,Great job but some management/trainers were not great and did not communicate necessary information clearly. Left in the dark on what was going on or what to do very often.
good,"I've never been so sad to leave a job! I I would have never left Capital One if it weren't for the shut down in our town. Definitely has some cons, but the pros completely way out the cons. It was a family setting. Biggest con is they often close due to outsourcing."
good,"I was working with Allied Universal contracted with Capital One. I did patrols, interacted with staff, and solved issues regarding other staff that affected my position. I also reported any faulty or broken equipment to the maintenance department."
good,"good company"
good,"Love this place. Great minds meeting in an organic culture. Some thrive and some leave. I’ve had a wonderful experience with the company. There are times when decisions aren’t aligned which can create dysfunction, but that’s also how company’s grow."
good,I enjoyed working at Capital One but the management was constantly changing.  Over the course of less than two years i had five difference managers.  But I loved the culture and see how people thrive in that relaxed environment.
good,"Team work is one of the best experience I have learned.  Great work life balance but lots of  work.  As a previous people manager, performance management can be brutal and need to be addresses using Radical Candor"
good,"The company offer great benefits which offsets the pay.  Diverse culture to work in with lots of opportunities to volunteer in your local community."
good,My typical work day would be from 8 am to 5 pm. I learned a lot in this role including how to reimage Macbooks and PC's from usb drives and network connections. The workplace culture is very welcoming and relaxed. The hardest part of the job was dealing with somewhat impatient or non understanding end users while troubleshooting their issues. The most enjoyable part of the job to me personally was the environment and colleagues; We worked together very well as a team resolving issues.
good,They have massive layoffs and always let go of the tenors instead to keep the employees young and fresh. Management will set you up but there are some great managers and people who has been there for a long time. It's just one of those jobs where you cant win for losing. Take your chances learn your job and people around you
good,"I loved working at capital one for the culture and benefits, however career advancement was stagnant. I was in the call center, constantly met with an onsite career coach, attended seminars, and interviewed for multiple positions but was never placed elsewhere. I only accepted my position to get my foot into capital one so that when I finished school I could move up. Never happened after almost 2 years, so I left."
good,"A typical day at capital one would be logging in to your computer and taking calls for hours on end. I wasn't cut out for banking or work at home so for this I resigned. My coworkers there loved it, I'm a people person and I thrive in more human environments."
good,"This job has great benefits. Health, dental vision, PTO and many more. I love capital one. The only bad this I can say is, it’s always changing. I typically don’t mind change. But it’s way to much sometimes and it can very stressful. Management is okay. This past year it seems like they let go of a lot of great managers and kept a lot of poor ones."
good,Everything about Capital One is great! A typical day would include coming in and performing you task that are well prepared and laid out for you to obtain your daily goals. They allow you to create your own schedule and the campus is top of the line. Meals are discounted in certain areas so that you are allowed to be healthy while working.
good,The company overall is great and I would go back if the pay rate ever increases. There are a lot of great people there who make it a family environment/
good,Its a great experience working in Capitalone. Getting the opportunities to work the latest technologies. Great exposure to working with new technologies. Balance professional and personal life.
good,Nothing say capital one bieng one of best company i worked for at that time but things get very low and time and matrix becae really hard to get .........
good,Capital One is a wonderful place to work and I still would be working there if my job hadn't been eliminated along with 450 other jobs.  I miss not working there very much.
good,"I loved the job, I would typically send emails, make a few outbound calls an receive inbound calls. I did account management for several business accounts as well as build file cases for subpoenas."
good,"The culture in the main branch is awesome and very upbeat and friendly.  The culture in the field is different in that you are expected to work as long as it takes to get the job down, which can and will include nights and weekends and the occasional call while on vacation."
good,capital one bank good place to work ...capital one bank  has god working environment but they are going through a lot of changes  so their is no more job security
good,Overall great company culture and benefits.  The company is very focused on the company mission of Changing Banking for Good.  There Lots of high performers therefore advancement is difficult.
good,great place to work at. great environment. it is easy to learn and adapt to. there is opportunity for bonuses and the customers are very very friendly
good,"Capital One really values it's employees and during my time there that was very apparent to be the case. Work-life balance is a big reason people stay with Capital One for years and years. Were it not for an external source that lead to my position no longer being there, I could have seen myself at Capital One for years to come. Great management, great benefits, and a great place to work. I would recommend working at Capital One to anyone in the finance industry looking for a great company to work for."
good,"I was contractor there for 2 years enjoyed my time working with great management and team associates.I learned a lot and moved up from mortgage document processor to loan file setup, would loved to have stayed but assignment ended."
good,"Great company to work for, though they rely on extremely green analysts that they almost exclusively promote from within. With that said, it's an extremely pleasant place to work with growth potential and I've only seen two rounds of layoffs in my six years, both very limited in scope."
good,"Review social media feeds from customers"
good,"I had a productive day. I had a lot of patients since the vaccine days are only scheduled once a year. The nurses and other staff were very nice as well as majority of my patients. However, there were  some who seemed to be rude and self entitled. The hardest part of this job is to deal with these ill-mannered patients though very minimal. Most enjoyable part is to tend to my patients who listen and respect me the way I respect them. It makes me happy when I see them leave my clinic with a smile"
good,"I loved my time at Capital One, however I managed a large team that required my presence daily. In 2016 I encountered serious health diagnosis which required 4 major surgeries.  My absence made it necessary that I resign because I couldn’t successfully perform my role."
good,CapitalOne is a great company to work for. They do a really great job making all their employees feel welcome and enjoy what they do. They also offer competitive pay rates and great benefits. The hardest part of the job was hours (I worked from 3pm-12am 5 days a week). To change hours - you must submit a shift bid. The shift bids were once a month and my request for hours change was never chose in 7mos.
good,"Every day at Capital One was an opportunity to learn something new and work on your professional development, whether is was customer interactions or company training."
good,Great Company to work for. Capital One has great benefits and offers a good work/life balance. The culture is definitely something you witness and experience on a daily basis.
good,Capital One is an AMAZING company to work for! I do not have anything negative to say about the company. They offer flexible work schedules even if it's temporary (ex: for school). They offer cost efficient insurance packages (my opinion because it's just me)
good,"I enjoyed my time at Capital One, but it is up to you showcase your achievements. You can't rely on management, I had 2 great managers in 20yrs. Speak up when things aren't going well, don't expect someone else to do it for you."
good,Capital One was a great job to have. I would recommend family and friends to apply with Capital one. The pay was fair and upper management understood was professional.
good,Capital one was very employee friendly and showed much appreciation for employees. They did contest which prizes where grated with half of a day and pd time which Capital One would pay for a fun outing.
good,Capital One is a good place to work and develop your talents. I would recommend that yo voice your thoughts of change and help with implementation in order to climb the ladder.
good,"Great work environment "
good,"capital one will make you feel appreciated in the work place. Salary can be better is low for field. Other companies pay more but they dont make you feel appreciated. "
good,"Enjoyed my time with the company, needed to move on to finish personal educational goals. Fun work environment, very engaging and has a customer first business model."
good,"Loved working there, would still be there if it wasnt for the manager. I was employed at Capital One for 7 years with great advancement opportunities the entire time. During the last year I was there, the manager that I had was beyond full of herself and, in her eyes, never did anything wrong, even when it was blatantly obvious. Theres a saying that people dont quit jobs, they quit managers, and that is 100% the truth about Capital One. The company itself is amazing and extremely good to its employees, but the people they choose to put into management should really be scrutinized."
good,"The push to improve technology skills was a theme that ran through every day. Fun place to work, great people and work/life balance too. Business and Technology people workewell together."
good,"I worked as a contractor, and was treated very well. I really enjoyed that I was able to work from home frequently. There were many rewards and tokens of appreciation from my manage."
good,"I feel that the opportunities within Capital one are really nice if you would like to grow within your current role. However, it would seem that promotions are harder to come by even thought they do provide you with opportunities to grow within your profession for future opportunities."
good,"I had a very good experience working at Capital One.  I enjoyed the department (HR).  The associates were pleasant and knowledgeable.  The company cares about its employees.  Unfortunately, my position was temporary. I would love to be an employee of Capital One instead of a contracting agency."
good,Capital One is primarily a credit card and car loan bank.  It has attempted home loan originations and divested themselves of it.  It has attempted investment services and is divesting itself of it.
good,Managers are very approachable and easy to talk to. Enveryone is energetic. Workload can be heavy or light depending on the queue of calls. Tools are very easy to navigate and product is also good.
good,"Leader in change, change is constant, being Well Managed is expected, recognition and opportunities are consistently available.  Very competitive though they encourage collaboration and new ideas.    The most difficult part of the job was the impacts that change had on the employment status as of result of those changes (Job Elimination seems to be part of the culture)."
good,I enjoyed working there. It was a very relaxed and fun place to work. I was a contract employee but I would definitely work there again. I really enjoyed the people.
good,"I would have liked to move up and stay with the company but since they shut down their mortgage division I have no choice but to look for other options.  Very employee oriented company, was happy there."
good,A typical day at work would be taking my calls and in between playing games to win prizes. At this job I learned how to multi-task as far as taking calls and handling other job related things at the same time.
good,Supported VP and Directors.  Workplace culture was best I have ever experienced.  Hardest Part of the job was just learning each individual manager and their preferences.  I loved the flexibility of work/home balance.
good,"Capital one is probably one of the best entry level jobs in the area, however it was not for me. If you can handle sitting for 8 hours and constantly talking then this is for you. The emotions on the call range way too much for me, one second someone is nice and you have a great conversation and the next call you have someone cussing you out. It was too up and down for me. Cap one does create a great culture but the stress of the job, especially if you have personal things going on, is not worth it. It’s hard to be empathetic and caring when you are going through your own trials. It’s very draining trying to maintain an upbeat, perfect tone and composure when you’re on the phone. You hear sad stories everyday and it truly takes a toll on you. Some people enjoy talking and helping others through anything so they’ll probably be a perfect fit, by for me, it’s a no."
good,Over all great place to work at depending on the location and on the department. Auto financing and Banking were the departments I worked at and were both very good.
good,"Capital One is probably the best company  I have worked for.  The benefits and life/balance are amazing.  The culture is like no other.  "
good,"Fun and stimulating workplace.  Job security is a concern.  Great benefits and atmosphere.  Management changes quite often, so be prepared for change.  Great cafeterias and beautiful campus"
good,Management is supportive of employees.  Always feel welcome to share opinion.  I enjoy my coworkers and my boss - there are many things to do on campus.
good,Very competitive environment but overall nice people and very nice working conditions. Great perks if you're a full-time associate. not so great if you're a contractor.
good,Very happy working there. Take good care of employees. Fun uptempo workplace. Everyone is willing to lend a hand and push you to be better every day you are there.
good,Capital One is a great place to work!! You will find a lot of great helpful people and all the support you'll need from the managers to help with your daily job.
good,productive and digital. excellent place to work. flexible but no work life balance. always hiring always promoting. management makes sure you are well prepared for next position
good,Corporate banking environment. Slow quiet days. The culture is diverse and fun. They should have more associate gatherings. Alot of hierarchy issues. Still great place to work nothing really bad to say
good,capital one is a great company to join if your are looking for advancement and a career at any age. this is a company that takes care of there employees.
good,"Overall, Capital One was a great company to start my career with. The culture is largely dependent upon the department you are working in. Regardless of your title, if you posses the knowledge your voice will be heard. At times it is a very strategic company in terms of being promoted."
good,"Some days were very busy, some days were very slow. I learned about the banking world, and how they will bend over backwards for customers with money, and do nothing for the people with no money. I learned that banks want to just sell their product no matter if it is good for the customer or not."
good,"A typical day at work. I arrive about 10-15 minutes before the start of  my shift. Within that time I would begin to start up my workstation and begin checking emails, while conversing with the people sitting next to me to get an idea of the work flow such as, what is driving the calls and if there are any updates based on our policies or systems. What I learned from this job is patience, I also learned it is always best to double check/confirm tasks customers want me to accomplish, in order to avoid errors resulting in a negative experience for the customer and the company. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who believe you are not trying to help them, when in fact I will present them with numerous options to show there is a willingness on my part to resolve their issue. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you meet and interact with at work. There we really were a family and everyone supported each other."
good,Great place to work. People are a very smart and articulate. Work life balance is a big plus. The culture is very diverse. If you do get into Capital One do not expect to get promoted unless you are a complete rock star. The bar for promotions is very high. The promotions system is clouded in secrecy to prevent anyone from knowing why the other person got promoted. Benefits are great! 401K is exceptional. Communication and influencing other are the keys to success here. You cannot get anything done without building a consensus.
good,"Very fun laid back place to work. Not business casual dress code. You can wear jeans, flip flops, etc Really laid back Fun Job! If I was still in VA I would still be there."
good,Great team player. Just banking side of the company needs a little bit more stability.Company has great training programs. They care for their employee. The only thing that lacks from them is the banking market and products that are offer is only very convenient for customer
good,"This is a great place to work if you are looking to start from the bottom and work hard to become top earner, the people who work there are very welcoming and are brilliant to work with."
good,Excellent benefits great staff and opportunities for growth and development. They will provide opportunity for your develope ie tuition reimbursement .
good,"Good co-workers;"
good,See Capital One.  It's the same company.  They purchase Hibernia in 2005.  So everything that was wrote about Capital One could be said for Hibernia now.
good,"Capital One is a great company to work for, but like any other company they have their challenges.  A typical day is calling clients to set appointments to ensure that we are meeting their needs."
good,"This was a wonderful place to work at. The teams were cooperative, the leadership was magnificent, the work-life balance was quite good. Everybody right up to the CRO understood the value of risk management, and treated every resource with respect. I would go back to work here, if needed."
good,Capital One is a great please to work.  However the company is downsizing in some areas of the company.  Overall I loved working for Capital One and the experience I gained there was awesome.
good,"Company had a nice work environment. Management always tried to uplift agents.  Everyone gets along, and vacation was great."
good,"Capital One is not your typical bank. If you have a desire to learn and innovate in a tech and data driven environment, this is the place for you!"
good,"A typical day at work is busy Ive learned a lot of things being a senior operartions representative,I now have knowledge of bank transactions and I can say my skills are developed including communication skills."

good,"Good benefits and culture. A lot of outings, agent recognition, proper training. The CEO has good values. Most manager's are great people."
good,this is a wonderful job to work for!! always a friendly environment and positive atmosphere. the downside is the scheduling. it is hard to work around the schedules if you have little ones
good,"Good to  work here and I was working as a servicenow developer as well as an administrator where my role is to configure, customize, integrate with external services."
good,"My time with Capital One was not very good and I faced a lot of trouble with the management policies there which were clearly not favoring the employees. However, I tried to work hard in the position I was given without caring too much about the surroundings. However, I would not like to work again for Capital One onsidering my past experiences."
good,Great company and work form home environment. This opportunity has given me many skills from customer service to time management.
good,"Excellent Team and Manager, love to work always..."
good,"I enjoyed my time a Capital One, many of the management worked hand in hand with associate. There were those that for either personal reason, or lack of training did not. Employee issues tended to take way to long to resolve adversely affecting bonuses."
good,"im a team player I wish I could advance in the company, I been working for them for 6 yrs.I want to find a job that had advancement."
good,"I worked at Capital One Tigard site, It was wonderful place to work. I would recommend anyone who want to work at Capital One"
good,It was a great company to work for. I loved the fact that we got an hour lunch. The people were friendly. They were a very diverse company.
good,"A day at Capital One, logging into the virtual phone after signing onto the dual monitors and assisting customers with new and existing accounts. Also engaging with teammates in scheduled meetings that occur weekly. The hardest part of the job was learning to deal with each customer and their personality the right way. I enjoyed Capital One."
good,Opportunity abounds. If your interested in the financial sector this is a great place to start. Also volunteering is big here.
good,You can lean a lot if you want to. There are many good officers there who can teach you many things. On a typical  you meet many new people.
good,"The folks I worked with they were terrible two leaders , but I enjoyed the relationships I built with my customers about 2 years I was able to earn all my client trust and they were very special to me. During my career here, I established and maintained many relationships with continued follow uo to ensurce we showed the customer their relationships with us and as well follow up with other sales needs we may had lost during our sales. I  concentrated on finanial planning leading ti financials success."
good,"Great place to work at for the past 3 and a half years.. Great management, but unfortunately was laid off because of ""workforce reduction from the customer Capital One."
good,"The company is moving forward and changing the way banking is done through innovation."
good,"Overall a very good place to work.  Great culture.  Managers are very receptive to hearing feedback and interested in your development.  Somewhat hard to move up, unless someone quits."
good,"Open up your system, Upload all loan assigned to you. Make 100 plus calls a day. Skip trace and locate vehicles assigned for repo, contact the repo company to let them know if the vehicle is at the residence."
good,"Capital One is a great company to work for welcomes diversity with a very well rounded benefit package.  When you work for Capital One, you work to treat each customer as an individual.  Changing Banking for Good!"
good,"Working in retail banking can be very frustrating at times. Customers of Capital One can be very rude and irrational at times but through skill-building meetings one can learn how to service customers in a proper fashion. On the positive side; I enjoyed always learning different regulations and processes the bank utilizes. I also began to take interest into specific areas of banking; for example, auditing."
good,"They are great environment and friendly. Depends on the branch you are at, you need to be friendly with the customers and have personal relationship with them all times."
good,Capital One has the cafeterias. good place to start a career at. the bank offers a lot room for employees to grow by providing frequent trainings.
good,"Capital One Bank is an innovative company in the sense that it is always in tune with the current culture or the way people conduct business nowadays. The most enjoyable part of my job is the ability to make a difference in people's lives. Part of my job is to assess people's needs first. Afterwards, I make suggestions or recommendations based on those needs."
good,Capital One was a great company to work for. They were very people focused and made sure there employees loved coming to work. That same focus was directed to there customers as well. It didn't feel like collections at all because our drive was to help resolve the customers issue.
good,"Good place to work."
good,Great company to work for... Make sure you arrive fifteen minutes early and this is a good habit to have anyway. Alot of people lose there jobs because of situations out of their control. Management is great... if you are collecting pressure will be on. The comoany does alot to ensure appreciation.
good,"My day starts with checking emails and following up with pending work from yesterday. If their is any meeting then prepare for the meeting and related documents. Check if their is any tickets issued and forward them to the concerned department. I learnt many different things from my all experiences from different companies, its always hard to adjust and learn the workplace initially when you have no one to help you. Management so far is always good to me and very helpful where ever I have worked. "
good,"Capital One was a great place to work... I love the company and it's values. Making $33,000/yr as a banker with a degree is what sparked me to look for another future... Other than the pay I would still be apart of the team."
good,"Excellent company to work for, Have worked many year as a temp and full time with company."

good,A great job for someone who's single and is willing to work long hours.
good,"I have learned alot about Debt Protection Department, how to cancel the protection on customer accounts, how is issued credits on customer accounts. The most enjoyable part of my job is my team we work hard we get the job done no matter what and have fun at the same time and thats what being a team player is about working together."
good,Typical day at Cap1 includes a lot of data entry and confirmations. I sometimes receive emails from my managers to ensure that the customer has received everything that they ask for along the lines of bank statements and brochures. I then enter it into our TSYS system which saves the information on their account so no work is duplicated. I learned how to e-file and rightfax along with other administrative duties. My co-workers are helpful in helping me learn how to do something properly. They are a complete joy!
good,It was a very fast passed environment in which I took outbound and inbound phone calls 8 hours a day sometime from very upset customers. It was a challenging job but a very fun job to experience.
good,I got alot from the job. I was able to advance fast. The job was very skillful.
good,Capital One cares about their employees. It is a great place to work if you live in the Dallas/FW area.
good,"Great people, good management, flexibility, team spirit, compensation is decent, annual goals can be achieved in a number of ways; positive attitude and personal care"
good,Capital One is a great company to work for. The culture is exhilarating and the benefits are amazing! It’s always room to grow with management on site but I have no complaints after being with them for five years.
good,"Enjoyed my short time there and was not actively looking to leave, just had an incredible opportunity come by that I could not pass up.  I have missed their awesome benefits since the day I left."
good,"Great benefits, CONSTANT push to advance. Difficult place to work if you don't want to keep advancing. Managers change very frequently. Work stations moved frequently."

good,"Capital One was a great place to work. It has an excellent business model, great leadership and a great culture."
good,"The management depends on the department, but the culture and people are fantastic. All entry-level employees are great to work with and for the most part, management values our time and dedication to the workplace."
good,"Great company to work for, take care of employees and provide plenty of opportunities for advancement."
good,"They are some phenomenally talented marketers here, but they prefer people who stay in their lane and do the job they’ve been asked to do. Innovative personalities will run people the wrong way."
good,I loved overall working at Capital One. The work life balance is good but may vary from team to team. The overall job culture is collaborative learning. Emphasis on professional development.
good,They treat their employees great and benefits are the best. Not all roles there are great but the company and the facilities overall are amazing. Very fun company to be a part of.
good,Moving up the ranks in Auto was tough but worth every minute of investment. For those that are just hard workers and don’t really get involved in the culture aspect it will be that much harder for auto. Other pets of the company Introverts tend to be more successful. Auto is heavily leans towards extroverts as sales is more natural for an extrovert. Being an introvert myself sometimes communication can be tough so be ware that if you are Oman introvert to really think about how much you are willing to invest in inter office relationship .
good,"A typical day at work, well in sales,  employees utilize  all aspects of the sales positions with each customer interaction. "

good,"As a branch ambassador your hands are on everything from processing transactions, opening and servicing accounts, and maintaining ATMs.  Its a great way to get your foot in the door in any role in the financial industry. Capital One has a great culture. The people are extremely helpful and nice. Being good at researching and using your resources will really help you out in this role. You will be learning new things everyday. This job requires you to be good at multitasking, learning on the fly, and adhering to policies and procedures while providing greatl customer service"
good,Capital is a great company however job security was always talked about within the mortgage department in meeting with mgmt. on which way the company will move forward in the mortgagte department. It is very difficult to advance or grow within the company.
good,The job is what you make of it! Loved working here and exploring different roles at Capital One. This company cares about it's employees. It is your responsibility to grow your skills and network to grow with the company.
good,"Great company! The people and the culture make you forget you are at work most days. They really believe in diversity and inclusion. Our location is small so you know everyone. Depending on job, you are able to travel to the other locations and get a lot of exposure to upper management."
good,"It was great working at CapitalOne in terms of work culture, knowledgeable and passionate resources. Its a very collaborative work environment where people listen and at the same time have opinion and always willing to provide candid feedback. Leaders do have a clear vision and are aware of market competition which allows teams to stay focused and be productive."
good,"Poor Organization at the time I was there with a new operations manager and team manager, things were just all over the place with a really great company and perks."
good,"Good place to work.  Team was outstanding only problem was commute.  Data Center was out in Volo Illinois commute was 100 miles a day. I was going to be hired full time but accepted another position which was closer to home,"

good,Capital One is a pretty amazing place to work but gets interesting at times. I loved working there bt once personal issues arose there weren't many options or help . Other wise I wouldn't mind going back.
good,"Capital one is one of the world largest bank and credit card company. They offer a variety of job opportunities and great benefits. The work environment is fun and there is always something to do, Capital one takes pride in their agents and they make sure that the employees are well taking care of. They have poor leadership but the job alone is wonderful."
good,"Continue education is highly encouraged at capital one and recognized. Management appreciate and recognizes hard working employees."
good,"Benefits are great! Compensation is competitive. Culture is diverse. Very competitive place to work. If you work here, be ready to prove you are the best at what you do. Every department's culture is not the same. Some are more relaxed than others. There are many, many opportunities within Capital One. Change is constant."
good,"Great place to work, although a bit too touchy-feely and over the top with the diversity aspect, and a bit too liberal as TV's were alway on CNN or MSNBC. Great benefits and pay. Excellent 401k and bonus."

The workplace culture is fast paced and always trying to stay ahead of any issues that may come up from constant upgrades and rollouts. Most enjoyable part of the day is when you realize that when you go a little further to investigate an issue and think outside the box and you provide solutions and impact your customers with a positive impact.
good,"You must be willing to learn fast, deal with people from all walks of life, and work well under pressure. As a manger you must be driven and competitive banks are all around. It's not the product, it's the customer service received and the ability to be ok with change.."

good,"This company has the best benefits and work life balance I've ever see.  My only complaint is the pay.  Benefits start day one, 4 weeks of vacation at a minimum."
good,"Health benefits kick in first day of hire. Very generous on PTO, hard to move within the company, its more of who you know. There are constant reorganizations of departments within the company which don't give you enough stability with the constant layoff for tenured associates."
good,"The Work at Home aspect of the job is awesome.  This is not for everyone.  Many people must be surrounded by people in the workplace.  Work at Home is solitary."

I was there as a Contractor, my representative from staffing agency had meeting with my manager at Capital One, she told him i was doing a great job. The coming Friday was my last day, no warning or anything. My opinion is they could handle that better in future. I honestly believe they told my agency that the job was temp to perm when in actuality, they wanted me only until an FTE employee came back from leave. Overall great company, great benefits, full time employess had great things to say about it and i would love to work for Capital One again, as a full time employee."

I've learned to not judge a book by its covered and appreciate the simplest things in life. I have a great team I work with, a branch full of dynamic people who love what they do. The hardest part of my day is not being able to help a client, unless it's completely out of my power I won't stop and make sure that person understands I gave it my best.

The customer interaction model is a bit rigid, but other than that it is a great place to work"

Like I said, I can't think of anything but positive things about the company."

good,"My entire career for Capital One was W@H which was wonderful for my family. It allowed me to take care of my personal obligations, not have the worries of a commute and the increased flexibility was amazing!

good,Had multiple roles with Capital One over 10 year period in multiple states. Really enjoyed working for Capital One. Smart people with diverse professional and personal backgrounds. Well funded so plenty of people and technology to make your projects successful.
good,"I love our CEO, but management and senior leadership just don't get what he's trying to achieve.  They all nod in agreement but fail to execute.  Their performance management system pits employees against each other instead of getting them to work together.  That said, it's still one of the best places I've ever worked in the past 20 years."
good,Capital One understands that employee efficiency and engagement are important and strives to allow employees to be flexible in their schedules. Meetings with superiors regarding performance to date occur regularly. The culture could be described as laid-back compared to other financial institutions. The hardest part of my positions was the volume of inbound calls taken each day and inability to advance in my departments to a certain extent.
good,"I am unsure how I fell about Capital One has anything to do with trying to find a new job.  I am trying to look for a job with advancement opportunities, doesn't mean I have anything negative to say about Capital One"

Typical workday consists of daily morning team huddles to discuss  work volumes, recognition's, birthdays and who generally needed help. Work was steady and challenging and very rewarding. I learned how to be an active and productive team lead with a very supportive management team.  Capital One has a very friendly culture and actively encourages all associates to enjoy the customer first  spirit."
good,"Capital One has a great employee-first culture, and they provide numerous above and beyond resources to ensure the happiness of their people.I am not leaving the company by choice, it is unfortunate that corporate layoffs determined the outcome of the employment."
good,"My job gave me a lot of ability to create and drive the customer experience to be the best it could be, and the people I worked with were incredible.  I was able to help shape the culture at Capital One Investing to make it one of the best places to work.  This culture helped cultivate great experiences for both customers and the associates delivering the experience.  I truly have a passion for the customer experience and loved being able to make it the best for every person involved, and had the freedom to do so.  I was able to take my years of knowledge in sales, finance, and customer service to create the current evaluation form that helped lead to great NPS scores while taking into account the associate's ""voice.""  The toughest part of my job, like anything in finance, was to keep up with the ever changing market, compliance, and rules and regulations, but this also helped me adapt and change while constantly moving forward."
good,"Capital One is a great place to work and a very hard place to leave.  Benefits are great, compensation is competitive, culture is very consumer and employee focused.  Onsite benefits are incredible."
good,Everyone is passionate about the bank's mission. Friendly and inclusive work environment. Sometimes tries too hard to appeal to younger people with casual dress codes. Very much embraces the tech culture.
good,The company is great to work for.  The leadership really helps to make sure that you understand policy thoroughly and are able to do your job at effectively.
good,During my tenure at Capital One I had some of the most lasting career growth experiences. Having a culture of support with new challenges daily that are built upon current customer banking needs along with staying afoot of banking compliances ensured me a well rounded learning environment.
good,"Capital One is a thoughtful company that embraces new and innovative ways to connect with their employees and customers.   Although they are a finance company, they have the look and feel of a diverse IT company from Palo Alto.   They really care about their employees and make a concerted effort in investing money and time into building their brand and insuring that their employees truly have embraced the company culture.    I have met some of the best people at Capital One and value the experiences gained working with them."
good,In a busy branch you have the opportunity to hone your skills and become a better professional even making mistakes from which one can only learn from.
good,"Great place to work. Relaxing atmosphere with great perks. Benefits were fair and extensive. It was not close to home, but it was worth the commute. Would recommend applying."
good,I enjoyed my time working there because of the diversity. You never knew who you would be interacting with that day.I enjoyed educating the public about all of the direct banking products we had to offer and how it could benefit them. On a typical day I would sit at my desk and take back to back inbound calls and answer all questions. I enjoy going that extra mile to leave a great impression of the company.
good,Working with Capital One as a contractor has been a great experience to learn more things. I have gained more knowledge as a BA role. The company is great and really takes care if it’s employees.
good,"Capital One's culture creates an atmosphere where the drudge of day in and day out activity is non-existent. It's a place where you can look forward to the work week (or at the very least not dread Monday morning!)"
good,"The Management is called to know the agents individually. It makes their advancement and connection with the company stronger, I love working there. The culture is focused on the customer first at all cost, take your time but get it resolved"
good,"Capital one is a great place to work however can be difficult to move up if you aren’t a single person with no children. "
good,"Capital One was an excellent company to work for. There were several job opportunities company wide and even relocation opportunities. Even though my position was phased out, the company provided so much support to assist with the transition. They really took good care of us."
good,working at C/O was fulfilling. Management and staff were helpful and very open and interactive. It was a very good environment and advancement was always possible.
good,Working for Capital One provided many exciting opportunities to not only network but to advance in personal growth. With the changing economy we were given opportunities to volunteer both within and outside of the work place to help build a better community.
good,Great culture and they care about the employees safe working environment strong leadership open lines of communication HR makes you feel like they care
good,"Working for Capital One definitely set my standards for being a productive and progressive employee. With many incentives and benefits I felt I was in a position of growth, always striving to be the best employee. I always wanted to impress my co-workers and management in order to gain connections and also  move up in the ranks. I wanted more hours and I wanted more pay so I worked everyday my hardest so that I can leave with valuable experience and skills."
good,"I loved my time at Capital One. You are surrounded by very smart people who are also caring and supporting. It is place that is very analytical and data driven in making decisions, yet the people are nice and down to earth."
good,"I enjoyed working here, as they appreciated hard working employees.  There was room for advancement and growth within the company as well as continued training."
good,"You'll learn about credit cards and how the business operates. Helping customers with typical credit card account related inquires and transactions.  You'll typically work on a team of about 15 people in my experience and you'll have meetings on occasions to discuss things ongoing in the company, issues that have been identified and a strategy and team improvement. Capital One has always (worked there twice almost a decade apart) a terrific workplace culture. They love their customers. They want you to love your customers and in exchange they try to make you as comfortable as possible to conduct your work.  The hardest part can be just the volume of interactions you have each day. It can be god to make time pass but after awhile it can take it's toll too. Work life balance is pretty good. Managers make a HUGE difference in experience in the company. I've had managers that were truly good team leaders. I've had managers that lead me to resign. I know of great leaders and trainers also who have eventually left for one reason or another. The issue I had and not sure it's been resolved is the favoritism that takes place. This comes in the form of quality reviews of your calls after the fact where managers would tell you what you should have squeezed into these spots on a short conversation to build company brand or mention a benefit. It was not a black and white process and a lot of manager discretion went into it and favoritism came from that which down the road events your monthly bonus (I believe they have increased hourly and did away with monthly incentives)  and then later"
good,I spent 12 years working at Capital One and I find it to be one of the most balanced work environments I have worked in.  I spent the majority of my career in the customer service department as I am admit about helping others.
good,"Great leadership, industry-leader, innovation-focused, cutting edge technologies, game-changing customer experiences, write our own code, build our own applications."
good,Love the company hated my manager. Had to leave due to medical reasons and my manager was making it nearly impossible to work with my FMLA accommodations and threated to terminate me. However the company is a great company. Great benefits and wonderful environment.
good,Working at Capital One was a great experience. I was able to learn a great deal and take on roles and duties throughout my tenure there. The company offers take work and life balance and the employees are awesome.
good,"Overall, a great company to work for. I enjoyed my 10 years with the company. I started as an ABM and was eventually promoted to an Operations Specialist."
good,I have been extremely happy at Capital One and hate that this journey is coming to end with Capital One exiting the mortgage industry  culture and diversity is great
good,"I looked forward to coming to work, because of the benefits and working with such an awesome team. The culture was very diverse and made a lot of people happy. The hardest part of my job was being able to accept being laid off 3 times."
good,Productive and fun place the culture there is like no other very supportive and attentive as well as relaxed. Capital one is a very good company and they strive to be the best.
good,The Capital One Plano Texas location is a very progressive forward thinking Company. it's a very diverse location with innovative ideas. I loved it. I would recommend anyone to work there.
good,"Capital One is an awesome company with great benefits. Compensation was great, hours are flexible, The atmosphere was great and they care about their employees."
good,"Capital One is truly a great company to work for. While I think they are still trying to define themselves in the industry, they are proactively seeking to improve their culture. At times it seems like some of the leadership might not be on board for the direction the company is going. This in turn kills the moral of the associates reporting to them."
good,"It was my first time working in a bank setting and I have to say that this was my all time favorite job. I loved the hours because it allowed me a lot of free time to do whatever I wanted to do. I was a volunteer firefighter at the time as well. I enjoyed seeing my regular customers and my co-workers were all awesome to work with. I really learned a lot from them, especially my branch manager. She conducted meetings everyday with updates to the business, company policies, goals for the month, etc. We always knew what was expected of us."
good,So sorry they exited the mortgage industry. They took very good care of everyone who had to exit with job placement assistance and severance packages.
good,"Great place to work and get your feet wet in the banking industry"
good,"Capital One was a great company to work for. The campus was beautiful and lots of activites for employees to destress such as a ping pong table, a giant slide, bikes to ride across the campus, and a Corporate fitness center. The hours are flexible and the pay is pretty good. Also there they offer a substantial amount of PTO for their employees who have worked for the company 5+ years. They take very good care of employees that have been laid off."
good,great place to work . the hours work well with my schedule especially because i have a child and i know how hard it is to accomedate. work hours range from morning to night. pay was good
good,"Capital One is a great company work for. I loved waking up and coming to work every morning. I loved being part of a team. The employees, as well as managers are very open and helpful. I had no issues or anything until my car accident, that put me in the ICU and it felt as though my manager was more concerned about the time i missed, instead of my well being. I suffered a brain injury and when i returned to work, my speak was off. Knowing this my manager still put me on the phone and i failed 3 calls within a week, and prior to my accident I had no issues as far as calls. I lost my job because of this and felt it was beyond unfair, I'm a single mother of 3 and I was never late to work and never called in. I definitely didn't deserve to lose my job."
good,"Competitive not always room for advancement. Great Benefits. Work Life balance is great. Diverse. Relaxed and collaborative environment, but can be stressful."
good,Capital One is a good company that really cares about their employees.  They provide a lot of benefits and also provide services to help develop people internally and grow their careers.
good,". A typical workday started with a morning team meeting, working your portfolio, scheduled vetting's, and communication with managers."
good,"You will find fast paced work with fantastic teams. Some people do not like that things are constantly changing but I found that inspiring. If you do not being stuck in a rut, you will enjoy the ever changing environment with wonderful people. The hardest part of the job is the lack of job security."
good,"Great place to work I truly enjoyed being a Mission Ambassador for our associates allowing me to become a liaison between Sr, Leadership and associates site wide."
good,"Being part of the Capital One creative team allowed me to grow as a professional. I got a chance to work on a wide variety of projects with great, smart people. I wouldn't trade my time there for anything."
good,"Working here was fun! You get to me a lot of new people. The benefits and pay were good for the work I was doing. No weekends, unless wanted to. Fun!!"
good,Fast paced call center however management ensured the team moral was up. Really great place to work also a great job for young individuals starting out as there are plenty developmental plans in place to help with career advancement
good,I learned while working how to manage my own account when it comes to my personal banking account. I learned how to assist others without thinking about my personal feelings.
good,"Was a contract worker and loved the environment.  Campus is laid out like a small college and there are people constantly traversing the ""quad"".  A very unique culture/"
good,"Fun experience and i have learned a lot. Salary, incentives and benefits are good. Agents are friendly, some team managers are cool, fun to be with and understanding."
good,Capital One is a dynamic place to work.  The culture is open and associates are encouraged to find a role that fits their passion.   The people are smart and the work is challenging.  The opportunity to learn and grow is tremendous.   It is not your typical financial insituation - in a good way.   The blend between technology and banking is smooth and it allows bankers to learn technology and vice versa.
good,"I enjoy working at capital one , ive been in this industry for yrs and its the most relaxed call center ever. the staff is great and the the workers and working environment is amazing. the down side is no pto and no beneftis. they also have events that are cap one employess only."
good,Capital One was a great company. They created a great environment and workspace for employees. Its growing and stable place of employment. I didn't have any complaints.
good,I really enjoyed working for Capital One and I am very disappointed that they pulled out of mortgage.   The culture there was one of family and one that will be deeply missed.
good,Great place to work and management is awesome with work/life balance and community service.  Investing is a growing division looking to use innovation to tap into the middle class and savvy investor market.
good,Great culture and people! Large open campus with many amenities. Supportive management with opportunity to grow. Definitely a place I gained much knowledge and experience.
good,Great company to work for. They make it very easy to excel and advance as long as you stay on top of your numbers. Downside is there are a politics and managers play favorites.
good,Excellent place to work but they closed the site when they couldn't keep the staffing leveling they desired. Which was a hard on those who enjoyed the work there
good,"Although we were aware the office was closing, the environment was always positive, fun and motivating.  Management personally came to our desk daily to greet us and discuss the game plan for the day."
good,"Capital one did a great job of making such a large company feel small and personal. They had break rooms with food, ping pong tables, and plenty of team social events."
good,"Capital One Bank is a nice place to work for. Everyday is a challenge and a continuous learning. I love Capital One culture and how the company give back to the community. This company always trained their associate, great career development, equal opportunities. I enjoy what I do to live."

good,"Workplace culture was best in class compared to other providers in the financial services industry.   "
good,"The company did an incrediblet job of caring for regular full time employees."
good,I joined Capital One straight out of college and it was a great place to gain experience as an analyst. I learned the ins and outs of data analysis and presenting to leaders across all levels.
good,They helped keep the employees engaged. We had fun activities you could do on breaks and lunch. I feel the most important was the employees. It was a great group of people.
good,"If you're looking for a forward-thinking company that is changing the face of banking, Capital One is a great place to work. They are progressive and deeply committed to using technology to innovate every aspect of consumers' financial lives."
good,"In general, the level of engineering at Capital One is more than you'd expect to find at a company that isn't already a major player in the tech sector. Many, many managers or senior engineers could clearly work at a large tech firm or wall street for more pay and notoriety, but the company's stance on work-life balance, delivering products with ownership and accountability, and good culture keep them there. "
good,"Capital One is a fun place to work. The West Creek campus west of Richmond has winding trails through forest and landscaped gardens, a state-of-the-art health club, and multiple food outlets each with a different theme, as well as desks that automatically rise up and go down."
good,"The upper management of Capital One  not only design programs to take of their external customers, they also put in place programs to care about their employees. "
good,"My last boss was not what the company stood for. However didn't take away of the fact that the company is solid. Provides great opportunity for anyone that seeks excellence and opportunity for anyone to  climb the latter of success. provides excellent training and provides excellent community reinvestment. Love the culture, the hardest part of the job was when you have to work for someone that had a different agenda and wanted to deviate from the company culture and want it you to follow their practice for their benefit. I only saw this once in my 15 years with the company."
good,I held several positions at Capital One and each of them had a great sense of entrepreneurship associated with them. I valued the interactions with upper management as well as the freedom to look for ways to continuously improve the business.
good,"The Best place to work with the best benefits. Love the campus and all the perks. Flex start times, gym and health center on campus. Great people to work with."
good,"Capital One is a great company to work for, specifically at the Plano Campus.  Fun and casual environment.  Fun activities around campus and the food is great with lots of options!  Benefits are the best I've seen and the PTO is very generous on top of the 10 bank holidays"
good,Great place to work where community and collaboration are encouraged.  Commitment to technology to enhance not only the customer experience but help maximize information to keep innovating for the future.
good,Great place. I would go back. I loved all the training and equality there was. The training was great. My bosses were awesome. I worked on Las Vegas and in Plano.
good,"The team manager took the time to learn each member's skills/ abilities and applied them to project planning very efficiently. They also kept the moral up by planning team lunches/ events.Coding, there is a large potential above the required stories, but limited to the current sprint."
good,"Great environment."
good,"Supports and provides opportunity for advancement with many  career fields options. Encourages employees to dream, disrupt and deliver. Community 1st."
good,"They didn't want to hear any noise in the background, but the one thing you can't control are the outside elements.  I lost this job because they heard my neighbor scream at her kids by my window. They knew it wasn't me because I was talking to the member on the phone."
good,It was a interesting and eventful job. There were many fun and different types of jobs to pick from each day was different and eventful. It was never boring.
good,It is an incredible company to work. Just a shame they had to lay off people. The pay is incredible. The culture we have in my current role is unmatched. I will miss everyone here.
good,Capital One is the best company umbrella as a whole I have ever worked for. The culture is refreshing and the values the company lives is amazing. The company's compensation to their employees is impeccable with great benefits as well as 401 K contribution. Work life balance working for this company is always taken into consideration with the flexibility that comes with the mentality family comes first. This company does an amazing job of taking care of its employees in many ways.
good,"Great place to work, Medical, Dental, Vision, Life insurance from day 1. Associates can purchase 1 week of additional PTO during open enrollment. Would never have left but call center to be  closed on 12-7-17."
good,"They practice and apply how to bring back humanity to customers and colleagues. Also, provides wonderful benefits which definately helps the associates."
good,"Competitive culture that values and rewards innovative thinkers. Excellent benefits and an progressive, open campus environment that best supports independent work styles."
good,"Experienced Full Stack Developer with a demonstrated history of working in the financial services industry. Skilled in Spring Boot, SOAP, Java Message Service (JMS), Spring DI, and Spring Framework."
good,"Capital One was one of the best companies I had ever worked for before. The hierarchy is well maintained and developed. You know who is in charge of what, and where to go when you need something. The atmosphere is positive and welcoming. The people an absolute pleasure to work with."
good,Everything about my particular job(data entry) was fine. Got along well with my co-workers and we had a very calm work environment. They were very flexible when you needed a day off as well.
good,"Very good place to work, they are using advanced tools in the industry. Very good place for fresher's to learn and showcase themselves and grow .workculture is excellent"
good,"Working at Goldman sack was an incredible experience, they are all hard working and super intelligent individuals. i have not only made a career at Goldman i made lots of friends"
good,"Capital One is by far the best company I've worked for. It's atmosphere is non-corporate, collaborative, and productive. The only downside and the reason why I left is because of the pay. The benefits and perks are excellent and can spoil you if you're not ambition, however the pay is very structured so if you don't come in high you'll stay relatively low paid and making less then a newcomer. "
good,"Capital one is a great place to work. Work life balance is excellent and the benfits are awesome. Very challenging, if you are not working closely with your managers."
good,"One of the best work experiences of my professional career.  Great people, great culture!  Management promotes resources to think freely and challenge legacy processes for constant improvement. Company strives to do the right thing."
good,great employer loved the culture gave everyone base salary raise after I left to help ease the tension from the cost of living truly a family setting loved the company and still for them.
good,"Capital one is a good company, however, the pay for certain departments is relatively low compared to the competitors.  The lower pay may be due to the better benefits offered by the company."
good,Capital One is a great place to work. The work life balance provide is great along with the benefits including on site fitness facilities. The culture is great which is what keeps people working there.
good,Capital One is a great place to work! Benefits are great including on site fitness facilities. The culture is great! They really are trying to change banking for good!
good,"working for capital one was a struggle. I worked for a very small branch, which is now shut down. while working for capital one we had to have so many referrals a month. My manager would hound us about the referrals and it was very hard to  get the. the branch I worked at was in a very small farm town. Most of our customers were elderly farmers and don't like changes and still have flip phones. Being as they still have flip phones they cant do mobile deposit and don't trust an ATM, they want to do things hand to hand."
good,"A typical day at Capital One was always interesting, never knew what kind of customer you were going to  get on the line next. While working there I learned so much I had no idea about when it comes to car loans from working there I now know exactly what i would be getting myself into if I were to get a loan. Their management team was amazing great fun people who were always there if you couldn't find the answer. the culture of capital one they really try to keep their employees happy with fun days every now and then as well as a break room with ping pong, pool, and air hockey. The hardest part about the job was the upset customers and the hours I wasn't a fan of the hours there, being they were 11:30 am- 8:00 pm. The most enjoyable part was the fact we had 2 15 minute breaks plus an hour lunch."
good,"Really enjoyed working there, will miss it. management could have used better training in people skills, also got laid off due to site closure so no job security."
good,"Capital One is a fun place to work, everyone works as a team and there's no micro managers. The employees are also wonderful. I will miss it there. Typical day is interviewing customers or potential customers, it's an easy job"
good,"Very friendly work environment, the hardest part off the job was requirements were not clear and data was bad. Workplace and Culture was just another corp."
good,"Capital One is a fast-paced place to work with an emphasis on quality. While working at Capital One, I enjoyed a wonderful company culture and great bonuses."
good,This was a really fun fast paced office that was really fun with great co workers then the office party's were really great this was an environment where work alone felt great ha ha ha
good,Capital One is a great company to work for. The culture is second to none and the benefits are impeccable. It is a fast growing company with a great deal of opportunity for anyone who is willing to work hard.
good,"Capital One is a fantastic company to work for. I am still here and love it but much like other large companies, you hit a wall and need to continue your growth elsewhere. The company has great benefits, perks and culture. You will literally learn anything you want there, the hardest part is going somewhere though."
good,"They have really good benefits including health dental and vacation/ leave.  Men are even granted paternity leave which is amazing."
good,Great work place with many benefits. Direct management is lacking in organization and helpfulness.  The culture and diversity of people you work with are good.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with system issues that are constant and ongoing. Best part of the job is the other Customer Care associates you get to work with.  Always supportive and smiles ready to help you with a difficult situation or to boost moral.
good,"The goal is to change banking for good and keep customers in their cars. A typical day would be providing all company tools to assist customers into getting back into their cars. I've learned that life circumstances may happened and that Capital One are all about customers. The hardest part about the job was repossessing cars due to non payment and not able to take a payment when their is a repo agent on site. The most part about my job that I like was to be able to keep customers in their cars because everyone deserves to sing on they way to work and make it to all family festivities, and getting medical attention if had to drive there themselves."
good,"The banking industry is constantly changing. In order to advance a person must constantly find ways to keep themselves fresh and in demand. The management has an open-door policy that sometimes can be beneficial when it comes to sharing your career goals. The work environment is presented as a ""go get it"" approach. Capital One wants their employees to pursue their dreams to exercise full potential. ."
good,Excellent atmosphere to work with the employers with great pace.Capital One Bank encouraging associates to think independently and to present creative ideas to senior management .I gained a great experience while working there. Great benefits.
good,"Capital one is an excellent company to work for. They do right by their staff, and are headed down a path to increase their digital curiosity. Great benefit"
good,"A typical day at work was fun, fast paced and always new things to learn. A very diverse environment with excellent benefits. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with daily"
good,"To have grown to where Capital One is now from scratch, it has successfully shown the power of hiring the right people and supporting them to do great work."
good,"Great place to work, smart people and innovation is encouraged. Seating is a bit tight not enough space to work as desk size have become small with no privacy at all."
good,"Good Work culture , Flexible Work hours and Agile Model. Lot to learn .. Amazing management support , Will rate it 5 out of 5. Best place i have worked so far."
good,"I worked for Capital one for almost two years it was one of the best place i have ever worked enjoyed the job learning new things everyday , I was able to work as much as i wanted alot of overtime ."
good,This job was very stressful. Work balance was not enforce. We worked extremely long hours and weekends I was working 20-30 hours in overtime. The set up was not good at all.
good,Capital One definitely deserves a top spot on the best places to work list. Everyone there was friendly and open to ideas. They encouraged learning and career advancement (even if it was outside of the company!). The typical day was usually etched out for you the moment you got to work and you could always reach out to your management team or your peers if you were confused about something. The whole place felt like one big family and I was extremely sad to have to say goodbye when I decided to finish getting my MBA.
good,Since outsourced to numerous BPO'S some in the Philippines. If the BPO's adopted the culture give it a go. Collections isn't easy but Capital One was the ultimate work hard play hard company.
good,for the most part my day to day routine was pretty autonomous with very little interaction from anyone aside from my cube mates. the only real interaction with anyone outside of my position was mandatory huddles taken time off the phone and management conversations that usually resulted in unclear feedback.
good,Lovely place to work. Company Cultuure is so awesome that you dont feel like any burden or stress while working. They really take care of their employees.
good,Progressive workplace that allows open discussions on all aspects of the job and it's daily goals. Management welcomes applicants of all backgrounds and makes the environment fun and open.
good,"Capital One is a great place in many ways. There is a very inclusive culture, the environment is predominantly casual but still professional, and there is no shortage of very intelligent and experienced peers to call on. My one word of caution is that it can be difficult to get new ideas off the ground, so if you are an impatient person or prefer a workplace where a good idea gets immediate support, this might not be the best place for you."
good,"Working for Capital One was certainly a rewarding experience. This would prove to be the first job I've actually enjoyed working. the culture of the company is so rich. Everyone seems to enjoy their job. Diversity is definitely the first word that comes to mind. I've been introduced to so many aspect of the company from customer service, to working with project managers on numerous projects, to serving as a member of the problem solving team for auto finance. The hardest part of the job was realizing that corporate is not really the right fit for me, and Capital One like any other major company has its typical work place politics. I would say this is. great place to work for."
good,"Capital One, LLC is a great place to work.  Associates are rewarded for performance,  It can be a fun place to work. Compensation and benefits are comparable to other similar companies."
good,"branch employees have great benefits but if you work in headquarters its even better! Gym, clinic, daycare, cafeteria all in headquarters"
good,Ce fut un plaisir de travailler chez Capital One bonne ambiance de travail
good,"I enjoy working at capital one, great benefits but not a lot of room for growth. The company also has great time off and we have a be well clinic on site for employees and families"
good,This was my bridge job between coming home from college and starting my career in banking. I had extensive experience in the hockey world so it was an easy transition. I knew all the instructors on a personal level and it was a great rink to work at. Very Professional.
good,"I worked 8-4 Monday through Friday and quickly became spoiled by the state of the art buildings, excellent management, friends, fun, and I loved the casual environment!"
good,"Sadly due to automation, my role was eliminated.  But it was a great 20 years"
good,I truly enjoyed my work with capital one and the people that I worked with. I did find however that a desk job is not what I was cut out to do.
good,"I have good experience in that company, environment is very good as well as the employer of the company is also very helpful."
good,"Good work ethics, High standard of quality across board. Work life is kept professional and fun with a good balance of both."
good,"This has been an unbelievable company to work for , I have learned more in the past 1+ year working for Spark Pay Online Store E-Commerce with Capital One than any company before me. "
good,"I love my team and my manager. I know when the day is getting away from me, my manager is right there to help me along through out the day"
good,"very fast paced work environment. looking to change the world of banking."
good,Good work life balance and challenging work. Great company to work for and good leaders. Fun place to work and company really supports community involvement.
good,"I loved Capital One, don't get me wrong; coming in for 5 days 1pm-10pm was a great job, great pay, benefits; but two factors always hit me hard. Call Quota wasn't something I was well prepared for, and looking back, I could have done 5x better, and plan to if I ever find myself back there. The only other problem I had was I felt like one of a million instead of 1 of a few. When there's so many people that work in the same area for so long with around 4-5 managers around, you feel like less of you and more like everyone else. You can easily become unnoticed, even when you've reached a goal and achieved something pinnacle to your job. Answering Phones and greeting people day to day, helping them solve all their problems (account management, disputes, fraud, tough merchants) made me really feel fulfilled."

good,"For a position that does not require a college degree, this is a great one to have. The only downfall in this position is keeping up with all the changes that occur with policy and roles throughout the retail banking sector of capital one. Job security is also a major issue you are challenged every month with a area to focus on and digital advancement as well so if you can't adapt to change I do not recommend this position."
good,"Capital One values the employees and treats them with respect and fairness.  Tries to keep the energy of a start-up company regardless of the tremendous growth in the last several years. The CEO underlines  in every strategy meeting how the most valuable asset of the company are the people. Due to the digital revolution many new technologies are considered when solutions are designed for business requirements, offering the employees the opportunity to learn and update their skills. Self-sufficient teams are empowered to take design decisions on how to design solutions that fulfill requirements using Open source products and/or  AWS services, so that project is delivered fast, secure and with minimum expense."

good,"Walking into work everyday, I walk into great positive vibes. Everyone is smiling and ready to produce for the day. The management is great and very understanding. Managers are very supportive and understanding. While working as processors we must be very understanding and willing to help the customer's in the best way we can. We get great customer feed back from most of our customer's daily. Being that we are working with these customer's for 45-90 days at a time, it is important we show concern in their wants and we understand and are willing to help in every way possible. Overall while working for this company I have learned it is important to have great rapport with customer's. The customer must know we understand there situation and we are the best team (bank) to complete their process. The hardest part of the job is working with most Attorneys and Home Insurance companies in order to cooperate with our process for our customer's satisfaction. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing our customer's are satisfied and happy with our process."

good,"Great benefits, and overall great culture but really hard to move up within the company and tuition reimbursement is not as good as other similar companies"
good,Over all this is a good company and I enjoyed working there. The other managers were wonderful to work with. I just had this one manager that was a bully and threaten his team.
good,"It is a great company with amazing benefits. Anyone working here can develop great communication, interpersonal and organization skills. As a teller, you have a sense of responsibility because you are accountable for customer's daily transactions."
good,After entering and setting up all my employee for the day work.  I lead a 15 minute morning meeting.

good,"Its always fun to work at Capital One because they provide so many benefits to make you feel valued. From music rooms to games rooms they make sure you get down time so that your days in the office aren't tedious. Fun days out make you feel valued because you're getting treated. I have learnt so many complex computer skills and built up my vocabulary on how to write formal letters. The management are really supportive and are always boosting team moral. Its hard when you come across something you're not familiar with because theres so many different parts of the job its impossible to be trained on everything. I love the feeling of being part of a team and being able to have a laugh whilst working,"

I am the single point of contact for their system needs. I have learned so much with this company.  From mortgage lending to mortgage fulfillment to mortgage process and beyond. Managing and working with Capital One employees has shown me how rewarding hard work can be.  The management is well organized and thought out.  Most of my co-workers, like my myself, love the culture which translates into a positive environment.   The hardest part of my job would be making myself available to everyone all the time.  On the other side of that coin Capital One is so good to its employees that whenever the opportunity for the company or manager presents itself to recognize an employee, they are capable and encouraged to reward."
good,"Love my co-workers, pay is reasonable, customers are pretty tough sometimes but its mainly when they are denied because their credit score wasnt good enough or they just need help/answers. Other than that, I wish this place would've stayed in my town. Would've retired here!"

One of the things I loved about Capital One is the network and internal social intranet sites. That stood out to me, loved everyone who I have worked with. And work/life balance couldn't be better. Can sometimes get a little hectic but with everyone on the same page, your hardest part of the day can be easily forgotten and laughed about."

The reason for me looking to leave is because the location I am currently at will be closing. However the bank as a whole I appreciate. While working for the company I learned a lot about driving the expectations for all customers. A typical day at capitalone is making sure each employee has a monthly schedule. On a day to day I coach all employees to make sure they are servicing customers to thee best ability. I oversee the cash that comes in or out of the branch.

This company wants long term employees and they want them to be happy. They reward you in many ways for sticking around and make it pretty straight forward if applicable in your position to advance. I did get laid off from capital one's brokerage company and had to compete for a new position with the bank, then heard later they were revisiting the idea ofinvesting. I think they should focus more on big picture bank practices than constanltly launching new ideas, other than that the culture and environment is wonderful."

good,"Capital One lives by its mission. Culturally, Capital One, allows you to maximize how you want to work and grown as an individual! Typical day changes depending on what type of role you are offered."
good,"Teams were very important, the Captain of the team would create contest to boost moral and work environment. Working close with your manager and team to help the everyone learn and work independently, their was help when you needed help."

good,"Capital one was a great place to work, they treated each employee as an individual, as an equal, we are called associates.  It was a great place to work, a couple of issues was the time it took for me to get to work, and the tier system they had for advancement that could be retooled other than that I loved working for capital one, I would recommend this job to others."
good,I do not wish to write a complete review at this moment in time for Capital One. I will say it was a great place and if they still had a mortgage division I would be looking to go back to work for them.
good,"Great development and growth opportunities for those willing to work for them.  Great company and I'd still be there if not for the layoffs."
good,"Lots of benefits, many ways to keep more money in your pocket, management is different from one department to another, people and the values change but is not because of the company but because of the people it self. Great place to work in Plano, if you live there."
good,"The company has great benefits such as PTO, 401K and great health benefits. Overall work life balance is a top priority. Managers have a sense of what is important to their associates and focus is on providing a solid work environment."
good,Greet and service customers with their banking needs
good,"Capital one is one of the best companies you will work for. Managers give good feed back and everyone works well with everyone. Company culture is absolutely amazing, and you will love the work too."
good,A great place to work at it's just that you never really experience job security with the periodic layoffs.  It appears that they provide you with all the creature comforts but... I worked as a contractor there but I was not offered a full time position.
good,"Corporate culture is one of the best it has been my privilege to experience.  That said, it is also critical for the manager to live the positive culture desired by upper management.  I worked some great managers and some who should be removed from the company.  The concept of servant leadership is excellent when lived out and makes the corporate environment a positive place."
good,"I loved the hours I loved talking to all the people from around the world I took joy in helping people financially, I really enjoyed the job and I should have never left but I thought I was financially making the right move"

good,"Capital One Bank is a nice place to work."
good,#1 financial institution to work for. Very collaborative and forward leaning. Only con is that the company makes it very hard to leave - unlikely to get paid more and get as good of benefits elsewhere.
good,"Arrived at 7:30AM to go over my duties for the day by checking my email and phone messages so that I could plan my actions for the day. Planned my day according to the what needed my attention immediately and those things that could wait till later in the day. I learned that being prepared for the days events made me able to more effectively support my Directors.  Management traveled frequently, so I had to make sure all travel reservations were current and not being changed at the last minute. My management was very open and easy to work with. They were sometimes demanding but always fair.  Culture at Capital One was very professional. The hardest part of the job was sometimes keeping up with the rapidly changing technology while still staying abreast of what I needed to do -but training was always available. The most enjoyable part of the job were all my colleagues at Capital One. My interaction with both management and fellow workers were both rewarding and pleasant."
good,"Like many large corporations today, layoffs are frequent. This can be stressful. Other than that, it's an amazing place to work with some incredibly smart people."
good,"I supported a  large client group in a fast paced environment within the employee relations area.   My years in role taught me how to prioritize, work collaboratively and learn constantly."
good,"I like Capital One as far as all of the people I work with as well as management, but in the end angry and upset customer over the phone is not something I feel I can handle, I thought it would be easy but I have realized I am a face to face person and enjoy fast faced environment. For someone who likes the same things day in and day out then this job may be right for you. But it made me feel lazy and bored of the same routine constantly sitting at a desk looking at a computer screen."
good,Capital One is a competitive and productive place to work. The company is heavily involved on associate engagement. It's a very relaxed culture with great management and career potential.
good,Capital One has very nice campus that provides full gym and health clinic. Four large kitchens that provide gourmet meals and nice areas for dinning in. Extra immunities include bicycles for getting around campus. Softball field and outside volleyball courts.
good,"Awesome company to work for. Great training staff great benefits, a lot of company community activity. Free coffee, tea, a lot of eating."
good,My personal Manager/supervisor was very unreasonable and picked and preyed on certain agents who he felt were weak. He made several attempts to get a number of agents on his team fired particularly black agents for no reason and many agents who had been at that company for years before him. shortly after I left the company I heard from a current supervisor at the time that he was actually fired for that same reason. Otherwise management was very great.
good,Great company to work for.  The only bad thing is that they had to close the call center because the compny was going digital and if we wanted to stay with company we had to apply for a position in 2 other states which it would not work for me.
good,Capital One 's main objective was to provide the greatest customer service experience to all customers. Management worked was awesome at the time. It was a very diversed working enviroment. I enjoyed 100% customer interactions.
good,"great place to work, great people, great culture, love the performance driven environment, very smart people with variety of skills and backgrounds, collaborative"

good,"Yes it's very challenging and they mainly hire the best and brightest.  But they reward based on performance.  Good life/balance but not great.  Expect to work over 45 hours a week on average.  Bonus plans are amazing.  "
good,"I joined Capital One's home loans division in July 2015 and was immediately drawn in by the overall culture. It is definitely a place that cultivates diversity and does a great job of showing appreciation for its employees. There are several ways to develop your career if you take the initiative and leaders are generally very supportive to help you further your career. I was able to grow in my career and learn different aspects of the mortgage business. I personally have a great work/life balance, but I do see a lot of people (mostly managers) who spend a lot of time at work or working from home after the day is over. The benefits are fantastic and they are definitely on par as a more progressive company in regards to parental leave and overall employee satisfaction. I enjoy working for Capital One and would recommend it to anyone I know."
good,"Capital One really takes care of their employees, offering a fair salary, excellent benefits and perks. It embraces a diverse culture. While I was impacted by the layoffs, I still stand by Capital One as the best company to work for in Richmond. It is also the best company to be laid off by - as it does provide a 60-day notice, your annual bonus, reimbursement for unused PTO and a severance package. Also, the company provides resources for career development. Relaxed atmosphere. The constant thing about Capital One is that it is always changing, so you're always learning something new. There are quarterly team outings to encourage team bonding. I love Capital One!"
good,"A typical day at Capital One is a break during the sign on period to be abreast of daily changes.  We would read our daily information source for updates that have developed the night before up to the morning.  "
good,"Excellent company to work. they are introducing a lot of changes that might be annoying for most employees and customers, but overall a really good company to work."
good,"A typical day starts at 8:30am and the bank is open to customers at 9:00 am upon which we start serving our customers their needs."
good,Excellent company culture with opportunity to grow and advance.  Benefits are great and they try and make work as fun as possible.  Always something to volunteer for compete in.
good,Capital One is on the the best companies I have worked for.  I can 100% stand behind their mission and values!  I worked hard and played hard.

good,I enjoyed working at Capital One. I enjoyed helping customers and meeting new people. The company offered good benefits. They provided good training for the job.
good,"Great culture and truly wonderful place to work.  Unfortunately, pay scales for experienced workers vs.incoming workers are imbalanced.  The campus and management are really great overall, but my biggest hurdle is pay.  It's more balanced on the professional levels vs. the support staff."
good,"One of the best work culture I have come across. Pretty lay back, casual dress code, so many amenities to improve workers life at work. Many social avenues for worker to bond and improve teamwork; ping pong tables, volleyball court, town centres and what not."
good,"Productive and collaborative workplace that continually advances, evolves and invests. Best part of the job is the culture and working with talented and energetic teams."
good,Overall a great place to work. The management style at Capital One is reflective of the CEO's mission to change banking for good. This translates to everyday interactions with management.

good,A very good place to work. Very tech environment. So sweet people and the culture too is so encouraging. I love this i love this i love the place. What  a great place

good,Overall a great company to work for!! Great benefits and the culture is very diverse. Like every company there are pros and cons. What works for one may not work for another.
good,"Great company, tons of benefits and time off. Down side is working every other Saturday. Short lunches. Hours are not always the same every day. Pay is competitive."

good,Capital on has very high standards of customer service and security for its clients. A normal day involved handling escalated calls and verifying individuals. the culture there was made to be very open and fun. I learned a lot about the banking industry as well as fraud handling fraudulent cases. The hardest part was to know that event he most trustworthy sounding person on the phone may be the main person we are trying to drive away from our company for security reasons. I loved being able to stop individuals that wanted to take advantage of others hard work.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Capital One.  They have a great culture that is associate focused and they have great benefits,  There are a lot of great leaders at Capital One."
good,"Capital One is good company to work for with lots of diverse individuals within. The benefits are great and most of the managers are awesome.

The company works really well with assisting their employees the best way they can to accommodate each persons needs.  There are lots of fun days the company allows for each department, awards, certificates, and just to make your work day pleasant.  The position I currently hold can be very stressful and challenging but I love a challenge.  I currently work in a department that provides benefits to our service members and their families.

I was asked to convert to a FT employee with a great salary, so I took it.  I worked in Recruiting for 4 years, and then switched to Legal Recoveries.  The work/life balance is wonderful.  The pay and benefits are great.  The only reason I'm considering leaving is to relocate out of state."
good,Team was very supportive and friendly to each other and customers. No problem was left unattended. Best learning experience for customer service. Training was thorough but hands on experience with the team was the most influential.

One of the best things about the job is the people that work there. They always have a smile on their face and are willing to help.

Great management team, solid benefits and a fun work environment!"
good,"It's a great company to work for if you want to own the pace and direction of your career and don't need a lot of hand-holding.  Independent people seem to thrive here.  There are lots of people who do the 40 hrs/week and it's not looked at as a bad thing by management, so long as the work is getting done and getting done properly.  There are also lots of people who want to move up the ladder fast and they're also able to put in that kind of work.  The usual workplace competition and politics do exist, but it's very minimal compared to a lot of other places.  People managers are all accountable to someone else and senior leadership encourages an open culture.  Work schedule is also very flexible and the culture as a whole encourages balance and growth."

good,"I worked at Capital One for almost 2 years. The company is the best I’ve ever worked for in my short career. I entered the call center environment as soon as I graduated college. I learned many skills that will help me further my career. It is mainly phone interaction with customers which can be a little hard for someone who can’t sit for long periods of time. My pay, time off and benefits have not been matched since I’ve left. I appreciate the management is always looking out to better the environment and allowing ample opportunities for advancement. My only issue is that this is indeed a corporate environment. Meaning if you need time off for personal issues it is taken from PTO. There is no sick time (even with a doctors note). Shifts that’s are early are HARD to come by. I will rate my experience a 10/10. If I’d done things differently. I wouldn’t of left."
good,"customer identification program, love the the team outing  my manager and  coworkers were awesome would had to leave the Tampa Bay area for better job advancement"

good,A normal day would be to come in and clock in for my shift. I would receive a list of accounts I had to call out with taking incoming calls. During this time I was as get to meet with the team to talk about stats and a game plan for a few minutes.
good,"Good pay. No sales goals got insurance from day 1.  Healthy benefits, they pay you to stay healthy and fit. 401k has a great match. Continuing education through Capital One University. Give you money for school too"

good,"I left Capital One to be a stay at home mom to my newborn daughter and gave my manager my notice of leaving the company 5 weeks before my maternity leave was completely exhausted.  Years later, I would like to return to the company, where I was highly successful at, and I'm being told that I abandoned the job and was terminated.  Just make sure you have a human resources manager sign, print, and date (and your manager to be safe) the original notice if you ever put one in and then give the copy to Capital One HR for their files, while keeping one for your files to always keep.  I can even give my managers name, but they said not unless I had a copy of my resignation from 17 years ago..  this is heart breaking."
good,The hardest part about the job was not having a set time to get off. Your day ends when all the mail is complete which was a day by day situation.  Overall all a very good company to work for.

There is a full gym for associates, putt putt golf, bicycles, playstation, xbox, 3-story slide, ping pong tables, foosball. Tons of bank holidays. As long as you do your job, work hard, and try to excel; you can move up the ladder and enjoy the benefits and culture."
good,"Great workplace culture with the ability to work remotely.  Because the team is geologically dispersed amongst several states, technology is a key in keeping the Teams closely knit."
good,"Capital One is a great company, but like politics; it's all local.  So, the group(s) you work in can vary a lot.  However, overall, Capital One heavily invests in new/more/better techniques & processes."

good,"I was quite happy in my position, best place i had worked in my life. However, I reached my threshold when they raised the metrics again.

It's a fast paced environment and steady, but at the same time it's exciting to be able to help someone open their first account, get a loan for their first car or home. Customer Service is one of the most rewarding opportunities ever, because you Meet and Greet so many people that come in the branch. The hardest part of the job is when you really want to help the customer but stipulations concerning their credit forbids you to do so and you have to be the barrier of bad news."

Since this was a new venture for Capital One there was always a lot to learn.  Management was good to us they always made sure that we had the necessary tools to make our daily work flow smoothly.

good,"This was a productive and fun professional workplace. We were very busy assisting customers with account maintenance and problem resolution. I answered incoming phone calls on a phone queue, updated information on the customers accounts, processed vehicle registration renewal information, perfected liens on vehicle titles and helped obtain proper documents for the customers from the various dealerships,DMVs and county clerk offices nationwide. Sometimes it would be difficult to obtain a title from a customer in title holding states in order to correct the title to add correct registered owner information or to secure the lien holder information on the vehicle title. My managers were supportive and helpful when needed. I found the workplace culture great. It was clean and we participated in group activities with other departments. I also played on a co-ed softball team with fellow employees on Thursday evenings. We had a ping pong table in one of the lunch rooms and often had bingo or pizza parties when certain group activity goal were met. The hardest part of the job was not being fully staffed and still having to meet upper management goals in a specific amount of time.

It motivates you to do more because you would want to win. I enjoyed the company that I get from my customers. Most of which were elderly.

Employees get a lot of resignation for what they do and lots and lots of prizes!!!  Co-workers are awesome!  Management is supportive.

The most enjoyable part, was speaking to a diverse amount of people/customers in a day and feeling good about educating them about their credit card and how it works."

If I had to point out any flaws or difficulties to this job, it would honestly have to be the commute. At the time I lived in King George, VA and was required to travel to and from Glen Allen, VA each work day. One way was about an hour and thirty minutes. This is not a problem going forward, but due to this being my first job, I'd have to say I wasn't completely prepared to maintain a traveling schedule.

good,Very much technical to work and updated. Very nice environment to learn more technologies. Balanced work life and personal life. Friendly and comfortable.
good,"My typical day at work includes cleaning and maintenance of the bank. Every day I ensure a suitable and clean work environment for my other peers. I cleanse the entire bank of dirt, dust, grime and debris. I learned to time manage my work pace and I've learned to always do my best at everything I do. I've learned to make things spotless in a timely manner. Also, I've learned to substitute cleaning supplies and items in times of need in order to get the job done, no  matter how long or how difficult it was. I have always been able to maintain everything on my own and make sure the bank was very clean. I wouldn't say there was a hard part, it was a simple yet meticulous job. The most enjoyable part is being independent and working without an immediate supervisor."
good,"Capital One laid off their Home Loans Department, which I was apart of, and I was laid off in this pass Feb. 2018. This company took care of it's employee's through this transition and was and still the best place to work. After, being in the job force after Cap One a short period, it made me appreciate the culture and great people I worked with at Cap One.  This is a company I would love to go back too and get my years and time back and retire at in the coming years. "
good,Capital One is a great place to work with great people. You are a valued member of the teams and they provide you with many ways to educate yourself and stay on top of the changing environment.
good,"My day started off with a stop by the kitchen area, where you could store any self prepared meals for lunch. Eat ware and utensils  always provided. Coffee and tea were also available daily at no cost. I loved the Micro Market, which had plenty of selections of meals, snacks, allergy pain reliever, anything you could possibly need.  Could be accessed at any time while on the job."
good,Great place to work at.....team work the hardest part of Capital One was when they relocated the mortgage department. management had open door policy.
good,on a typical day at capital myself and others are very polite respect and helpful to one another. on a regular day the call volume was high and we did our best to make the customer feel at home n provided them with great customer service and and sure we completed the tasks they needed done
good,Sit with customers discuss the purpose for there visit today.  Give customers options on their needs and explain.  Open the account.  Shake customers hand and thank them for stpping by.
good,Good company to work for. Always room for advancement. Great benefits such as vacation and pto time. Insurance packages were not bad. Pay was not that well
good,"Capital One offered an opportunity to learn and grow. I was able to obtain new skills, as well as display the personal skills I already posses. As a relationship banker, I was able to build trust with our clients, and offer guidance in their financial goals/decisions."
good,"I truly do enjoy working for Capital One. It has a very friendly atmosphere, the benefits are out of this world and you have a chance to become life-long friends with some of your co-workers. I believe it would be beneficial for managers to have previous experience and mandatory knowledge of the department over which they lead. Once someone has proven their hard work and stats, it should be easier to move up into a back office position."
good,"Excellent cafeteria, beautiful building, great location, nearby public transportation, great BSA compliance culture, great communication within intelligence units."
good,The management staff at Capital One was amazing. I learned a ton of new things from this incredible team. I truly enjoyed working for this company and would recommend this job to anyone.
good,"management, customer service, sales, team building, team leadership, coaching , work life balance, volunteer work, charity events, digital banking and P&L"
good,Capital One was very accommodating when I needed to adjust my schedule for school. The tuition reimbursement and health insurance were better than any previous employer.
good,Would recommend to work here culture was always fun and there was a lot of involvement from management as well as other colleagues. Would have stayed if not laid off
good,"Capital One is an excellent company to work for, that offers each employee the opportunity to excel and advance in there career path. I have enjoyed my time with this company."

good,"I loved my time at Capital One. The pay, benefits, culture... it was all great! I sincerely wished I could have moved departments and found a better job for myself there. I would say that the one negative is that if you aren't on the good side of all of the managers in your department, you will likely never get to move departments. It is very hard to go into an interview for a new department when you know they will talk to your old boss who didn't like you based on personal reasons and that will lose you the position you know you would love and thrive in. That is the reason I am not still there."
good,Capital One is great workplace and a great environment.Also benefits are beautiful for a great home/work life balance. Its also wonderful because Capital One allows you to be yourself.
good,Management very understanding. Great work environment and work hours. Enjoyed the Chesapeake VA site and the managers there and great work environment and great meetings. I enjoyed working on special team projects.
good,"The job was a very easy job , i really enjoyed my time there make sure if you try to work here you do not owe any loans . because i witnessed them make a girl pay before she could start."
good,"Great people, great management. Really doesn't feel like you work at a bank. Which in my mind is a good thing. Feels like we work at Facebook or Google. The new alternative corporate experience."
good,"At Capital One typical work starts in agile. Since the process is clear in Agile, I had a thorough understanding on what need to be achieved in a sprint. I learnt work ethics, good management, It is very good work place for the talented. They are well recognized.I enjoyed the sprint ceremonies like deliverable. This is not a place for someone who do not want to work and cannot cope up learning and providing  deliverable using newer technologies."
good,No complaints company was great. Grounds were amazing. Even the the lunch areas were great. Every department has their own goals and rewards. Everyone has great energy and great attitude.
good,"The best job I have ever had. The work is great, the people are great, help is always available, there is very little stress and the culture is second to none"
good,"Had great experience with people i worked with and great customers"
good,I will definitely recommend everyone to apply in this company because I can assure you that they really take very good care of their employees. I really enjoyed working in this company because I really felt like I belong and I never experienced any form of discrimination.
good,I wouldn’t recommend working for the company unless you ensure it is a true capital one location. There is a lot of entitlement in management creating a hostile environment. If you can deal with the politics and nepotism you’ll be fine.
good,Was a fun work environment. Promoted employee happiness. Hardest part was learning how to interact over the phone versus face to face. Had a great coaching program.
good,Capital One is a great place to work with a lot of great people and benefits. Their attendance policy is to the point and sets clear expectations for their employees
good,"Capital one is a great place to work. I really don't know how to bypass this requirement. I don't want to write a longer review right now, but it is physically forcing me to."

good,"A company who had a Major Layoff. Even with the layoffs the employees still have all good things to say across social media. This Company truely appreciates it's employees. I was recently told by a HR Manager from a different company that Employee Appreciation is the fact the I have a Job. The old saying "" You don't know what you have until it's gone"" Is very true once you leave Capital One."
good,"best people best place to work, very understanding managers best campus to work from . learned a lot from capital one had a chance to move from one position to another loved working for this company. to bad my dept was closed."
good,"Everyday you learn something new, the best part of the day is getting recognized for going beyond customers needs to show you care about them. Greeting and meeting new people is always very important; creating a work related bond and memorizing the simple things such as their first name. The only part of the job where it may get nerve recking is audit time."
good,"All about teamwork, great Market manager  who always pitched in to assist in whatever needed to be done. If you needed time off the manager would always work it out."
good,I think when management really shows how much they care it impacts how well you do. I have worked with different call centers and this was by far the best.
good,"As my first call center job Capital One was probably the best company I could have started with. I learned so much in a fun, friendly environment. I will never forget my time at Capital One. I appreciate the the training and skills I have because of them and hope to continue being as successful somewhere else."
good,great place to work wonderful atmosphere. Great pay and benefits. Wonderful opportunity for advancement. Employee appreciation and great people. Will work with you.

good,my schedule is at 7AM est to 4PM est however it is not home based and i literally prefer home based because im a single mom. I learned a lot from this company especially on how i could enhance and help customers on their issues. I enjoyed my stay in this company because it is a fun workplace and they have a lot of activities especially in helping those less fortunate and donating stuff.
good,"capital one was a wonderful company to work for. great work life balance, great benefits and pay. Opportunity for advancement and company sponsored events."

good,"I loved working at this place! The work was contracted as a temporary  job due to Capital One and Costco in Canada."
good,"The management team was very good at keeping employees informed and motivated. They would bring in food or treats for special events, holidays, birthdays, and recognition."
good,Great fast paced environment so you never get board. working for bonuses and other incentives also made it fun. I would move back and work there......
good,Professional work environment.Company has great benefits and really cares about its employees.I would highly recommend working for Capital One. The only con is the work schedule. You will be required to work one weekend day. You will also not be offered a traditional Monday-Friday work schedule when you start. You can only switch your schedule if there is a shift bid and those don't come around often.

good,Really good company to work for. Great managers and love that they take the time to train you in detail. Training is very tough and they are super strict with their attendance policy. The hardest part of the job is that it is very fast paced and you have to know how to multitask for sure. The only thing I can say that I am not a fan of is that I have to work one weekend day and their hours are not easy to change. I would prefer to work M-F from 7-4 and that is not an option.

A typical day consisted of reviewing new mortgage request, reviewing appraisals, analyzing income, reviewing to close loans. Most managers were easy going and did not micro manage. There was a great work life balance with flexible work hours.  The hardest part of the job was working with a customer and for some reason out of our control we are not able to close their loan.  I enjoyed it the most when a customers' loan closed,"

This process takes around 3-4 hours to compile all data required to publish one of the daily dashboards I am responsible for delivering. I continuously report on various metrics and departments throughout the day based on the required deadlines. All reporting and data analysis that I provide is used by leadership in making agent/monetary decisions. It provides a visual view of how and what the department is doing on any given day. Allowing leadership to make real time decisions and quick agent shifting should the data call out a need. "

I have learned to think outside the box and really put myself into the shoes of the customer as a call center representative.  Leadership is great here and truly ensure you are doing the best you can.  My co-workers make the day go by with conversation and the atmosphere is very comfortable. The hardest part of my job is a dissatisfied customer. I strive to make sure every customer feels valued, so when one is upset after we disconnect it impacts me on a personal level. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I know that I have changed the mood of an upset card holder from a company detractor to a company promoter."

good,"A typical day at work was great for the most part. Sometimes we would get super busy with customers needing Auto Financing asap! The customers would apply online for a ""BLANK CHECK"", it allows them to go into an ""authorized"" dealer and purchase as if they where spending actual cash. Meaning, write the check for the purchase and spend $0. COAF is a 2nd Chance finance institution and that in itself attracks a lot of customers. Once they apply we verify app info is valid and fund loans......all day....over and over. I really think COAF is a great company for a number of reason. The main thing is they actually give a dam about their EMPLOYEES as much as their customers. Customers spend the cash and they have a great team to make them cash.....and they make you comfortable in every way! I bonused every month and it was at least $800 everytime! Their starting pay is great and they ARE negotiable.....please use that option in your favor. Out of a 25 person training class, about 17 people negotiated pay and it was granted. All in all I can actually say COAF has been the best employer of all my previous ones. They care for their associates, they reward you in every way, awesome benefits (AETNA) and you are able to advance super quick. As long as you work hard at reaching the common goal, you will be a great success at COAF! The only reason I am no longer employed there is because they relocated, making my commute almost an hour to work. I tried it and it was not fun (Cedar Hill, TX to Frisco, TX)!
