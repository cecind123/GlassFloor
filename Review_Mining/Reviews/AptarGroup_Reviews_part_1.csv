rating,review
bad,"The pay is not fair and they don’t care if you work hard or not, they don’t help to move forward I don’t think think if they want to see they job done they supposed to pay more"
bad,Management is only out for themselves! The culture is terrible at Aptar Lincolnton. Management does not give equal job opportunities for an employee to grow within the company. During my time there there were four different directors of operations and the culture has yet to get any better. As an employee for almost seven years I would never recommend anyone to work for this company!
bad,"Les salariés de ""base"" sont géniaux, ils vous accueilleront sans problème et vous assimilerons à leur environnement au travail."
bad,Where to start. Management believes workers are literally disposable. They don't seek top talent and don't believe in employee retention. They don't invest into the facility or there employee's.
bad,"Worked at Aptar for 4 years.  Was best performing Account Manager in the UK for Beauty and Home."
bad,They have no clue what is going on . Management is horrible . They don’t even know safety procedures . They write you up if you have an accident . Even if you were doing the steps right
bad,Management is clueless to employees needs. Horrible place to work. They expect way too much for way too little. They keep taking everything away and giving nothing back. It was a great place to work twenty years ago when it was Seaquist Closures. It has went nothing but downhill ever since becoming Aptar. I was terminated after twenty seven years of dedicated service to them without so much as a write up. I was nearing retirement and dismissed for little to no reason at all. I feel as though this occured so they could save themselves money. They don't care about their employees well being. Working for them will make you old before your time. They work you hard because they are severely understaffed. They run full productivity even though they don't have enough people to do so. Their training system is poor too. They throw you on machines with no training what so ever and expect you to run it anyway. You are responsible for running up to twenty one different machines at the same time all by yourself on a daily basis. They have a revolving door of employment. They can't even get people to apply there because they have a horrible reputation for mistreating their employees.
bad,"Aptar is a judgemental place, they do not care how you feel, and make up their rules as they see fit. There is no room to grow. The management plays favoritism."
bad,"Horrible hours for little pay. They make you work more than one press and it's highly stressful sometimes I ran 7. you have people swearing and hitting on their presses.. Overall if you like to run a lot of presses on 12 hours with little pay I say go for it, I sure will not"
bad,it was a long hard day at work the managment was not good overall my coworkers were for the most part not nice people but i did like my job it kept me busy most of the time
bad,Human Resources at NextBreath an Aptar subsidiary.  The old lady there is very condensing when talking to employees of color.  The team lead is always looking for someone to sacrifice for their short comings or at the daily meetings.
bad,having been there for 9 years I've seen a few management changes but their current leadership is abysmal. Between switching employees shifts on a days notice and not filling vacancies and over working the current employees this place is an unbearable environment.
bad,"The job the work was fun and easy, but management and other workers made it difficult. Hardcore favoritism along with shady things go on at that plant . Heard great things about the one in WIS. though."
bad,Sobretodo la encargada de las tardes Ana es simpatiquisima y muy educada
bad,No one ever seems to know what's actually going on. Very little training is provided before you are on your own and while you are being trained your trainer usually disappears for long periods of time. Very cliquey people. They either like you or don't and if they don't good luck getting help. Most people are over worked and expected to come in on their days off for meetings. 12 hour shifts on your feet leave you little time to do much on the days you do work. They expect the company to be your whole life
bad,"Management allows "" who you know"" type of supervision style."
bad,Aptar has the potential to be a great company but they need to focus on how they treat their employees and the management within. Bad management can ruin a company and I feel that is what is going on here.
bad,"Worked here for over a year. Company only cares about themselves - not their employees. Any company like that is no good company at all. Compensation was decent, but not worth what you have to put up with."
bad,chef d'équipe et régleur U1-U2.aucun savoir faire dans le management d'équipe. C'est personne ne sont pas assez contrôlé trop de laxisme.
bad,"Los compañeros te ayudan mucho."
bad,the hardest part of the job was I barely got to go use the restroom. and it was 12 hours. way to long for a single mom. I learned how to run 3 machines.
bad,"Typical Day: Assisting President's office with extensive Calendar management, AMS updates, Appointments and daily meetings,"
bad,"Low pay, mandatory OT & stressfull environment. Management was really bad. They just care about producing at all costs and pointing fingers when something goes wrong. Some assembly lines are from the 1950's and it becomes a hassle to run them. Coworkers did'nt help either. They praise about team work but must people just care about their own work and then, they do expect for you to help. Sometimes I'd get stock with twice or three times the work load."
bad,"If you want to make a mountain out of mole hill, this is the place for you.  If you wish to have something to strive for and look forward to from your career, the move on."
bad,"If you are looking for resonable compensation and are willing to work in a demanding environment under stress of being laid off, this place is for you"
bad,"Busy work day for a few workers, Management seemingly BLIND and very forgetful. I enjoyed my work day would go by fast and I felt like I got good exercise at the same time."
bad,This was by far the worst job I've had to endure. The job itself is not bad its just the management. they should have additional staff but rather cram work on individuals.
bad,When I first started used to be a great place to work good raises good benefits Etc. Now their only focus is on how do we pinch more pennies. Everyone now has a bad attitude probably due to not getting raises and getting written up for micromanagement. Do yourself a favor go find a nice family owned company that cares about employees instead of just making money. Aptar has become the Walmart of plastic injection.
bad,Questionable ethics and shady deals with vendors.  Management is very detached from the working people.  Bullying is the norm.
bad,"Trop de taches répétitives, ce n'est pas du tout ce quoi je m'attendais dans ce métier, les pauses sont trop courts ( 2 fois 15 min). Pour moi ce travail à été une erreur. L'environnement est très maussade."
bad,Manque d'expérience et d'intégrité pour certains managers
bad,"You can work your butt off and only be noticed for the times you slip.  No recognition to those that pick up the slack of others.  If you are not ""in"" with the higher ups, you will go no where.  No loyalty, you are disposable whether you have been there a week or 30 years."
bad,"A typical day at Aptar Mukwonago was very exhausting, and mainly overworked at times.  What I learned was to work better as a teamplayer.  Management can very well be improved.  Work place culture could be more diverse.  Hardest part of my job was operating more than five machines at once.  The most enjoyable part was getting along well with my co-workers."
bad,Mauvaise ambiance salaire pas terrible travail sous effectif
bad,Long workdays and hours. Sitting or standing. Very dusty. Enjoyed working with my coworkers. Loud. Fun coworkers. Very warm working environment.
bad,The way their procedures are to get the job done correctly were very difficult to follow. Not quite organized. Management was no very easy to work with.
good,BUT - There is a price for everything and they make sure they squeeze every cent. They abide by the Illinois Employer guidelines and know every single loophole and use them against their employees.
good,They make changes all the time without even asking the employees if it’s ok for them and there life. They went from 8 hours to 12 hours which actually gives you time off. They can be a good place to work but they have a lot of overtime because a lot of people quit or they fire them. They keep a lot of employee’s that don’t want to work so you end up doing there job and yours. If you try to tell supervisor everything gets twisted around on you.
good,entreprise en pleine restructuration que n'ouvre pas d'opportunité en interne et qui préfère la jeune génération a l'expérience
good,"Some managers do not care for their employees well being.  Company is managed by others outside of the location."
good,Travail répétitif . Je ne recommande à personne...
good,Pas dambiance et aucune évolution dans l'entreprise
good,"Work 12 hour per hour"
good,"For North America, only  employees in the Mid-West  Region near Corporate HeadQuarters received advancement and Industry training opportunities on the IS Services Team during years of working there."
good,"Cadre agreable et positive ."
good,"poste agréable,propre,seule contrainte combinaison travail en salle blanche,salaire un peu faible"
good,"Petite agence conviviale, avec une bonne équipe. Une opportunité pour travailler en autonomie"
good,"Politics is king in Lincolnton. If management likes you, you’re ‘in’. Don’t give your opinion unless asked. The only people who have good ideas are the ‘in’ people."
good,"In the 3 years I have been there they consistently have added more responsibility and increased workload with very little increase in pay or bonuses. "
good,"I had worked there 2 years ago. From 2011-2015. The first few years it was a solid place to work with good leadership and sound benefits.  There was a solid work life balance.  However, transitioning from one SAP to another was poorly implemented. Leadership changed and the culture became poisonous to company moral.  What was a solid company became bogged in bureaucratic bickering and operational inefficiency.  I dont know about now but I hope its improved. There were a lot of great employees there."
good,"a typical day at work for me even barely gives me enough time for lunch but the satisfaction of a work well done always keeps me going... my colleagues are all fun and there is always laughter... we've stepped our boundaries a few times among colleagues but they were all always resolved over a nice smile and open conversation."
good,"Typical day:Review requirements, place purchase orders, resolve issues in cost or delivery, negotiate price terms / delivery dates."
good,"Aptar é uma empresa que produz embalagens de cosméticos, como eu era auxiliar de produção, tinha uma meta a cumprir todos os dias, com isso, fiquei mais ágil"
good,it an ok company but u dont get the respect u should and management can be better in my eyes ioverall in a grade level i rate this company a C in the middle average
good,Bonne entreprise. Opératrice en zone grise. Visuel sur binoculaire et conditionnement des produits.routen suivant les bonnes pratiques de fabriquetions
good,There is no confidence in upper management as of late but is a good overall company.  Head HR in the CT facility is not very helpful and discourages people from going into the office also is never there.
good,It a fair job. Have unloaded and run the machine and work in fast  Pace. Running 4 mashing by yourself with no help. Supervisors are somewhat good. Money is good.
good,Être a les coute des intérimaire
good,"Overall the people there are great,it was even kind of fun. It was fast paced so the time flew by most nights.I also liked that they recycled the garbage bags used in processing of the parts, employees could take them at the end of the shift."
good,"Aptar is a worldwide company manufacturing many components made of molded plastics. These products range from lotion and spray pumps, to food and beverage dispensing caps, to medical-grade devices. Overall, Aptar is a good company to work for. However, at the local level, they lack the leadership strength to hold their employees accountable for their daily work activities."
good,Days are some what unpredictable because of poor staffing levels and continued increase in demand. Management is scrambling to get more employees but it seems that people today just do not care about a 40 hour work week.
good,"A good place to work at if your new to the factory life."
good,"bonne note globale car l'ambiance, le salaire et les conditions de travail y sont vraiment convenable et avantageuse."
good,You would sit in a chair for two hours and handle their product that later get shipped off to factories to be put in the bottled products. They also had the machines that made them so occasionally throughout the night you would be assigned to one at least twice. all you have to do their is check the pads and watch the machine to make sure its working properly. some of the people were fun to work with but there were also a lot of weird people to that i didn't get along with. the best part about the job was talking to the people that i was cool with.
good,The job was fantastic when I started with the company back in 2011.  Many changes internally at the plant have not been for the best.  Still a very good job for pay and benefits.
good,environnement de travaille agréable  personnelle a l’écoute conducteur de ligne
good,Aptar was another great experience but the hours where a challenge for me. Aptar was the first assembly and 12 hr shift job I had. I lasted longer than I expected.
good,"my supervisor always giving me the right amount for my review, i was an Machine operator before then Material Handler and i was train as a Forklift opeeator and certify me, i am doing all this job because now they lock of operator and material handler"
good,Environnement de travail agréable et très instructif dans le domaine de la cosmétique.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job to me was working with all the machines and seeing how they operate. The hardest part of the job however was working overnight because I had 3rd shift.
good,Bonne équipe. Bonne ambiance.  bonne organisation le travail week-end
good,"Bonne entreprise aux conditions de travail plus qu'acceptable. Emploi sécurisé et stable du fait du secteur de l'entreprise."
good,Fast paced environment with friendly employees who are there to help you. Competitive Organization where there are many resources to help people grown and learn more.
good,Business trends made for interesting highs and lows.  I learned a lot about scheduling production for off shore locations. Had a great team atmosphere.
good,"Empresa boa, porém ambiente muito agressivo e muita sujeira por ser fundição"
good,"A typical day at work, would be to get my samples from the machines then check my parts for defects and if none the operator is okay to run the machine."
good,My time spent at Aptar Home and Beauty was an enjoyable experience and gave me an opportunity to work with a very friendly group of people as well as management staff and human resources as well.If given the opportunity to recommend this company to anybody that applies there I would recommend them highly
good,"Aptar was an okay place to work. the pay was very good, however, i found the culture to very cold with a severe lack of teamwork. the job security is good as they are a very diversified company. they are also very mindful of employees who have families. management does not engage in furthering a person within the company by way of training. this is a place where you hit the ground running and if you make the cut your on your own."
good,Salary and hours ok. Can be a little crazy not very organized.
good,"When you are sick they are not so nice to you, they give you more than you can handle. They treat the employees that go through them better than the ones that are temps. The temps get more for instance they gave me 8 machines and everyone else 1 and I was extremely sick and said if I want to get sent home I would be getting fired."
good,When I started this position we worked 8 hr .   The 2-2-3 schedule came later. You are expected to be able to work together as well as by yourself. The atmosphere is good. People are friendly
good,Aptar is a good company the benefits are good and we have pension every 5 years. But as an overnight worker the pay rate is too low and employees need to treat more fearly.
good,"Bon avantages financiers, possibilité d'évolution."
good,"Travail en 3/8 assez compliqué au début mais on s’y fait vite à cette forme de travail, poste électromécanicien qui permet de toucher à plusieurs domaine de travail donc plutôt bien pour cela"
good,Era muito animado .Eu gostava de trabalhar lá. A direção eram pessoas muito legais .São pessoas de fácil amizade.
good,"My supervisor was excellent. They were only hiring temos, but then started hiring people straight thru the door, I guess to get people to stay longer than 2 days. Some lines are more boring than others but the job itself is OK."
good,"Interessanter, nach ständiger Verbesserung strebender Hersteller medizinischer Dosiersysteme"

good,"A typical day included checking of emails for any pending work to be reinitiated."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with. My manager was amazing and eager for his people to continue to learn new things and explore further education. I learned a great deal about different aspects in the manufacturing process.
good,I am an automation tech. I am part of a team that keeps the machines in production.
good,"Um dia comum na Aptar era bom , pois todos trabalhavam em um ambiente descontraido e nao estressante ."
good,All the people at Aptar were great.  It's like a big family.  Unfortunately the VP of Internal Audit is impossible to work for.  She has turned her whole team several times.
good,"I was responsible for 100% of purchases on a site level. A typical day involved meeting with co-workers, sales reps, project meetings for quoting.  Tracking purchase requests for approvals in SAP and publishing the purchase order. I, also, resolved any issues with the items or services purchased.  I was a member of the North American region purchasing team to harmonize practices in shipping, payment terms, general ledger accounts, sales tax application."
good,"travail agréable en toute autonomie"
good,"Company is good. but, management is just one man show. and supervisor just do not believe any mechanics. he is always right."

good,"You have to be very conscious of the rules and make sure you know them all "
good,"Typical manufacturing environment and very dated interior. The work life balance is good, however staff does not tend to collaborate with each other making it difficult to progress on projects."
good,L'entreprise est très propre (pharma) c'est agréable de travailler dans cet environnement. La plupart des responsables et chefs d'équipes sont très humain. Dommage que certains employés se comportent comme des enfants.
good,empresa boa nao atrasa em nada salarios etc beneficios bons

good,"De bons souvenirs relation/travail"
good,"Um empresa multinacional, mas com pouco potencial de crescimento dentro da produção."
good,"Aptar hat ein gutes Managment, wenn man sich dort gut anstellt hat man einen sehr guten Arbeitsplatz"
good,I have worked for Aptar for 10+ years.  If you are knowledgeable and work hard there are opportunities for growth.   The company is fair to employees work/life balance.  It can improve on its training programs .  Salaries are on the lower end of pay scales and the health insurance program can be improved.
good,"I did not mind the heavy work loads at times, but I did not like the politics and favoritism games that were played every day.  There was too much nepotism in the employing of people and of keeping people."
good,"In a typical day of work, I'll deal with the costumers, providing information about the projects, also deal with our internal team negociating dates, costs and savings. The hardest part is the negociation, and the most enjoyable is the development of something new in every project."

good,"Aptar is a very nice place to work. The people that work there are very friendly. Benefits are great. Very clean and safe working environment. There is always something to do, not a dull moment."
good,"The work is not hard, its just sometimes they want to add more on you with everything you have going on. Most of the people are friendly but if you can work by yourself then you are better off staying to yourself."
good,"Es una Multinacional que tiene grandes potenciales para adquirir conocimiento."
good,"My overall experience at Aptar has been great. I have been able to successfully move up constantly in the years I have been working here. I have a good work life balance, management is supportive and encouraging. Co-works are always willing to extend a helping hand when needed."

good,I work with a dedicated team of employees with a goal of improving the companies productivity ensuring that we are meeting our customers needs and requirements.  The management team is very approachable and willing to listen to employees concerns and feedback.  I have learned the importance of following procedures to ensure that the companies is meeting all its customer's requirements.  The hardest part of the job is building a culture of team work outside of the Quality Department.  I enjoy the people I work closely with and enjoy helping them succeed.

good,"Cette société est très agréable. Les collaborateurs sont chaleureux entre eux et respectueux. Le management quant à lui dépend entièrement du service dans lequel nous nous trouvons mais dans l'ensemble, c'est correct. Point négatif, une fois qu'on y sort, plus moyen de revenir dans l'entreprise. Et pourtant il n'y a pas de CDI à la clef, que des CDD (et encore, surtout de l'intérim) alors que beaucoup de collaborateurs temporaires souhaiteraient restés."

good,"Aptar Stratford is an excellent company to work for with excellent compensation and benefits. My co-workers & management are excellent.

good,"Working Nightshifts managing between two to four Plastic molding presses. Company provided the best training and support. They really took the time to prepare you for working independently and management always let you know that they were there to support you when needed. Co-workers were unique in their own ways, yet were friendly and approachable, also very willing to help you as you learned the steps and processes. Hardest aspect was working nights, but its contrary was being able to be home with my family in the morning to see them off to school/work. My shift allowed me to have every Sunday off and alternate Saturday."

If you're willing to stick with it for the long haul though they do have amazing benefits like a pension.

The employees I worked with were all very respectful and treated you as though you were any other employee. I really appreciate that the engineering team I worked on made sure to always try and give me work to do that were in my areas of interest rather than assign me busy work that the other engineers were simply too busy to do. As a Co-op student, I gained valuable engineering experience as I learned the fundamental processes that go into product development as well as an exposure to manufacturing setting. Not only this, but my team treated me as another engineer and I regularly got to assist in leading projects and traveling to meet with customers and outside vendors. I greatly appreciate all the effort from the team I worked on that helped me build valuable skills as an engineer. My team was very respectful, helpful, and knowledgeable, which resulted in me both learning a lot and enjoying the work I was doing. I am very thankful for my experience at Aptar; I would definitely recommend for other students to work here as co-ops given the opportunity."
