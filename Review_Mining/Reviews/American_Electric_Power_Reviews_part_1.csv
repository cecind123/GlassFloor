bad,Aep coworkers were back stabbing people. I wouldn't recommend working for aep because the people's are a joke. If employee by aep always watch your back.
bad,"Terrible Company. Deckhands and Assistant Engineers are abused, Captains, Mates, and Chief Engineers pick favorites, no matter how good or bad you are at your job. Former veteran here and my advice is to always watch your back with this company, they will drop you without notice or reason."
bad,I didn't work for American Electric Power.  I worked for American Electric (CED).  American Electric was a great place to work.  I had great co-workers.
bad,"If you like stress, a work place that promotes from within the worst of its employees. Not being recognized for your dedication to your performance and support of the company. Than this is the place for you"
bad,"I was hired for call center position. The entire time I was in training, the trainers and supervisors spoke how they want you to succeed and that family comes first.... that they understand that you’re human and life happens.  That couldn’t be further from the truth.  If you miss work, it hurts your rankings. Everything is based on performance!  You could have 100 calls and 99 of them be simply perfection but that 1 call is what they concentrated on. It’s not what you do right but everything you do wrong.   There’s no leeway.  They also encourage telling on each other for minuscule reasons.  I was so happy to leave and not look back!!"
bad,"I worked at AEP for 3 months on the trading desk. The training consisted of ""take good notes"". The lead trader of the desk at the time was only interested in taking care of his friends and wanted nothing to do with new people. The lead trader was constantly responding to HR about his own misbehavior, which seemed to have no effect. On the third day as an employee, another trader asked me to buy transmission for him. I asked him to show me how. He responded, ""how do you not know this?!?"" to which I responded, ""today is my third day and no one has shown me yet."" He was seemingly unaware of and annoyed by the fact that someone needed to show new traders the procedures. He said to me ""it doesn't matter, it's your responsibility!"" He refused to show me. It was the most petulant thing I have ever witnessed in a professional environment."
bad,"All they do is dispose of employees. It’s a joke. No breaks allowed. Favoritism, sexism, no diversity, no culture. They are outsourcing all jobs to India to “save money”. They are evil."
bad,Very hostile work environment. The supervisors verbal attack the agents.  Very difficult to work there. The supervisors are not understanding or helpful. They do not make you feel welcome safe or respected.
bad,"The entire company is awful, they will keep you employeed as a contractor for ever. The management sucks because nobody knows what they are doing. They also have a contracting company called Easi which is a company i dont recommend working for either because they lie alot. I HONESTLY DO NOT RECOMMEND EITHER COMPANY AS A PLACE TO WORK."
bad,"This company will encourage you to lie to the customers that you are hired to “help”. Supervisors and leads are too busy discussing their vacations, their remodeling plans, their latest shopping trips, or gossiping about other sups/leads or employees to be bothered with answering questions or taking customer calls requesting them. They favor certain employees while others are treated and talked to horribly. You can never use your time off and are blocked by whatever rule that suits them. The"
bad,"AEP was great until they laid off 20% of their works, froze pay, cut benefits and put a freeze on promotions. So, overall, if you just need a paycheck and are willing to be in a high stress, low reward work evironment, it's ok, otherwise don't bother"
bad,"this place is stressful!! There is no work life balance, because they expect your life to be work! Constant hold overs, call outs in the dead of night (yet they want you to be safe but yet call you out when the water is over the roads, icy, ect). Day in and day out getting yelled at over the phones, nearly everyone there suffers from some kind of health issues, you ask for a stand up desk they make you get a note from your doctor to get one, and still wont give you one. You want a supervisor for help? Good luck! They are all hanging out somewhere laughing and joking. This is no place for anyone to work."
bad,"Make friends with the right people and your life is great. Otherwise watch your back. Management out number the employees doing the actual work, hostile atmosphere where each team is encouraged to hang others out to dry. Back stabbing and brown nosing is the only way to get ahead."
bad,"Not a lot of room to grow with this company. However, they are trying their hardest to change the culture. It can be a decent place to work. If you are right out school, try a smaller company first."
bad,They give their buddy’s all the good jobs and management knows this and doesn’t care. Better have a friend high up if you want to advance to something great. You also probably won’t have a job long as they keep downsizing coal production.
bad,1star  managers are inept  job is easy  too much work for the amount of pay  managers are not sympathetic to any personal issues one may have  there are double standards and some mgrs are racist
bad,"Inefficiencies and lack of direction and organization made progress difficult.  Employees would take advantage of relaxed working environment.  It was very frustrating,"
bad,"I was a Transmission Dispatcher in a 24/7 control room environment and was responsible for the day in day out maintenance, storm response, switching an maintenance of the transmission system in Central Ohio."
bad,"Very stressful, and unorganized. The schedules were very hard to get use too, you never knew when things would change. Had alot to learn, and alot of multitasking. I think that management needs to focus on more important things than they do. I worked very hard and did the best I could do, had perfect attendance ...while others did not care about there jobs,"
bad,Overall the job is fairly easy to complete.  Its the management that has their priorities mixed up. The CFO for the company has a few quirks that need to be worked out before they loose very good employees. Most employees are not there long enough to be an asset to the company due to the personality clash that the CFO may have with that employee.
bad,The culture of the corporate office is varied depending on which department you are in.  My suggestion is not start as a contractor as they promote you to different positions with the promise to hire then never actually follow through. Nepotism runs deep in this company.
bad,"It's hard to explain how terribly treated  you are at this Nuclear Site. Management never will back you, and its NOT SAFE to SAY! Most fellow employees are a pleasure to work with. After that be prepared to watch your every move."
bad,"Good if you just need work for short time, no advancement opportunity"
bad,I was targeted because of the color of my skin and made fun of. My manager at the time was the main reason my productivity went down hill. I hated being the but needed the job.
bad,"This company promotes unqualified people to senior leadership positions and it is killing the general morale.  Training materials say all of the right things, but the actions of leadership are inconsistent with the culture propaganda. Actions speak louder than words."
bad,Manager throws employees under the bus to cover himself. You know there is a problem when the manager calls HR on an employee. Supposed to work the other way around right? This used to be a good place to work. Don’t recommend.
bad,"Corporate management will not let you do your job,  too much emphasis on cultural diversity programs, not enough emphasis on  integrity of the grid.  No such thing as common sense with this company.  With the right upper management this could be a great place to work."
bad,A typical day at AEP consists of getting a job assignment from management and being able to communicate with co-workers to complete the task. The most difficult part of the job is being able to multi-task the required work load.
bad,"Good place for electrical engineers to work, great benefits for full time employees, job security.  Interesting projects, good people to work with. Flexible for personal issues."
bad,"9 weeks of paid in class training, but not enough on the phone experience. Only one manager on night shift, so not enough support and resources for new employee to work effectively."
bad,"If you are going to work out on the river I suggest another company other than this. It does pay more and they do have decent benefits but the promotion sucks and they have a click and if you are not apart of it then watch your back. I have seen good people get fired for minor infractions. I would work for Archer Daniels, Marathon or someone else if I was wanting to work on the river."
bad,"Answering phone calls from AEP's 11 state territory. Mostly dealing with billing questions. Adjusting bills, setting up payment agreements, extensions. Also dealing with commercial accounts. Inputing new customers in to Virtual Agent computer system. Faxing, filing, mailing documents to customers and agencies."
bad,"enjoyed my time working with american electric power, i would recommend it to anyone who wants to advance into career fields like this one, i enjoyed the percs"
bad,I worked with good people and learned much while I was there.  There is much talent at AEP.  Unfortunately it is squandered by poor management.
bad,"My supervisor was not there the entire summer and did not teach me anything so I learned very little. I typically went to work and expected to not get taught anything and have to try and learn some advanced application software on my own with no prior knowledge of that particular software. That by far was the hardest part of the job, especially when communication to my supervisor was extremely difficult to accomplish. The only thing that I actually enjoyed that the company did was take all the co-ops and interns on a trip and did a ton of different activities."
bad,I was hired to lead the financial activities of the unregulated side AEP and the position lasted six months before AEP bowed out of the unregulated utility businesses and my reason for working at AEP disappeared.  AEP quit the unregulated utility businesses as a direct result of the bankruptcy of Enron
bad,"This was an okay good company to work for, as the pay was good.  However, they were very disorganized at the corporate level and communication between corporate units was nonexistent."
bad,The station in Lawton was very tough to work in. It's hard to learn from people that are hostile 80% of the time.
bad,There are more contractors working in this building than full time folks.
good,This is a highly stressful call center.  The call volume is very high.  However it is the very rude customers that they service that make the job unbearable.  The employees that have been there a while offer no help.  The people that are suppose to take the escalated calls are rude and often don't help.  The process for getting a set work schedule is based on a bidding scale.  So you may end up with a schedule you don't like or can't even work.
good,"not a pleasant place to work. dirty dusty management was nonexistent and no raises or room to move up. if you can kiss enough butt you can get moved to ""better"" positions where you do more work and get paid the same"
good,"Long hours for not enough compensation, long commute (uncompensated), poor front office. But the field supervision made it O.K."
good,As a contractor I did the duties of a full AEP level employee (and in my case more because of my background in tech support) for a fraction of the income. A little lopsided but that's how their system works. It takes 10 years or so to graduate to actual AEP employee. I couldn't continue in the holding pattern.
good,I did not like being a contract employee. They didn't give you any leeway if you have to go to restroom more than 3 times a day. Training was very good.
good,Went to become a lineman have been stuck in this job with what seems no future. They are planning to lay people off and they are doing it by seniority. I have wasted almost two years chasing a dream that i was worthy of achieving. Instead i have to hurry and find a new job to provide for my family.
good,"Company is old school in why change if we have been doing it this way for 30 years."
good,"Typical day at work is always unknown  due to the area you may be assigned.  You always feel like another reader has a better area that is less stressful.  Immediate management is pretty cool but upper manage is not understanding about a lot of the issues that are going on.  They tend to compare their time as meter readers 20 years ago to that of today.  They show no sympathy to the weather conditions or the meter reader..  The hardest part of the job is having to consistently work weekends that is not volunteered.  The most enjoyable parts of the job is break time, finishing up routs early, lunch and  the driving in between sites as well."
good,I like the people I work with and i like the job just want to be hired on full time and get PTO and benefits. Also would like to find a job that uses my 4 year degree.
good,If you want your life to be all about the job and only the job this is the place to be.
good,"Good Job, But with all the benefit cuts and they are no longer competitve in the job market in our area for qualified workers, and are letting qualifed people just walk out the door with an ""oh well"" attitude,"
good,Good place to work great cultured with flexible schedules. Will always work independently on a daily basis with heavy call volume and required to maintain stats.
good,Things were getting really bad towards the last two years there.  Consultants - Management drinking the Kool-aid.  Sad they couldn't look at the whole picture.  There was no life-balance.
good,"Loved the job but disliked the atmosphere.  Great benefits, meet lots of long lasting friendships, management not flexible as far as monitored bathroom breaks."
good,A Typical day would be always act safe and service meter's at residential and business. Management don't really care about you the just want the job done with no accident's.Workplace culture is a joke there. The hardest thing is not being able to advance.The most enjoyable thing there is the pay check.
good,"This is a great place to work if you are an engineer and/or ultra conservative white man.  Women, gays, just don't.  They claim to be all for diversity but in the actual working environment it doesn't come through.  "
good,AEP could do better in employee - relationships. I find it to be just a means of paying my bills at this time
good,"Never a dull moment, Always learning new laws,information"
good,"Unrealistic safety expectations sometimes. Pays well but overtime is not scheduled, you're always on call. Tough to balance a personal life. Health insurance is ok but not great. They're currently cutting jobs."
good,This should not be a required field. I am currently working for this company and am not comfortable speaking about a company I am currently working for
good,The pace is slow.  The people are very nice and have lots of institutional knowledge.   They care about the communities they serve and are very charitable.
good,"I worked door-to-door. In the winter, it was had and we didn't get paid that much.  We were asked to try and get customers to switch their billing plan for electricity and it was complicated and honestly not beneficial to anyone."
good,"Very stressful working environment. Manatory overtime. Cutthroat management. Nuclear industry has uncertain future. Good pay, great benefits, good vacation policy."
good,"AEP  hires a lot of contractors.  If you have the luxury to wait to be hired in as their employee, it would be a great place to work.  They treat their employees really well."
good,eeehh not that fun working with electric company customer issues
good,"Current management is going backward in culture. Despite their assertions, they are not inclusive. Management is becoming more like the ""old boys"" club that existed years ago."
good,"The tools of the job are truly awful. As of May 2012, the company is using Office 2002 (not even upgraded to major release 2003). An old version of Lotus Notes is used for email."
good,"When budget cuts come down, the people asked to leave or forced to resign are the ones that did go to VT or aren't Republicans."
good,"Workplace culture is very important to me, it could use major improvements.  There are great people that work there, but leadership is flawed in a few areas."
good,Worked in a fast paced environment taking in coming calls regarding customers electrical accounts . Company offers great benefits and they have a lot of perks.
good,"The management was inefficient at times but i met some great people there, the company itself is money hungry i got more calls where customers just vented and i listened most complained about added fees on their bills which varied by the state they resided in and sometimes there was stuff i was unable to do."
good,"Company has local plants in Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Louisiana that are serviced from the Dallas area. Work can be fast paced and varied.  Compensation is good."
good,The people that I worked with were fantastic.  I loved how we came together and got things done.  The other people in the company were great as well.  The problem arose with the high amount of politics that came from management.  Safety is also not one of their concerns.
good,"Management had a lot going on and the communication disconnection, disconnected some of the task needed to implemented. Not a clear and concise picture of details was communicated. Although communication was always being challenged, the company continuously strive for improvement."
good,5 year turnover..and learning was always in the days working on all types of projects. Safety Safety and more.. I agree some people  think its funny ITs NOT
good,"The people I worked with were fantastic. However, my manager (the last one I had) was somewhat passive aggressive. You start out in a contract to hire position and becoming a full employee is based on performance. Being a power company, overtime is mandatory and sporadic. I had tons of angry customer calls, a few calls that were an hour long, and lots of being held over for 4+ hours. If you can strictly work the hours on your schedule, this job isn’t for you."
good,"High paced and stressful.  Jobs and promotions are done on a ""who you know"" basis and not qualifications.  Difficult to move up. I'm not sure what else to tell you.  I have no other comments."
good,"enjoyed working for AEP, was part of the size reduction"
good,"I was at AEP for a short term contract.  Did not have a lot of time to get too involved in the culture.  No complaints about the company, but no opportunities for career growth for me."
good,"Decent work environment just wish the pay was a little higher for living needs. Overall, this company wasn't too bad and treated their workers fairly."
good,"I worked for RSO which is owned by AEP. it was a pretty new company and had a lot of flaws. overall the experience was great, very fast paced. AEP was and is a great company just the RSO division was lacking."
good,"Very structured and old fashion. Great owner. if you do your job you will be fine. Be on time, do your best, and this job will pay and be a great opportunity to learn."
good,Good company to work for. Worked on river boat. Stayed gone 21 days and then home 21 days. Compensation was decent. Insurance and benefits were good as well. Retirement and 401k
good,Always had a paycheck.  Overall good place to work.  Good insurance overall fellow employees were good to work with.  Enjoyed my time at AEP and the fellow employees.
good,Fun place to work with great benefits. It's very fast passed with great people to work with. High amount of politics in the management scene.  Safety is not their highest concern.
good,Working with the dogs and people not being aware of the damage that can result from where they are tied up or let to roam in thier yard. Did not care for this job loved the walking but people  have no reguard to what they put around the meters. I laughed sliding down a big mud bank to get to the meter that a person had boxed in under a porch he had built around it.
good,AEP has a strong community feel and provides plenty of challenges.
good,sucessfully dealing with all types of contractors on every level of the project.
good,"A lot of corporate red tape, but a nice work environment, good management.  Roll need to be better identified at the time I worked there but the technology was solid."
good,I like my job and have had a lot of good to note throughout my career. I personally feel that AEP is going to be around for a long time however my current line of work may not be.
good,"Rotating 12 hour shifts (6-6) with 1 week off a month"
good,Contract opportunities prevalent.  No growth potential but great management and work environment.  Good area and great people.  Need to upgrade systems.
good,"Although it is a great company on paper, it is difficult to move up. Current culture dictates diversification. Many people have been overlooked for positions recently(past few years) that should have been promoted."
good,Overall it was a call center enviornment. large desk and spacious. alot better than many other places. you have room o breath. Pay it pretty good. benefits are great. really good family oriented company
good,Pay and benefits were more than fair and a great group to work with. but we spend 4 nights a week on the road. Good training and advancement opportunities
good,Great place to work. Most of the workload is being handed off to contractors. Non union job with the good ole boy system. A lot of training. They do require you in substation to learn a lot of jobs and information.
good,"This company served me very well for the last 13 years. The benefits, wages, and compensation package were not at the top of the industry; but competitive. A lot of good people trying to steer a very large ship into a very tiny port. Efforts of employees do not go unnoticed by local leadership, but they often get lost in the corporate haze. Overall, AEP has been a fantastic place to work, provided me a multitude of experiences and learning opportunities, and provided my family and I a very comfortable lifestyle."
good,"less work stress, more work life balance good company stable job more beneficial for career in power electronics and systems growth is ambiguous less coding jobs"
good,"Management has lack of respect for person of color, favoritism was given and provided to specific people. If you are not in the inside group you cannot have clear and safe job security."
good,Politics was too ingrained with upper management. Often difficult to really understand what was wanted and needed from them. Felt as if there were unknown agendas. HR guidelines did not apply to the upper management group. I felt I could be disciplined or fired at any time with no reason. In my position I had no opportunity for arbitration.
good,"A busy company working to change its safety, environmental, and employee culture. The the benefits are very good and employee tries to good care of their employees."
good,"A typical day was challenging, because I dealt with irate customer as my main duty.  But I enjoyed the challenge involved in solving the issue of the customers."
good,"It was a well paying position with some direction. I would have liked more support from the actual management, and I felt that when we left there was little debriefing and that the they didn't care a whole lot. Got along well with co-workers, though."
good,"Great company to work for, however, the management needs to be revamped.  Most management positions do not funnel the proper information down the ranks and employees are left to make decisions  without guidance.  This causes an unnecessary amount of stress."
good,"AEP is a great place to work just want to explore my options, just do not want to get complacent and want to see if I could better myself in a different jobs."
good,Great place to learn and grow of experience. I guess like many other companies they don’t place great leadership. Pay depends on sometimes who you know not of how hard you work.
good,"The job I had was fun and challenging, "
good,Not a lot of room for advancement. The company didn't work well with me when I had to have surgery. I felt rushed back to work when I wasn't fully ready.
good,"I was only at this job for 6 months, it was temporary. for the most part I did grunt work, digging holes and setting poles. lots of overtime. everytime it storms, count on going to work and wear your rain suit."
good,"Very fast paced, stressful but rewarding job. Resolve and initiate solutions to complex distribution"
good,This is a very well established company that just keeps growing and innovating with technology. If you are interested in the utility industry this is one of the best places to work for.
good,"Structure and price large wholesale power contracts, monitor costs associated with power delivery and develop risk mitigation practices to ensure costs are properly accounted for."
good,"It's a great place to work off you're an actual employee. If you are a contractor it is still good,  but there is a clear divide between the actual employees and contractors."
good,"They hold you accountable for numbers that you cannot control. They say you are a CSR but make you sale a product. If person doesn't connect or hang up, you r accountable. They hold you accountable for payment plans made AND how much of payments come back, you cant control that."
good,Typical River work for how they handled their self and how they talked a big game but when it came to promotions time it’s about who wot knew in the office
good,"A typical day at work provides many opportunities to learn and grow, but also presents most with the opportunity to see the influence of the corporate lifestyle."
good,"While replacing electrical equipment seems complicated, it's actually very easy. Load up the van with new meters, drive out to an address, replace the meter, repeat. The managers and fellow employees are friendly and are always willing to lend a hand. The main point of stress comes from making numbers. The heads of the project demand a set number of meters replaced each week, while not fully taking into account of the different factors that would delay progress. Factors such as bad weather, commute time between addresses, and damaged equipment that may require additional time to rectify."
good,"Good Place to Work, but varies by Department. It's a big company with operations in 11 states. You experience will likely depend on your work location and functional department."
good,Very strenuous about scheduling. I was a student at the time I worked there and it was made very clear that it was not important. New hires are at the bottom of the food chain no matter their skill level.
good,Good company. Production driven - poor in nuclear power.  Mediocrity a norm.  Very good people at plant. Good design.  Accountability for workers is mixed.
good,Being a part of a team protecting one of the largest electrical infrastructures of our country was very exciting. AEP was at the forefront of Cyber Security & Physical Security and the marriage of the two. Great opportunities to learn and grow.
good,"I loved all my coworkers, would still be there if they wouldn't have laid off a bunch of employees, I was never fast at the 10 key but with being at AEP for so long I can now do over 10,000 key strokes"
good,I learned many new skills while working there. Co workers turned into great friends and management always got us the training we needed to perform our jobs
good,AEP is a very large corporation with lots of room for advancement.  As with many large companies there can be politics involved.  Depending on your group and management your experience will vary greatly.
good,I had really good managers and mentors. They were always very flexible with me once I started my family. I had to get my work done but was able to work off hours as long as it didn't negatively impact a project. The assignments were always very challenging so I was never bored.
good,"The work at AEP has always been challenging and rewarding.  With all of the EPA regulations and deregulation in Ohio, AEP has focused on the regulated utility model as the number 1 priority.  We have great folks working at AEP that have risen to the challenge year after year to keep the company competitive.  We are rewarded by fewer employees and less opportunities for growth."
good,Good place to start working at... You learn alot and also work in harsh weather conditions
good,"This is a good company to work for.  There is never a slow moment, but I enjoyed the work.  Co-workers were wonderful to work with and the rest of the team was great."
good,"Great benefits, good people, solid work environment. Great safety environment."
good,The typical day while working with the American Electric Power Company was exciting for me. I was hired on as a  temporary employee. The assignment that I was given was new and fulfilling during the time.  The management staff were professional and patient with me. My co-workers were phenomenal and worked together as a team/unit. The most enjoyable part of the position that I held as a temporary employee was that I was able to learn the trade. I was introduced to skills that I utilized quite well in the field as a AEP meter reader. I was also introduced to many residential as well as commercial and business clienteles.
good,"A typical day at work would include checking weather report.  Looking over attendance, so that if anyone called off the reconnects and disconnects could be transferred to another Specialist.  Answering questions from Supervisors, and field personnel regarding customer's accounts."
good,AEP is one of the largest energy utilities in the United States with annual revenue over $15 billion.  I worked in the Commercial Operations department where we bid our assets into the market and bought and sold energy commodities.
good,Very friendly people
good,"Learned a lot, very flexible hours. Had a lot of exposure to different areas of the company"
good,Loved working for the company. The learning experience was there and the work experience is something I’ll always be thankful for! All I can say about the company that’s negative is don’t get hurt at work because they will not take care of you!!
good,Overall I enjoyed my 32 years employed by Aep. As any job it had its pros and cons. It was a good experience overall nothing really bad that I have to say.
good,"A great place to work! Wonderful facilities & cafeteria! I was a consultant there - so my perspective may be a little unique. We were always having large-group meetings and there we only a limited number of conference rooms that were able to hold 15+ people within the room. Also, we were always moving around from room to room - so the slowness of the elevators downtown was a hindrance when we had back-to-back meetings, and was often tramping that carpeting up and down the hallways - which really needed to be updated/was very dated."
good,"Would recommend working for AEP to family and friends.  I had opportunities to advance, excellent benefits, and interesting and challenging work activities."
good,"The pay is decent, i had no benefits because I was a contractor, everyone keeps saying there are advancement opportunities but there doesn't seem to be any clear cut way to do so.  Many people working the same role for 4+ years, seems to be more about who you know and if you are liked than actual merit."
good,Company is out of business. The company had great equipment and training. Management was not honest with its associates. High stress work environment.
good,The time I spent at American Electric Power I developed life long friendships and obtained business experience that will assist in my future job endeavors.
good,"I would answer calls and help customers with their bills, such as make payment arrangements, explain bill, handle power outage calls, open and close accounts,"
good,"great experience, good atmosphere, work enviorment safe and clean. great incentives and enjoy helping customers"
good,"Work closely with IT field operations supervisors and technicians to report issues on the network, equipment, and SCADA devices."
good,Organization is committed to its goals. Views itself as a public service as well as committed to shareholders. Experiencing transition at this time.
good,"The call center services 11 states. So, if there is a storm, outages,utility problems you could be working all night. Which is mandatory. You have no life with this job, The benefits are great!"
good,AEP is a good place to work and does what they do well.  There is a tendency to do things the way they've always been done because that's how they've always been done.
good,Always willing to go the distance for it's employees to ensure that they are comfortable at their job. Training and advancements within the company are available to any one with experience and proper certifications
good,Generation in the coal fired power plant industry is volatile. The salary is at the high end of the industry. Shift supervisors are knowledgeable and helpful
good,No review to be provided for AEP.  I am not willing to/or elect not to share any discussion regarding AEP other than the answers noted above in this survey.
good,Being forced to work night shift because I was new even when I exceeded goals didn't seem.right and had to leave due to work life balance that wasn't a good fit.
good,"Compensation is not great"
good,good place to work.  not easy to be promoted.  there is a lot to learn there. the working environment is safe and respectful.  must be able to multi-task.
good,"I work 12 hour swing shift (days & nights). One half of the day or night consist of operating / monitoring the unit from the control room. The other half of the shift I work out in the plant monitoring and check equipment operations."
good,AEP covers a large foot print and offers many different career paths.  AEP has many benefits that its employees may take part in.  AEP is working every day to make its work place a positive Culture.
good,I wish I could have retired from AEP. I met good people there. I learned many valuable skills and I learned experience in managing people and situations.
good,Many meetings to attend to provide feedback and updates to the senior leadership team.  Lot of time reading or writing reports and completing corrective actions.  Worked with many different departments to coordinate material arrival to the plant as scheduled.
good,"work as a team , able to problem solve on your own. again your safety high priority, workout in the morning , safety meetings good time talking with other employees"
good,"Enjoyed my job, stressful, learned new computer skills, good working conditions, hardest part of job was working storms,lots of long hard hours for all involved in restoration."
good,The size of AEP can cause some issues with slow change decisions.  There is also an effect of remote management that causes issues with customers who are accustomed to local approachable management.  AEP did make changes in structure that improved the response to customers and employees.  PSO a company owned by AEP is a great place to work with excellent executives.
good,"Good place to work , every day starts with a safety briefing and upper management is involved.  The people work together to get the job done and are most interested in seeing the project completed on time and budget."
good,Good company. Adaptable to changing business climate. Compensation market based. Stable working condition. Very concerned about employees and their family benefits.
good,"I spent over 20 years at AEP and enjoyed all of them.  My peers were actually friends and I do miss working with them.  "
good,Worked as a contractor. Good atmosphere. Direct employees treated contractors with respect. Managers listened and were there to facilitate. Good work organization. The work day went pretty smooth.
good,"Excellent personnel. Director set the guidelines, simple. Each person knew their roll and gatekeepers. Direct boss & Engineers were outstanding and helpful. If you are not contract personnel, and find a place this good, stay there forever."
good,"Most of the work was out of town, but I learned an extensive amount of information working for a great Foreman. The higher was surprisingly involved with crews. "
good,"Work is good, co-workers are great, management is average. It is a very interesting job to do, you can learn a lot, but is just way too time consuming, there is only time to eat and sleep, and then go back to work."
good,"8 hours providing superb customer service to customers across 11 states.  I learned negotiation and de-escalation skills to provide our customers with the best possible solution during the worst conditions.  Co-workers were excellent.  The hardest part of my job was call outs and extended hours due to unforeseen circumstances such as weather, customer incident etc."
good,"Company of accounts and engineers!  Not a lot of andvancement, running so lean that it is difficult to gain valuable experience.  When jobs do open, the company is only looking for senior level individuals that can ""hit the ground running"".  The work has to get done so there is not a lot of room for entry level employees to learn and grow."
good,Overall a good company to work at in the end.   Advancement was hard but the experiences learned was worth it in the end.
good,Compensation was very good. A good stable environment. Many good years there
good,"Reviewed work requests with maintenance and operations leaders to prioritize."
good,"Its a very good place to learn new things and explore more."
good,"On a typical day, I support upper management and employees with questions and issues that arise, provide on-boarding service to new contractors and employees, other administrative tasks, and budget reconciliation."
good,"AEP is finding itself in a difficult environment. As an electric provider that is largely based on burning coal, AEP is finding it challenging to compete with providers based on burning gas and'or utilizing nuclear."
good,"AEP has been investing heavily in its transmission system, creating lots of new projects and work to be done. However, they are not keen on expanding the work force to be able to accommodate this work load. Additionally, changes and additions to the engineering process have dramatically increased the time to complete new projects. Management does not seem to understand how their decisions impact the people on the bottom."
good,"Enjoyed working  for AEP.  Lots of different experiences. Long hours, but good pay and benefits. Good training for each different job. Safety is number one priority."
good,Good electrical utility company. Easy to work and learn from other employees. Flexible and great benefits. One of the largest utility companies to work for.
good,"During normal online operations, its standard job conditions, 40 hour work weeks with occasional overtime."
good,I enjoyed my career and the company was good to me overall. It's a large organization and the individual is easily forgotten. Recent shifts in management focus from the job at hand to chasing after the latest trends in the industry are hard on the more seasoned employees.
good,"Well structured and organized, continuous training. Supervisors possessed high degree of technical competence. Productive meetings. Efficient tools and documentation available for completing tasks."
good,"Nice place to work with good people for the most part. "
good,AEP is well-positioned as a utility company.  Has done a great job changing with the market and converting coal assets to a balanced portfolio of modern assets.  Resourceful with a large footprint.
good,"-I managed the tool room at my own pace"
good,"Lack of advancement opportunities. Great benefits, but is not my ideal location and coal power is shutting down. Union work so there is good and bad in anything. You sometimes might have to deal with an I do not care attitude at all levels."
good,"Answering between 60-100 calls a day, the calls were only limited to 5-7 minutes.  Tickets system was base off of Service Now.  The management was open minded to take suggestions and was able to give positive feed back. The hardest part of the job was not being able to used you complete skills in assisting customer due to the time limited.  The enjoyable part was able to have a atmosphere where the team work as one"
good,the external consulting firm reviewing and restructuring all areas of the business has had a a very negative impact on IT and shared services
good,"Hard, labor intense work.  Co-workers are family.  Pay and benefits are good.  The company promotes safety and generally cares about employee well being"
good,"I am a contractor and this has been a great opportunity to get in with a company who pays well, and provides experience I wouldn't be able to gain else where. If you are offered a position to work as a contractor or get hired permanently, take it! You won't regret it."
good,Its a great place to work if you can get into the company. THe benefits are amazing and the salary is above average. The atmosphere is relaxed and there is plenty of training provided.
good,They tried hard to make the culture at aep better. They were succeeding when I left. I would work for them again in the future giving the chance. Would recommend.
good,"High speed and high stress environment working in nuclear power.  As a management employee, expected to be part of the emergency response organization and involved in refueling outages.  Good compensation, great community support, good charitable causes encouranged."
good,"Nice, Fun, Learning experience, knowledge based learning, it was great to learn, collaborate with SMEs to implement Enhancements with accuracy and efficiency, also within specified timelines"
good,it was fine i guess. it could be pretty boring cause you are there a lone a lot and hardly work with anyone. but it was relaxed and as long as you can follow intructions its an easy job
good,"AEP is a great company to work for, they compensate you well, and also make sure everyone leaves the same as they came in. The most enjoyable part is that you get to do something different almost everyday."
good,"Excellent promotion opportunities."
good,"The work environment was a government site and was unchanging but, provided a great environment to work in. I enjoyed working with the management team."
good,"Able to work alone or with a team in various locations"
good,This job was very driven by how many phone calls you made per day- very numbers driven. You answer a ton of phone calls a day and work as if you are emergency personnell
good,"Very active job with exposure to dangers in the electrical field, dogs, people with lots of driving and exposure to all elements of weather."
good,Extremely busy days due to contruction projects and normal maintenance.  Dispatching a transmission system of this size is a learning experience that never stops.  Management can be difficult to work with at times but overall do a pretty good job.  Co-workers are helpful for the most part and generally willing to help when the need arises.  Hardest part of the job is making sure everything is performed perfectly/safely at all times.  Most enjoyable part of the job is the job itself.  Love dispatching.
good,Great place for working mothers excellent benefit packages. Flexible hours are great for busy working parents. Great people to work eith

Internal business group that relied on work from business groups inside AEP. After the merger of CSW-PSO with AEP, AEP's internal documentation group took more of the lead and eventually was dissolved."
good,"Typical day at work involves checking emails, attend meetings, working on existing projects, and/or devising new alternative to mitigate reliability issues associate with system performance."
good,I worked on the boat 28 days at a time and usually worked 6 hrs on watch and then 6 hrs off... working 12 hrs total a day. I usually bulit tow for the most part of my trip and then i also cleaned and painted the other times.
good,I've been working at AEP 11 years on and off since 2001. It is a great place to work as a consultant.
good,This job provided the necessary job experience to move into other positions.
good,Outside everyday - troubleshoot alot
good,"It was a great place to work with good pay and benefits. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people, the least enjoyable was that I had several ""command and control"" type supervisors in my years with the company."
good,"I really liked working for AEP, but there was a lot of corporate ""Kool-Aid"" that was passed to all the employees. There were many areas which were inefficient, but overall I loved working there."
good,"Good working environment at most AEP locations. Atmosphere is relaxed and fairly casual. Management was, for the most part, friendly and helpful. I would work here again if given the opportunity."
good,Productive place On and on a typical   day at the office work what you learned management workplace culture the hadest part of the job the most enjoyable part
good,Call center environment in receipt of many frustrated callers on a daily basis. Not the place to work if you want a relaxed environment especially during storms & outages!
good,"Overall, it's a very great company.  They work towards advancing their employees, and generally care about the individual. I would recommend if you have the proper qualifications that you apply here."
good,"The biggest perk of working here is the culture within our team.  We have a great group of people in telecom.  With the growing pains the company is facing it's hard to see any advancement or permanent placement in the future.  They have red and blue badges and everyone seeks that red badge, but few get it."
good,I did not work here long enough to generate an accurate assessment of the organization. I did see a positive environment and advancement opportunities available to the full-time employees that worked there every day.
good,Excellent atmosphere to work in. They did a great job in steering me in the right directions and never leading me astray. Overall great group of people to work for.
good,"great co-workers that I still remain in contact to this day."
good,Very enjoyable experience working at AEP.  I thoroughly enjoyed the culture and people.  The work was enjoyable and the people were great.  Lots of work and it was challenging.
good,"Generally working at AEP in the engineering section was a good experience.  Great exposure to a wide variety of technologies.  However, the opportunities for advancement were not great, especially for senior positions.  People tend to become highly specialized in certain areas."
good,"I was working as a Site Manager, had several crews to oversee,(structural, civil, and piping.) I learned that I had to do my best to make all duties work smooth and finish projects on schedule. All employees had a good knowledge on their craft .My hardest part of my job was when I had to release someone for wrong doings.The part I enjoyed the most was have everyone go back home in good health and no injuries."
good,It was a good career advancement opportunity but the location and city was slow for me and my family. The company pays great and also the longevity of the place was a bonus
good,"My day started between 7am and 8am.  My years at AEP were divided between Customer Service in the office and outdoors reading electric meters.  We had daily safety huddles. It was always important to stay aware of your surroundings.  I accepted customers' payments for their monthly bills, I performed adjustments to accounts that were read wrong in error.  I transported monies to financial institutions.  As a meter reader, I walked daily from house to house reading meters.  Some meters were located in desolate areas and others in narrow traveling lanes.  I walked in rain, snow, sleet, hail and many other weather conditions in order to do my job.  I enjoyed the people i worked with and I enjoyed meeting customers out and about on my daily routes."
good,"AEP is a comfy stable job that anyone could retire from. However (in my experience), they aren't looking for innovators. AEP is a good place if you want a 9-5 job (nothing wrong with that). For those who have the passion and desire to innovate, it feels as if you are restricted."
good,"AEP was a great place to work.  Working there and retiring after 33 years of service, they were fair, had great benefits, encouraged and assisted in continued education with no limits of opportunities for advancement."
good,The benefits and compensation were excellent. Shifts were hard to work at times being away from family late hours. Some of the metrics used were not attainable.
good,American Electric Power is a leading electrical generation supplier and transmission company. They work hard to keep things online and the electricity available.
good,"A great safety culture, caring management.  Opportunities for advancement.   Tulsa office has cafeteria and gym.   Computer and people skills are both valued."
good,"Participated in Cost Estimation Class 5, Class 4 and Class 2 to remediate applications and also various other dispositions. Analysis of effort model and data in the estimation sheet. Assist Project Manager in Project management Plan and Resource Planning"
good,Held multiple positions at this large corporation over 30+ years. The last 8+yrs I spent in the Distribution Dispatching group as a Dispatcher III. The work was fast paced and required someone comfortable at multi-tasking.
good,AEP - DC Cook was a great place to start my career.  I learned a tremendous amount while working there and was able to travel around the country evaluating suppliers.  This allowed me to learn a lot from how different products we use at a nuclear plant are fabricated.  I got to meet a lot of new people and felt like family there as well.
good,"A company that cares about its employees, community, and environment."
good,"I typical day at work for the electric company is to provide customer service which includes but not limited to: starting and stopping service, bill reviews and explanation, order input, and mentoring new hires. I learned the only thing that is constant is change. "
good,"Hard work, But good pay and benefits!  Free Food. SAFETY FIRST!"
good,"However, if you're not an engineer, your advancement options are limited. Benefits are outstanding and work/life balance is terrific - depending on the boss you have. Some bosses are still stuck in the 50's mindset of a regular 8 - 5 job, others are not. For the most part, there's a lot of flexibility. Great bunch of folks to work with although AEP's taken the whole ""sensitivity"" thing to new heights with its Ethics & Compliance Dept and policies. Common sense in some cases would be nice! Good location downtown Columbus although having to pay for parking (albeit subsidized) is a pain."
good,• Manage self and others in support of safe and incident-free operations.
good,I am allowed to use my own initiative to get things done. I am able to be creative in how that happens. Room for personal growth.
good,My job entails meeting with business users to gather requirements and translate them into technical specifications and oversee developments activities.
good,"My experience at American Electric Power, Cheshire, Ohio was that of a good one. The employees and management was very professional and courteous."
good,"AEP is an old school place. The work is very cyclical and regimented, which can be boring at time. However, the experience is legit and you learn how to do things right. If you are given responsibility you can be put in positions with a lot riding on your actions. It was great experience"
good,Hardest part of the job was traveling. Great place culture wise. Lots of good technical work. Plenty of good people to work with as well. I learned a lot working there.
good,"my work day starts by ensuring all is right with the ERCOT footprint in the territory I look over. after that has been checked/fixed, i move on to the meetings that are needing my attention and get any information about upcoming project details that need my immediate attention. by this time, I usually end up working on an issue from the field that needs assistance or work on project designs that are approaching the deadline."
good,the work place culture is extremely positive towards safety and looking out for one another. it is employee driven. the open door policy makes it so communicating with upper management is easier and shows how they are willing to hear from all perspectives in the company.
good,"AEP is a great company with a wealth of senior employee knowledge.  Only caveat, they never retire so promotional opportunities are limited.  Maybe one or two leadership roles come open a year.  You have to have patience to wait it out."
good,Great place to work. Environment is fast paced but you are well compensated for hard work. Have a great culture and value culture as high as safety. I would work for them again if the logistics were right.
good,"I worked for AEP at our Donald C. Cook Nuclear Plant for ~23 years."
good,The culture of AEP was very open and honest.  The employees that worked hard and took pride in their work were rewarded.  The daily work was based on the corporate business plan (both a 10-year and 5-year plan) so we all understood our role in making our company successful.
good,A good place to work depending on the location.  The pay is great and so is the benefits.  Only downside is they are a coal driven company.  Coal is not a bad thing but the government thinks so.
good,If you want to be gone for 28 days then home for 28 days this is the job for you. The pay is great and the benefits are the best most place do not offer anymore. The work is hard but you are still making money.
good,I worked in Transmission-Substation group.  Never a dull moment.  Lots of new construction and maintaining older equipment.  Each day is different and exciting.
good,AEP was a leader in the utility industry while I worked at the company. They had an incredible work force that was guided by effective management that took calculated risks to be a major player in the global electric utility market.
good,"One woman office. Handled busy phones, responsible for $30 million budget consisting of O&M and Capital projects. Processed all accounts payable. I learned to make independent decisions concerning day to day operations of the plant. My co-workers were supportive and sharing. The hardest part of the job was relating to the corporate office which was located in the East and values and operations were sometimes polar opposites of those in the mid-west. The enjoyable part was feeling I made a difference and was appreciated."
good,"Positive experience and possibilities to advance within the AEP systems, competitive benefits for employees  Work environments were always positive and provided areas for promotion."
good,"Great benefits. Good opportunities. Slow growth and slow advancement. Management is hit or miss depending on location. Culture is encouraged, but not good at change."
good,"My first career was at AEP, and it went pretty easy.  I never had overtime, a stressful day, or anything that drove me crazy.  It kind of paid that way though."
good,Good place to work with great benefits. Coworkers are friendly and help others out.  Job can sometimes be stressful while trying to solve customer issues within a certain timeframe.
good,The people at AEP are very hospitable. The problem I had was there felt like a large amount of inertia to adapting to new ideas. An older workforce overall in terms of the diversity of peers.
good,"AEP Energy is a commission based job and you will only get out of it, what you are willing to put into it. The opportunity to make a decent living is there."
good,Excellent workplace.  Awesome benefits.  Very diverse culture. Lots of potential for advancement. You can definitely learn a lot. This is a family like atmosphere.

good,I enjoyed the culture and the people who I worked with at AEP. Most assignments with groups of people were collaborative and productive. Everything was organized and professional.
good,This was a very different place to work. There was so much to get done and caught up on accuracy was a must. Overall the bosses were cool and they made it comfortable for us
good,My boss has been great to me over the years however not able to keep me busy. I would like to get at least 40 hours per week and am not bothered by 60 or 70. It is very rare i get a full 40 hour week though.
good,"Good company to work at. i have seen right person gets promoted and get to work at higher level. Good culture and good environment. Most of the people are friendly. Good pay also considering the Columbus, Ohio location."
good,learned many new thing while working here.  work was boring and monotonous but provided a steady pay check and allowed me to provide for my family.  fun
good,Great pay great hours and great coworkers   Benefits from day one. Advancement minimal. Great at letting employees know how well they are doing.  Like family
good,"Everyday is fun and interesting and different. I have always been busy and managing multiple projects at the same time."
good,This employer was great to work for. I worked in the Recreation and Forestry department as an intern for my college degree. The people that worked there were always great to work with and for.
good,"Everything! The people are all super nice and friendly, probably because we are all treated with respect. Really relaxed, family style atmosphere but doesn't stop your ability to work like some places. Great benefits and snacks/drinks provided. Management really take the time to talk to everyone and listen to opinions. Training budget is great and you are encouraged to use it"
good,"a typical day at work, what you learned, management, workplace culture, the hardest part of the job, the most enjoyable part of the job. Great place to work."
good,My typical workday was staying busy. I enjoyed my job and my coworkers. Loved the bonuses that were given. I love my job because everyone shares the same vision and is dedicated to the mission.
good,"Had the great privilege to serve with some of the best people in the industry, and grow professionally professionally as a result of the many challenges I was given."
good,"Allowed me to comple GIS work of varying sizes: small visual aide maps, property maps for inclusion of site files, to a nautical navigation map of Leesville Lake for the Leesville Lake Association providing necessary experience in the use of GIS in real world environment."
good,AEP is great to work for and has great benefits. I only left because of medical reasons. The benefits were great as well. it's a large company but has a great work environment.
good,Really cool job working with the field reps.  Taking their calls and enter in the information they provide you with and if they need something from you.  Approving pay roll.  Work environment was laid back but busy at the same time.
good,"Learned all so much in this company that I stayed there until they had  were bought out. I loved this company  for their benefits, training and all everything I can think of a good company."
good,Great people. They love what they do and it shows in their work. Supports the local community.
good,"Good group of people to help in what ever way they could."
good,Good benefit package total pride and integrity among the linemen it's not so good with the mandatory call outs great 401k they match 6% supervision could show a little more respect
good,I got a feel for the job and what type of work it was from this company all the guys were great i learned alot of residential work here we did monster size houses good experience
good,"Challenging and rewarding work environment.  Depending on job position, time demands can be great.  Developed strong management and leadership skills at the corporation."
good,"Great place to work if you have nothing keeping you at home. Power plant maintenance traveling is not for the faint of heart and not great if you have wife and or children. Long days nights, must be disciplined to road work. Great pay and benefits."

good,"Overall good company to work for, substation hours are great(4- 10hr days), culture needs improvement, management needs improvement, staffing needs improvement, benefits are good, good apprenticeship program."
good,We had an excellent team.  Worked in the same department for 15 years.  Fair management.  Good leadership.  Always trying to stay on the leading edge of technology.

good,"8 hour day"
good,"AEP has given me great experience in Economic/Financial analysis. The company is very laid back and lets you be an analyst with minimal supervision. I work directly with Economists, Statisticians, Engineers who are very helpful and always there to assist the less seasoned employees. The most challenging part of my job is that there is no single right way to do the job, there is always forecasting involved and different analysis needed for different projects. It takes around 3 years to be fully trained in Load Research so you are constantly learning and reading new material. My first day, I was given around 5 training books, and a SAS certification manual and was told to just read and learn for around 6 months. I enjoy my job due to having a great flexible boss and great coworkers who have also become my friends."
good,Working at a coal fired power plant that was built in 1926 was a very rare opportunity.  I worked along side and was trained by some of the best ever.  There was so much specialized industry knowledge in the oldest men in the business.  This knowledge was in danger of being lost forever with the next generation taking over.  I'm very lucky to have been able to absorb as much knowledge as possible from the best Men in the industry.
good,"Enjoyed the work on typical and non-typical work days."
good,It is a great place to work.Always training and advancing your skills.A very friendly work environment  and surrounded by great people.They are like family Because you spend more time with them than you do with your own family.

good,I was a contractor when I work for AEP. I was a slow pasted and a great place to work. Being a contractor I was brought in for a specific job that need to be done.
good,"AEP is a great company in which to work for.  Allot of great opportunities available for employees to continue job training or education.  "
good,"Being a dispatcher at this company has a very demanding, but rewarding responsibility. Overseen the daily operations of field personnel and made sure by the end of the day everyone went home safely."
good,"Great place to work. I have no complaints, I like to keep options open as im not tied to down to any specific area at the moment. I like to keep resume upt o date for opportunity purposes."
good,"I worked in the call center. Where my typical day was taking connect/disconnect orders as well as billing inquires."
good,Most of the people are great to work with.  Enjoyed coming to work each day.  Leaned a lot about project management and maintenance planning.
good,a Great place to work. they pay a competitive wage and are willing to take people on with little or no experience.
good,"Enjoyed working with my team in procurement. Work/Life balance.  We would all jump in the do our part. I was flexible where I was needed in my position. I enjoyed setting up Lunch/Learn meetings with providers for AEP, ordering food/drinks and setting up the conference room for the meetings."
good,"the work is very routine, and it is always the same, other work schedules are sometimes extended"
good,"Fast paced"
good,"Being at AEP was the highlight of my career.  I really would like to return and continue with a great and collaborate team. I worked for five years as Business Administrator with the IT department.  This group, some of which still are employed and advanced there, helped build me up and gain confidence in the work I did.  I have had two interviews at AEP since I left and I feel that the same spirit is still there."
good,Great hours. Great people to work with. Off on the weekends.
good,"-[Only driver/courier to log 7,000 miles with no accidents or violations.]"

good,Challenging     work     with     good     leaders    and     team     members.    Would     highly    recommend .    The    culture    is    supportive.
good,Great place to learn and grow your career.  Plenty of advancement opportunities.  Pay and benefits are at the top of the class around this area.  Management very well structured.
good,There are very few negatives about working at AEP. The pay is great and most people I work with are great. I feel like they do their best to take care of their people here.
good,"AEP Transmission is a great place to work. I never dreaded waking up and going to work mostly because of the people. Management makes it a point to keep current with their employees' work and accomplishments; something that rarely happens in corporate America. The workload can be a bit dicey, with many engineering projects being outsourced due to limited internal resources. However, working for a utility owner allows employees to explore areas of interest at work that may not be project-based. Having a good and honest relationship with your teams and management is critical. Lots of opportunities for advancement. AEP cares about work-life balance, offering flexibility in your schedule, comprehensive benefits, and a fun work environment."
good,"I loved my time at AEP.  The supervisors and the managers were very supportive and gave good direction. Also, opportunities for growth. Culture is getting better than the day I started and I see it moving towards a place of inclusion and diversity."
good,"I worked 31 years there, The people I worked with was great, I was promoted very well, had good training. A day on the job was to make repairs to equipment that was broken, Being a mechanic I learned a lot from other mechanics on how to repair equipment including heavy coal handling equipment"
good,"Transmission Operations at AEP is relatively fast-paced and carries a higher workload than smaller utilities. AEP is also in the top 3 transmission companies for overall capital investment dollars through 2020, so the level of (relatively) complex construction switching is higher here than at a utility doing fewer system upgrades.  The upside is that transmission operators here will experience a wider array of operational challenges related to multi-phase construction project switching that makes them ideal for roles assisting other companies in doing the same when their time comes."
good,"While employed with American Electric Power they let me cross train on other jobs.  After I learned the job I was given the opportunity to do the job on a full time basis.  I learned alot about benefits not just medical.  I also learned about retirement plans, 401k plans and life insurance.  I have nothing negative to say about American Electric Power.  I was given the opportunity to learn more about HR and the benefits within the company which made me more of an asset to the company."
good,"Very relaxed work setting; Have plenty of time to get your projects done 99% of the time. The people are great, the benefits are awesome. As an entry level civil engineer I was making great money. Pretty sure the highest out of my graduating class. Many travel opportunities if you want them. Just all around good company to work for."
good,"Spent 22 in sec reporting"
good,This company is a great one to work for! The management is very helpful and the guys treat each other like brothers. Pay wasn't great so I had to move on.
good,Every friday for the last seven years I have seen the Transmission Dispatch Centers manager leave for lunch and return with enough food for everyone in his office.  It was amazing how fast the word spread that the TDC has lunch bought for them every friday.  The manager had no problems in having stay over for meeting for a saftey meetng or filling a shift due to a illness.  The empolyees were willing to help out because the TDC manager humbled himself to buy lunches for everyone every fridays.
good,The key to that job was always stay alert and wear your proper PPE because any small mistake could cost you your life so I was always alert to my surroundings.
good,"I mainly learned more about controls and terminations."
good,"Great pay and benefit. I've been here almost 4 years and I haven't ever had any problems. Everybody is  nice and great to work with. I love what I do, where I work, and who I work with."
good,"Corporate has some great initiatives and tries to move the culture in a positive direction. However, some facilities aren't moving as quickly. Benefits are great! Vesting occurs fairly quick in the 401k."
good,Its a very good place to work.  There are many types of opportunities and many locations in which to work.  Job security is somewhat stable but power generation with coal is on its way out.
good,Excellent continuing professional education on site.  Professional and hard working individuals. Very professional work force.  Typical day involved interaction with employees and contractors.
