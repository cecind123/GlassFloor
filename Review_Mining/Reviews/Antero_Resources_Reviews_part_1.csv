rating,review
bad,"Business sense executed poorly. Unwilling to educate themselves on understanding what they do not know.  Dangerous game to continue ""the way we always have"""
bad,"Company thrives on dysfunction, on heavy work loads with little assistance. A company with high turn over for a reason, people do not enjoy being at this company."
bad,"Pay is good, benefits are good.  The assets are great."
bad,Not a place to work. Executives are dysfunctional and only care for themselves and cronies that follow them.  Common word used by employees toxic . I wish they would send out a questioner to employees and see . Some managers lack common skills needed for their job that a freshman in college would have (SA) . Last harassment and prejudice has been brought up and HR has no clue how to resolve the issues.
bad,"The culture there is extremely disorganized and stressful. Competing managers, conflicting directives, very prejudiced against minorities. Company was not at all ready for expansion or going public and it showed."
bad,"Other than the benefits, I have nothing positive to say about this company. "
bad,The people i was able to meet during my time employed at Antero Resources.the toughest part about my job was upper management was never able to make a decision and stick with it or give things a chance to work.
good,"All crews are safety oriented. Company men are very helpful, they keep safety personnel in the loop and take the safety advisor's opinion into consideration. The scenery is breath taking at every location. The locals are friendly and have great hospitality."
good,"Management is poor. Stressful environment.Spending of resources in the wrong places, for example lots of contractors in positions that need to be permanent; contractors that can be removed quickly, but are very expensive for the company."
good,"Antero does a poor job of teaching and mentoring on the whole. Some departments are better than others. Nepotism is rampant. Some departments have ridiculous management tiers. At a place as small as Antero you shouldn't need 5 managers/supervisors between you and the VP. If you already have career experience you might do well. If you're just starting out, Antero isn't good at teaching and mentoring. They used to be at one time."
good,"Salary compared to other Oil & Gas companies was a little low, but pretty good overall. Excellent medical / dental/ vision benefits. Great office location downtown."
good,"A normal day at work involves typical executive assistant duties, I have learned a lot working in oil & gas that will extend to all industries. It is a decent place to work with good benefits."
good,Antero Resources is an upstream and mid-stream oil and gas company. They have been able to stay busy and grow even through the difficult  times in  the industry sector.
good,The accounting department managers were very respectful of the employees and had open door policy for all.  I would work there again if given the opportunity.
good,Assisted everyone I could with many different types of issues and requests.  Greeted guests and answered questions via telephone and or in person.  It is a very professional company with a community feel.  Co workers were very friendly and willing to help.  The hardest part of my job was leaving. The most enjoyable part about the job was that I am a people person so since I was the receptionist I got the chance to greet almost everyone and speak to them and help them anyway that I could.
good,Nice place to work with a lot of resources. Very thorough with their training and gave lots of different avenues to find information to help with the process of doing your research. Always accessible and friendly environment.
good,"I really enjoyed my time working at Antero Resources. I started as a summer college intern (that was burnt out from working at restaurants) and I was given the opportunity to advance to a part-time job once my internship ended. The pay was fantastic and I was given a lot of freedom in making decisions and curating spreadsheets for the environmental managers. The manager I worked for was awesome and to my pleasant surprise, felt like he valued my opinion on projects. My work schedule was flexible with school hours and it was great being down the street from the downtown UCD business school. My only complaint was that I was let go after a year so they could make room for college interns. It was a bummer because I would have wanted to work there through graduation, but I understood their decision wasn't a direct reflection on my work."
good,My productivity is often very busy each day as there are a number of team members I work with that have various tasks at hand.  I often meet with each of the five team members on a day to day basis to ensure goals are met on time and accurately.
good,"Prepare Oil and Gas contracts. Contact mineral owners. Research missing mineral owners will death certificates, will, family members or heirs."
good,As interns we were given many mentors.  All of whom were very helpful and understanding of our level of expertise. Antero got me excited to work in the energy industry.
good,Enjoyable company to work for. Provided needed information in a timely manner. Supplied excellent work tools and work stations. Management was very helpful in explaining the criteria needed to complete the assigned projects.
good,I enjoyed having the opportunity to work with so many positive individuals within the company. There are opportunities for advancement and wonderful managers.
good,"I did like to work there a lot. People were very nice and had a great work ethic from employees to Managers. A great great palce to work, unfortunately people get laid off."
good,"While working with Antero Resources I was treated with respect from all levels of employment. Additionally there employee benefits are outstanding with compensation to the fullest in all areas. Travel, Insurance, Medical Leaves."
good,"Antero was the best company I have ever worked for. They taught me a lot about accounting and working in a fast pace environment. Everyone worked well together and we worked together to implement new ways of doing things in the accounting department so that everyone was working to their potential. I wouldn't have left, but I had to relocate to another state."
good,Great place to work with excellent benefits. They really take care of their employees. You have the ability to work autonomously and a typical day of work is rarely the same as the day before.
good,The environmental department works well as a team. Everyone is willing to help out in other areas to ensure compliance throughout the company. Managers help each individual to succeed in the career.
good,"I worked directly for Antero Resources for a little over 6 years, great company, great benefits. However, I took another job recently that was closer to home and business has slowed down so I am going to be without a job soon."
good,Great place to work with tons of good people. Oil and gas is a booming field to get in and I'm glad i had the opportunity to work for Antero Resources as long as i did.
good,"Antero Resources takes care of employees that take care of business. "
