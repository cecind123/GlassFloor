rating,review
bad,Very bad place to work if you want stability.  The keep people a few weeks at most and get rid of them only to hire replacements.  Why?  Not sure....but the turn around rate is astronomical.
bad,"Middle level manager are 5 to 10 years experience designers. They are not qualified to be designers or engineers in major EPC, but can be the person in charge here. What do you expect?"
bad,"Horrible company values within extremely Hostile Work Environment.  Speaking to management requesting help/support falls on deaf ears;  even when they agree with issue, NOTHING is ever addressed. Do NOT waste time at this company, which works employees 13 hours per day 6-7 days a week in unhealthy environment."
bad,"Worked in the disaster recovery division. There is no work life balance and I was given the third degree when I needed to take sick time for a chronic illness. Very high turnover and the management of the disaster recovery efforts did not hold operations accountable for errors, leading to excessive time spent fixing errors on the back end."
bad,"The leave policy is antiquated and miserly, and you'll often be required to use what are supposed to be vacation days simply to meet your required hours every week.  (The leave policy combines vacation, holidays, and sick leave; as a result of applying leave simply to get a paycheck I went nearly five years without a single paid holiday.)  There is no management to speak of - once you're hired, you're on your own to find work and if you don't it's just your fault.  The entire focus is on the next acquisition, and employees are simply a nuisance.  There are no opportunities for professional growth or development.  I was a technical editor who was supervised by a civil engineer.  She had no idea what I did and it showed every time there was a performance review.  The performance review process is itself useless; until recently the self-evaluation, which keep in mind is the evaluation of your own performance, included the question ""would you work with this person again?""  There are lots of reasons to leave companies; I've left jobs before and maybe don't miss them but I've never left one with the absolute hatred I feel toward Tetra Tech EM."
bad,The Supervisors does not communicate with all Employees. They pick out their favorite workers and they are they only 1s communicated with on a regular basis. If you are nit 1 of the favorites then you work as little as possible.
bad,"Management promoted based on looks and gender rather than skill and experience.  Poor communication with employees.  Unorganized most of the time. Promised hours, but then cut without notice. Kept promising call backs each day, but never did.  Extremely unprofessional."
bad,"When the regional Manager spend his days working on, using company supplies to print, make multiple copies of Boy Scout projects it creates a bad atmosphere "
bad,Administrative and Management are racist.  This company is the perfect example of what Modern Slavery looks like. I do not recommend this company for Health Reasons and Mental Sanity.
bad,The work environment is not good at all in this company. Sometime there is no work and when there is work you have to work overtime or work crazy during regular hours. Lots of pressure on employee. Management have no sense at all on how to run company. Management do not respect their employees. Layoff of employees are very common in this company.
bad,There was a lot of down time and the only contract for work was through the Army Corps of Engineers. When the United States left Iraq and the economy dropped in 2008-2009 we ran out of work and they laid of 30% of employees.
bad,"Long hours, no certainty of work, no stability and low pay. I would not go back unless the pay improved, the working elements bettered and management was dependable."
bad,"With Tetra Tech, you have no social life. I worked more than 110 hours a week 7 days a week. The management is over-stressed and has very poor leadership skills. They have a very poor way of communicating goals and expectations. They often used the phrase ""sink or swim"" when training for Data Managers - this is due to their training for the position being less than a few hours with the ""Supervisor"" and then tossing you in to do a job that was barely explained. "
bad,"The manager would come in drunk, and committed many discrepancies against the government. It was a terrible workday and he only treated you right if you tried to be his friend. He was condescending and made you feel terrible at your job."
bad,"This company is without exception the worst and most unethical company I have ever seen.  They redicule and threaten their employees, they actyally write your time card by hand taking time off it and threaten you with no work if you don't accept it.  They also do not pay you frequently stating they are behind and you will get it next week???"
bad,"For a Company that's been around for over 50 years they have poor to non-existent management skills. Lack of good leadership, no chain of command, and a (so called) Supervisor who micro manages, leads by instilling fear and confusion in everyone below him."
bad,Worst company I have ever worked for. I have worked hard jobs and not complained about it and I have done a lot of tough hours but nothing compares to this company and the way the lie cheat and steal hours and work from you. They tell you one thing and do another. Promise you great things and never come through. Steal workers from other companies while they still work for other companies and tell you that there is no work when they give the select few they like 100's of hours a week. I wouldn't take this job if your life depended on it. I was behind on bills due to lack of work and took this job and they enjoyed seeing me struggle. They work very unethical and only look out for themselves.
bad,I went to Tetra Tech offices in Saskatoon after being offered 2 years work.  The laid me off after six months because they did not have any work in the then booming city.  The reason they had no work - they botched a job so badly they were blacklisted in town.  I worked for 2 engineers that could not design a paper bag for their lunch.  They spent 200 hours to run 30 feet of pipe.
bad,"This company was awful, the people are nasty, the HR director lied to me. Find another job somewhere else, they'll probably lay you off shortly after they hire you anyway!"
bad,Your greeted on your first day nice .. by the time you have been there for a little while your yelled at all the time.. not for me.
bad,"In my 15 yrs experience, the IT division in the Fairfax location is the WORST I have been in."
bad,Terrible company and benefits were bare minimum.  Staff was not friendly nor compassionate.
bad,Disaster recovery sector focused on the implementation of processes and procedures. Limited professional growth in this company. Contracts change depending on where you were hired.
bad,"I've worked with the company for almost two years and had to walk out. About on a weekly basis there were shouting matches between higher individuals. The overall atmosphere is a division. The full time and part time employees. I was considered part time yet I was working over 40 hours a week. Majority of the full time higher position employees looked down upon the ""part time"" employees as second class citizens. It was disgusting to say the least."
bad,"The pay was laugh and the only reason to work there would be if you enjoyed not knowing where you might be or what you would be doing from one day to the next. The entire experience was like a Rodeo, there was bull ship everywhere, people were judged by how long they could hold on and the clowns were running the entire thing. Worst job ever, period. Not worth the time."
bad,I am glad for the opportunity to have worked there and gained the experience I have now but thats it. I had to stay because of financial responsibilities and my family.
bad,"Management doesn't want to hear other than their voice and don't care about employees."
bad,"This position was temporary. Some employees, some supervisors, were drunk or high on the job.  People openly slept through their shifts. Their was no supervision, no screening of employees and NO benefits.  You were required to use your own car and were in no way compensated for gas or wear and tear. Tetra Tech is a monitoring company for the contractors hired to proved debris clean up. As a resident who saw so many people lose everything, I resent such shoddy practices. I should also mention we worked 12-14 a day/7 days a week. No breaks."
bad,This was a temp job for clean up of the Hurricane.  I would go to work in the morning and ride out with the guys who would cut the trees and pick up debris.  I would measure each tree and document. I would return at the end of the day.
bad,"The job duties I had to perform on a daily basis were absolutely the most enjoyable part of the day. I have no gripes or complaints about my  job functions. In fact the duties performed were easy and not back breaking. But the leadership or the lack thereof, made coming to work an absolute horror story. From the first line supervisor to the end result boss, made it very hard to make it through a normal work day. A bunch of bullies with a good ol boy mentality. If you're in the good old boy club, then you're in for life. These managers are jokes and  couldn't manage a one horse race. From bullying tactics to plain old harassment is how they (management) keep the workers from reporting them. When the management screws up, and  it is often,  they always most assuredly tell the government, that we are contracted to; that it is the workers mistake. Which in some cases I understand it is the workers fault in some situations. But a great leader will always take accountability for their subordinates."
bad,"In my 17 years as an environmental professional this is the worst place I ever worked (I lasted 9 months in the Boulder office). Consulting is a tough world, but I had terrible management, work load issues and no support from other staff. You are basically a consultant witin the company who needs to find their own work within the conpany. This leads to constant uncertainty. This model is similar to Ch2mhill (Bellevue Wa) office-terrible model for business."
bad,"No management interaction. No inclusion, they try to fake that they are an inclusive company but look closer and one will see that is the bare minimum to save face. No atmosphere in the office. Nepotism is rampant and it’s all who you know. No transparency, very closed off management style and Typical Boys club mentality. Senior management not interested in new ideas. No leadership, no growth opportunity. Don’t waste your time here!"
bad,"I had 2 other job offers at the same time as Tetra tech but I turned them down because they lied to me about my job duties. They hire for my position as a temp, and promise that if you stay 6 months that you will be hired on full,-time. This, like the job they said I would be performing was a lie. I injured myself at work, and reported it. My manager ridiculed me for reporting it."
bad,"Extremely awful place. Racist environment and management has no idea whats going on. Payroll processors are extremely over worked and the supervisor is not the aware of here own members  being over worked. She usually assigns other people her work and doesn't make time to teach new members. You're easily let go here if you have an opinion or even make a small error. No room for growth either. Unless the supervisor  leaves or the manager but other than that you'll be at the same level as everyone who's been there for 20 years.  The work environment isnt healthy either since theres a lot of micromanagement and no one interacts with other departments. Just dont work here, you're honestly wasting your youth and creating unnecessary stress."
bad,I have been a motor grader operator for 35 years. One of the worst companies ever worked at. Management sucked. Thank god company is gone from our area.
bad,It was a wonderful place to learn about myself and was highly beneficial in my human development. There was always work to do and it allowed me to improve my time management.
bad,"Terrible environment at Mississauga Office, bunch of Dum management . "
bad,"When there is work, you have lots of hours.  Mangers play favorites, so they get the best jobs with the longest hours.  The job was easy but could be boring at times."
bad,"Good pay, great office facility and physical amenities but that's it. Endless Internal financial accountability to the point where no work is getting done. Incredibly talented staff, stifled by lackluster operational structure and poorly trained management, mainly in place due to attrition. Good design takes a back seat to a good quarterly report. Lack of adequate backlog in the buildings group. Firm hires employees away from stable companies and positions within other firms by enticing with high wages but drops employees quickly regardless of promises or performance. A revolving door of highly qualified but lower quartile performers (sales) are dropped regularly. Be prepared to sell or be laid off regardless of your position."
bad,"Not a good place to work.  Manager was terrible. No upper management support. Although  they offer good benefits, and pay,  The way you get treated  it’s not worth the sacrifice for the pay and benefits. There’s absolutely no upper management support."
bad,"I recieved a invitation to apply for a position through LinkedIn. So I applied. Had to wait 3 weeks before we had a location to meet for training. Only 4 people showed up including me. Waited another 2 weeks for the job to start. Ok started job, the 2 Supervisors they have in Charge plays favoritism to people they know who work with them in the past. New hires get step on and giving the worst jobs while they friends get the easy jobs. They lie to you and takes you off the schedule so they friends are getting 7 day paycheck while you only get a few days."
bad,Worked 12 hours a day 7 days a week. From 10 to 10. With no guidance. No training or guidelines on the tasks assigned. Constantly jumping from one task to another. No organization. No management. They do not care about employees. Fire team members regularly for no reason. In the office there were racists sexists comments profanity and unacceptable behavior. They fire people with no notice ahead of time. Payroll is constantly wrong for the employees.
bad,"very poor management"
bad,"There are many great people here  but senior management and genuine staff support are lacking.  Corporate claims are one thing, some offices are probably much better, but practice in this office is something entirely different -  the importance of people is not understood.  Management is dysfunctional."
bad,They will let you go with NO notice. Work you hard and keep bonuses for upper management. You are just a tool to them BUT if you are in the old boy's network you can lie about your education and NOT get fired just demoted and keep your Millions. Very disappointing.
bad,"On the Project level there are some very competent skilled staff but at the engineering level there is poor communication, little understanding of constructability and no concept of deadlines."
bad,"Just started recently but not impressed., Difficult to communicate with HR. No support. Mistakes made on medical benefits."
bad,"This company is also not good for management reasons.  Some people who had experience just leave the company."
bad,"Extreme favoritism and partiality to chosen, ""brown nose individuals "" who make the common man or woman. Feel discarded, as just someone who banks hours and means nothing else. Yet, the favoritism of their ""click"" is incomprehensible. There was an individual who ended up m.i.a., and had Chico P.D. enter his room at given hotel. Only to later find. That not only did said individual refuse to answer his phone. But took a company paid rental vehicle, and a escort. And took refuge at a casino."
bad,Great company except no higher management accountability. Also no opportunity for advancement or long term employment. Great travel opportunity as well as on the job training for other employment opportunities.
bad,"I was told that I was going to begin work in two weeks, after the interview. So I filled out the new hire packet, and waited. During that time I turned down another job that  I was going after. After the two weeks were up I went in to see about a drug test and I found out that they decided to go another direction. I have been looking for a job for two months already and since they didn't have the ability to tell me that I didn't fit into the category they wanted, I lost both jobs. If you decide to take a job here make sure to get it in writing. The company doesn't seem to be organized."
bad,"Operations Manager with over 34 years of experience related to project and construction management. I’m very familiar with (EPC) firms and Construction Contractors involved in the industrial market within North America."
bad,"Extremely busy day with lots of issues of projects to resolve. Daily site visit, review progress, issue necessary instructions to contractor for improvement."
bad,"Long hours during the busy season, poor communication between upper management, field managers, and office managers.  No team players.  Everyone under high stress."
bad,"Tetra Tech is just like any other big environmental consulting firm.  You will be hired at a salaried position, but your work week will probably be something closer to 60 hours if not more.  They are also very aggressive about how billable you are and you are expected to be 100 percent billable even though as a staff geologist you have no control over the amount of work you have.  The coworkers I had were great, no complaints there.  "
bad,This company expects a lot and gives very little. The do not hire anyone as a permanent employee. No job security.  When its Hurricane season or a natural disaster they expect you to dedicate your life to them . 70-90 hour weeks are the norm here. Then when it's slow they will let you go suddenly. No benefits. No paid time of. No sick time. Noe paid holidays. It's been 2 awful years. Here you're just another number. Not a name.
bad,"in Puerto Rico, they are a little bi disorganize.  need to improve their management skills.  they are looking always for new employees, because their a lot of turnovers."
bad,Tetra Tech is a consulting firm and publically traded so the profit margin is important to management and all employees are treated as a number with profitability requirement tied to their employee number that's all.
bad,"Huge lack of training and at the same time you're expected to inherently know all of the protocols for which there are many. You are stuck because you make a mistake and nobody shows you the right way to do things nor most the time what it is that you were doing incorrectly. Everybody passes the buck onto the person under or below them and never takes the responsibility for their own mistakes so if you start out and your at the bottom of the company ladder you can expect to catch all the greif for all that goes wrong above you and it's a gossip ridden soap opera when it comes to that, Don't expect to have anything about you or your job performance stated to you directly, nobody speaks of you to your face and is to little of character to do that, instead they will move you are put you in a different position where you are stuck with the same lack of training and ill comm=unication where you make mistakes and never shown the correct way. That is how people learn, making mistakes is part of the learning process on any job and it is the duty of those above you to make sure that you are shown the correct ways so as not to make them again but Tetra Tech has a lack of leadership that does not address things appropriately if at all. Theres always someone under them that is supposed to do that."
bad,"Good company to start your construction with but not ideal to stay in."
bad,For the amount of of money you're being pad to do large amounts of work.. it's not worth it. Very stressful work and management has very little understanding. Be prepared to work your tail-gate off!
bad,Only one to advance is same nationality. Salary does not compensate for the workload and long hours of work including some holidays. Management takes all the credit while the rest do most of the tedious tasks. Unorganized and need restructuring. HR is slow in response especially lots of mistakes from payroll recently. Payroll Supervisor was a pain to deal with and very arrogant. Job descriptions are in low key compared to what is expected and given on the job. Worked on a project onsite and you are expected yesterday when you are just in time.
bad,"The work done is meaningful because it helps communities when disaster strikes, heavily based on government contracts and therefore very few are really ""part of the company"". when contracts end, work is scarce and so is compensation."
bad,Very little team attitudes and un-knowledgeable managers waiting to retire. Goals are not attainable because management doesn't follow through with training and skill building activities.
bad,"-long work day"
bad,"Great to learn from scratch and company will overload you with work. You will find that you will either sink or swim. It is a difficult company to advance in and does not offer competitive salary compared to other similar organizations. There is no issues with being light on work to do. If management realizes you have great multitasking skills and are smart, you will be tasked to a point where working is all your life and this is not a great environment if your looking for a work/ life balance."
bad,"Management doesn't care how hard you work, when they dont need you they throw you out. They will work you 7 days a week most of the time, and as long as they need until the job is done. "
bad,"Poor management, clicks in management , no room to advance, work can suddenly end, Procedures change daily.Decision can change quickly without notice to employees.The company may hire other personnel for the same position as you are working with no prior education or experience. The pay is kinda standard regardless of background and education. I was working with people that had zero experience actually making more money than i was.that had a degree and 30 years experience."
bad,Rest of the company was terrible. Gave me no warning when they ran out of work or that they cut out all of the work they originally signed me for. No overtime pay despite weeks working 90+ hours.
bad,"This is a consulting company where work depends upon the amount of work available to you.  If work dries up, you are left to try to find work on your own, and sometimes managers are of no help.  If no work is available at all, you are to use your PTO time or go to a lower employment level."
bad,"I was hired as a project analyst, and then was placed as an administrator. The job description I applied for spoke to my qualifications, but was never realized in the 18 months I was employed."
bad,Not a fun place to work or place to advance.  Company culture there is work or get let go.  Benefits overall not good.  They want you to work overtime and not get paid for it.
bad,Decent place to work with a supportive staff. Not all about the numbers but how employees grow and develop. Some red tape and politics involve. The most enjoyable part of my job was working alongside colleagues and learning from them.
bad,"A company looking for stock valuation and maximum ROI, focused on growth by acquisition.  Corporate culture presents a focus on quality and safety while training, organic growth and support for business development fall victim to the bottom line."
bad,Communication is horrible. Manager Paris lack of communication and and horrible leadership skills but the pay is excellent. The job is contracts mostly. However there's no real end date.
bad,Poor benefits and opportunities. Management was seldom willing to help with career development. Co-workers were supportive on completing project tasks.
bad,"TetraTech Technical Services is a part of TetraTech that calls business and customers of utilities to ask them about a program that the utility provided to them recently. The utilities want to know how well the program did and what it didn't do. "
bad,- Not a place to grow - Management controlling of work and very slow to search for new work or maintain good working relations with current clients. When work gets low - you get screwed
bad,Helpful to teach you the ropes but limited availability to upscale or take on more responsibility. Everyone seemed pigeonholed in their roles with no where to go. In my six months there everyone at my level had left for a different job.
bad,"Started work at 7 am and finished around 6pm. "
bad,Non team atmosphere - Management seemed to be the issue here.
bad,No place for someone without a real high end college degree.
bad,"Por ser uma empresa de Gerenciamento, dependerá do contrato assinado com o cliente para qualquer tipo de avaliação."
bad,"It's a good place for someone fresh out of college, or someone looking to cash in on years of experience as an SME. But it becomes stagnant for anyone in the middle, especially if you are looking to grow. You are hired to do 1 thing, there is limited promotion potential, and no reinvestment in the workforce. Also the time off is terrible. Federal holidays count against your PTO. Pay seems low given the cost of living in the region. The initial experience was valuable, but staying long isn't an option for someone looking to progress, though I can't speak much for the experience at a management level. Better off working for a sub rather than the prime"
bad,"Great team players, fun, like family and very productive when it came right down to deadlines. Enjoyed going into work. I was able to learn different positions which I enjoyed, always learning new techniques, and working with a team was very productive and helpful, everyone had patience when someone was learning a new area."
bad,"Bad training, bad leadership, no benefits, and bad safety record. Bad communication and cooperation with employees. Lots of paperwork, no electronic devices."
bad,"From the beginning I thought this job was very inciting,because it was something new to me,we were told that we were going to receive a predim that was never received?,because of that everyone money got very low."
bad,Their infrastructure dept. does not exist anymore. But it used to be a great dept back in 2002.
good,It's a small they don't know what they are doing. I got there through an temp place. You would think a company so forward thinking can't do the basics
good,"Nothing bad to say about Tetra Tech over 14k employees."
good,I did not worked for more than 5 months. And I am glad I left the job. It was the type of job you do not want to spend the rest of your life. Not a job to stay.
good,"Pay is decent only because of OT 7 days a week 10-12 hours daily , you get burnt out pretty quickly. You are just a number to them and their is a lot of favoritism especially to pretty females"
good,My co workers were great.  Good job for 12 years until downsized.
good,"After a brief time on site, i was asked to assess the project conditions and and organizational structure.  Those comments were recorded to EQT's deputy counsel in a 1 page letter.  A copy is available upon request."
good,"You travel frequently on short notice with limited to no knowledge of how long you will be gone. You learn on the job, the knowledge you obtain from this staff is impressive and will make you more valuable. The most difficult part of this job is the inconsistency of work with no set schedule, you must be adaptable. The best part of this job are the people and traveling."
good,it was like working with a hawk over your shoulder. always telling you what to do and what not to do.
good,More work load not enough truck for the guys to drive. Little to no communication from management down to the guys everything is done over email vary strick place to work
good,This was a temporary position to help audit work done after hurricaine Irma I enjoyed the people there but they made you work 60+ hours a week no work like balance
good,Employees are very helpful all the time.  Job training always available.  Company picnics are a great thing to have.  Company is very fair and partial all the time.
good,"Every week numerous employees, including myself, had problems with payroll which was tracked on a paper log. Every week we were getting paid for less hours than we actually worked. Only after calling the payroll department and leaving numerous voice mails would we be paid the entire amount."
good,"some level of job security, overall they do industrial job, but sometime, it is good, sometimes it is bad, nuclear job, co-worker is good,"
good,"Everyone wants a job that creates joy in their life.  The meaning of joy is going to mean different things to different people, so asking me if I am satisfied with a job I no longer do, is subjective.  I'm sure someone with different skill sets and temperament is going to have a different experience."
good,"Management was very pleasant to work for and I learned a lot of important skills to advance, sadly the corporation lost 3 major contracts in the last couple of years and they had to cut-back and I was part of the process. I would go back if given the chance."
good,"Working at Tetra Tech means working 70+ hours a week with a high chance of travel. If that works for you, then you're all set.There is no vacation time in most roles, you work very late and sleep very little during activation. If you impress them you might be able to stay on in the interim. If not, wait for the next disaster and reapply."
good,"decent company to work for, lots of hours. they can improve in their management and treat their employees better so they don't have to hire new people even year"
good,"Be careful when signing on with them, they have had major issues with Payroll and Exec Management in the past and are ill equip to handle business lines in which they haven't started from the ground up. They are slow to transition and often times are very negative towards staff in business units when issues arise (regardless of who is at fault). While individual managers and work groups are usually great, I had little confidence in the Corporation's ability to conduct business."
good,"prefer not to rate.  I was not long enough to make comments."
good,"I am usually the guy doing the work, so it was strange to be an observer, recording the progress. My boss was a jerk and would take every opportunity to be rude and humiliate me in front of the contractors. The company, apart from him, is a great engineering firm."
good,my day at work consisted of me taking pictures of tree cutters cuts before and after also measure the tree then i print a ticket for that tree then document the time size and location where tree was cut
good,"Designing what ever the client needs. Mostly HVAC, some sewers. It is survival engineering and the great thing was I was close to my personal environment. "
good,"At start was very proactive, innovative, and proud of best employer awards but hiring of new marketing manager turned company into a basket case especially after Tetra Tech takeover."
good,"1. 8 hours working day"
good,Good company to work at. Interesting projects and processes that come from the different kinds of work that they do. Unorganized in certain aspects of planning.
good,"I have worked on a variety of projects and learned many skills as a result. However, there is no work life balance, the management is toxic, and there is no sense of mentorship."
good,"Very corporate "
good,"with this company i have learned managerial, leadership skills, cooperation and dedication for achieving organizational goals, also i have learned how to handle tough situations and how to overcome on a tough deadline, prioritizing the assigned tasks for a good result and outcome."
good,"If you are a calm headed person you will enjoy the experience."
good,"Work was overseas requiring long periods of separation, with little contact with peers.  Cultural differences between US and work country, usually very real hazards and danger risk.  Compensation was not consummate with the overall risk"
good,"The company pays good, no complaint."
good,"A real lack of communication.  Interaction outside of work hours is not encouraged; neither is the sharing of non-work information, even for politeness sake.  Undertones of resentment of the lack of appreciation very evident.  Often, the hardest part of the job is showing up for work."
good,"Pros"
good,The guys at the Newtown county landfill are great group of guys to work with very accepting and knowledgeable on the other hand the project manager is noth the greatest from not having any communicate skills to not being a great leader
good,Not much connection to the company. More connection to the federal agency. I would advise anyone interested to keep in touch with the company. Make trips to  the main office to meet with executives
good,"Donne de bons défis en terme de grosseur de projets."
good,"The work was great, but the environment and management needs improvement.  In the field, a typical day was going to site, speaking with multiple building managers about their buildings, measuring out building space, and then meeting back at the hotel to quality check others' work.  In the office, I updated all the field notes into CAD drawings and also checked the other CAD drafters' work.  My co-workers were great people to work with.  The management showed little desire to ensure a happy work place as long as the job got done.  The hardest part of the job was all the pressure to get the job done. At the beginning, we had weeks to do a job; by the end, we were pressured into doing multiple jobs in one week.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with like minded people who were dedicated nice people."
good,"I managed calls, hosted guests, provided for scheduling for executives and engineers. I managed conference room scheduling, and helped create project proposals. "
good,"Tetra Tech is a great company to work for but the hours are erratic."
good,"Pros:"
good,I was hired by the company on a temporary position. I was then able to turn it into a full-time position. All the work was in the field with very extensive hours. They provided lodging and a per diem for food. Training was limited it was a jump in and swim environment.
good,"Whether you're working in a construction materials lab, or performing tests/inspections as a field engineering technician, there's plenty to learn for newcomers. Management realizes it takes time to thoroughly understand everything. That does not mean they respect a fool though. The best way to succeed in this career is to be hungry for money, willing to learn and do anything, and generally have no life to go home to. Expect long hours in the sun and elements. When it storms, 90-100% of the work is shutdown until things dry up. As a geotechnical firm, everything revolves around groundwork, so when it's wet, there isn't many jobs that can be done. One of the best things about the job is the freedom to work your way. The Engineers only care about quality results, so they don't typically micromanage. In fact, the only time you'll hear from management is when there's a problem. They're usually short-staffed when it comes to technicians, so lack of manpower will account for most of the problems that arise."
good,"It's a good company to work for.  You'll be working mostly in the field.  I learned a lot working there, such as using the collectors app and also working in different projects such as the wildfire in Paradise California."
good,"Not a bad job, just temporary.  Poorly ran with some pretty smart people on board.  Employees pinned against each other trying to secure a place in a temporary job."
good,"Temporary job, it was a job. I had to drive from location to locations taking pictures of flooded houses in the Baton Rouge area. It was a a lot of driving but I liked I didn't have someone standing over me."
good,"Please refer to my review of USPS - Western TCMT. While I love the people and place that I am currently working at, it is the contracting agency that I am not pleased with."
good,"Typically inflexible; sometimes myopic; good benefits; great place for engineers; very much a rent seeker relying on government monies directly and regulatory compliance indirectly; upper management is more mercenary than idealist; lower levels can be pretty crunchy, especially the environmental groups; manages to straddle the crunchy environmental activist cause (big in ""climate change"" while also servicing oil, gas and mining sectors.  Largest water engineering firm in the world (treatment, distribution, protection."""
good,"Tetra Tech is a good environment to work in and the people are great, it is a little disorganized at times. Too many hours and a lot of wear on personal vehicles."
good,Waited 90 days then was given 2 days work. This company is good to work for if more hours were available sooner. Would definitely travel with them if ever offered.
good,"Employers have flex time, and they have to have their 40 hours in by the end of the week.  The benefits are poor same with vacation/sick time.  You get 23 days a year and 7 of them are paid holidays - New Years, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Christmas.  The job security is poor, and that comes with the job considering you have to win jobs to keep your team busy.  The people working there are great and friendly, which is the upside of working there.  Most of the work is done behind the desk and on the computer.  Great help and assistance if you need it.  Sometimes there is poor communication and certain individuals aren't available when you need them and they didn't let you know that they weren't going to be there."
good,The internal structure of the company breeds internal competition among offices and units which is detrimental to the overall corporate success.
good,"inter act with co-workers, helping to keep office machines running keep them loaded with paper and supplies, getting expense reports prepared, reviewed and submitted in timely manner, receive mail and parcels, ship out parcels, straighten up conference rooms.  On occasion lunches would be provided,"
good,Nice working environment.  No communication between upper management and worker bees.
good,"Trabalho firmemente solido em inspeções de segurança."
good,The medical industry was going through lots of changes at the time with the explosion of managed care.  We had our work cut out for us.
good,Mes services ont toujours été loués pour des projets au niveau Aluminerie (Chantier).
good,"Paperwork, paperwork and then some more paperwork. Fun at first. Meeting new people, everyone is friendly and the overall energy is super positive. Then they put the hours on you. Too much. Average work week was 80-90 hours. Nice checks but burnt me out fast. No time to do anything at all other than work. One day off per week and a sunday at that, cant take care of any personal business. Barely enough time to do laundry, get groceries for lunch, and hope to get a few hours rest before youre back at it. Also required to drive long distances with your personal vehicle and the first year theres no gas  reimbursement. Ouch. Not a good job for someone with wife and kids at home."
good,"L'environnement en générale est très agréable. La semaine de 37 heure et demi est vraiment très apprécié, avec la possibilité de faire des heures supplémentaires. L'équipe d'ingénieur et de chargé de projet sont vraiment passionné et transmettent beaucoup d'information. C'est une équipe très soudée et enrichissante :D"
good,There are issue that can be cultivated by any institution including the camaraderie in the work environment amongst staff. The issue of complaints and issues surrounding problems staff faced are not discussed with staff. Decisions are taking without input. I think that should be revisited to reinforce the cordiality
good,"Each Tetra Tech office should be evaluated separately, since the corporate office treats each operating unit almost like a franchise. The people at my office are great, but the focus from corporate is entirely on profits and reducing overhead."
good,Nothing more than a social club for previous Colorado School of Mines graduates.  Too much social drama that got in the way of getting work done and keeping clients.
good,"No 6 month reviews or performance evaluations. Working with other offices or using resources from other offices was difficult and employees often did not work well together. Top Management/Owners took a hands off approach, which would lead to a cowboy type mentality when it came to defining leadership roles. Middle Management from other offices would bicker with each other. Sometimes, veteran designers would scream and yell like children and would see no discipline. Overall, Tetra Tech has great benefits and after 6 years great time off with pay. The environment and company culture depends on the office."
good,long hours 12 hour shifts work in all kinds of conditions. natural disaster work cleaning up debris and monitoring contractors hired by fema for storm work.
good,enjoyable place to work however large company atmosphere made personal advancement and personal development much harder. Overall a good company to work for.
good,"Monitor gas well field, monitor flare station, monitor power plants-submit data and supervision of 8 technicians.   Review of 8 republic waste management sites throughout the bay area."
good,"you have to work too much hours,too many days,you need help cause they want you to do too many thingsthey want you to work as a field supervisor ,secretary,pc.messenger at the same time"
good,Great folks to work with but the job was all billable and there were unreasonable quotas for an administrative professional to obtain. Small office feel for a decent sized company.
good,"This one was so Long ago I cant remember much besides that I was given a job and expected to do it. No more or no less, just support the people and do what needed to be done. Great company to get  you into the work field with comfort."
good,Average Company on Fed Contract Market. Management is very nice and take personal visits regularly. Benefits are almost the same of other Fed Contractors at average level.
good,"I was working for PRC Environmental Management, a company that was eventually purchased by Tetra Tech in 1997 which totally changed the culture of the company in a negative way."
good,"Management did not train new employees well. However, this job was not hard to grasp at all. Work environment was pretty cool and down to earth. They give you plenty of hours."
good,"Great people to work with.  Poor benefits.  Poor job security - work goes and comes, which is typical.  Employees have flex time as long the 40 hours are in by the end of the week.  Great assistance for work.  A lot of research required for entry level positions."
good,"Previous company was acquired by Tetra Tech.  Left for another opportunity after about a year, in which we basically operated as we did before TT so not totally sure of operations after full transition."
good,"Tetra Tech is a good place to work, has steady flow of work, and the people are pleasant to work with.  Most employees pretty much keep to themselves and is a quiet atmosphere."
good,"I worked there for 7 years and was heavily involved in employee relations, benefits, performance reviews, hiring and terminations."
good,Not a bad company to work for but the slow winter months can be a stressful time.
good,The companies Human Resources Department has not yet caught up with the growth.
good,"A lot of work but not too much motivation, No trainings and travel availabilities."
good,Projects focus on soil vapor investigations of dry cleaner sites and impacted groundwater sites.
good,"Good place to work, just when mining industry goes down, so does personnel."
good,"I've worked in more than one, and this is a typical engineering/consulting firm.  There are some great people, and there are some you'd rather not deal with.  If management could inspire the staff to work together, instead of allowing pockets of insanity to reign, it would be a great place to work."
good,"When I started working for this Canadian company I was employee No. 7 in the Vancouver office, they were an Engineering company out of Winnipeg expanding operations on the West Coast. We were a small office led by a dynamic Engineer, our purpose was to grow this office and win large mining projects.  We were so successful we expanded space several times and finally moved into larger premises with two floors then out grew that space and had to rent another floor. At peak we were 300+ employees, these were very exciting years! 4 years ago we were bought by an US company and started transitioning all company standards to their policies, very challenging but on-going. I had the best team, no assignment was impossible, whatever was asked of them ""got done""! Without the teams dedication all the changes and policy changes would not have transitioned so smoothly. Challenging part of the job is always introducing the right employee to the right team, placing one with people who will help you excel at what one does and seeing them succeed."
good,Very good company with good security.  Mediocre opportunities for advancement.  Good benefits and average pay.
good,Typically I would prepare drawings under the direction of the structural engineer with little guidance. I would also make minimal calculations to size steel members or solve other problems that may occur. I worked with all other disciplines in the firm in coordination of  buildings or whatever the project incurred. My experience at SCM expanded my knowledge of the construction field vastly. I really enjoyed working on a project from start to finish where I was in control of the structural drawings. I find challenges a part of the job as a stepping stone in learning. I f it takes me additional time to figure it out I have no problem doing it on my own time.
good,They are an out of town company. They took too much time off work due to weather when other things could have been done. I have been on job sites for over 25 years and can look ahead and tell what needs to be done. I feel like the hardest part of the job was not working when things could have been done in other areas such as erosion control and hammering rock. The best part of the job was that it was a thirty minute drive from home.
good,a typical day at work
good,"work/life balance at Tetra Tech was excellent but the compensation wasn't enough.  However, people at Tetra Tech tend to work there for long period of time."
good,"The job overall has been a good experience. The work environment is relaxed and can be taken at your own pace without a lot of oversight from management. Worst part is being paid on time. Invoices are not paid until 30 days after submitted and several times delivery of payment has taken more than 30 days. If you are month to month or paycheck to paycheck, financial stress is high."
good,"Tetra Tech EM Inc. promoted the entrepreneurial mindset.  The ""flat management"" concept emphasized that anyone can pursue work and in fact was part of employee performance evaluation.  This ""flat management"" concept, however, only works in theory.  I did not feel I had adequate training to pursue work outside the firm being in contract financial management role.  I also felt I always had to seek approval and authorization from higher-level personnel such as senior project managers, therefore not a true ""flat"" management structure."
good,This is a great company as far as the work that they do. The deliverables they provide are always high quality and the employees are very talented and qualified. The atmosphere in the office can be dead and lonely. It is not the friendliest place to work.
good,"I have learned more in my two years at Tetra Tech than I have in the last 6 elsewhere. A decent place to work, and pays for talent."
good,"Good company to work for- good people and process is set up so"
good,"The benefits are the biggest con to working here.  The holiday leave that is required comes out of the personal leave.  Management is friendly and usually willing to work with you, but it is all about getting the customer's support/approval."
good,"In my last 5 years with Tetra Tech, I did learn a lot on engineering side as well as project management side. I had a chance to work with multi-discipline engineers and multi-discipline internal/external teams that increased the breadth of my engineering knowledge. The biggest negative point is poor upper management. Tetra Tech is reluctant to send people for training for some reasons and there is absolutely no planning for career development from the department manager's side or HR side. The most enjoyable part of the job inspite of all the frustration from the chain above was variety of stuff that you get to work on which kept me going and interested."
good,"A typical workday is 8 to 10 with weekends off. The workplace culture is great, however it is located in Liberia. The most enjoyable part of the job is you get to help other countries capacity build."
good,"Il y avait un bon esprit d'équipe,  Dommage que les mises à pied se face rapidement lors du manque de travail."
good,Tetra Tech is a dynamic firm with a broad range of specialties primarily focused in environmental A&E and with a specific expertise in water.  The firm serves customers around the world and is a constantly growing enterprise.
good,"-Various projects to work on and more freedom on the design and input in the projects. Learned about writing techniques and client interaction. "
good,"I learned a lot about chain of events in a large company and how procedures effect other departments."
good,"Horaire variable,intranet bien documenté."
good,"Typical work involved completing process engineering design sections for NI 43-101 type reports to access cost and feasibility of mining projects.  This involved dealing with different disciplines, mining, geology, environmental, to assist with completing a well balanced project."
good,"Great place to work, very challenging construction projects supported by a well trained field staff."
good,"This job is a contract with the military at Tinker AFB in Midwest City Oklahoma. A typical day starts out with getting the daily assignments from your File Maintenance Supervisor as to which laptops need to be inspected daily. There are anywhere from 3 to 12 sets of laptops with 10 to 16 laptops in each cabinet. Depending on what happened at midnight some or all didn't get the overnight up date and must be manually forced to update or restart thus this starts the morning. This can take anywhere from 1 hour to 4 hours depending on the laptops and their speed. This is completed while standing the whole time. After the laptops are ""synchronized"" a ""report"" is filed as to each and every detailed step that was taken to update each laptop. On Tuesday and Thursday the clerk would return to a designated office and retrieve the new changes that need to be added to each of the military maintenance manuals. Each update/change must be checked for absolute completion before it is inserted into the manuals. On Monday, Wednesday and Friday, if the work from Tuesday or Thursday is completed, will be spent (after the computers are updated) inspecting manuals for 100% perfection. This is called Annualing a File. Each file must be inspected every year according to military standards. There are over 300 files throughout the base. Each file is assigned a team (or vice versa) there are about 40 files per team and there are 5 teams on this contract. File inspection includes ensuring all pages are present and in the right order, ensuring that each page has the most recent updated change, and that all"
good,Very bad cummunication from mangment to field. They do not give you to proper team to succeed in a new division. They do have a great HR department that will help you through a lot.
good,"The company provided a great opportunity to grow and learn. Extremely talented people and friendly environment. Compensation was competitive."
good,Was working on exciting projects from all over. Was able to learn a lot from other co-workers and engineers over my time there and very grateful for what they shared.
good,"This was a multi-function complex that had high end living quarters with roof top living space containing putt-putt gold, video gaming and other outdoor entertainment center."
good,Big company with opportunities to work the world over. A huge environmental firm that competes with other large environmental companies.
good,"Every Mon. morning we had a project managers meeting via phone to determine schedules and needs for various employees. This is typical of consulting firms and I'm ok with that. However, as a project manager you better be at least 70% billable. I brought in 2 small clients, but near the end I was way less than 70% billable and got laid off."
good,"Tetra Tech DPK has the advantage they have been in the International Development Industry for over 20 years and they know the client very well.  This has both positive and less positive outcomes.  Positive, they know how and when to send proposals that will almost guarantee a win, they know the space very well and can provide very impactful solutions.  Not so positive, management is basically the same person who founded the business unit therefore there is very little innovation, also, staffing needs are addressed with the same uncertainty they had 20 years ago, despite the strong numbers they pull every quarter."
good,"As a Debris Monitor, I recorded Information on the Vehicles doing the Clean up for Hurricane Florence in Duplin County North Carolina. Long Hours, Lots of Sitting, Standing and Walking."
good,Well organized n I love working for the company.  Very long hours but you get to know different company picking up debris for the government after hurricane hit the ease coast
good,great paying job. great amount of hrs per week. this job also helped me to catch up on all of my bills and was I also was able to take care of my family. great management
good,I've been working with Tetra Tech for  months now and not once and I get paid every week have I gotten a correct paycheck from Tetra Tech always get the runaround of it'll be there on the next week's check I love the job itself Controlled Chaos I just disagree with the way that it's managed and the way that they train their new employees and expect them to have it down and just a couple of days everyone learns differently but not to them. Also if you don't get your required hours for the week Tetra Tech will take your vacation / holiday hours / payment and put it towards your regular Work Week hours I disagree with that fully
good,"A typical day starts at 7 am and you monitor city trucks coming to compost facilities to grind up the trees and branches that were left after Hurricane Harvey. This was truly a laid back position but when I first started you have to use your own car and gas. Gas is not reimbursed. The workplace culture was pretty much Supervised with Managers or leads with no management experience. Monitor contractor safety and report potential issues to the Field Supervisor."
good,"With the previous HR Director, the company worked very well and it provided more learning opportunities for my position."
good,Must stay late every month to adjust the financial states due to incomplete info.  Always needed temps and other to help..............................................
good,"I learned to work with multilingual staff. I learned a lot for expat staff. The hardest part is I am working with Home Office at US with different time zone. So, should communicate with them at their convenient time. I work up to 10 pm in office."
good,"empresa de grenciamento."
good,"Difficult to provide much of a review as the position was temporary.  While I worked there, I enjoyed by interaction with the management and other monitors, as well as the overseeing organizations such as Army Corp of Engineers.  Overall, a good experience."
good,Tetra Tech was a fast paced workplace that had a good atmosphere. It seemed a little mismanaged but its hard to blame it all on the managers. In my opinion they took on too many projects at one time and had a hard time coordinating all of them. Provided very nice chairs and good hardware.
good,"Highest pay among other companies.  You will work some terrible hours but you will get overtime.  They always have work, which is great for archaeologists; it will all go away sometime in the future."
good,"It is a good starter company to work for to get some experience in the mining industry, gaining knowledge in welding, and millwright trades. Always lots of good individuals to work with that are willing to help and teach newer and inexperienced workers."
good,"Compensation wise the company gets an A rating and is focused on employee health.  I really liked working for the company and doing my part to generate income which is an atmosphere that is greatly encouraged to win contracts."
good,"Tetra Tech is a great place to work, with great people, and interesting work. The benefits are quite good, there are lots of incentives to work, and if you work hard, you can advance upwards."
good,"I am contracted by Tetra Tech to work for the fed. gov't at FAA.  It's a good job and I enjoy the people I work with.  It's pretty slow paced most of the time and can get really slow.  That's the part I don't like, it makes the day drag."
good,You will be provided with a wonderful opportunity to challenge yourself!
good,"Stay focused on the task at hand, be punctual and come to work with a positive attitude. Always respect any authority figure that you may come in contact with because you may learn something helpful as it pertains to the job or safety."
good,"Overall a good job. Pay was good and lots of hours. It was a temporary job 3-6 month contract and worked for four months. I was hoping there would have been more work as time went on but not the case, but overall a good job and experience."
good,"it was good money but only seasonal. gives you good hours, you work 12+ hours a day and have no days off unless it rains. but overall good job if you want to make good money"
good,I like everything about this job except for you have to provide your own gas and hotel expenses........................................................
good,"Tetra Tech is a great company to work with. I have worked for Tetra Tech for over 8 years and my career as advanced steadily. I work on a variety of projects and am constantly challenged. I learn a lot every day and am grateful for this opportunity."
good,"Fast paced work with hard working fallow workers. It was out of town work, but I knew that going into it. The most enjoyable part of the job was the location."
good,Tetra Tech provided the foundation for administrative training and office practices that proved to be very useful in allowing growth in my current position.
good,I enjoy the work I do at the agency.  I find it to be very challenging and rewarding.  Manager appears to be micromanager and will not allow the employees to grow and to be challenged.
good,"As a monitor I love helping the community. I am paid fairly and love to work hard. Being kind is my specialty, and I get along with my fellow workers."
good,"Managed and developed a mapping of land disputes as a way to mitigate the potential for conflict surrounding this contentious post-revolution issue."
good,Relocated for work. Paid out of my very own Pocket to stay in a Hotel Room. Worked Hard for my money had absolutely no breaks for Lunch and Water. Worked under Extreme Heat. Was able to complete project.
good,Great environment. Excellent management. They provide a lot of advancement opportunity through continued education. The hiring process is drug out and rather annoying.
good,Bom lugar para crescer profissionalmente e como pessoa
good,"Tetra Tech is a great company to work for full of talented individuals, a leader in environmental and engineering consulting.  The workplace culture is supportive and demanding, with opportunities to gain diverse experience and skills."
good,Nice company to work for with lots of nice people.  Everyone always helps each other.  You never get bored because there is always lots to do and learn.
good,"A empresa conta com excelente corpo técnico e bom ambiente de trabalho. A empresa oferece algumas atividades diferenciadas em relação a outras do mesmo seguimento, tais como campanhas de saúde, ginástica laboral, treinamentos on line e outras. Gostaria apenas de ter presenciado uma maior integração com os outros escritórios ao redor do mundo e possibilidade de intercâmbios em outros países."
good,Bom clima organizacional e capaz de se adaptar às necessidades dos clientes.
good,Long work days involving continuous travel across various sites. Work is unfortunately repetitive and relatively not satisfactorily challenging but eventually rewarding
good,Poor job security that is typcial working for an engineering firm. Good staff and peers for a working environment. 99.9% work time spent behind a desk.
good,"Endless emails. Lots of early morning calls and late nights. Meetings upon meetings. Great people. Interesting countries and travel. Fun,  family culture."
good,THey were a good company lately they just have not had any work or promise of work. they offer good benefits 401k & overtime.

good,An environment where there is opportunity to learn many new skills.
good,"Good company, unfortunately I have not been able to find full time work with them, only project work."
good,Fast pace publicly traded engineering firm that had to compete hard and we won most of the time-- and they're still winning!
good,"Diariamente realizo o monitoramento do cumprimento de obrigações legais a e a manutenção do Programa Qualifica, além da gestão de não conformidades das empresas terceirizadas (controle do plano de ação). Apesar de ser uma empresa muito boa de se trabalhar, noto que nós, profissionais de SSO somos menos valorizados do que as outras áreas da empresa pela gerência atual. A nossa equipe de trabalho possui cerca de 40 pessoas no setor (SSO), é uma equipe que se preocupa em ajudar e repassar seus conhecimentos e experiências ao próximo. O que dificulta um pouco nosso trabalho é falta de alguns recursos que não são disponíveis para todos os funcionários do setor. (Ex.: computador, que temos que revesar em algumas situações). A parte mais agradável do trabalho é o contato direto que tenho com outras empresas (o que proporciona mais contato profissional) e o nosso grupo de trabalho que é unido e valoriza o trabalho do outro."
good,A typical day would be
good,"I worked there through good times and bad. During the good times things were great, but the bad times everyone took a hit. the company was split into many different business groups that competed for work with little sharing of resources."
good,"While field days are long, crew members also participate in data management in the field. "
good,"This was my first environmental construction job I was on, didn't know what to expect. I have learned a lot (most good some bad). I've got a lot of seat time on equipment that will help me on my next job."
good,"Great place to work for, one can learn quite a bit here for future employment. The negative is that the Management at the department was not very knowledgeable on people skills and on going out to attain more business, which results in the loss of jobs. the department I worked under relied solely on the contracts and clients that we maintained, but didn't go after new clients, which when we lost a few of our clients and contracts, resulted on having to have cut backs of employees.  I was employed there for thirteen years and saw this coming in the last few years.  My hope is that the company steps in and pushes management to stay on top of looking for new clients for other people still employed there."
good,"I gained knowledge of many different environmental disciplines.  I learned a lot about data management and the tools used to assist with data organization (i.e., Excel).  I also used different risk assessment tools to conduct statistical analyses on data.  The favorite part of my job was working in the field on biological surveys or conducting environmental sampling.  I did not mind traveling to different regions of the country to participate in these field studies.  The hardest part of my job was not working in a normal office setting.  I did not see my coworkers on a frequent basis.  It also became difficult at times finding consistent work due to poor project management.  In general, I enjoyed working for Tetra Tech and was employed by them for over 27 years.  They recently hired me back to work on a part-time basis.  However, I am seeking a permanent position."
good,"Federal contract work for Human Resources function, consisting of recruiting, mission critical occupational assessments, orientations, human capital planning and employee training."
good,"During my stay in Tetra Tech., I found it very professional but relaxing. I had a good time with my co-workers. My boss was very helpful and sympathetic about my needs."
good,"Its a good place to learn the essentials of the oil and gas industry.  Great opportunity for advancement, great training programs.  Pay rate could have been better."
good,My office relies heavily on government contracts. Not a bad thing but can be at times uncertain for the future.  I do love the people that I work with.
good,Gained a lot of valuable cliental relationships.  Learned the importance of good communication an service between office an field personnel.
good,"working with task leads, subcontractors, headquarters staff."
good,there were a lot of jobs to keep you going. company is not doing any work anymore
good,"beautiful place to work great team members,not so great upper management"

good,"Really enjoyed the time there, agumented other offices, out of state."
good,"Is a temporary be responsible and puntual is my recommendation, Not an stable work but is good the operation manager is a great person most of the peers are team work persons."
good,"Safety concerns addressed early morning before employees are sent to work zones. Work days are about 15 hours long, seven days a week. Most enjoyable part of the job for me was earning management experience."
good,"Tetra Tech is a good company to work for and with; because of flexible work schedules, opportunities for professional growth through training's and projects, and office Kansas City office culture. We in the Kansas City Tetra Tech office have developed a culture cutting edge mobile data collection with web-based viewing applications. The most difficult part of my position is managing work schedule through cyclical cycles of low and high demand and managing delivery expectations between numerous project and project managers as I work all my projects concurrently."
good,Very strong mentoring for new professionals.  Strong collaboration and growing work responsibilities.  Poor transition beyond entry level due to corporate aversion to risk and being unwilling to give challenging work to unproven staff.
good,"The transition from a privately held company to a publicly traded company has been somewhat rocky, resulting in many reorganizations and layoffs. "
good,"Lack of work, was hard to stay busy sometimes. Nice computer setup and great IT support. Flexible hours in a good location. great coffee bar and free snacks. Just and over all good environment."
good,"Be prepared to work long hours, that is the nature of the position. It is a temporary job. If you are afraid of work, don't apply. If you have ability and ambition, it will be recognized. Plenty of overtime."
good,This was a contract job due to floods of 2016. Working with Federal Government Relief Companies and different types of government on a daily basis was great. It was an even better feeling knowing I was helping my own and surrounding parishes.
good,If you like staying busy this is a great company to work for.  Your supervisors do not micromanage you and encourage you to take ownership of your job.
good,Enjoyed the work and the management.  Most of the work is contractual and temporary and would work here again if given a chance.  Some of the temporary hires had little motivation and could not show up to their assigned work posts on time.
good,"Great people, great work. High caliber scientific staff leading the industry in complex data analytics; providing data-driven solutions to complex challenges faced by EPA headquarters, regional offices, state and municipal water agencies."
good,"Tetra was a good place to work it's not their fault that the oil is up and down.I enjoyed working for all of the managers there, it was a great experience for me.The equipment and living quarters which was provided were, for the most part, was clean and nice.If anybody has a chance to work for Tetra take it. Good Pay!"
good,"This is a great way getting Documention experiece. As a Task force leader working at the Portable scales I Weighted and documented All Roll off bins, End dumps, Rocket launchers hauling off debri to land Although it is only a tempory job I have enjoyed it. If i want to continue with this company i would have to travel but i have a family i would like to see on a daily basis and unfortuanatly  i could not continue working at tetra tech after this project is over."
good,"Very diverse projects with dedicated and talented co-workers. I learned something new every day even after 20+ years. Hardest part of the job was the constant pressure to remain billable. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to solve problems for our clients, especially with the help of good co-workers."
good,The management was great and provided a healthy environment to work in. Very appreciative of their employees' work. Got opportunities to learn on environmental management.
good,"My co-workers were top notch professionals well respected in the industry."
good,Tetra Tech has extremely qualified personnel and a diverse project portfolio. There are a lot of opportunities for personal and professional growth.
good,"- Referencing ticketing system to manage tasks. Respond and correct computer hardware and software issues for all machines that had been shipped to my location for a break/ fix status.

good,"Management was great and staff was helpful and friendly."
good,Paid time off was the only issue with my time with Tetra Tech everything else was acceptable and fair. The work conditions was challenging at times but a great work place.
good,Una empresa de cooperación internacional con excelente manejo de personal y remuneración
good,"Standing on your feet all day (8 hours) studying the core. They need to put the core on a V stand and provide stools to sit down on to do your work. If you have any back problems, don't work here."
good,"L'entreprise est ouverte à bien former ses employés."

My day started at approximately 8 a.m. and could end anywhere between 9 p.m. to 3am with no days off. With time management you have control of your own schedule although there is always an extreme amount of work or back tracking your days are always long."

good,"Une journée typique est de faire les tâches demandées par l'agent de facturation auquel j'étais assigné. Faire les tâches pour lui faciliter sa facturation et désengorger sa charge de travail. J'ai beaucoup appris car c'était la première fois que j'appliquais pour ce poste. L'agent de facturation prenait tout le temps qui faut pour bien m'expliquer les tâches que je devais faire. Si je ne comprenais pas, il m'expliquait d'une autre façon. Malheureusement, il y a eu un changement de système. Le processus était long et cela rendait ma tâche difficile et je trouvais que je n'évoluais plus autant que je le souhaitais."

good,"There are assignments that come in either by direct contact emails that require completion within a time as the particular assignment required. This may be something routine ( not necessarily easy) but something that can be done within the time needed. Other days there are job challenges that require thinking outside the box the accommodate the requirements of the particular job, time constraints, and or usual skills sets. The workplace culture is more relaxed because each individual is highly skilled and trusted to get the job done. Once the abilities are proven there is a trust and expectation level to get the job done in timely accurate and professional manner."

good,"The management knew what they are doing and it was  a nice place to work, they were very knowledgeable and useful, very nice and truly professional engineer who trained every one"
good,"I worked for Tetra Tech off and on for many years. That's one of the best things I can say about them. If you are driven, work hard, and always eager to learn, they will help you build your career and push you along the path you wish to take. I've had AMAZING managers all the way around and feel very lucky to have worked with every one of them. They have a healthy work/life balance which I find really important. There is a lack of ""team"" attitude though and sometimes a lack of acknowledgment for those who work hard by managers. Overall, I think this is a great place to get your foot in the door, but I wouldn't say it's built for long term placement."

good,"It's been a good experience for far. Manager and peers have been very helpful in my transition to office's culture, which is semi relaxed and stimulating for those craving to learn. Assigned projects enabled me to push my knowledge boundaries. For the first time in the work place, I have a manager that cares about employees and genuinely expresses concerns.

good,"- Team effort is a very important."
good,"This is a great company to work with. I was part-time and did a lot of driving, but everything is paid for. The surveys got a little boring in the winter because there are not many birds in the north at that time."
good,Collect water samples several times in a 12 hour shift. High expectations to perform daily duties accurately. At times the work place culture was stressful when the plant manager was present. Some employees were over competitive for a short term project it was as if the were building their own kingdom.  Project was micro managed from Colorado making the decision making process unnecessarily cumbersome.

They were paying $300 to over $400 for Adobe Acrobat Standard and Professional. I fully evaluated Nuance as a replacement for Adobe and installed over 3000 copies of Nuance at a cost of $22.00 per license. In a few cases I had to upgrade certain people back to Adobe Acrobat standard or professional, but I had to do fewer than 20 people which saved the company thousands of dollars in their operations. I also got to be the company's expert on both Adobe Standard and Professional as well as Nuance. I also recommended the company settle on Google Picassa as their standard photo editor."
good,Tetratech is a company on the move.  Willing to venture into new areas to provide challenges for people and provide services to their clients.

good,"I loved tetra tech because of the $20 an hour and 12 hours a day but unfortunately they are temporary and they are global so this didn't work for me in the end because I have a family, but for people who can travel I highly recommend them."
good,"Work/life balance needs some work but they pay us very well. The thing about great pay is it requires great sacrifice. Keep that in mind if you come here at work for Tetra Tech. I have seen some short-timers that think they are ready to work but get here working 90 hours a week and fall out within a few weeks.  So if you want to make great money and build your resume, TT is a place to do it. Not on that, but the work we do can be very rewarding. Best of luck!"

good,"The staff that I worked with was great.  Very easy to get a long with, very patient, and very much for the people.  I had a great time at the company unfortunately that contact ended about one year after I had been employed with them.  It was my first company that gave me an opportunity after I retired from Naval Service for that I am grateful.  They taught me a lot about how to be an upstanding civilian after 20+ years of Naval service."
good,"My time at NDY was both challenging and memorable in a good way. Nothing to say except great things about the people I worked with and the reception I received as I challenged audiences across the world with Client Centricity and news ways of working.

I am still there with only like 5 monitors now since all debris pickup is just about complete. I absolutely love working with Tetra Tech and really hope I can continue in other storm affected areas when this assignment ends. As a monitor you are in your vehicle a lot as well as on your feet while trucks are loading. It’s a easy job and pays well.

good,Typical day at work will be to review work progress of the day and all communications between Port Authorities and Customs are thorough and precise as to the work done and to be done. I learned about time management more effectively (the co has one yr to complete the project) and how to manage people from different backgrounds and parts of the world. My co workers were fun to work with. Hardest part of the job is when there's communication break down. The part I enjoy most about this job is meeting new people.

good,"This is the best job I've ever had.  I started out after Hurricane Harvey as a debris monitor and learned the many rules of monitoring, as well as how the offices ran.  I was soon moved up to the data manager position, and I've never been happier.  I have worked several projects and eagerly await the next one.  Every day is productive.  Within the position, you work 7 days a week, sometimes 12+ hours a day, but the pay and the productivity is absolutely worth it."
good,My day consist of monitoring large trucks picking up debris for Hurricane Harvey. The workplace culture was based outside. I most enjoyed getting to know all of the different residents around the Houston area.

good,A typical day as a tower monitor was making sure that the truckers had the proper paperwork and by eye rate them by how much debris they had in there truck
good,"Tetra Tech was a great place to work.  The people I worked with were very knowledgeable and fun.  A typical day of work for me was 50% construction oversight and 50% office work.  It had a very relaxed atmosphere where people were willing to help each other out on their projects.  Billable hours are billable hours.  One of the most difficult parts before our office got laid off was to stay billable.  Overall it was a great experience and I would work with those same people again.  On the downside it soured me somewhat to consulting work.  Consulting work requires you to find clients who want to spend money to fix their problems.  In a recession, clients are more likely to shelve their problems until the next fiscal year.  This means you lose your job."
good,"Great verity of work, but the nature of contract work is a feast or famine situation. "
good,I've enjoyed my time at Tetra Tech. I was able to work on exciting projects and learn a lot. The people that I work with have all be fantastic. It's hard to advance because people rarely leave the company.

good,Great company and look forward to work with them again. Career  is development good. Tetra Tech is flexible in  using so many offices to execute projects .
good,"The interview process was streamlined and easy to complete.  I especially liked the automated pre-employment paperwork process so there was very little paperwork to complete on the first day on the job.  The orientation and training included an easy to follow checklist.  My first days at work were welcoming and smooth covering a wide assortment of questions I didn't know I had until they were answered.  "
good,I worked on the camp fire clean up project. It was an honor to help my community and a blessing to work with so many wonderful people. The hours were kind of insane but we got through it and I don't regret a second of it. I made friendships and professional relationships I know will last a lifetime. I am forever greatful for this job and my coworkers.
good,"Excellent company, great to work for.  Management, Supervisors, and peers all dedicated to the work, as well as each other.  Location work, location was awesome (Orlando, Florida)."
good,Supervisor are awesome and they actually care about you as a person. Great people to work with. Contractors are easy to work with. Will follow them around the world if needed
good,"The Tetra Tech office where I was a member before I retired specializes in energy efficiency and Clean Energy program planning and evaluation. They also have a great market survey group to support those initiatives and conduct other market research projects. As a senior consultant and project manager, I had full responsibility to get the project done and satisfy my clients' needs using a team of Tetra Tech staff and others. I had a project budget that guided my decisions, but was very involved in putting that budget together. Junior staff have lots of opportunities to learn from great mentors. Those who have not been successful are not willing to put in the extra time and effort to learn and to do a high quality job. As a result, work/life balance is typical for a consulting group, but you are well compensated for good work. There is also plenty of opportunity to work together with a great team and to make longtime friends from Tetra Tech. It is also nice to work for a U.S. based company and for local management who care about their staff personally."

good,I like working with Tetra tech I learn so much from the boss out there and Army corps they had so much compassion on helping people with the fires and everybody in this company love their jobs and that made me want to work harder and harder and to become a permanent worker for their company

It has a culture typical of any consulting engineering company but unlike one's run primary by accountants the engineers and technical managers are very involved in day to day decisions on how to run the business. The company makes money but does not make foolish decisions to just make money. They care about their employees, the public's welfare, and of course serving their clients!"

good,"Honestly, I do not remember much from working here other than that I drove about 45 minutes there and back to the office, which was outside. I only went to pick up forms and I spent 12 hours on a computer looking at data and scanning in documents, composing emails to higher-ups on questions I had. The lunch break was always nice and I liked the people I would get the talk to. I had only 2 days of training with the former manager before she left for another city so I was kind of thrown into it, I loved it though regardless. Miss it a lot actually."
good,"I find that a regular work day can be challenging at times.  You can come in and someone ask you to run a report, you'll just complete the task and return to your to do list."

good,Great company. Only downside is that they are contracts. To summarize it deadlines need to be met and the work needs to get done. The best thing to know is that you will have to learn on your own for the most part. Ask as many questions as you can.
good,"It is refreshing to work with people that really love what they do for a living. It makes the stressful times not so bad. This was my experience at Tetra Tech. The employees do a good job on whatever they're working on because they really care and love what they are doing.

good,This was the best place I ever worked.  The believed in everyone.  They have education reimbursement.  They pay for one professional membership and do lots of in house training.  Everyone I worked with was interesting and a professional.  Part time workers were included in the annual meetings which were always held in 5 star hotels.  The work was always challenging and fast paced.  Most of the work was  government work so there were lots of confidentiality agreements and unrealistic deadlines and budgets.  My favorite part of the job was getting together at the annual meetings and being able to put a face to the person that I had worked with over the phone and via e-mail.
good,"Great company, teams feel like family. The work environment is excellent. The pay can be great! Its a very casual environment. Advancement opportunities are excellent."

good,"My 10 years of experience at Tetra Tech have been nothing but positive, and I have been around the block a few times. Best advice I can give is to go into a company like Tetra Tech with a producing/contribution mentality...not from the perspective of what can the company do for you. Unfortunately, contracts end sans additional funding, periodic downsizing can occur. However, Tt is a worldwide company with plenty of in-house opportunities."
