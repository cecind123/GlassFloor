rating,review
bad,"It felt like a time slip.  They have not moved on to modern work schedules, workflows, management techniques, micromanagement, and everyone work in very silent silos.  It felt like working in a morgue with an overseer."
bad,"I've worked for this company for many years. When I started and for years after they really cared about their employees and their families. Now I feel like I'm treated like a number, they seem to care about the bottom line rather than the employees that help run the company."
bad,I was constantly bored and looking for things to do.  They kept telling me that they where going to train me in new task but failed to do so.  I was also let go two months early than my contract.
bad,Enjoyed the time that I was there only negative is the company was to far my commute wish it was closer than what it was pay was excellent and company is great
bad,There was no work-Life balance. I felt I was pushed to do my work too fast which compromised the quality and integrity of my work.  Management were not leaders only supervisors
bad,They promote young inexperienced Supervisors that can’t pass any of the licensing. The employees who has the designation do not get promoted. Doesn’t make sense.
bad,"In the call center, there is absolutely NO flexibility in schedule to allow for either making up time or altering your schedule for anything outside of work.  They allow seniority to dictate all time off and it is awarded by a bidding process.  Most people, outside of the top 3-4 in the department do not get to take off at the holidays"
bad,Worked here for a while and was a joke. Tell you that you will train on your shift but you end up training on all shifts so if you need a family balance this company isn't worth it for Security. I pulled some weeks 50 plus hours and didn't have a choice. There pay system is wack also. Pay says salary but it's not roughly 16 an hour. Have to pay parking also. I got harassed my first week and the company didn't do anything. Said they would find a different position for me and didn't.
bad,Very structured to the point of felling like a robot. Lots of favoritism in the department I worked in. Probably a great place if you start when your young not in your late 40s
bad,"Securian prides itself on stability. This means you can stay their for your entire career and feel confident that you'll have a comfortable retirement. With scheduled raises and a pension, it's easy to see why the tech department is filled with people who have families."
bad,"Securian is a very beige company. The cubicles are beige, the average workday is beige, and most of the people are beige. This consistency is attractive to many people and suits their desire for regular, known work but is smothering for anyone with creativity and a need for variety. Securian rewards tenure above rank or ability which is frustrating and unappealing for bright, new talent."
good,"My boss micromanaged and was passive aggressive. They were frequently not available but always seen chatting away with supervisors in Operations. Valued quantity over quality and didn’t care about team building. When people quit, instead of replacing them, they would force the extra work on the team, forcing us all to work over time, while simultaneously reprimanding us on our workloads. This just goes to show how out of touch leadership is."
good,"It was a very difficult environment for someone who came from a nonprofit background. I found it too cutthroat for me."
good,I gained lots of knowledge and was challenged daily to use critical thinking skills for processing applications. I enjoyed the non micro management experience.
good,"Siloed departments/divisions. Technology is far behind compared to other financial companies. Long tenured employees is what they are proud of, but difficult for moving up."
good,The work Environment was quite everyone stayed to them selfs for the most part if you like a self working environment in and call center this would work for you..
good,"The company has been long standing in the community. However, the department I was hired to work in was Variable Annuities. It was soon to be sunsetted.  The software was antiquated, the co-workers had all worked together for a very long time.  It was clear that Securian would soon move on from Variable Annuities and the department would soon be shut down. To avoid that, I applied and was accepted to a new company and one much closer to home."
good,Securian is a great place to work. People are nice. Many people stay or come back. Decent pay but other companies pay higher. Needs more diversity and should promote within more versus hiring by association.
good,"Typical day at work aside of structured work schedule include minor to major sporadic tech issues. Rarely are there major job issues."
good,Solid company with continuous growth opportunities. Lots of on-site training and constant evaluation of internal processes.
good,"Securian is a great place to start your career and learn and gain experience in the your related field. The culture there is very old school, and new management recognizes this. They are trying to change but it's going to be a very slow and laborious process."
good,Not a lot of opportunities for advancement unless working in a few specific departments.  Managers who've been there for a long time are complacent and resistant to change.
good,Value long term associates. They have a wide range of financial products to offer.
good,"Strong, financially stable Insurance Company with great benefits and consistently recognized as one of the top employers in the Twin Cities by its employees."
good,"High ethical standards, some pockets of bad management.  Morale used to be strong but is now fragile in IT due to the level of uncertainty and lack of trust in management."
good,There are no level up interactions to be able to hold all levels accountable.  Upper Management looks out for themselves on the back of really good and dedicated employees.
good,"Securian FInancial hired me through a temp agency. Once I started, I realized they went through temp employees rapidly. Upper management was lackluster, authoritative, and under qualified."
good,The people are very approachable and fun to work with.  They are always available to bounce questions and ideas off of and provide any guidance or help they can.
good,"Per their website:"
good,"Extremely stressful! I retired early due to the Supervisor and her side kick. Would still be working there if it wasn""t for the two of them. Loved my co-workers, got a long great with them but the supervisor, no!!"
good,Securian has been a good company to work for the last 4+ years. They value employees and are good about hiring within the company. They offer excellent benefits and vacation/sick time and also believe in work-life balance.
good,"Securian is an innovative and creative working environment."
good,Good place to work.  People hold positions for a very long time so there is not a lot of brain drain.
good,"Securian Financial is a good company and could make some shifts to be a great company. They are on a path to creating a better culture, but change has proven to be difficult. For the big picture, they are strongly rated with  good values and a focus on doing what is right. The experience you have is tied to the division you work in and your manager. There is too much time spent in meetings and not enough empowerment for some high level positions."
good,"Overall, a great company to work for. Not all departments were treated the same.  Could not count on Human Resource assistance if there were issues.  "
good,I would highly recommend this company. They offer a competitive benefits package and opportunities to advance. Many of the business operation positions are highly technical so there is always the availability to learn new things.
good,Overall good company to work with. Different departments with different management rules plays on the downside. Friendly and accommodating workplace environment
good,"Good working environment, very appreciative of employees. Plenty of fun things to do. Health benefits a bit high but other benefits are pretty okay. Treats you like family."
good,"Great place to work, however I wish they would push employees out of their comfort zone a bit more."
good,"Overall good management and coworkers.  Very stressful fast paced environment, and my skills/abilities turned out to not be a good fit.  But many people very happy working there."
good,"At Securian Financial Group I typically work from 8 to 5 Monday through Friday. The work load keeps my busy all day with peek times of year when overtime is required. There are constant opportunities to learn new software and new skills. Management is sometimes excellent and sometimes poor and the same can be said of the workplace culture, depending on the department you work in."
good,"I can't say enough about my time there except to say it's the best experience I've had in tech. Highly flexible on schedule and an amazingly talented crew to work with. Contracts are unreliable, unfortunately"
good,Has the usual ebbs and flows of any career. Hectic and extremely busy at times. Work culture is becoming more flexible. Working from home is becoming more common. Very comfortable place to work.
good,Overall i liked working here even as a temp. Everyone was nice and friendly. Very well environment to work in. Workload at times but was well kept to date.
good,"I was contractor and I enjoyed my work at Securian. My supervisor and manager were great. Really nice and flexible if my schedule needed it which it did twice a week. They were great about it."
good,"Learn something new everyday."
good,Securian has a great family friendly atmosphere where everyone is treated fair. This company provides opportunities for advancement and provides in-house training.
good,"I was an intern, it was pretty great. Had the opportunity to bounce around several different non-technical and technical projects as a Business Analyst and Quality Assurance Analyst"
good,"same as other review, was a temp and still loved working here, loved my boss and co workers, anytime I had a question it was answerd"
good,"The company itself is a wonderful company, it is very financially sound, they offer wonderful benefits and a very independent work environment."
good,"Securian was a broker for the independent firm I worked through as a private wealth adviser. They were somewhat lacking with technology, but extremely helpful with service needs to our firm."
good,Best place I have ever worked!!!  Wonderful training!! Amazing people to work with!  Lots of room to grow!
good,"Hires people will applicable experience. Is not nepotistic, and only advances those will true skills. Provides plenty of training to new associates and a welcome atmosphere."
good,"Being a training specialist is a high energy and quick paced job. I have learned to write documentation, implement training, complete quality review, and conduct training analysis. The culture is supportive and open. The hardest part of the job is the lack of work/life balance."
good,I started as a temporary worker in the warehouse 18 years ago. Every four to five years I was promoted to the next job grade. I was able to take in-house classes to help me be a better leader.
good,"The company values are truly lived out in the culture and day-to-day interactions. Conservative mutual holding company, very financially sound. Management overall is very effective at producing results."
good,"Great place to work, not stressful, thoroughly trained, great work atmosphere. You get to work with some great people all over the USA, most days are smooth and joyful days."
good,"There always something to do.  My supervisor was amazing,  I had to leave because of health reason. Overall it is a good company to work for.  I would recommend anyone to work there."
good,"Days start with powering on plate imager, then daily required maintenance on the plate processor. Organizing job tickets into order  in which the press room would like the jobs. Run the plates in the imager and bring to press."
good,"Monitor all foot traffic at the receiving dock. Give security access to vendor making deliveries to businesses that rent space from our company. Receive all incoming packages, and supplies that are left at the dock."
good,"I've enjoyed working for Securian for eight years, a typical day at work consists of data entry, verifying information, auditing payroll files, determining eligibility of participants, and mostly computer based work. My current supervisor is the best supervisor I've had in any position I've been in, she's understanding, and easy to work for, she makes my job pleasant. I would say my co workers are hard working, with a lot of personality differences, but all in all we are a good team. The most enjoyable part of my job would be when it is busy, it makes the day fly by. The hardest part of the job would be the attention to detail, triple checking that everything looks correct before it passes my desk. In my position I have learned the importance of my role in this company, our participants depend on us to do a great job, no matter how small our role seems, we are all equally important to produce great results for our clients."
good,"Customer service focused organization. Good life balance for associates. Many long-tenured employees, so promotions can be slow. Corporate headquarters located in adjoining buildings downtown in St. Paul."
good,"Everyone is really nice, personable and friendly.  Work / life balance is phenomenal.  Securian really cares about their associates."
good,Securian Financial Group is by far the best place I have ever worked. Pay rate far exceeds the job requirements.  Paid time off that the company encourages it's employees to take.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of organizing my task for the day. Working as a team to complete diligently, also to enjoy our day as we work. Good attitudes, enjoyment atmosphere, complete all task at hand. Successful days work for the company and our team."
good,"Great company, with lots of wonderful people and a culture that respects work-life balance.  Although they are expanding into other regions with recent acquisitions, they are a community-minded pillar of St. Paul."
good,Securian Financial Group is a great place to work.  Wonderful culture and they take great care of their associates.  Their benefits are competitive.  My typical day there is go to the cafeteria and grab a light breakfast.  Take the elevator up to my floor.  Say hello to my colleagues on the way to my desk.  Plug in and get to work!  Other associates are almost always respectful and everybody is quite knowledgeable about their job.  It's a great place to work for just about anybody!
good,"I loved working for this company.They gave me a lot of room for growing. Good benefits,working with different people, learning different skills. Providing different work classes to manage different skills and to handle different problems. Friendly people."
good,the job was easy. Management and other team members were very helpful when you need help. the work environment was relax and you always have work to do.
good,"Securian is the best company I have worked for in my career. They have a fantastic onboarding process which includes a robust training program that provides new hires with a very clear understanding of the organization as a whole. As you grow in the organization, they provide ongoing training that is well developed and thorough. Their HR department is very much a business partner, actively involved with other business units with any and all events that may require support such as process changes, re-orgs, progressive discipline, training, etc."
good,Premier Resource Group is a group of elite advisors affiliated with Securian Financial broker dealer who formed a group that is for advisors and run by advisors. They meet once a year in Las Vegas for their 3 day annual conference and the speakers are top notch and the relationships you make who other advisors in different parts of the country is incredible.
good,"Great management that acts according to corporate values - honesty, integrity, doing the right thing. A great culture, although very conservative - they just recently (2017) got a Friday Jeans Day. But the people are great and the culture is wonderful. They promote from within, so people rarely leave. Just a ton of opportunity there, and great benefits Profit sharing - and they are a very profitable company."
