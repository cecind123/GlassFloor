rating,review
bad,i spent 33 years working there and was treat well and then thrown away.
bad,I have to say cab it is and by far the worst job I’ve ever worked at. They pay well but if you have a family a kid a girlfriend or any sense of life that is not the place for you. You work terrible hours management is awful many people flow through that company because of how terrible it is. Would not recommend going there unless you’re single I want to make money.
bad,Managed entirely from Corporate. Lots of politics and posturing for appearances with no accountability for results at the top. Financial games lead to misleading financial results. Systems are obsolete and inadequate. Not a good place to work.
bad,"Pay is great, dirty job, no chance for advancement, will hire foremen off the street, lower management=clueless. Upper management= penny pinching, if you are worried about Safety...then you will be labeled as a ""troublemaker"". Even as a union shop, if management wants you gone.....you're gone!!"
bad,"In one word, I would summarize: racist."
bad,"Unless you fit in with the click or do non company things you will not work there. I worked there for almost 2 years and trust me Cabot is not all what it seems. I did not my work to the best of ability and was not enough,"
bad,"Just a job, morale is low and I am told it has been for years. work schedule is long and being on call while on a long off is not a plus."
bad,"quasi impossibile fare carriera"
bad,"Company required us to work 12 hour shifts alone, which is unsafe and physically/mentally exhausting. Workload was enough to keep 2 people per shift busy. Supervsion did not care and never responded to reported safety dangers of working solo. Supervisors look out for themselves. Equipment was poorly maintained and constantly breaking. Extremely dirty workplace due to working with carbon. Folks who work here put out a lot of work with little recognition or praise. Pay was OK but below other chemical/oilfield plants in the area. Benefits were good but did not offset the demands of the job. This company is results oriented and definitely not people oriented. Go to work here with your eyes wide open."
bad,"Site GM was absolutely worst interview ever.  He was only interested in 1-2 word answers.  He made you not want to work for him or the organization.  Other interviewers held same opinion.  Comments were that you adjust to him and his abrasive style or you won't survive.  If ever there was a person that belonged in a single contributor role, its this guy.  He is an employee relations nightmare."
bad,Cabot Corp was a great place when I first started. Everyone was incredibly nice and 60% of the people has been with the company over 20 years and the was 10% of the company that has been here over 30 years. This all changed November 2019 when they had a massive layoff of 53% of the office. they are shipping all these jobs to Latvia. Most of the employees that have been here over 20 years have not taken it very well when others like myself have been through this before. They have been providing everyone job counseling and trying to help the people that were let go with there resumes. I think we all expected more for a company that was so family oriented.
bad,the work environment at cabot is poor the equipment is horrible and outdated and management is the worst i have ever had. pay is very good but that is the only pro about the place
bad,the pay is good but the management in place is the real downfall of the plant. It was a constant struggle between production and maintenance on who took priority.
bad,Each day you were extremely dirty and it was unavoidable. The pay was great and some of the job duties were easy. In the end they laid off a lot of people for poor financial decisions.
bad,Cabot has an old school vibe; no great work from home policy and slow to change things that should be able to pivot quickly. They do have a solid sense of security though and the pay is not bad.
bad,"Working Environment was poor,  No ventilated hoods."
good,Cabot pays very good and the safety culture is amazing. But they don’t support you or want to see you grow as a person. There is little advancement if any at all. Management does not treat the hourly people good and they don’t value there feedback or input.
good,"it was a very fast paced competitive job, but had a really good crew that worked together. very dirty and but easy to learn. overtime was always available."
good,Overall the company has great people. Management is not your friend and over manages at all aspects . You can be a temp for up to 2 years while being laid off multiple times . However I am proud of the safety process they have in place . They take safety seriously !!
good,The best part about Cabot were the benefits. The work was dull and a few of the people ruined the feeling of it being a good place to work. I would only recommend Cabot to people who are willing to deal with the hierarchy and really really really want to work with materials.
good,It was a good paying job and the labor wasn't terrible. Unfortunately being a Contract worker there wasn't the greatest and the swing shifts took a toll. The job overall gave me a stronger work ethic and taught me what more serious companies want to see in their employees.
good,"Its a good company to have balance between family and work time. Although everyday is a challenge and learn new things, however if you work effectively the award is given to you"
good,"You are not allowed to think outside the box there. Procedures for everything. Rules don't apply for everyone. Didn't want to leave , but production manager is awful. That is politely as a can say it."
good,"Cabot was a great place to work. The indeed had work life balance with flexible hours. Unfortunatly, the company decided to outsource some departments overseas."
good,"•Manager of a team in support of all manufacturing processes.  "
good,Not bad place Ville Platte is not where you want to live if not from there.
good,"good company, good health coverage, heavy work loads, have to log on from at home after you leave for the day to keep up. have to depend on other dept. to complete your job, which gets you behind."
good,This cabot corporation is good and also it has very good tema work and work culture all employees are good to work with and very helpful in learning the organization
good,Upper Management has good handle on the product lines. Work at the plant is easy going in my role. There are other department managers that take their jobs way too seriously and their workers suffer for it. Some of the other departments have poor work life balance. The Capital department is great though and I enjoy my work but I would be hard pressed to take another role in the plant due to poor management of facility
good,"Great work place environment, where employees are shown a great of respect regardless what level you are level in the organisation. Clean, pleasant, friendly culture."
good,"OK company, doesn't do anything without months of review. Fairly bureaucratic from the top down. If you want to work at a place that is slow moving, this would be a good place."
good,Shift work requires 12 hour shift with high expectations of fast quality analysis results.
good,I worked at their production plant since 2008. Very busy and friendly environment when theres jobs. The company says they invest in their employees and help them grow in the company but not so much when me amd a couple other individuals that worked their as long as i have. I applied for multiple positions within the company to advance my skills but they ended up hiring someone from the outside. Would only go back if they hired me direct thru the company and up my pay rate to $40 per hour. Wasted 5 years of my life there.
good,9-5 work day. Management strongly believes in PM and values a strong safety first culture.
good,Normal work day consists of being at work at about 6:30 am or pm depending of what shift you’re on. Days or nights. 12 hour shifts 7-7 2 weeks a month.
good,"Very much to be learned at Cabot Ohio river . "
good,"Great company , I was blessed to have this job ,I was able to work my way through the ranks to get to the position I wanted the most .I just needed a change after thirty years in the chemical plants ."
good,Working for Cabot has allowed me to develop the skills and knowledge I possess today to be a successful Buyer. Management provides ongoing support and guidance. Overall culture is positive and nurturing.
good,"I was a working production supervisor during a labor dispute with the union."
good,I loved my job there an the people where respectful an always helpful. Cabot Corporation is also very safe environment to work also management was very strong on being aware of your CO2 monitors they trained very well on the forklift and the scissor lift they also was very family-oriented
good,"Cabot is a global manufacturer of specialty chemicals, with more than 40 manufacturing plants worldwide.  It is headquartered in Boston, in the Seaport District.  The company has been in business for approximately 130 years."
good,"Procurement has a high turnover, might be due to the workload distribution.  Process are cumbersome, as they have several levels of approvals and its also repetitive.  Limits are lower than industry standards as well."
good,"Cabot corporation was a fine place to work. The Georgia facilities office housed HR, IT , and some other functions. They were very conscious of safety within the office."
good,"In general, it's a nice company to work in, very good at keeping people safe in the research environment. "
good,Do not wish to leave a full review - Cabot Corporation is a leading global specialty chemicals and performance materials company and are a good company to work for.
good,Actively involved in financial research. Figured out which career path I want to go down.
good,"-Flexible work schedule"
good,I was hired to define and champion and implement badly needed equipment and process upgrades in a well worn and dilapidated plant.  Plant management was very supportive as were onsite Project Engineering and Maintenance Groups.  Everyone was interested in doing a good job and maintaining the plant.
good,"I worked at the Haverhill facility for over 10 years, the safety culture is amazing but at times exaggerated. the team was amazing, helpful. Management, on the other hand, is too controlling the amount of micromanagement is ridiculous."
good,"A convivência na empresa era muito boa;"
good,"Overnight travel 50%  large region, 25-30% administrative work, Selling premium product in a very price competitive market.  Good customer relationships."
good,Over all Cabot Corp is a solid company to work for but for the upcoming future I unfortunately need to seek other employment that has more of a solid base for me and my family.
good,"It has been a very long time when I worked at Cabot Corporations' R&D in Tuscola, IL. "
good,"I worked in Boston for Cabot at their corp. offices in the Seaport District.  The staff and most of the management were professional, top notch hardworking people who knew that Cabot was a great place to work.  It is. "
good,"Very professional company, not that much room for upward growth in my department. Friendly coworkers, who are always willing to work with you on things and help to support your projects. Decent flexibility in terms of working hours and working remotely."
good,Started out as a dependable job. Trained in several areas. Received safety training regularly. Troubleshooting was expected regularly even on new equipment.
good,"with limited opportunities, very nice colleagues, However, very poor work life balance. most importantly, do not see much opportunities to advance your career. "
good,Focus on completing assigned tasks within 8.5 hrs. Management is very approachable and eager to share expertise with even interns. It is a very friendly environment within a hierarchical structure.

good,"Ran machinery and also worked in the maintenance department. Learned a lot about safety, chemicals and working with metals."
good,I was a co-op in the performance materials department under Mike Morris. I interfaced a lot between the lab and the scientists who requested experiments and data. I also learned a lot of VBA programming in Excel. I even had my own office as a co-op.
good,"Cabot is a leading specialty chemical and materials firm.  As such, it is highly dependent upon the ""value add"" proposition gaining traction to the customer.  This business model, when applied universally, translates to better margins especially in growth markets seeking more efficient product solutions.  However, in a stagnant World economy as we are currently experiencing, customer decisions shift to overweight economics compared to value.  This paradigm will over time lead to purchasing decisions being viewed as more commodity based especially in price sensitive markets such as energy.  "
good,Worked on the filler machine. Filled packets with black carbon. Package and get it ready for shipping.
good,"It is not for nothing that the average years of service is 18 yrs for a plant with 105 employees. It feels like working with relatives, We have 2 cases of a grand father, father and son  (3 generations) working in the company."
good,"I process 1590 – 1700 invoices monthly.  Though many people find change difficult to handle, I understand how to handle it with ease. We have a very fast paced environment and I understand how to navigate the changes and provide high quality work.  Over the 12 years I continue to remain nimble and adapt to changing circumstances.    I find it easy to be energetic and ready to start work in the morning. I have strong motivation in my responsibilities throughout the day. As the AP lead I work to keep a positive attitude and help motivate others in my department to do the same.  My attitude toward positive change is one of enthusiasm, and I consistently put forth an effort to improve myself and my surroundings."

good,Light maintenance and repair work. Not a long term career just something to pay the bills while I was in between school
good,"The culture was welcoming and friendly. Good learning environment for an engineering internship, with plenty of opportunities to learn on the job. Would recommend considering a summer internship for undergraduate engineers."
good,"A typical day is either being bored out of your mind or work at a very fast pace. You could have 20 things that need to be accomplished in an hour to having 0 things to do all twelve hours. I have tried to become more proficient at time management. The management here is alright. My crew we all work as a team, so this is good. The hardest part of the job is not having enough people to do the job. This company follows the less is more style of tactics. The most enjoyable part of the job is the days off."
good,"Bom relacionamento com  colegas ;  facilidade  nas  idéias de  inovação ."
