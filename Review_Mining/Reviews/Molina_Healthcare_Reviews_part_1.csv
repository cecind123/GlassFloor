rating,review
bad,Worst working environment I ever experienced. Was told by the plan president and corporate office to create false documentation and submit the false documentation to the state of California
bad,I would not recommend to my worst enemy. Hire unskilled manager who you have to train .Upper Management need to come and train know all aspects  of health care.
bad,"No other word to describe it, but trash. None had education and were only in their positions due to tenure so anyone with a degree was a threat to them."
bad,Scare tactics and narcissism is what you’ll face working at Molina since the first rounds of layoffs a few years back. No work life balance. Management are promoted when they should be front line staff.
bad,Worst job ever pay was below average micromanaged staff very unprofessional high turn over rate low morale training was poor I would never recommend anyone applying company as a whole is a joke
bad,This is an extremely stressful position with very few rewards or room for growth. Our unit was a staff of 26 and it has been reduced to less than 13 agents with the same amount of work coming in for a fully staffed dept. (i.e.  about 800-1200 cases per month). There is no consistency with departmental policy and procedure. No cohesiveness with interdepartmental units working towards a common goal.
bad,"I have worked there for 3 years and truly feel like just a number. Not a person. Quick to criticize - never ever compliment. They want want and want and never give back. I loved speaking and helping members, but in Molina’s direction get the members on and off the phone as quickly as possible!  However, they preached being emphatic, but they really don’t mean it."
bad,This company is going down the tubes and is solely money driven. They lie to their employees. They expect you to do a job without proper training. They change your job with no new job description so you have no idea how to do your job properly yet get reprimanded when you don't.
bad,"Nothing good to say, not recommended at all! Abusing of employees poor and not prepared superior! No knowledge of basic computer skill! Not fair competition between workers!"
bad,"Shady managers and I have never seen a healthcare  place who does not care about their employees health. They just care about your body in that chair taking calls. The managers often disappear to so called meetings at the highest volume of the day. If a caller want a manager, good luck finding one. I would not recommend working there. Enter at your own risk you have been informed. If you do work there, PRAY!!!!!"
bad,"Molina Fires all employees for the failings of Executives. They will layoff entire departments that are essential to the company to appease stockholders. You will never get a promotion, and if you do, it's so they can blame and fire you."
bad,"No longer stands by their mission ""One Molina""."
bad,"The work load is stressful but easy. Organizing does not exist in this location . Good luck with contacting the HR department, they are hard to contact."
bad,"I worked for this company for a year and half, they were unorganized the whole time I was there. I had 3 different supervisor because they would quit. I worked as a Member Services and we had the responsibility of taking calls from 5 different states which was too much information to remember for one person."
bad,Please don’t waste your time. Management is run by idiots that hardly know how to do their on job because of all the turn over happening at that place. Good pay though just a miserable environment
bad,"Place is completely disorganized, not enough training, as a LTC case manager your would have to figure the job on your own. Awful place to work. At the interview, they would tell you that you are allow to work overtime. However, they will not approve you any over time, even if you request it. You would have to go through many hoops to get your job done. Even though you are able to work from home, its not worth it."
bad,"There's a reason this company always appears on contract positions.  Personally had (2) separate RN CCM contracts that ended badly.  1st was a 3 month CCM cancelled on the Friday before a Monday start; supposedly decided to hire within.  2nd was an 8-week CCM, arrived on a Monday.  Manager unaware, a laptop not ready because their IT lockup over the weekend and no one had keys to access.  Spent the day on a PC watching company videos.  Returned Tuesday, no manager, no one in charge on the floor and all were clueless.  Called my agency contact person who could not reach anyone.  Contract cancelled and no back up plan available elsewhere.  "
bad,"If I had a choice, I would never work for Molina again. They treat their customers poorly and their staff worse. I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy."
bad,"I never heard what I did good, always bad, a lot of backstabbing immature people, a lot of games played by the workers. the environment was very negative"
bad,"Just a scam!!! "
bad,"I couldn't get up to stretch, it was difficult to go use the restroom and was told to skip my breaks a few times to answer calls. Members needed answers on their prescriptions and was hard to get a hold of a team member to assist. It was very frustrating as I wanted to help out frustrated members i felt helpless sometimes."
bad,"Despiden masivamente empleados sin importar el tiempo de servicio  (algunos con mas de 10 anos de servicio), te ofrecen un empleo fijo y posteriormente, sin notificacion alguna, te la rechazan y no te enteras hasta que llegas a trabajar y te encuentras la sorpresa. No hay seriedad con los empleados. Estabilidad laboral? Ninguna. Cuando menos te imaginas, te dan lay off. No recomiendo trabajar en esta compania."
bad,"They lie and tell you that you are part of the family, not true. They don't care if your child is sick and have a doctors note for missing it counts against you. Most supervisor (about 90%) are manipulative and get agents to do most of their job but prepare to NOT get paid for it much less appreciated. There are fights in the building all the time and the ambulance is constantly getting called every other week due to people passing out. You cannot disconnect on a customer even if they are cussing you out. Be prepared to put this JOB before your family and health."
bad,"Expected to had a caseload of 250 members. Had to go to peoples homes, hospitals, nursing homes and conduct phone assessment while being expected to hit certain goals that we unobtainable due to lack of staffing!"
bad,Very cliquey. If you want to help people this is not the company to work for. Worst company I’ve ever worked for.  Management has favorites and those are the people the fakest brown nosers. They are not sincere at all. Please don’t apply to work there you will regret it.
bad,slow pace work days not always having a set thing to do. Always getting calls more of complaints about things that are done on a patients medical account that they may have not wanted.
bad,"Upper Management treats employees disrespectfully, very unprofessional. There is no good employee appreciation, too much favoritism, no place for growth or advancement. Hostile environment especially after the lay offs. Remaining employees have lost interest and incentive to go to work. Seniority is not taken in consideration. Unprofessional environment overall, very disappointing."
bad,Poor communication with changes in job role poor management no place for advancement unless you get along with management or know anyone in higher position.
bad,"* Typical work day: Stressful 8-5 position that didn't allow overtime.  "
bad,Worst place anyone could work. Upper management refused to listen to complaints. I would not recommend anyone to work under the leadership I did. Many clients that were not truthful about the assets or abilities.
bad,I only worked at Molina for a short amount of time. I did not stay as the offer that I accepted was very different than what I was required to work once I started
bad,"the company is unorganized, don't know what they are doing day by day, not sure it will be around another year. It started out a good company to work for then went down hill."
bad,"It's typical call center environment going off a point system for absences. When I needed time off to take care of a family member, I provided all FMLA paperwork and got denied even though the family member also worked there on the same floor. It was very discouraging and management is terrible. Inconveniencing them was like you'd stolen thousands of dollars from them. There was also a huge lack of professionalism among the ""tenured"" employees who were assigned as floor support. I wouldn't recommend it there."
bad,Molina is not a good place to work. The new upper management sucks. They are horrible people who doesn't care about the low level staff. Stay away from this employer.
bad,"Don't work here. This job cost my my family. People with the same experience as me, made 10k more a year. They have lost their contract and are done in NM December 31. I could say so much more, but I think I have said enough."
bad,Every month employees fear about  getting pink slips. Not worth to work in this company.Very stressful environment.Most of the middle and senior management are not very professional.
bad,"The senior management is pathetic. It used to be much better earlier, but with the new restructuring everything is upside down here.Don't join this company if you are looking for a good career."
bad,"very busy office"
bad,2 counties responsibility to drive increased to 3 counties after hire. New State program was not at all organized so that workers could complete job duties.
bad,This is by far the worst place I have ever worked. No wonder they lost so much money and had to lay off. The management is awful. Heaven forbid you disagree with them they break all sorts of laws and retaliate against you. I have 3 EEOC complaints with this company in process now.
bad,There is a lack of direction and appreciation from leadership. Typically all requests are considered urgent. Working in that type of environment does not allow one to put thoughtful consideration into anything.
bad,"I worked at the Molina Healthcare in Boise, Id. "
bad,There was an out break of fleas in the office and everyone was getting bitten. No one did anything about it and it was very unfair they did not care for our health. Disgusting company!!
bad,"No talking allowed, unhappy employees, slow paced very boring job, all the employees I worked with left after I did.  nothing enjoyable about the job what so ever"
bad,"Working for this job is just terrible you have no place for advancement, you're working a lot to get little pay. Management is the worse they keep promises that can't even keep. Managers don't even last that long I swear you meet new ones every couple of weeks. They keep hiring so many people that don't even know much I wonder if they even learned anything in training?"
bad,"Unprofessionalism is in abundance... Beware. Our training was insufficient, literally our entire class was working off ONE laptop for the first 3 days (training is only 5 days), then we finally got into a proper training room with enough computers for everyone. The ""trainer"" always had an attitude and only taught us how to navigate the database.... No scenarios! When I got to the floor, I pretty much taught myself everything she didn't."
bad,This place is a very hard place to work at. It's all about micro managing here. Even if ur sick and have to go to the dr it doesn't matter to them.
bad,"Worked at corporate headquarters. Nepotism is rampid throughout the company. Most leaders/head of departments have received their title because they are married, related to, or friends of the Molina's.  Myself and my team were repeatedly harassed by our manager. Multiple HR reports were filed but nothing was ever taken seriously.  I left the company due to a hostile work environment."
bad,Bad management. Secretary on that dept is very rude. Not professional. No equality. They want you to work on 60 cases a day. Meaning 8 cases an hour. Software that there using is so horrible and slow. Management is not very fair. How can you possibly review a case. And read a note and make a decision when you don't have enough time. That's why the outcome of the audits are bad. They want to implement rules that are impossible to do. But they don't want to be audited. There is no appreciation on that dept. I hope they will change the management on that dept
bad,"I tried very hard to be friendly to everyone & my being there was not very welcomed by my coworkers. It made me very uncomfortable at this job. I was not welcomed by my coworkers and they were not very helpful when I had questions. Management did not listen to my concerns when I spoke to them about this and at one point I felt like I was not safe there but after their so called investigation about the person that got in my face, I was told it was because I was trying to hard to fit in with my coworkers so I was told by upper management, that I should not speak to anyone of my coworkers, not even to say good morning, which made the situation very unbearable. I eventually got so worn down from this emotionally and felt my only option was to leave. It's very hard for me to leave a job because I always try to give 150% at any job I take on. I'm not one to speak anything negative towards the company but this job by far, was THE WORST JOB I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE, it just didn't work out for me. The job itself I loved doing what I was doing there but the environment and treatment from some of the people made it very hard for me to do my job, when I couldn't get the help from my coworkers I would ask for help but they would not want to help me, I STILL did not get the help from my immediate supervisor. So, it got too overwhelming and that is what lead to me decision to leave. If you were not in good with the management, they very much had their favorites and it was very clear they picked them over me, even though I was doing my job very well."
bad,"No room to grow, pay was low with no raises. Very hard to keep happy without growth at Molina Healthcare. I would never go back."
bad,"A terrible place to work, corporate paying off meedicaid hospital claims with proper auth. Management definetly needs help! Unexperienced, how can you have a manager of a department who is 26yrs of age????????????/"
bad,"This company should be treated like a relationship. It's all good at first and everything is going smoothly, and they get you to really like this ""company"" vision that they've completely fabricated. Then oh I'd say about a year later you start to really get to know the company, and realize they don't care about you at all. They do things for the employees...usually holidays only, and that's only because there's an employee committee. Otherwise, they wouldn't care. They tell you about how they like to promote within, yet they will pass over someone who has the knowledge and skill to get the job done and chose someone that has personality and can make them laugh. Hope those laughs can meet deadlines. Also, the management team is HORRIBLE!! They care about themselves and themselves only, they give you ridiculous deadlines and say that they're just telling you what ""they have to""..when they know it's unrealistic themselves. The management will distribute their work to other employees and sit in their offices and do nothing all day. Overall, this is a HORRIBLE place to work. Their corporate office needs to actually listen to the employees and read these reviews....maybe then they'd see that their little ""picture of perfection"" is smudged."
bad,If new management comes in they bring there own people.  If you know the Molina kids then you have a chance to survive.  Everyone else what out.  Senior managers do what they want and they can get away with it.  DO NOT work here. 
bad,"Poor management, luck of training and poor work division."
bad,Management was the worse no help whatsoever. There was a lot of favoritism and you dont have work and life balance it's nonexistent.the pay is not that good for the mess that you have to go thru. No room for advancement unless you are in good with the management Basically this company is everything you dont want in a company. In addition to the horrible benefits and low pay you dont have job security and if you have a disability or an ongoing illness fyi the insurance doesn't cover pre existing illness. You wont find that out until you get a bill for it in the mailing. Im giving all who reads this fair warning do not apply for this company you will regret it...
bad,"Lots of broken promises, horrible colleagues will throw you under the bus in a heartbeat. I would not recommend working here unless you are desperate. Run away !!"
bad,Staff there is expected to work more than 40 hrs per week at minimal wage possible. Employees barely meet 50% market ratio! Poor work force management that under estimates call center call volume and struggle to meet contractual service levels. The struggles to meet the agreements are then placed on the hands of the employees with over time and low pay wages. Management in the call center are a bunch of women that are like the movie mean girls. It’s a breakfast club where you must be friends with them and kiss their butts in order to move up and promote.
bad,Molina healthcare is setting a trend in managed care witb its employees. They do not value their employes nor do they valie rhe employees time. As a senior level salary employee i am disgusted at the practices of Molina Healthcare MS. Neputism at its finest. If yoir family doesnt qork there you dont get anywhere.
bad,"Can't discuss at this current time, but will if needed during any interviews over the phone or in person. I believe every person and organization has room for growth and improvement, Molina has a lot to work on."
bad,"This company has supervisors and above that are not qualified. Promotions are on a ""who you know"" or ""who you've made yourself known to"" basis.   No requirement of good people skills or experience.  Molina is racist against whites as well.   Beware,  seems good on the surface. "
bad,Micro management and little communication amongst leadership has led to very low team moral. The pay is decent but I wouldn’t recommend this company for anyone who is looking for a mostly positive work environment.  There have been many lay offs within this past year and lots of turn over within the higher management.  The company seems unstable and untrustworthy at this time.
bad,"Since restructuring and firing Dr. Molina's sons the company has lost sight of Dr. Molina's vision of affordable quality healthcare for our most vulnerable members.  Focus now is on profit and not on what is in the best interest for the Member. Corporate wide layoffs have resulted in low morale and disorganized, overworked departments."
bad,"A lot of work, not enough ppl to help.  Molina has started laying off ppl due to poor service to their providers. Providers are no longer accepting Molina patients due to unpaid bills."
bad,"I struggled working as a salaried employee in this location. The company decided to promote from outside, which did significant damage. I interim as a manager, however, was not financially compensated for the extra work. Their support staff are far under paid, providers overworked. Patient care is sacrificed regularly."
bad,"Raise amount received $0.15. Yes, that right, only $0.15. "
bad,"I have never had such backstabbing from so called professionals. It really is a shame how disconnected they were from their employees. Overworking us,  no compensation and no adherence to any polices. If you are applying with them and you last 6 months congratulations you are one of the few. Overall moral would make the owners very disappointed this is the company they created!"
bad,"Poor training, incompetent managers. A bunch of women in charge that act like high school gossips and bullies. Frequently singled out people, sabotaging their work, unrealistic case loads. Catty nasty women hating on new comers. If your were not part of their Mormon cliques your job was miserable.."
bad,Do not take work for this company. They do not care about you as a person. Their only concern is numbers.  Management is horrible.  And the turn over rate is HIGH.  Run don't walk past a ad if hiring .
bad,"I worked there full-time for 4 years. Leadership is ineffective. There is blatant discrimination throughout the company. The morale of Maine employees is at an all time low, rather than trying to improve it, they just ignore it. Good employees are leaving. HR representation is a joke. Molina does not care about its employees, their only focus is onthe money. They literally drove me out with a bully boss and created a hostile work environment for everyone in my department."
bad,"This is one of the worst places I have ever worked. They do not follow to culture of the organization to any degree however claim to care about the employees. They have no morals and you can't trust your supervisors. The daily activities consist of people throwing whoever they can under the bus to cover themselves because they have no idea what they are doing. Leadership does not pay attention to staff and has no idea what is really going on and have little to no professionalism to speak of. It’s a hectic, high stress, toxic environment for all the wrong reasons. While the management sit around gossiping and making the big bucks, they hand off all the real hard work to the employees."
bad,"This company micro manages their employees. You need to meet a daily/ monthly quota of in and outbound calling (bothering) members. Should you not meet their quotas as they set unrealistic goals, they will bully you, give you warnings, write you up. You have no time for breaks or lunches but you have to take them. Most nurses there are on some type of anti-depressant, anti-anxiety or adderall to help with the stress and makes that is an unpleasant un- healthy company to work for."
bad,Everyone needs the same rules. Mbrs are 1st but they don't care employees. Co workers don't work together. It's to bad. Feel for the mbrs. Things needed are not not given.
bad,"About 10 years ago, I was terminated for the most flimsiest reasons possible. The Corporate Security Department was going through some major turnover due to the poor management skills of the (then) Director of Corporate Security. Come to find out (years later) that the Director was purposefully terminating team members to then higher family members to replace them. Thankfully, she was discovered and was terminated as well"
bad,"just... just don't do it... this place is terrible. They say the fish rots from the head and this is exactly that... its so f*kin top heavy....for instance .. they have one clinic left in their entire company... this clinic has three managers, not one of them can work the closing shift. Its embarrassing, but you know whats really embarrassing? the voucher program they put there employees on passing it off as healthcare. they ought to be ashamed of themselves to be a healthcare company that basically rips their workers off on healthcare...shame...this place is toxic.. run."
bad,I would not refer anyone for positions at Molina. Management team is not very helpful. Staff is isolated if you are not part of the in crowd. Work load is overwhelming with unrealistic ideas of success. My opinion Molina needs a whole new management team & Start over
bad,The management is all over the place and disorganized. Management is lost and has no clue what we do which makes for a frustrating and at times hostile work environment. I learned a lot in the years I have been at molina but this is not a career position. Cincinnati staff is treated like the outcast because the main office is in columbus. So there is no room for growth don't let them lie to you like they lied to me.....
bad,People that worked at Molina were fine; but the Service Desk Management created a hostile work environment where is was hard to go into work each and every day. I can not recommend this company; as I was poorly treated.
bad,management  could use a lot of additional training and the job ciulture itself may improve.But ovaall Molina is in need of a business makeover. I tried to grin and bear it for 4 years.I now feel its time for a career change.
bad,It's a poorly managed company as said by many others and it trickles down to every department.  Human resources was the worst they are 100% comany/department oriented not employee oriented at all.  Job advancements are based on how well your liked or how much of a brown noser you are. I was truly excited when I started here years ago because of Dr Molinas core values but after working there first hand you see how little care and compassion is shown for the employees that work there. It's all about numbers and everyone is replaceable
bad,"Molina states its mission is to help members of government programs (paraphrased).  But that is a smoke-screen.  Their real mission collectively is to hold on to as much of their money and assets as possible.  Individually, the mission is cut-throat, dog eat dog, every man for himself."
bad,"Stressful Unprofessional. The Mission and Value once meant a great deal to the company, however somewhere down the line it all got lost. I pray one day they find it again."
bad,"With lot of layoffs, there is much uncertainty here. Not the best place to work currently. Unclear directions from management making it worse. Many good resources were let go."
bad,"Senior leadership are not transparent about company's current situation. Too many promises from managers that were not fulfilled or retracted. Low starting salary that was supposed to be reviewed next annual check which was later denied as the hire date happened after the month of October and, again was not reviewed the next year as the company was going through RFP process. Very low job security at this time period at Molina since positions are cancelled regardless of employees' performance as the company is going through restructuring."
bad,"Never treated fairly, worked 60+ hours every week. Favoritism is how individuals advance within the company and how your compensation is determined. The current restructure of the company is now led by corporate greed. The company does not care about their employees."
bad,"Supervisor was so stressed to get her work done, she had no time to help the CRC's under her, it was like, good luck! No supervisor support at all. Very discouraging!"
bad,No one from the Corporate Office even cares about the complaints. The turn over in the company office in Detroit is so fast because of the terrible leadership.
bad,"This is by far the worst place I have EVER worked. The leadership team picks and chooses who they like and who they don't. They pick and choose who they wrote"
bad,I  experienced this organizations has larger issues that are not recognized until a complicate is documented. Certain issues are never to be mentioned or you  are fired.
bad,"I was very happy to be a part of this successful organization founded in California. I was there for 3 years. The department where I was at had very unrealistic production requirements and the leads and supervisors have no management skills. They do not mentor. It feels like you are always being watched by a prison warden. They do not care if you can't meet your production because you are taking phone calls back to back because there are always staff on scheduled and unscheduled PTO. They only care about you meeting their numbers. There is no reasoning with them. Even if the department is short-staffed, there is a system problem, department meetings which take away from your time to do your production, they do not care. They will still expect you to meet production. Even when there is not enough work for distribution, and you ask your supervisor for work, the supervisor will not assist you and yet she will expect you to still meet production. I work with a lot of providers on the phones and processing referrals on a daily basis. I know that the people I dealt with outside the company and provided customer service to are very satisfied in the way I handled their issues. I listened and I resolved their issues. "
bad,"I learned that being paid well does not equal job satisfaction. Senior leadership is completely about the bottom line, no matter what and even at the expense of those who they say they serve. Good mission statement, but not followed. No opportunity for advancement  and no job security."
bad,"Poor leadership, low morale, abusive managers. Awful place to work. Good money but not worth the nightmare. They fire people quick and without warning. Concerned with the bottom line first and patient care last. Every healthcare organization in the area are aware of how bad Molina is - most providers refuse to accept Molina insurance as they are notorious for denying claims and if they eventually pay the provider it is at a fraction of what the actual cost is and is paid 6-12 months late. Do not work for this company."
bad,I am not happy here. I am looking for an opportunity that will allow me to THRIVE and be successful. Hopefully I will find the opportunity that I am looking for. I clearly have not found it in my current role.
bad,"Worked at Molina in Oakbrook,Il.  Sat for 16 weeks.....yes 16 weeks with no training, nothing assigned for me to do.  Asked mgr daily for work was told after training.  When asked when that would me she just shrugged.  During my 6 months of employment, the entire team of Director/ assistant director/quality director turned over TWICE. Medical director made fun of members in team meetings. Had to finally leave, no training, no mgr support, no ethics.  Went to HR regarding no work, no training, and was told it was my fault not to have sought training on my own.  Did read 17 novels while I was there.  The state of Illinois is broke, if all contractors are like Molina, Illinois will remain broke"
bad,"I worked as a senior software engineer and had been seeing a very high turnout rate, people leaving in less than 4 months."
bad,"The Member Assessment department is the most horrible place any LVN can work. There is favoritisms and family ties. Family members working in the same department under same management. Micromanagement!!! In staff meetings they clearly tell you restroom breaks should not exceed 5 min. The supervisor is the worst!! She’s worse then Hitlar. The amount of people who come and go is shocking. People quit withing 2 weeks of beings there, that should tell you alot. The expectations and goals are ridiculous PTO approval is based on how much your liked."
bad,La compañía luego que contrato a un grupo de enfermeros para auditoría que muchos dejamos trabajos que teníamos permanentemente por todas los beneficios y salario competitivo que nos ofrecieron. Un día convocaron una reunión y despidieron al departamento completo efectivo ese mismo día. Nos votaron en plena época de navidad sin consideración poco humana. Eso causo un daño emocional.
bad,They do not want to hear what needs fixing within this company. Management only wants to keep drawing their salary. Some work very hard while others do nothing. According to who you know is how you are treated not what your capabilities are and what you contribute.
bad,"Everything is about making $, even if it means taking services from the patient. Nursing/benefit assessments are questioned and changed based on what the supervisors want the patients to have, even though supervisors don’t physically see patients. Managers do not back you up. They criticize and threaten you frequently"
bad,"When Molina first started they were a Great company to work for.  Over time with poor leadership, and continuing to hire unqualified worker and leadership allowed to hire their friends that were unqualified."
bad,"This company is very unorganized. You will never get a straight answer on your questions. You’ll have to figure out which one is correct. You’re left with a bunch of angry customers with questions that you won’t be able to answer. Short staffed in almost every single department but refuse to fire people but will hire in groups. They either never give raises or they never do. They take advantage of the employees and don’t even give you the option to decide, they make decisions for you"
bad,"The “drinking buddies” get promoted while those with real talent, knowledge and are actually advocating for the members and being good stewards of the money get held back. So sad!! It used to err on the side of the member, not anymore. The members mean NOTHING to the “new Molina” other than an way to get more money.  I was there 10 years and saw a lot!!"
bad,"Call Center environment "
bad,"Poor management don’t work here run away! They have a lot  favoritism. If you bring their coffee you’re in their fav group. Little pay for the workload they give you. Only communication is via email a fake smile in person every now and then for your one on one."
bad,"If you want to work at a job that is stressful, poor training with a lack of job security, Molina is your place! Cliques and groups working strategically in a clandestine manner for job security; fighting for a position.  Management is not supportive nor available to provide their team with the  necessary tools needed to do your job. Raises are giving their favorites."
bad,"I learned about Medicaid which was a positive but my overall experience was not very good. Management was biased and played favorites, which made it hard for career advancement."
bad,"The worst job I've ever had.  Bad morality, bad management, bad time.  I hated going to work every single day.  I worked for jerks. Just miserable.  I hear the company has lost its contract and has lost its ceos"
bad,"Did not enjoy working at Molina, micro managed, only saw the 4 walls of the cubicle, calls were back to back, Molina does not pay there providers on time."
bad,High expectations to be knowledgeable in Healthcare field straight out of training in short period of time and in an unorganized workplace specifically management.
bad,"I took this job with the understanding that I would have autonomous responsibility and that didn't happen. My job turned out to be a lot of copy and pasting without a lot of decision-making. "
bad,Executive and Upper management does not have a handle on the company which has led to numerous layoffs.  Many projects that would benefit the customers were cut.
bad,"Company is going through huge layoffs and the whole atmosphere is extremely stressful with only people close to management getting a change to stay, run away while you can. People who have stayed behind are all close friends on Management and they are more interested in leeching this company for their benefit. Find something else and you will be better off."
bad,"Molina used to be an amazing place to work. But once out went corporate,  it all changed.  I hated the work environment! They are a racist, lying company. This company drains the life out of you, and then spits you put, like your worth nothing!"
bad,"If your not part of management then watch out. Management  does a lot of favoring.. hopefully you speak Spanish cuz if you don't you have no chance.. you will be hired for one position and work  a position that is a no brainer.. welcome calls an 18 year old kid can do... having 10 years experience in the business and then end up reading from a script  and using the dialer that doesn't even work right to reach patients.. patients get very angry after we've called them 10 times in 1 month to see of they have any questions regarding their benfits..,what a joke...their system sucks and the people trying to be in charge have no idea.. a friend has her medical assistance license  interviews and doesn't get a call back for the member services position  but they ended up hiring someone e who worked as a grocery bagger and couldn't even send email before coming to Molina... this place is a joke!"
bad,"I worked for Molina 2 different times, as CM and disease mgt. Thought the second time would be better.  Started well but no job security for nurses in Spokane, WA office.  Typical cubi-land job, hideous corp. management.  Loved co-workers-committed and fun but always battles against corp. No respect for nurses...also lots of battles between Spokane/Bothell offices.  They talk a good game but"
bad,"Stay away if you are knowledgeable, honest and have integrity.  Terrible place to work.  Lots of nepotism.  Unfair hiring practices.  The concept of what they have for the company is very different with what is implemented."
bad,"Siting in a cubicle for prolonged periods of time. Did not learn anything. No training was provided. Poor Management. New supervisor did not answer my questions properly. Co-workers were ""too busy"" stated that the were not trainers. The hardest part of the job was trying to get answer to my questions. After 19 days, my computer and phone were not set up, They expected me to do my work without the proper applications and training. The worst place to work. if you want to keep your sanity...stay away from this company."
bad,"This is one of the worst places I have ever worked. They do not follow to culture of the organization to any degree however claim to care about the employees. The daily activities consist of people throwing whoever they can under the bus to cover themselves because they have no idea what they are doing. Leadership doesn’t pay attention to staff and have no idea what is really going on and have little to no professionalism to speak of. It’s a hectic, high stress, toxic environment for all the wrong reasons."
bad,"This was my first LVN job and was super excited to get hired. Excitement quickly turned into hating going to work everyday. As an LVN Health Assessor, they expect you to meet quotas for phone calls made and health assessments completed"
bad,"Not an overall positive experience . Worked there as a contract employee and job description kept changing. Management changed often too, hard to keep up with the changes"
bad,"They hire for there open enrollment season, tell you lies, then lay you off, training is hard for marketplace, they really only car about there Medicaid reps, marketplace is easy once you get the hang of it, but once the season is over, you might as well start looking for another job, it will get slow, and they will let you go"
bad,Molina has gone from an enjoyable family company to a ruthless corporation. Work/life balance is no longer an option and accountability is nonexistent. Move on!
bad,"Extremely disorganized.  After four months still couldn't get all the tools and equipment I needed for the job.   Literally had no place for  meetings or private conversations.  Had to run around with a  laptop which didn't work properly trying to get tasks done.  "
bad,"MHC is a very competitive place, it absolutely takes the cake on favoritism. They post jobs and send it company wide and people apply thinking they will have a chance at moving up, reality is behind the scenes they already made selections. If you are one that likes to kiss butt this is the place for you, they will send you on Starbucks runs, pick up supervisor lunches, you can come in as you please and most important is that those who actually work get the short end of the stick and never move up. Very unhappy place to be at. They build teams that make no sense as other departments are failing. Stay clear from here."
bad,"Money money money - that is their was primary concern and desire"
bad,I would like to say I have never worked in a more hostile environment in my life. The management was horrible. I was a employee who worked very hard. I basically never had a supervisor to train me properly. I was never given any feedback on my work. And on one Monday evening while still working in the office after work hours. I get a call telling me I was being terminated and my services were no longer needed. I have tried calling both the corporate office and others regional offices requesting to connected to or to be given the phone number for HR. The only thing I got was hung up on and given misinformation. My supervisor went as far as making up a false reason for my termination. At the end of the day temporarily workers are also human beings and deserve to be treated as such.
bad,Project nickel destroyed everything good about Molina. When the Brothers got ousted the company stopped caring about its employees. Even their health insurance for employees is awful as of 2018.
bad,"They do not know, at any IT level, what they are doing, or where they are going.  Their upper and middle management are clueless.  No leadership.  No direction.  No guiding methods or processes."
bad,Worked my job helping clients all across the USA. Management did not appreciate a person that knew the job and came faithfully to daily make a difference. it was a difficult company to work for
bad,Workplace culture was poor .  Had to work several hours of overtime and still could not complete job task. Often was not compensated for overtime and consistently did not get reimbursed for travel. Job requirements and expectations changed daily..
bad,"Horrible company!!! No stability. No one knows what they are doing. No one was ever on the same page. The benefits and flexibility is the only decent thing about this company,"
bad,A typical day would be to  work on the different reports assigned to the Analysts. Culture is great. You will meet people from different parts of the continent. It is encouraged. The hardest part is not advancing even when your perform above and beyond.
bad,"A place I don't see myself working there, if we needed to use the restroom you would put yourself on personal but they took it off so if you use the restroom a lot if affects your adherence, so basically if you want to drink water your screwed. member services they dont train you on claims, payment etc and if you dont know you try to call other departments to get help they give you an attitude.you do so much for a member service rep and the wrap uptime is ridiculous. Favoritism is beyond pathetic. I will not recommend ANYONE to work there its horrible. Maybe if all management including workforce was eliminated things will probably run better at Molina. Oh and i forgot you cant get up and stretch because they tell you to sit down. They are strict on the dress code but girls look like they are going to a club."
bad,"hostile working environment...incompetent supervisors and managers. the company overall is a great place to work; however, the managerial staff doesn't provide the tools needed to do your job effectively."
bad,"The job in and of itself is terrific. Spent a great deal of time receiving calls, and inquiries from  Members or Providers. Responsibilities included follow up actions, assisting with questions regarding Primary Care Provider assignments, eligibility, resolving billing issues, prior authorizations, referrals and general questions, and claims examination."
bad,"The position was great- felt like I was making a difference in someones' life on a daily basis "
bad,"Stuck in a cubicle, 10-12 hour days with little to no break are needed due to case loads(minimum of 50) and you still won't ever get your work done on time, no training, really poor supervision,strick start times/hours, even though you are salaried, higher pay than a Social Worker usual gets- but not worth the stress and stupidity that you will be working under. CEU opportunity restrictions. Social Workers and RN's are treated differently, with little room for advancement as a Social Worker. Extreme expectations that literally nobody was able to meet, with no room for honest mistakes. No hot water in the restrooms or kitchen sink. Hardest part of job is dealing with very poor leadership, lack of training, and a negative, punitive environment. Restrictive communication in meetings, and with co-workers, ideas are not welcome. Nepotism, top heavy management, supervisors are rude, inappropriate, controlling and love intimidation, retaliation runs rampant, and no support from HR. Best part of the job are the co-workers, IF you are allowed to speak with them. RUUUUUUUUUNNNNNN away from this place fast."
bad,"Sadly, Molina turned out to be a huge disappointment. I was hoping for long-term employment and I found a company that was short-sighted on employee retention. The writing was on the wall when I discovered management had no clue what my orientation schedule was. After one week in Long Beach ""training,"" I was expected to jump into the position with complete knowledge of how to do the job . The problems didn't stop there. While trying to do the impossible, myself and other new recruits were written up for not clearing the queue quick enough. Then we were bounced around from one state health plan to another and expected to know the new state's rules. It was beyond ridiculous. Eventually I went to a different area of the health plan to work and found the worst micromanaging I had ever seen. I thought the poor management I had just witnessed was beyond belief. I don't understand how this company expects to retain quality employees with the way the majority of management treats everyone. They were bosses not leaders. Molina needs to clean house of their management and try again."
bad,"A new doctor cane on board , everything changed . She made racial comments about my apoeatrence and made deragotory comments about me to another employee behind my back ."
bad,"Salary was decent especially for Albuquerque area. No job security, lack of communication and no flexibility. Parking was awful as you had to walk blocks at any time,"
bad,"Having been a manager in many of my job experiences, I would rate Molina at the bottom for managerial effectiveness.  People need validation in order to strive to improve...continuous criticism breeds resentment and low morale."
bad,"Co-workers were very to themselves type of people not willing to open up to new employees, job functions were easy to learn, unrealistic expectations on what you can get done in a day, VERY poor management. Flexible work schedule."
bad,"As a previous employee of the OH Plan, I am greatly disappointed by the SC Plan. I know each State is different, but the treatment of its employees should not be."
bad,"Hired for a job and it was changed. Terrible place to work. Management was horrible, if you went to them whatever you said was used against  I had a medical issue where I couldn’t go into homes anymore.  They basically forced me out instead of finding a new fit for me  I was disappointed because I really liked the pay and working from home"
bad,this job was only good in the beginning then the schedules rotate your stuck in a schedule you don’t like. Managers lie and don’t tell the truth. We do more work then what we are paid.
bad,Molina WAS a great company with a great culture.  Change in CEO leadership has changed impacted the company severely and negatively which is unfortunate.
bad,"Great benefits but micromanaged to death. Unfair unless you are one of the favored ones. Watched a lot of great workers leave over the years due to change in management. Claims manager only cares about herself. She will throw you under the bus if it benefits her or saves her butt. Corporate doesn't care about the employees well-being as long as they get numbers. Work environment is stressful and creates much need for taking ""mental health days."" HR is a joke and no help to employees."
bad,"Typical day at work is completing home visits, performing assessments, coordination of care, completing documentation, phone calls, managing work load"
bad,"Wish I had read the reviews before I hired on there. I've worked for several managed care/health plans and this is the worst company I've had the misfortune to encounter. The original concept and culture associated with the Molina history-how Dr. Molina started it all may exist in California and some of the ""older"" Molina state plans but I don't think he would approve if he had a clue what goes on here. As the company is based in California, it's doubtful the corporate HR group is even aware (or cares) what happens to the Texas employees, though you'd think the number of people that leave--and leave quickly--would set off some red flags somewhere. Even cutting some slack for it being a new contract, the management they've brought in  seem almost clueless as to what any of us actually do on a daily basis. The workflow and job duties change frequently, adding more & more clerical duties yet you are still expected to meet their quota of reviews daily. The level of micro-management topped with incompetent leadership is insane. And no one thinks twice about throwing you under a bus if it makes them look better to a superior--even the medical directors. I did meet and work with some wonderful nurses and coordinators but only a few are left. That's all I will miss-a few really nice people and the pay check."
bad,"Worst place I’ve ever worked! Managers pick favorites and treat everyone differently. The training is a joke and then they throw you onto the phones with no help, they Tell you if you need help to ask but when you ask for help you get a smart mouthed answer or no one was around to even help. Most stressful job I’ve ever had!"
bad,"loved the district manager and other clinic administrators, but the people at corporate were terrible to work with.  They did not support the efforts of the administrators and allowed the directors from Long Beach to micro manage the clinics, overriding administrator efforts"
bad,"Without warning on September 15, 2017, myself, my entire department along with 112 other people were laid off. We were told tgat we can apply for upcoming jobs, which I have but have not been considered for any of them. I loved working there, but losing my job has destroyed me."
bad,Change in management to California and they have no clue how Utah operates successfully.  100 people lost jobs due to this new California management taking over.
bad,I worked for Molina for  almost 4 years and loved it until a position came open that I had worked towards and I was the only one trained in that area and my performance was exceeding expectations yet I was told they would not fill that position and so I was not allowed to apply.  Two days later they promoted new hire secretly and said it was business decision I say it was because I was qualified  but over 40 and they would have had to pay me whereas they didn't the new hire
bad,I am amazed at how unprofessional the 'professionals' are in this company.
bad,"A poorly run company, filled with the undereducated and underskilled, that willfully exploits a broken healthcare system.  Rife with nepotism, political gamesmanship, and blatant self-interest, the focus is rarely on the patient/customer, but instead, the bottom line and self-preservation reign supreme."
bad,From the director of claims all the way down to the team leads no nothing of claims at all!!very unprofessional and supervisors coming in at 11 am or 12 when flex time is over at 9am to 10am..........and logging in on their phones from home having the director of claims thinking shes at her desk
bad,"a lot of calls, you need to be quick. it was kind of fun but also very stressful. you can promote quickly. i haven't worked there in years im sure a lot has changed"
bad,Used to be a good company to work for. Had a better experience working in a different state. Management in South Carolina sucked because half of them didn't belong in management.
bad,No one wants to do their job. All calls go to Member Services but no one in different departments can do their job. We are not allowed to contact supervisors or leads.
bad,"Worst company to ever work for. Never in my life have i seen poor management like the one in the IRVING TX location. "
bad,Molina Healthcare is an alright company to work for. Explaining healthcare benefits to the sickly can present challenges but the work does humble you.  I learned alot about the difference between a MHO and a commercial insurance co .
bad,The company is very unorganized and upper management appears to not know their job functions.
bad,"Management is very poor, they dont believe in its people. We have sick time and PTO, however if you take time off, or you are sick you are discipline because your adherence and you attendance are poor."
bad,"This company would have still been operating in our area if it wasn't for being mismanaged from the top up. There is no work life balance and my caseload was averaging 90 plus members. Their technology was behind the times and we were still using paper care plans and documents that needed to be signed, unlike our competitor who has electronic efficient ways of conducting case management functions. The pay was never adjusted to us who came on board in the beginning. People that were hired after me made 5 k more a year than I did and management was aware of the discrepancy but did nothing to make it fair. Tampa employees had a class action lawsuit against Molina for making us work excessive hours. No one was surprised when Molina did not get the contract for 2019."
bad,"Friends get prompted, skills are irrelevant. Molina's hiring managers dont care about qualifications as long as you know Someone within the company your hired."
bad,"They don’t work with there employees "
bad,Management is terrible company going under. Career advancement is done based on favoritism. Company is now doing lay offs because they can't pay current employees. STAY AWAY
bad,"The future is very uncertain with the organization.  Lots of layoffs, especially management.  The layoffs are being handled horribly. Things are uncertain day to day.  The organization lack processes and procedures.  Brought in an outside person to make these decisions.  All they looked at was dollars, not skill or talent. No idea who are good employees but deciding who gets laid off.  No rhyme or reason.  Which leaves a lot of bad apples in place.  But the way the fired the Molina's (CEO and CFO) is a good indication of how they feel about employees."
bad,"The Job just is not fun at all for me since it is not related in anyway towards Information Technology which is my Degree and this is a Customer Service Call center."
bad,"Been with the company for quite a while.  Columbus turnover rate is off the charts!!   If you are a nurse with any real experience you will notice immediately that this company follows none of the usual rules of nursing.  you are often left speechless from the management team  and their silliness.  Since the turnover rate is so off the charts you will end up with a new supervisor, manager or director about every 4 months or so. With so many new new people, seasoned employees have zero value or respect  or viewed as any company asset."
bad,"management supportive, promotions are not based on merit, "
bad,"Management only concerned with bottom line...money. They could care less about family, happiness or promoting from within."
bad,"The team I worked with was really good and assisted when I needed it. However, the leadership from my direct supervisor all the way up to the HR department lacked leadership qualities and commitment to their employees. The cultural of the company is well below what I had previously been around causing a lack of excitement to go into work or even want to work. The hardest part of the job was the lack of quality leadership. I cannot honestly identify anything enjoyable other than some of the co-workers I was able to work with. "
bad,Management feels threatened by employees that may know more than them and will become resentful and vindictive. Many good employees were let go due to this.
bad,Very poor working environment. Poor Management. Favoritism in the company. No room for advancement. Job is too stressful and a person in management is expected to work 60hrs+ in a work week.
bad,"management is hard to deal with, they lack knowledge to do their jobs, they let it known they dont want to help you do your job; they are only concerned with stats they dont care if the job is done correctly;      usual day is run to desk avoid certain people in the workplace, login do my job, stay out of site clock out and leave.......it is a great day when i dont have to go to management for anything."
bad,"Working for Molina is a learning experience like no other healthcare employer I have ever worked for, and I have worked for a few major healthcare companies. "
bad,"This was once a great company to work for. But Dr Molina got fired and it is run different now. The lay offs continue, it is micro managed and it became greedy! All they care about is money money money! BS project ""Nickel"",making us work long hours even during the holidays because we are understaffed. Days off are not being approved, they are working us to the ground and everyone is so unhappy. This place use to be a great place to work for, but don't bother applying. The benefits are good, but there was some recent changes and even that is no good. They don't care for their employees, its like a sweat shop. We're all just waiting to get laid off or fired so we can at least collect unemployment while searching for something else, that's the only thing that keeps my dept here. The most depressing job ive ever had."
bad,"MICROMANAGEMENT!!! no consistency. WIll cut pay, make changes that affect your directly and dont care. NO advancement unless you know someone. Hate it"
bad,"A typical day at work is never dull."
bad,"Not a healthy working environment. There is a great deal of favoritism practice in the workplace, and a great deal of negativity."
bad,"High stress environment. Higher ups never take accountability for their downfalls and want to let the blame trickle down. Scheduling sucks. The money is really good if you can deal with the day to day stress of nearly unattainable goals, little to no real resources and blame being placed on you that shouldn't be"
bad,"Working at Molina was okay, but it got stressful. There is no life balance, the management is disorganized and horrible. I feel like the agents are not trained well enough. Procedures are always changing.  Whenever I asked for help to a supervisor or lead there was always different answers and sometimes they weren’t even sure themselves. There is advancement opportunities as long as you’re a supervisor’s favorite. Molina is always hiring because people are always leaving and that says something. Not the ideal workplace, but it’s a good place if you are trying to obtain experience in customer service, call center or healthcare insurance. The pay was good, I stared at $16/hr as a member service representative (customer service). Overall my co-workers were nice people."
bad,It was stressful working there. Too much and not enough pay. Management was horrible. You cant get in touch with anybody in HR and you are constantly on the phone.
bad,"I worked in the Medicare pharmacy department as a Pharmacy Technician.  My job was to review requests for prior authorizations for medications that were not covered under Medicare.  I spent a lot of time on the phone with doctors offices and pharmacies and sometimes with patients.  With all that phone time and research that needs to go into each request, they can go slowly.  Management expects you to complete massively high numbers of these per day, regardless of how other circumstances come in to play and bog down the process.  They have no tolerance for different levels of ability in their employees and do not work with you as far as ADA accommodations.  The environment is hugely stressful as the management constantly pressures everyone to keep production levels up.  Zero down time allowed.  The training provided was greatly lacking yet they expect perfection in all things, they want a 0% error rate and they do track that individually.  The stress an competition within the department breeds an atmosphere of distrust and backstabbing. Its a miserable place to work, which is unfortunate because there are a lot of great people that work there.  The managers and corporate, not great.  Its all about the numbers, keeping your numbers high and with corporate, you are all just a number and as long as they are profitable, that's all they really care about."
bad,"There were a lot of politics of it it's not what you know but who you know. There were a lot of ""shady"" back door things happening that went on and only a privileged few knew about. If the walls could talk..."
bad,"It used be OK to work for Molina. I had freedom to bring in new idea and create something new. Now, we are being micro managed. For Example, we are being told which font, font size, paragraph spacing, bullet format to use on presentations. Then, the managers do not follow the format."
bad,"Very micro managed fast paced enviroment,  training is very Vague. Salary is not enough for the job duties. Communication between departments is terrible."
bad,"Utilization review was very much taken for granted by a company that tried to retain as much profit on Medicare and Medicaid dollars. Frequently was asked to do more and more, including other co-workers work without recognition or compensation"
bad,When I first started at Molina it was ok than it turned out to be a nightmare working at Molina they need to replace the Management very unprofessional and a lot of favoritism going on with Manager and Supervisors they don't know how to treat their employees no advancement there it's been a big turn around with employees you don't want to work for Molina until they get a new Manager until than good luck
bad,It was like high school management was a clique. They only promoted their friends not people qualified for the position. It was a popularity contest. Management was rude. Mandatory over- time. With the overtime you could not choose how you wanted to work it. Meaning it was preset after your shift. Human Resources did not follow up on complaints.
bad,"Typical days are busy, busy. I learned many different programs as well as many different processes in the Healthcare Industry. Management was fair but could use some improvement in other aspects.Workplace culture unfortunately was grumbling employees complaining they were not getting paid enough and ungrateful for their jobs. Hardest part of the job was not having the resources needed to fully complete job requirements. Most enjoyable was helping those that needed it, and reaching people on a different level as not just an employee but as a person understanding their needs and really making a difference in someones life. That was the best part of the job by far. Unfortunately this company did a mass layoff and I was one of them. They lost a great asset though as I made large changes that greatly benefited this company on multiple platforms."
bad,The most important part of the job was meeting new people.  I was also able to help those who were not able to help themselves.  This gave me a sense of accomplishment at the end of the day.
bad,Terrible management and virtually no career development. My department was a revolving door of leadership until we were finally left with an under qualified “dictator”. Highly recommend looking for a job elsewhere.
bad,I was always put on late shift as I have no small children and felt I was punished for this reason as I didn't have to worry about  babysitters. We were given 2 weeks of training to learn 5 more states which was not enough time and provided more stress to the job
bad,The supervisor is the biggest issue that I have with Molina. She is not pleasant to work for. Very mean temperament. I work with an excellent team of individuals however the management is unprofessional.
bad,"Have to be seated for 8+ hours a day, not lenient with breaks or going to use the bathroom. Not lenient  or understanding with sick self or kids. "
bad,"Started off ok, but after a few weeks reality sets in. Production numbers unrealistic to meet. More and more responsibility dumped on your unit that could have easily been handled in more appropriate departments with people doing nothing at their desks. Supervisors and managers who are always in meetings and hardly ever positive about anything you do. Sink or swim mentality while you're surrounded by sharks. I'm surprised I lasted as long as I did. BTW, I'm not a job hopper. Last 2 jobs I've held were 8 and 11 years if that helps."
bad,Molina is revolvling door. The turnover is very high and the morale is very low. To get ahead there you have to know someone or be a family member of SLT.
bad,"Answer phones, answer questions about billing, and update patient demographics.  Management was very disorganized at best and you always got a different answer from each leadership team member.  There was no consistency and favoritism was at one of the highest levels I have worked under.  Most of my co-workers were pretty nice, which made the job somewhat enjoyable.  The hardest part was being told different rules, regulations, protocols, and everything in between."
bad,Started out as a good place to work. Soon turned into a company that lacks leadership and does not care enough about developing its employees. The company will make promises and then not deliver. If your a self starter who just wants a job - then by all means apply. But if you want to make a difference and your caring - run!!!
bad,"Working at Molina was very uncomfortable, it is a click company. If management does not like you; management will give you the wrong information and if you do not speak Spanish to bad for you because management and staff will talk all around you."
bad,all company need structure but I feel when they try to micromanage every minute down to assigning breaks to who you can go to lunch with is a little over the top. the position I'm in is very demanding and stressful we have dead line to meet. The department moral is so low . There is no team building here at all. I have never worked in a place like this.. what I enjoy about this job is trying to do my best to help the members get theirs services in the time allotted by the state.
bad,Molina hired hundreds of employees then did a huge lay off. They promised many remote positions but then stated it was an error. They would allow many to work remotely but then would often make them work at office. Would also force employees to different departments to work.
bad,"New program company not prepared for State mandated requirements."
bad,New restructuring did not take in to consideration many factors that affect each different states. Job duties changed without staff knowledge or consideration.
bad,"This is not the friendly, family owned company that it used to be. Now everything comes down to how many dollars can be made for Molina. Quantity is much more important then quality."
bad,"Case management dept was hired as telephonic. Three months into the position changed all of cm to field with to notice or pay adjustment. Poor leadership, almost daily changes."
bad,Growing Company with a lot to improve on.  Call Center environment.  Helped Members re-oppended their accounts that were erroneously closed.  Escalated about 5 issues to leadership and it took about 2 weeks to get response from them.
bad,"For an enterprise sized company, they are very unorganized. There are no SOP put in place. Management decides to change how things get done weekly. "
bad,"I was a temporary employee that didn't meet my supervisor until 2 months in. I didn't meet my manager until I was 5 months in. They always liked my work and told me I would be hired on permanently, then I got injured on the job and let go since they couldn't accommodate my injury. Once I was healed they said the position had been filled by another temp. Thanks for making me start at the bottom again."
bad,"Only thing keeping me here is my coworkers and the decent pay. The patients tend to be either drug-seeking or recurrent SNF patients, dwindling job satisfaction. Management could use some work with significant issues take ages to be dealt with. Flexible scheduling though is a plus."
bad,"Management is very punitive."
bad,Great place to work for if you're  a politician.  Too many chief's (Who don't have a clue) and not enough Indians.  Molina of Michigan has the potential to be a dynamic force within the managed care industry.
bad,many departments are not ready and or prepared to integrate remote employees into the organization.  overall the company is good and has admirable goals.
bad,"Toxic environment to work in. This place is not about what you know but who you know. They hold you up to unrealistic production standards. They’re about producing numbers, not quality work."
bad,"Working for Molina Healthcare was challenging as they do not provide the support needed as a new hire. Work environment is consistently changing and as upper management changes, job security goes out the door."
bad,I can say it may have been me but I worked with a women who made my life miserable from day one! I tried and tried to work with her but she was out to get me and I was upset everyday. I tried to go to HR who completely ignored me bc I learned that HR backed management and not their employees! Way too much nepotism in this company when I worked there..
bad,Management does not keep you update yo date on whats going on even if its about your job. The will half tell you what you are to do and then the next week throw you into something different and not train you on what it is you are to do. The benefits plan are very bad.
bad,"The management in Puerto Rico was there just because they end up giving the job positions to friends but they did not have the required degrees nor experience to have management positions. It's sad because at the beginning the company was great but after the new managers took place they had no organization, they didn't even knew basic english and that was a most for working there. They did not know how to handle the employees private situations properly  because they were always telling people business to other employees that they hang out with. If you told your manager you had to leave for whatever reason, like sickness or a personal situation everyone in the whole department end up knowing."
bad,"Good company to work for, however, no full time employment was offered to me. I played a temp role only, moved on looking somewhere else, so sad, company has bad management."
bad,"Worked at Molina in Spokane.  Hired on as a temp associate and was told that things were looking really good and we would be hired on as full time once contract was up. To start with, my initial start date got pushed back twice from when I was supposed to start and had already given notice to the prior employer. 2 weeks with no job and no pay did not help. "
bad,"Management was like watching nurses go through a revolving door 24/7. In 6 yrs I had 8 different supervisors, and managers. No consistent management. Remote position was great but you were only treated fairly if you sucked up to Supervisors. I worked 2 years in a row we all got 10 cents for annual review even though we met and exceeded company goals consistently! To many lay offs and no honorable leadership."
bad,"Very stressful to work in. Management is ok and supportive, but internal clients can be tough to work with. IT policy is very strict... very difficult to obtain access to data to do work."
bad,"Very stressful, have to meet a call quota/day when honestly if members answer their phones or not is out of your control.Also documentation is constantly changing and constant meetings occur VERY often with new changes being the focal point. Management does NOTHING to help and supervisor usually hides behind her screen or says she’s in “meeting” when a member wants to speak with her. The dept is falling apart and upper management does nothing to try to keep their employees...when employees should be the companies BEST assets. We have employees quit every 2 weeks since I worked there, making the work load tougher, think twice about applying here"
bad,"A typical day consisted of calling over 200 plus providers, nurses, hospitals, and clinics regarding patient assessments. I've gained more knowledge from the Quality Department about HEDIS. The workplace culture was diverse. The hardest part of my job was not knowing what my job duties were on a consistent day-to-day basis."
bad,"Molina was very stressful and constant. YOu only got 30 mins for break and there was no grace period on arrivals, even if there was bad weather. The michigan call center is closed now, good riddance."
bad,Heavily micro managed by Corporate making it difficult to carry out day to day duties. This occurred after the restructure of the whole company. Prior to September 2017 Molina was a great place to work.
bad,My department and my manager was very relaxed. When I first started was very family oriented but after the Molina brothers were ousted things change. Sad was a nice place to work
bad,It was nice. different type of management. Didn't like HR. THey didn't satisfy needs when things were medically important. Time off in advance request were not up to par and were different.
bad,"Pay is laughable compared to other health plans in the area. People are nice, but not worth the pay you get. Only way you'll get decent pay is working as a contractor."
bad,"At the start of my tenure at Molina, the company and the management had a culture that was attractive with promise of a growth path. Unfortunately, that started to change, with a shift towards nepotism, and just horrible leadership, especially at the Health Plan level (Texas). There was no recognition of contributors, and work-life balance became a lip service. ""Remove silos"" was a slogan, while more of them were being erected."
bad,Lack of resources for the population that resulted in a high-stress environment. Long work days which made it impossible for work-life balance.  Constant disconnect with management due to membership demographic.
bad,They had bad management in PMO and I think they laid off most of them but few left in Infrastructure. The VP of infrastructure does not have any value for PM and he keep rushing to do all projects without any PM which cost the company more money in long term.
bad,"I love what the company stands for and that is why I stay as long as I have. The downside is that in the process of trying to make the board happy and the customers happy, they have failed to see the value of loyal employees."
bad,Until recently Molina Healthcare was a great place to work.There have been several layoffs with more to come. The original philosophy of the Molina family has been overtaken and now the culture of the company is no longer a family atmosphere that exhibits concern and caring for it's employees. There is a feeling of distrust in corporate management. It is definitely not the Molina that we all came to know and love. I would not go back under this current regime.
bad,The management of this place is atrocious.  Communication is almost non existent and there is no structure.  If you like being thrown under the bus by others than this is the place for you.
bad,"I have been working here for X years. There have been huge changes to everything from the culture to the members. The One Molina is that everything is micromanaged through corporate. Management  in my state does not care about their employees, only the bottom line.  Management actually couldn't do what the employees are expected to do,  they would have no idea. Management is not supportive of the existing staff or even interested in retaining those with special skill sets. There is a newer job description for folks like me who have been here a while  that applies to one and all. There is harassment about this almost on a daily basis. It has become extremely hard to work here with all the distractions and frequent daily changes. It has become very difficult to get any  information in writing to assist you in the process of whatever you are doing. You must be willing to fly by the seat of your pants every day and hope you get it right. No one will tell you except your coworkers, who are remarkable people. In all my time here my coworkers have been the best.  Run from this job it is not what you think it is."
bad,"Not coducive jpb emvironment. Very few opportunities for advancement .  No sensitivity to emplyee's needs, not willing to listen to employee concerns.  Too much favoritism."
bad,"Management is absolutely terrible and can't help you with anything. Training process was not thorough and it was rushed. No one slows down to show you anything. There is no time in between calls and you don't have time to wrap up and take notes before the next call. Very unorganized and member services has to take care of EVERY call that comes to Molina. Member services now has to do claims and everyone is lost. The claims department constantly messes up claims and when the providers call in, it makes the company look like they don't know what they're doing."
bad,"It is a good fit for first time call center job seekers. If you have any experience, the pay isn't worth it. Certain members of management will help you,  most of the managers are back stabbers. They don't look out for their employees as they should. My personal manager is amazing."
bad,Overall the company still needs to figure out its communication with employees and training is the worst I’ve ever had from a company the people I worked with were the best part
bad,"I enjoyed working and the collaboration with other leaders from different departments.  You get to engaged with leadership actives and classes, understand HR guiidance to complete staff 1:1 and standardized productions."
bad,"good pay, very stressful, bad schedule, no flexible hours. do not recommend to work here their turnaround is very big and there was just a lay off for employees."
bad,"Heavy workload, Computer systems have not been updated to handel the workload. Heavy manual entry. Leadership expectations are not clear. Communication from leadership is poor."
bad,"Management is the worst I’ve ever seen with favoritism, nepotism and  total disrespect! With  almost 30 years experience in healthcare  it was my worst  experience.  Once the Molina ‘s left the culture totally changed.....   management needs to be replaced"
bad,This place was okay years ago. Now you are micromanaged and overworked. The mandatory OT is terrible and now you might have to work some weekends. They had layoffs a couple of years ago and now have to rehire because of the workload. The place is too stressful and it really shouldn’t be. It’s political and who you know gets them off of you. Some of the managers are rude and should be written up. Who knows when they might lay-off again? If you are Filipino or Hispanic you might have a chance. Nepotism is also in practice! I’m in the process of looking for other opportunities elsewhere!
bad,"Management is terrible. There is no communication in teams in the office I worked in. The compensation and benefits are the best perks of the job. "
bad,"The corporate office is out of state. There was no growth and advancement opportunities in Detroit. The office was also disjointed in terms of positions, jobs, reporting, etc. There was a lot of tension and it was a stressful environment."
bad,The workplace was typical and it was pretty much mellow. Management was ok they seemed like they really couldn't make dire decisions. The hardest part of the job was staying mellow to everyone.
bad,It started off good. Worked with a great team and had a great manager. Things started to change when the layoffs happened. Lack of support from the director who was clueless on our job duties. There were cliques between AP and Accounting that I felt since day one. They had too many leads in the department that were not qualified to even be a lead. Huge turnover in the department mainly because of the director or not being able to adapt to change. Great for someone fresh out of college. Not much room for growth and opportunities.
bad,"Typical day consisted of a requirement of reviewing 25 cases per day, but only had 4 hours in which to do so to get to Medical Directors for review.  The remaining day was following up on cases returned from Medical Directors, and concurrent reviews.  "
bad,Work is intense and multitasking skills play key to be successful through out the day. You must be strong as dealing with stress since call volume keeps you very busy and sometimes it can be difficult to cope with. Coworkers are nice and friendly and are your best allies to be successful at work with help and job resources.
bad,Not a bad company just my department once management changed we were giving a boss who micromanaged every part of are day even though are department had a good track record
bad,"I believe in Dr. Molina's mission."
bad,I learned that high pay does not equal a good job. My license and my co-workers licenses were always in jeopardy! Molina does not support their staff in this office. No concept of seniority. Poor moral. Broken promises. High turnover.
bad,"If you want a supervisor who is NOT knowledgeable, constantly gives inaccurate information, tries to find fault in any action you make or question you have, gossips, micromanages, is a habitual liar, has poor communication and only involves staff on a need-to-know basis (which pertains to almost everything you may need to know), and who will make every effort to get you into trouble if she doesn't like you then this is the job for you. Don't expect upper management or HR to listen to your concerns because they will back up the supervisor even when she's wrong and somehow blame you for it."
bad,"The turnover rate is crazy, i have been here for almost 3 years and  they have a lot of people coming in then later they fire them. The company really doesn't care for the employee. they do not do any outside the workplace activities like some companies do. Some supervisors are understanding but most don't care about your well-being or family. its either them or you. Most of them micro manage which is really annoying for someone who does better on their own. the insurance in general is trash that is why there's nothing but complaints against the company. there aren't enough resource and they make you do jobs that wasn't even in the training. the pay is good i guess if your'e coming from a place that pays less than 15 but i would suggest to just get your experience and take your talents else where because this company will drain you. the benefits that they they offer isn't worth it. Whats the point of working for a health insurance if the health insurance they provide isn't even worth it."
bad,"It started out to be a great work experience and took a turn for the worse. I gained a lot of experience and wanted to learn more but management was not supportive, especially if you were not one of their chosen few. Quite disappointed."
bad,"Went to work for a new manager...spent more time trying to find someone to walk her dog and researching getting her car registered. Ended up being let go because apparently someone said I didn't get along, which was BS. Wouldn't tell me who said it so I could go to them to find out the problem so it could be rectified. First time I worked for Molina was as a temp...had pretty much same problem with management. I have never been told I didn't get along with people in my 40+ years of working...not sure if the problem was me or the cutthroat atmosphere of people working around me."
bad,"Perhaps due to corporate restructuring, quality/competent leadership scenarios are scarce. Entire leadership chains are known to be petty, vindictive, and cover for one another, rather than pushing each other to strive for better. It's entirely a who you know, rather than what you know scenario. Any interested applicants who enjoy a sycophantic lifestyle where you only have to pander to the idiocy of talentless so-called professionals, please apply as you will go very far. The company used to be an exciting place to work however they have a very visible preference towards putting people from a ""non-color"" background in charge over departments with a highly diverse staff and it works out to the disadvantage of many."
bad,"Not a very reliable company. Constantly changing directions, laid off many departments without warning. After layoffs the company has been unreliable in paying severance and insurance premiums. Management was condescending and unconcerned with employee satisfaction. Employee turnover was very high."
bad,"No comment as to anything that happened there, if you are a brown-noser, you will fit in perfectly. There's nothing good to say except the pay was exceptional and made some of the bs you had to deal with bearable."
bad,"poor management, micro management, no leadership, would have liked more weekly meeting or bi weekly meetings, more of an understanding why the layoffs accrued was not happy with the lay off"
bad,work is assigned and you manage how you want to complete it . Learned all different aspects of the company from the front end to the back end with member elig .
bad,"Talent is not located in the right places, currently going through budget cuts and layoffs. Career advancement opportunities are put on a standstill until business develops new plan for advancement."
bad,worked as a Project Coordinator.  I was there 2 weeks before anyone gave me any direction - then was told I wasn't communicating.  little feedback regarding job performance. company does not provide utensils or water for employees.
bad,"Good benefits, poor work-life balance, decent pay, work at home options, lateral movement but no upward mobility. Overall, average place to work.  High turnover rate."
bad,The place has potential but doesn't make good use of time/talent.
bad,Assisting patients to the best of my ability is all anyone can do.
bad,"Very unorganized. Didn't want to give raises even after a year of employment. Management didn't know what they were doing and how to assist when needed, they only knew how to tell you to increase production. You can get switched from one team to another without you knowing you were being put on another team. Management played favorites."
bad,Many deadlines to meet. Stressful work environment. A lot of mandatory training. Very heavy workload. Must work 50/55 hours per week to meet workload.
bad,"Molina used to be a great organization to work for, but not anymore. Now it is all about profits and making shareholders happy instead of caring for the customers or employees. Lots of layoffs, no training, no travel, working more than 45+hrs a week on salary plus on-call, extremely fast timelines for projects, outsourcing. However the stock prices continue to climb at the expense of thousands of former employees."
bad,Molina healthcare does not pay extra for all the Job responsibilities that are expected  they refuse to promote from within and there is a sense of i don't care towards the employees
bad,company h as the consant lingering of layoff hanging over your head.  very stressful and hard to work with those conditions.  Productivity decreases .
bad,"Nice people, but too worried about pushing blame or responsibility to another area/person. Very silo'd environment with territorial issues and constraints. Molina is more worried about following structure than serving the patients. Not a particularly talented population of professionals."
bad,"The management were very unfair with the workers. They made it hard for me to be relax. I worked there and for the time being I had 4 different bosses. People were leaving all the time because of ungrateful management. The pay very two weeks was no more than $850.00, I mean what is a human being in Miami is going to be able to do with that? Fight between management themself."
bad,"I did not have an actual review. Small raises were givan once a year. We were continually asked to do more with less staff. Quite a few of the employees had more than one job,in the clinic. I was also the vaccine coordinator, along with being a MA for my provider. I took inventory,of all medications and was senior MA also taking care of the lab."
bad,Most days are challenging with updates on the job from day to day and you to learn to adapt to the different changes that are going on within the work place. Within the last year management has been changed with so many uncertainties going on with not knowing from day to day whats going on with the company.The most enjoyable part is that we have flexable hours.
bad,"I loved working for Molina in the beginning.  I loved all the Directors/Managers I supported and reported to, buut the company went from a great family organization to cut throat/worry about your job. What they did when they eliminated jobs was awful.  I felt betrayed."
bad,"It was a great experience in the past. Used to be a great company to work for, but currently company goes through re-organization: no stability, unknown future."
bad,"Management is disorganized in some departments yet excellent in others. Lack of consistency between departments. Great culture program, unfortunately the sentiments of the culture program aren't always reinforced by corporate (very little PTO at supervisor/entry level, no good options for sick days - pretty much get a little write up for calling in without 24 hour notice - not always realistic in actual life). Does not encourage work life balance in any way except having the culture program promote it."
bad,"Keep in mind that Molina is a large company, so there may be other departments that are more pleasant to work in. Many of my work experiences have been very positive. I've been very fortunate up until now. Usually, the only reason I would seek other employment would be to increase my annual salary above the standard 3% raise.  "
bad,"Fight fires we aren't allowed to call fires.  This branch of Molina has a strong fear factor version of management.  I hear the rest of the company doesn't use escalation and intimidation to produce results.  "
bad,"They make changes that do not make cense, and do the opposite of what the core value is. For over 3.5 years with a great manger it was like family and I loved going to work. They put in a different manager that had never done that type of work and it cost the company not only money but time and people that new what they were doing to get the job done."
bad,"Molina is a stressful place to work, so much favoritism you see. Dealing with members for the 14.99 they pay not worth it. Only if you keep it could with the supervisor maybe they will change your time card and not use your PTO as some do.. good luck"
bad,"Molina bought out total care.  I was one of the last employees that was left from total care.  I had to clean up the old system in order to start working with the new system.  I felt my hard work in cleaning up with total care work was not recognized,as the company downsized"
bad,"The work is rewarding, because the team is aware of the positive impact our product will have on people's lives and health. The employees (not management) valued and looked after one another.The actual employees that are Directors and below are fantastic."
bad,Fun training for customer service.  However some audtiors not honest about your metrics. They tell the reps that they did bad espcially in the area of empathy. The pay is not good in the call center for what we did.
bad,"If you can land another job, please do so. Management is of no help in any situation. Favoritism at this company is out of control. It's not about what you know or how well you do your job, it's about who you know. Also, this company is ran by micromanagement. Do yourself a favor and avoid this job at all costs."
bad,"It is a great job, a good steady paycheck and benefits are great. Not the greatest place with under qualified managers, but still good job with good people."
bad,"but they do promote from the inside most of the time, however i have seen times when a person should have been promoted and they were passed over for someone from the outside."
bad,"Typical day open lobby first thing , meet and greet staff and visitors, verify access to building daily, sitting spreadsheets, room bookings, scheduling equipment for meetings via other sites,"
bad,"It is not the job for those that are people oriented, I believe that it is very basic. I love a challenge, the hardest part is staying focused"
bad,They fly you to long beach for a two day orientation and it's a blast and the ceo is actually really nice and all about the company and you leave thinking this will be great. You get back and work in a cubicle and your manager never listens to you never helps you and helps no one. My manager even had me email her if I was 1 minute late and when I left so she could track my time. I had no training and there was no job description for my job. No one could answer questions or I would get 4 different answers. A lot of cliques and I hated that. You didn't know who truly like you and who was faking it and talking behind your back. I only lasted 4 months and left my job of 12 years to come here for more money and found out they don't give raises and there is no advancement either.
bad,The company sounds great when in orientation but when back to the home site the company culture isn't observed.
bad,"Molina has changed a lot, at the moment the company is restructuring all the departments, it is dismissing almost all the employees, many departments disappearing."
bad,"Working in Molina Healthcare is memorable for me, especially when I'm a newbie. "
good,typical day too many meetings. Mgmt is based on friendship. hardest part of the job was inconsistent instructions. actual job was enjoyable. Management was incapable of being impartial.
good,"All upper management are friends"
good,The department I work in so poorly managed. A lot of the upper management was hired because of who they knew. Uneducated and unqualified. There is no room for growth or advancement.
good,"Working at Molina I acquired much needed experience in a medical surgical setting. The location was perfect, nine blocks from my house. There were some great people to work with. The company vision was was great to get behind and uphold. But the nursing director and most of the management at her level were older, petty and inflexible. A great deal of the staff was near retirement age."
good,Great benefits. One should have a vehicle not conducive for bus rider unless living in that area.  Training descent.  Only 30min lunch but doordash delivers there.
good,"Toxic work environment, very high pressure with little to no support from “leadership”. Chaotic with high turnover of employees. The person who hired me had quit by the time I started employment, the “supervisor” who provided the massive data-dump and expected me to produce the impossible quit from apparent nervous breakdown. The manager was a cold oppressor. You are expected to do everything but mop the floor for less than competitive compensation, while the CEO makes his $20,000 000 yearly compensation. There are better options, don’t sell yourself short here."
good,I'm grateful the experience and knowledge gained. I learned quickly and was able to assist in training others as well.  It was a fast pace environment as well.
good,"Extremely busy, inept management, low pay, hostile co-workers. You're expected to be a non-stop machine, do tasks that really ought to be completed by HR, supervisory staff, and be the department cleaning lady. Oh, did I forget to mention in this day and age of electronic data management, you have to copy gigantic training binders? Complete waste if resources, time, and energy! Totally not worth the good benefits. Basically you sell your soul to the devil on that one."
good,"Multiple rounds of layoffs. Remaining management team ineffective and  unskilled. Job security is non-existent. New CEO has work cut out turning this company around, if possible at all. Deeply routed dysfunction."
good,"Molina is fast paced and patient oriented. Dr. Molina was an admirable man with a big heart and an inspirational vision for taking care of lower income families and has done so for over 30 years. "
good,The Health Plan and Corporate do not act like one team but two separate teams. A lot of blaming someone else happens when things goes wrong. Most of molina does not stand behind their employees. My supervisor is great but everyone else in management are good. Also the case managers are lazy.
good,"Management will destroy an entire company, they do not listen to their employees and if you want an promotion with more money be less educated as possible those the ones get promoted"
good,"Molina healthcare was a very stressful place. I would sit with the marketing coordinator and help with small tasks on a daily basis. I learned quite a bit from my time there. I was able to learn more about Adobe InDesign and organization skills. I also learned to be very patient. Management wasn't to great, they were going through a lot of changes and people were getting fired a lot. It was a very hostile place. My co-workers were nice, but to stressed and nervous to really get to know them. The hardest part of my job was trying to find enough projects to do to stay busy. Things were always changing. The most enjoyable was learning to use the Adobe products and watching myself grow in a corporate environment."
good,"Job one;  Implement a replacement application for the Care Management solution."
good,Typical day job. Clock in at certain time answer phone calls and provide customer service to best ability. Not a fan of supervisor. Best part of day are coworkers. Honestly no one ever really knows the right answer to your questions.
good,Management did not provide the needed tools to complete caseload work on time. Management did not support case managers and continued changing processes.
good,"Stressful environment, you never knew if you would have a job from one day to the next.  False hope of being brought on has a permanent employee. A typical work day was no help when you needed assistance with a issue on the floor.  You had to reach out to a coworker for assistance.  Management was uncommunicative with workers.  Workplace culture was not friendly.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to assist members and providers."
good,"My first year at Molina was great! It was fun and they really made great strides to make Molina the top place to work! I thought I would retire there. Difficult to advance. I applied to 10 jobs with no interviews. Changes made to position frequently based on colleagues performance. Low almost minimal pay raise. Job uncertainty with ""Transparent Joe"" sending out  layoff emails like it was great for the company! No regard for employees livelihood. Micro-managed in my position!"
good,helping members that need the assistance with there health is concerned they make it worth coming to work. As you want to improve your performance and go ahead it the cultural issues
good,"Molina has been growing rapidly, but has not been profitable. There are several operational issues and the high cost of admin makes it hard to earn a profit. Additionally, Molina pays on the low side compared to it's competitors in the same space."
good,"This company if very disorganized and I found my job to be unsatisfactory....the work was easy and and rote which is okay but the constantly changing of policies and processes let to confusion.  We worked in teams and depending on how each supervisor interpreted daily directions for processing, teams were seldom processing work in any standard fashion.  Constant conflicting rules were put in place, verbally explained at an employee call together in one of the lobbies where we would all mash together and try to hear the speaker; following with written confirmation that did not always have same terms as verbal explanation.  The pay was good; the supervisors where more like babysitters and they were required to do ""walk throughs"" to make sure staff members were working.  Not a place for people with strained confidence in yourself....self confidence is challenged frequently by the way the supervisors and managers are ""told"" to manage.  Good luck if you go there."
good,Molina is a great place to start but advise to take knowledge and either progress to another company or attempt to move up internally.
good,"All abscense is Unexcused, no matter if it's a death in family or if you are hospitalised. 1 minute tardy counts against you. I was on crutches due to multiple leg fractures. I was literally 1 minute late due to I was NOT offered accomodations and was written up for it."
good,I do not feel any job security at Molina. There are too many lay-offs. Some of the managers are micromanaging work such as what color to use on graphs.
good,"Molina was a family-led business but the family fumbled and drove it into the red. Their heart was once in the right place but it's hard to do good work when their ain't no money. The current CEO makes over 300 million per year. No way is he working hard enough to deserve it, but that's the world we live in today. It's an organization that does try to do its best by its members (patients) but the management isn't great, or driven or necessarily inspiring. So I worked here for years simply as a means to make ends meet. Not the worst nor best job I ever had. It's just okay. And the salaries they pay are below market value. So... a meh experience all around."
good,Hired as a contract employee that was supposed to transition to a permanent position that didn't come to fruition.  Lack of communication by management that position was going to be terminated
good,this place was not a great place to work at. there was no direction. Also management was never around for direction. From day to the next you didn't have a job.
good,"The job is not permanent but was told through the hiring agency that it could be a permanent position. It is ok (so far working here), the job needs to be little more and the some of the co-workers they have hired are not professional (wondering how they ended up working here)."
good,This could have been a great company but there are too many issues to overcome. The workload and expectations are unrealistic. There is serious lack of communication and accountability.  There is no real training. You are thrown to the wolves and left to figure it out.
good,When you apply for a job. Your told that your are not qualified for that job.Yet your asked to train the new hire for the same job you were not qualified for. Your Supervisor takes credit of your hard work and you are never recognized at all for the work you and your team does.
good,Your workload is provided to you daily in ques how ever it could be increased per management. Never leave a good job. Management was allowed and even encouraged to treat staff in a hostile manner. Treating to fire you if you did not perform up to their expectations and then changing the expectations so that you would be unable. The was no place for workplace culture if you stopped to say hello to someone you meet you would be reprimanded by management. You always knew you were going to have a stressful day. Leaving at the end of the day.
good,Good company with some Bad co-workers. Contractors didn't take there job seriously. Overall its a Good company for full time employees.
good,"As a former employee. There were promises made and never kept. I was hired as a TEMP employee and after nine months Molina did not want to be in TEMP employee business. They sent me and others to any agency where I lost all my accumulated days and started over from day 1. Like most business's they never hire from an agency/firm because it costs to much money to buy the contract."
good,"lots of company changes, people are nice and work hours are good."
good,Meetings took up most of the day. We had to stay late or come in early to get work done. Coworkers were great. The position above me (Director) has been vacant for 18 months. The position above that has been vacant 6 months. This created increased responsibility and duties and there was little to no interest or support from senior management.
good,"Upper management  shows little intrest in showing appreciation for the employees  under their charge, nor do they place  value on helping those employees  advance. More often they try to hold them back to make their job easier"
good,"Molina  went thru a period where they had bad management. However, that was some time ago, so i can only hope it improved. There has been much in the news about them so it appears to still be unstable."
good,"was an amazing when i started 7 years ago, but culture changed so drastically that the company ha become almost unrecognizable. the company used value all of its employees and consistently offered room for growth but now see employees as easily replaceable numbers with no value and no room for growth."
good,Molina's culture has changed from a company with personal touch to just another typical corporate America with low company morale.  Pressure to perform is great and yet employees wonder if their jobs will be outsourced.
good,"Solving provider's claims issues "
good,The company should do a revamp to ensure that policies and technology are equal to competitors. Also the pay should be more comparable to competitors as well.
good,"I have had the pleasure to work with a hard working group of people on my immediate team, however the workplace culture is changing drastically and at a fast pace."
good,"Molina was poorly run without the kind of oversight I would have recommended. There are thirteen plans reporting into a single corporate office and it was like the tails wagging the dogs."
good,"There is a lot of work, so you are kept busy throughout the day.  The day goes by really fast.  You learn a lot everyday, but very under staff.  Unreasonable overall expectations"
good,"With recent layoffs it's become a very tense environment. Folks are leaving left and right and the ones that remain are left to do double the work without the pay or any other incentive. If the company were smart, they would look for incentives that to offer employees that won't cost money such as remote days or flexible schedules when possible. Upper management would rather keep their buddies that don't have anything to offer the company than reward and retain hard working employees. Management is then left scrambling when there is no one left to do the job properly."
good,Amazing opportunity over the years! Position provided opportunity to learn and manage State level Medicaid Health Plan for Texas and attempt to navigate multiple process changes with LTSS program changes.
good,"I liked the people I worked around. I did not care for working in a cubicle environment, I like patient care more hands on. "
good,To much favortism. Management takes sides never gets a chance to get to know you. Staff acts like they were in high school with drama.
good,"I loved my job, however management made it very undesirable. Many unrealistic expectations, no training and no support. Job description changed frequently."
good,Molina is an extremely stressful environment The company lacks management and direction. WE are currently going through a transition where our corporate offices are being movied and the company will probably start laying off people soon.
good,"Upper management is clueless and as useful as a diaper. My immediate manager was great and went to bat for her team. Some of thr policies are redundant and don't work, but the suits don't understand that."
good,It's type a job that does not have many things to do. My job is to be on the phone and call doctors office if they had received a letter. And that is it. My office co workers are very distant they do not talk to anybody it ugly environment.
good,"The workplace culture is relaxed and the team where I am located is very good and supportive, which makes working there enjoyable.  I just don't like the commute - its too much.  Would prefer to work remote or at least be offered."
good,"You will be told one thing in your interview but once working none of that is true. They call you family. Well run for the hills. Some managers only care about themselves, smile at your face, and then stab you in the back. Health insurance is terrible. Co -workers are rude. Walk the building, staff always on their phones. Favoritism. No 2 people are treated the same. Don't work here."
good,Dont apply if you're in IT.  The CIO only wants to work with body shops.  The environment is extremely siloed and political.  First few years were good then went bad after the CEO was fired.
good,"I can't speak to any other department within Molina as I believe each have their own ups and downs, but IT at Molina has been in pieces for a few years now. I haven't felt safe in quite a while, and now, we have finally been given the word that Molina is moving away from full-time employees and toward a contracted work force in the near future. "
good,I enjoyed the five years and opportunities I experienced. The unknown about the companies stability was unsettling.I would have preferred that all departments had adequate training.
good,Hardest part of this job are the late hours.The most enjoyable part of the job are the agents. It is very diverse.Great supervisors they are really caring. A typical workday. Is assisting agents with questions and concerns.
good,Enjoyed working with the Medicare/Medicaid populations and working remote with a great deal of independence. Constant fear of job loss due to layoffs or lost contract renewals.
good,"I started as a Quality Interventions nurse.  To stressful.  Tools to do job ineffective.  Management would not hear the issues.  Management stated they always wanted your feedback and ideas, but did nothing with this information.  And, if you pointed out what wasn't working, then, you became a trouble maker.  "
good,"Inbound call center. "
good,I have only been here 8 months and seen 2000 plus people laid off and major changes in all level of management. I do not feel anyone has my back and being the new person I am like the odd person out.
good,"My review might make it seem like Molina is not a good company, it is. The service it provides it good, the idea behind it is good, but the problem lies in the board and upper management. Mismanagement as the company moves from medium business to national fortune 500 company is palpable. This is why turnover is so high. Molina has to find direction in the coming years or things will not improve."
good,That's literally the motto because even though you are overworked and they are understaffed; while you're untrained with unlimited amounts of workload. Your job is not secure. The majority of the people that work there is about who you know and who they're related to. My favorite part is those not your superiors telling you what to do and micromanaging your work.
good,"Overall learning experience, very nice coworkers and staff, got along well with others. To many ILearns. Liked working from home. Mileage was great!!."
good,I really don't have anything to say about the organization and its current structure. In the beginning of my employment with the organization it was a very good place to work for but it has not now become an overwhelming position.
good,"The claims department  was just getting started when I was hired in. It was not well organized and the management was not interested in the employees concerns. Old historic building with renovations going on around the employee's during business hours. The company had a couple of good perks, nice Christmas party and invites to numerous events in the downtown area but the working environment was not professional at all and somewhat stressful. Health insurance was ridiculously expensive and the pay was average."
good,Great company to enter into any field and opportunities to grow. Friendly staff no matter what department you go to. Its a learning experience constantly as the company grows. Management is not always established and is changing. Hardest part is the constant change in process and procedure.
good,"This company aims at providing quality healthcare to underserved and low income individuals and families, reduce ER and hospital readmissions, and promote self management health strategies to empower individuals and families."
good,"Molina was a great place to work for the previous year and a half. However; due to recent organizational, structural changes and the type of heightened competition that brings, the environment changed drastically. This may be a good opportunity for someone who has an affinity to repairing broken processes. Job security is questionable at the present moment. Office politics sour working relationships as the company continues to restructure."
good,To much favoritism among the bosses.  They expect 100% perfection. They don’t tell you that you made a mistake until it’s an issue. They get mad at you when you help another team member complains your helping.  Poor teamwork and the management almost encourages it.  It’s like being back in Jr high or high school.  Pretty sad.
good,The feeling of being watched is a common theme. Great basis for learning the health insurance industry but the main priority is not the interest of the employees but how many pennies can be pinched.
good,"There really is no training available or much room for advancement."
good,"Average workplace. The benefits were very good, as well as the salary, but the work environment was not friendly and focused mainly on productivity. No teamwork present."
good,"Compensation and benefits are not that ideal however job work/life balance is neutral. I loved working here for 3 years, it honed my community skills to help underserved population and was given an opportunity to meet one of the IL state representatives!  unfortunately due to revamped of management, organizational structure was lacking and hiring managers left and right just to fill the position was the worst part. Never really went through with the hiring process of finding the  ""right candidate"" and just give the job to someone they feel like it. Ex: NO management skills, no people skills, and micromanaging is utmost!. I tried to resolved my issue with my the management then raised my issue to HR but never heard back from them. This company has such a good core values ""one Molina"" and they truly value the members/client but not so much for the employees."
good,"1.  Over worked and very stressful."
good,"There is a lot of information that gets thrown at us and on the floor we all help each other out to help the members that are calling. The co-workers are what really make the job fun, you get to help the member and connect with the people around you and you have each others back."
good,"Molina Healthcare is a Great place to work if you are under the right Manager. Don't expect pay increases over 2 percent a year, if any. And, if you get a promotion, don't expect a big jump in pay because they will pay more to someone coming from the outside opposed to paying internal employees.Molina's payscale is a Secret. This is a great company if you like overtime and don't mind no work life balance.Benefits are OK and the pay is below average, but it is a job. Unsure of their future."
good,"MHC was a great place to be until Corporate took over. Corporate has been restructuring. Unfortunately,  job security and employee morale has been on a long time low. Unless you're a RN, there is no room for advancement."
good,"A typical day at work was extremely busy with loads of responsibilities. "
good,"Molina Healthcare was recently bought out by DXC Technologies. The benefits were really great with Molina, now they are not. The office culture is full of negativity and stress. There is no such thing as a good job, just meeting expectations. "
good,a typical day at work is what you would expect for a large organization. No real deviations from the norm of what you've come to expect from corporate america
good,"I came into the company at a bad time, just before we had a Presidential change and the Affordable Care Act was affected. As a result, many people were laid off, including myself."
good,Being at Molina was the most stressful two years. I was never made perm and was a temp for almost two years no matter how hard I worked. I do not recommend working at Molina.
good,"Do the words bait and switch mean anything to you; if so, keep it moving. I applied for a specific position and once in the door, everything changed. Management if sketchy at best."
good,"There is not much chance for growth. Favoritism is present, which comes in the way of fair treatment from management. Has it's share of workplace politic. Pay is low."
good,"New CEO, only cares about stock holders, company change once the new CEO took office, less customer base more about stock holders, company now is just a stock holders driven company"
good,I have enjoyed working for Molina.. There has definitely  been a lot of changes but it all for the member. Molina continues too grow & I'm sure with the upcoming changes  the members will be more than happy.
good,You can only move up based on who you know. It's about who you know in the company that can make you grow and promote you. It's not about how hard or dedicated you work.
good,Working here was convenient until we got a sixty days notice about us getting laid off. We all looked for jobs two weeks before that date came they told us we can keep our jobs. At the time we a few people found new jobs (my boss being one of them). When he left the fitness facility fell apart.
good,"Working for this company for 5 years I have see it all. The company overall has gone down hill. No employee appreciation, not enough pay for the type of work."
good,Overall I would say management is not professional. The organization is now coming under fortune 200 category but IT management is not professional as expected.
good,"I enjoyed the people that I worked with but it was a very stressful. You were never praised for your work, only criticized. "
good,Molina is a Huge Company and not a bad place to work at though I was a temporary employee.   I can say that they treat their employees much better and different than they do their temporary employees and at the end of the day we are there doing the same work  It is disrespectful to treat temporary employees differently.
good,It's been a great experience until the lay offs company wide management can improve lack of communication within the employees and clinics. Better resources
good,"Really Great peers and professional environment,  Serve as a Liaison for the Access Centers; assisting mental and behavioral health members who reside in Wayne, Oakland and Macomb counties. Uploading all documentations for members into Clinical Care Advance system such as; Level 1 assessments, Protected Health Information forms, Guardianship documents, Wavier Applications, Facility Level of Care Determination forms and Individualize Care Plans."
good,I enjoyed my employment with Molina.  The owners were extremely awesome and caring. I've known the owners since I was 17 years old.  They value an invest in the people and are very supportive.
good,"This company is not organize and there is no room for growth with this company, the mangers are not in sync with their employees and seems like they do not have management skills. The pay do not match the skills you do a on a day to a day basis."
good,Great company values. Not the best environment for moving up in a timely fashion. The majority of the work outcome was based on Medicaid Members and their willingness to participate in Hedis prevention programs.
good,Very high volume call center responding to members and providers concerns. I feel like the moral is low due to poor management.
good,As a call rep there is a very high call volume daily. I learned that documentation is so important because it helps to prove what you've done. I enjoy talking to customers and helping them with there healhcare options. It is great to change someones day from bad to good in one phone call.
good,"No room for advancement"
good,"Molina is growing but due to poor leadership,the company will continue to struggle to attract top talent. Leaders are not held accountable for their retention and we continue to say good bye to colleagues as they live the organization with less than 1 year of tenure."
good,"In-bound call center, focused on explaining coverage and benefits for enrollees of the Washington state Medicaid program. Directing callers to the appropriate government and private agencies for further assistance. Updating and maintenance of accounts on behalf of Molina members. Outbound calls when necessary for follow up."
good,"Responsible for follow-up on each account, verifying status of claim, re-billing claims as necessary, verifying contractual adjustments on claim status, review why claim were not clean for the provider, verify eligibility for members. Adjust claims for payment, review appeals on claims. Provide information on checks that have been lost. Reissue lost checks and information on cleared ones. Provide contracting information on new or renewal contracts. Responsible for government insurance payments on patient accounts."
good,"The culture and management of Molina has changed dramatically in recent years from a family-owned, diverse health plan to a more profit-driven, one-size-fits-all mentality. While the profit margins may look better, the staff satisfaction and job responsibilities have been significantly reduced. Working at Molina is a job and little more; not recommended as a career choice or for any type of career advancement."
good,Molina put a strong emphasis on team development and team building with numerous workshops. Cross-functional team building was a strong focus of project management practices in this matrix environment.
good,"I felt Management wasnt very competent, were not team players. Too cliquey. Also mostly communicated via email and rarely in person, and sometimes very rude via emails. Hire more competent management!!"
good,If you keep to yourself and do your job you will be fine. don't engage and try to make friends. my experience was fine. I enjoyed working here although the pay was low
good,All in all work was challenging and learned a lot. Had a lot of changes in the last couple of years which caused a great deal of stress and a lot of other employees leaving due to these issues
good,"Fast pace, often lack of true directions, appears to be very click driven.  Company is heading in the right direction of CEO, and going public on the stock market.  New leadership is doing well in the government driven business."
good,It was a good run working with Molina. The staff could be challenging but overall the company is for their workers. Atleast thats how I felt. If you had a great Supervior you were able to succeed. I would recommend them. The traffic in this area is HORRIBLE. Something that would make you think twice about working here. I couldn't deal!
good,"Current work day is based on production, not necessarily quality as it was when hired.  Management constantly changed and with new managers comes new policies and procedures.  Forever changing with expectations of new leaders."
good,Good paying job except they only hire temps.  Hard to get on as a permanent.  You can be let go before contracted time because job was completed earlier than expected.
good,Molina Healthcare in the midst of a massive re-organization.  The founders have been removed from the company after 30 yrs.  There have been huge lay-offs and the future of the company is uncertain at this time.
good,"Corporate values were excellent; however, work/life balance was difficult to achieve.  Communication of priorities was sometimes inconsistent, which contributed to rework.  Senior leadership was extremely supportive of staff during stressful times."
good,"While I worked for Molina it was not a bad job. It has many benefits such as: healthcare/ vision/ and dental care discounts, PTO starts to accumulate as soon as you start but there are no sick days, if you are sick and are scheduled it counts against you. Also it is nearly impossible to get a schedule change so be honest in your interview about what hours you can work."
good,"The company laid off a majority of its employees in Dec 2016. Management was not professional, they did not know anything. Its not like we were able to go ask management about a question we had because they did not know the answer. They were always changing something that was not broken."
good,Be prepared for constant changes. Management is cut throat there and only cares about the job but not the people. No room for growth in some departments.
good,The department I was in was not very structured.  There was a struggle between the state plan and the corporate group which is in CA.  The company is going through a major restructuring process currently.
good,It typical day at the call center in Bothell is quite busy. Coworkers are friendly as well as supervisors. The hardest part of the job is getting trained for other states that were never discussed on the offer letter or during the interview. The wage doesn't increase on the amount of workload that is added after training.
good,Clinic ok to work. MA over work and alot of drama. They want the MA to basicly do everything. I think the providers should be asking some of those certain questions when triaging the pt. Also management has favorites. Always double booking the pt so it's bad for the pt that they have to wait like an hour to be seen. I feel bad for them. Need better workflow.
good,At the time I left the company was waiting on the state to grant contracts to qualified managed care organizations.  Those who did not receive the bids would no longer be in service in the region.
good,"Company has a fantastic mission. It's all about helping those who are financially vulnerable attain healthcare. The company enjoyed massive growth over the last  5 years with the implementation of Obamacare. But, with growth covering the underlying issues of the company and the government providing uncertainty in supporting Obamacare, Molina struggles today. The company is currently restructuring and looking to refocus on their core business (Medicaid). It looks like the company is moving in the right direction, but we won't know how it will play out for another couple years."
good,"if you are trying to get into the healthcare field this is a good company to get some experience. There are other Healthcare Plans that pay at a higher rate than Molina for the same position. Management is very strict and they micro manage everything, it comes to the point where it feels as we are being treated as children and not as an adult. "
good,"Verify health coverage plan information to marketplace members. (inbound) Also, submit tickets to different departments if necessary regarding any issues that I am not able to assist with."
good,The entire atmosphere has been extremely politically charged. You can't even get an Interview for positions unless it passes the  political position control board.
good,It is an okay company to work for. But if you are looking to move up it all depends who you know there. I applied for numerous positions and the company does not respond as to if you were considered or not. The company is big on micromanagement of which is no big deal but have people who know what they are doing or talking about.
good,This is a nickel and dime company. They are also being sued by their own employees for exempt and non-exempt status issues. They were not transparent at all regarding why several departments suddenly became non-exempt. In a sense HR lied and is still lying to reduce their settlement amount I believe. Several of my former coworkers moved to QI due to the hostile and unprofessional work environment that our supervisor created. There are good supervisors in case management but not many. They have unrealistic expectations of staff and at times possible unethical reporting to the state. Overall directors were extremely nice and friendly.
good,I hace learned a lot about the State of Texas Medicaid plans. As far as how it works and the benefits that state medicaid members are able to get. I get along well with co-workers every day.
good,Good company who really tries to help with work/life balance.  Offers a lot of programs to assist with it.  There is also an exercise room and cafeteria in the office.
good,"Molina Healthcare’s Mission is to Provide Quality Health Services to Financially Vulnerable Families and individuals covered by government programs. Molina Healthcare has heath plan, medical clinics and a health information management solution. No other Organization of its kind does all three."
good,I liked the benefits and the on site free gym that they made for the employees. Management can be better. My manager was great and the fact that they had an extension for employees to call if they needed assistance while on a call. I think the company could be more organized and not so micromanaged when it came to getting answers.
good,"My schedule was 7-5 but after new management came in I found myself working until past midnight. The requirement of assessments a day went up and paperwork had to be completed within 48 hours and when you're working until midnight most days trying to get everything finished, there was no time for family. No work- life balance so I left the company."
good,"molina as a company is great its my department i have to issues with, i will not slander molina but it was just time to move on. Overall a nice place to work with an great view"
good,"Molina is a place that helps people with insurance. We assist the members with there benefits to inform them of whats available."
good,"*great potential to excel in leadership position."
good,"High call volume, assisted members and providers for Medicaid members. worked with 11 states, as well as all lines of business Medicaid, Medicare, duals, market place."
good,This Company needs to offer better pay also Overtime. Also there is no room for advancement with this company. I learned a lot regarding medical billing i spoke with a lot of Providers from all over made a lot friends just by working in Customer Service. Providers would call to speak with me.
good,Not many opportunities for advancement. The people that work there are great. Management is poor. The company's future is uncertain.Many layoffs.Health care benefits are not good.
good,"I thoroughly enjoy working for Molina for the most part. No two days are the same. That part is the best part, the challenge. It is unlike any other contact center i have ever worked in. My direct reports were the most enjoyable part of the role."
good,"the overall experience working with Molina Health care was good, with the well managed project. the mission was followed by the company and the work environment was flexible for the employees to work. The option to WFH gave the flexibility to het things done and manage work and personal life a little better."
good,There tends to be low moral due to upper managements decisions. This has created a lot of rumors and speculation. No room for growth and training is not offered.
good,You never knew what the day would bring; but helping providers & members is very rewarding. If an employee has never made an error before and scores in 100% for quality the need to be given more than one chance
good,"The organization strives to focus on healthcare for all types of patients, especially those that have had the misfortune of not having medical coverage and insurance. their revenue and profits is put back into the company to create more care opportunities for their members. Molina is known for a family and community establishments, where all are treated with respect. Their  inner city members healing and fostering approach is awesome"
good,I enjoy working for a department that is flexible with my schedule and is understanding of family needs.  There is definitely a work/life balance to appreciate
good,"Great people, nice environment, management needs work/training, the have no personal skills."
good,I have learned how to handle different medicaid claims and members. I like talking to the different members that call in about their claims and their medicaid accounts
good,"Good company to work on health care domain with good support from client. "
good,Great place to get your career started.  Never ending changes on a daily basis.  Learned alot throughout my time at Molina. Opportunity for growth within the company.
good,cool day at work take calls daily you learn different things everyday the work culture is cool and laid back the hardest part about the job is you have to keep repeating thing over and over
good,"I wasn't there long, but the staff was helpful in helping me get oriented. Molina has had a lot of management turnover, so I'm not sure what the environment is like now.."
good,"Good company to work for, however it is going through some changes and it feels a little unstable at the moment. It will be interesting to see what other changes take place in the next 6-8 months."
good,"Molina is a good place to work at due to the benefits,however, they have been going down the drain with no advancements and little to no pay increase."
good,This job they tell you that it's a good opportunity but after 6 months in the job becomes horrible. Management doesn't know anything. New people they're are hiring are only because they have no one else to work for them and the members are horrible.
good,I would not recommend anyone working in the Care Connections Department for Molina. The upper management at this company is horrible. I would resort to this as a last option.
good,"The culture in this PMO is/was horrendous. The lack of competent leadership is apparent in the constantly conflicting direction given from varying levels of management, often times in the same meeting. I honestly have nothing positive to say about working in and with this PMO organization."
good,Molina is a decent place to work.  Just recently laid of 1500 of its work force - currently we are very understaffed and the work has increased.  I have no more to say Indeed.
good,The company started off very promising; however things started changing once they started facing financial difficulties and things become very robotic and job expectations were not realistic.
good,calls and fast paced managers were a good help and resources were provided as needed when needed.  Place was being remolded and they made sure to keep clean while doing
good,Mis-led and poor communication. The company has good pay. management is spotty. There is poor communication between corporate offices and local offices.
good,Molina is a good company to work for. There is a lot of favoritism that is allowed to occur by management in many departments. I like the laid back dress code
good,"Molina was a great place to work for, Or so I thought. Lots of changes happened and we are being treated like pennies poor management skills on behalf of the owners, work place falling apart"
good,"coming into work was horrible, parking was at least a mile from actual work site. high security in building, if you have to report at 5 am the building security would have to let you in."
good,"Family focused"
good,"Molina is going through a major reorganization at this time. Working environment was good. Management was very understanding and good to work for, Reorganization is not a friendly process."
good,"answered members and providers inquiries, made PCP changes on a daily basis. Assisted members with finding providers around their area whom accepted MHC"
good,Thing begin to change when the new CEO took over and they are restructuring the entire company. A lot of the department are taken over by the corporate office in California.
good,Molina helped me learn a lot about legislation and how it is to implement new laws that impact Manage Care Plans as well as Pilots/projects. I have been able to collaborate with other departments to ensure that new laws/pilots are implemented successfully.
good,"Answer calls from multiple states, give claim status, send claims back to be reviewed/reprocessed, assist with check tracers, appeal status, insurance verification, also portal support calls resetting passwords and unlocking accounts"
good,The work process was constantly changing and it became difficult for others to maintain consistency.  The workload became heavy and it was overwhelming.
good,Disappointed in the company. I was told when hired many advancements. company closed the office I was working at. Employees were told once we won the healthcare bid we would expand. When the bid was won they told us they we were closing our location
good,"Come in take calls help members/providers with any questions."
good,"Ok place to work, my direct Supervisor was great, the Manager of the department not so much. Not much room for advancement if you were a woman, but the pay was ok."
good,"It is a good company, a warm welcome awaits when you get in the building.  You feel like family as soom as you get in. One on one meeting and group meeting are always good to let us know where we are and how we are doing as a team"
good,"Molina grew too fast and where it is today, it can use a leadership with stronger skill sets and diverse experiences to run the enterprise more efficiently."
good,"Although the company's mission and values are wonderful, those aspects don't pay the bills. This company is notorious for low balling their own employees. For many that I know, our jobs are complex but our pay isn't equal to our work. Also, I've noticed that it really is who you know that will advance you. If you happen to be part of a team that is led by someone closer to the top, then you're fine but anyone else, good luck. That's the unfortunate reality. I've experienced and seen the cunning ways of certain leaders and it's not pretty."
good,"The new VP, hiring manager of the Sr Analyst Financial Reporting position at Long Beach, CA, contacted my employer without my consent. This action might jeopardize current job of job applicants."
good,It is a call center with the trails and tribulations that are typical  for a call center.  Sometime there is no one to talk to when problems arise and you need an answer for a problem on the phone.
good,Really cant say much but the company is a Great company to work for just needs to be a little more organized. Nothing more to say. The people are nice needs organization
good,"Management was very understanding, and always ready to give a helping hand if it was needed. My day to day would be making phone calls to healthcare providers and retrieve medical records for HEDIS."
good,Learn as you go.  The skill of multitasking and flexibility will be utilized and needed.  Training is lacking and you will have to draw from skills already gained from other employment.
good,"Work culture is good. Academy has wide variety of courses to offer. Been working for quite sometime. Stable job, good benefits but growth is too slow. Pay scale is little bit lower side when compared to the industry peers."
good,"Molina has great benefits, competitive salary, but they do not offer flexibility with work hours or schedule changes. They  also need to improve the management, son personal lack of experience and skills to keep employees motivated."
good,Started here 3 months ago.  I like the location and the people but management in my department is s joke.  Completely dysfunctional environment.  Morale is very low.  Some people are very helpful others either don't want to help or act like they don't know.  HR is a joke too!
good,"For one of the largest healthcare companies in the world, they are definitely lacking. They hire a lot of family members within the same departments which of course limits opportunity for unrelated people."
good,Overworked with managers that micromanage.  Benefits are good.  They're making millions and don't want to reward their employees accordingly.
good,Molina is very flexible with working around every day life situations. This is a good place to gain some experience but moving up in the company is very difficult to do and pay/benefits are not that great.
good,I enjoyed talking to members of our health plan as well as providers. I also enjoyed making outbound calls to assist members.
good,"Not terribly innovative or forward looking environment. Having said that, I haven't found it to be very different from any other large organization. There is an antiquated dress code which includes a monthly ""jeans"" day. Other than that it's a fine place to work."
good,Visited members to assess their needs based on their stratification levels. Also worked on quality improvement tactics for the program.
good,"Company was very unorganized and the Insurance broker yelled at everyone. The job itself was very easy once you learned what to do, and the people I worked with were nice."
good,A nice place to work if you don't mind the call center environment
good,"After clocking in, we would go in to the clerk boxes and route all faxes to where they had to go. Throughout the day, we would check the urgent spread sheet to check for ant time sensitive letters that needed to go out. Then we would generate our assigned letters. The management was a bit unorganized simply because the Manager we had for a year got a promotion, and we did not know who to report to for a while."
good,A typical cubicle job. Not the most satisfying of work but it pays well and is predictable.
good,Enjoy working with knowledgable co-workers. Friendly people and environment is great.
good,I have increased my skills and knowledge working here. I am looking to even further my career in the industry.
good,Molina healthcare is't a large for profit company so some perks you get with other jobs aren't there. But I'll always miss my coworkers and supervisors as they were as supportive and helpful as they could be.
good,"This is a great place to learn and grow. I was given opportunities here that I would not have gotten at my previous job.  My main issue was with the facility and HR services. Takes months to get anything done. No one returns calls or emails. "
good,"They just aren't willing to accommodate my schedule even after 3 years with the company. The pay is somewhat fair, but with the commute plus cost of living it could be better"
good,"A typical day at work was a balance between answering phones, writing letters to members and physicians, as well as to QA staff. I learned many of the regulations which come with the healthcare system. The workplace culture was mostly Hispanic - but not ever a hint of prejudice or favoritism. The most enjoyable part of the job was resolving issues for both health plan members as well as for the professional staff members."
good,"I have been working here for last 5 years. Got a chance to learn lot of new technologies, dealing with users in different situations, managing teams, communicating and discussing requirements with users. Overall its a very friendly workplace with lot of opportunities at work."
good,I'm still currently an employee with Molina and I love being with my co workers and supervisors. It's a great work environment with friendly people who are always willing to help. The only problem I would say us that I feel like my voice isn't always heard and that I am constantly having to keep track of everything I do.
good,"A typical day at work involves generating leads through the setting up of events in various places. I contact places which I believe will have potential prospects and speak to management at those places. I ask them if I may be given the opportunity to market the Molina Healthcare plan at their establishment. After that, I get a list of my leads that I've generated and set up home visits to tell them about the plan. I follow up on my clients to make certain that they are satisfied with the product and to answer any questions about their plan."
good,"Training is horrible! You are left to learn the job on your own. And just when you get it all figured out, you get moved to another area and are lost all over again. Then you find out that the position you were at before was filled by someone who was also new and had to figure it out. Why not just put the new person in the new position? This process happens over and over!! If a company was looking to fail, and fail miserably, they would follow the Molina plan."
good,I worked at Molina for a long time and over the years there were many changes that occurred. I had so many Managers most were good but some were not. My last couple of years at Molina the Management has gone down hill and i felt like the company was only out for revenue not helping the member.
good,"With the growing of the company, there could be more interactions from management and supervisors - but the agents concerns should always be #1 - the leadership could be trained more and duties should"
good,"Poor comunication from management and poor training. Since the Molina brothers got fired from their positions, everything went down hill, and I mean fast. Layoffs and more layoffs."
good,"The organizations mission is good, however the execution is not good. Management would benefit from more leadership development courses on how to appropriately interact with staff and drive results"
good,taking member and provider calls regarding eligibility benefits and claims. over all a good company to work for even though member services was advised that they will be closing down WI site
good,Molina had a great culture but its drowned in politics and bad leadership. The organization is behind the curve in a lot of key areas and recently was hit by massive layoffs
good,"This company is a good place to work at. Staff is great, awesome. Some management staff are the BEST others, are not that great. Too much micromanaging. Company wide, this organization has the poorest communication ever. Nothing is disseminated properly or effectively. You learn news, procedures, workflow via word of mouth instead of from management, NOT good at all."
good,"Molina is a great company to work for. There is little opportunity for advancement, but overall the company treats their employees well. During Open Enrollment, the stress of working during the fast paced and busy time can get to you but otherwise it is a fun environment to work in."
good,"Moina is a good company to work for.  Being part of the testing team allowed for a great deal of flexibility most of the times.  However, as a remote employee the training is minimal,"
good,The job is overall a okay job it has it's perks and it has it's downs like every job. I came in and work individually at my own pace. This is a  job where you have to take responsibility for yourself no one is over your shoulder/
good,"great environment of people to be around but the pay is low, starting at $14 and $14.65 for leads is low for handling all states of health coverage, also training only 2 weeks and expect to learn everything about healthcare within the time"
good,"Typical day as MSR taking inbound calls at a fast pace while ensuring member's satisfaction concerning benefits, products, and claims.  I've learned a lot about Medicaid and Marketplace, and I've also learned several medical terms when it comes to Claims.  The hardest part was excepting a reduce in pay, and taking on more responsibility."
good,"the ride to get there would be pretty long always tried my best to get there on time but sometimes it was too hard, but in the office just call the customers and help them get appointed to see their doctor and always helping out. some would appreciate others would hang up and be rude."
good,"over all a decent place to work, I enjoyed my job there. Good Managers and the downfall would be subpar pay as well as workload/ratio  long hours and no merit for it, it was just expected."
good,"Good benefits, but caseload to high. New My Ohio dual options program and workload is unrealistic to do correctly. I do home visits, assessment, behavioral health assessments, 155 people on case load that require so much time to fulfill the expectations that it is impossible to fill good about completely all required task."
good,Production and Quality oriented. I learned how to look for information needed for case intake to help my production instead of reading each page word for word but remaining efficient and quality conscious. I learned various faxes that would be routed to specific nurse as urgent request. Faxes coming from providers offices had to be processed as they were received in order to remain in compliance with Medicaid and Medicare guidelines.
good,The pay is good as is the people who you work with. The exception is the management. If you are willing to suck up to your supervisors then you should do okay working for this company.
good,"Good company to work"
good,Overall a good company with multiple opportunities for advancement.
good,"Great place to work and to get your feet wet with the insurance industry. I learned a lot of valuable skills such as multi-lined telephone use, database entry and HIPAA training. The hardest part of the job was not being able to have face to face contact with members. The most enjoyable part of the job was having at least some contact with the members and feeling like you helped them with whatever their issues were."
good,"The flexibility for home situations was amazing. However, they over micromanage and their benefits are no where near great."
good,Worked in Utilization Review and was able to move up.  Not a lot of training once I was supervisor.  I liked the community service that was offered.  Made lots of friends that I have remained friends with.
good,"The work culture at Molina was outstanding for the first 6 years.  All employees were valued and were encouraged to grow within the company and as individuals.  After the Molina family was removed, the culture quickly changed to that of a more profit motivated company, focused primarily on the bottom line and less about individual contributions and value."
good,"The people were great to work with, those who came from larger corporations were inclined to have a more structured work environment. While it was somewhat unorganized and dysfunctional, most people with a history of structure was able to work through some of the barriers. It seemed like they weren't ready for the growth they experienced and maybe didn't have the right people in the right roles."
good,all up to the health plan did not get awarded several regions n the state the environment at Molina was a great place to work. Unfortunately between all of the lay offs and downsizing the environment has become hostile and employees left do not want to work
good,Management to not provide the tools and resources necessary to accomplish our jobs.  Too many cases assigned to one person making impossible.  They set us up to fail from the beginning. The expectations were high and impossible.
good,Although I enjoyed my time there were definitely times that I went home in tears. I worked tireless hours and still could not see the light. There was a lot of turn over and management was not transparent.
good,Molina is a great company. Our employees truly care about the people they serve. Quality is everyone's responsibility and this is the culture we all embrace.
good,I enjoyed the working at Molina. It was a great experience and I would go back in a heart beat. I met I lot of great people and I was able to train and practice many skills.
good,"It  was an amazing company till summer 2017. They cared about the employees and members. New leadership took over, the CEO and founders were removed and the culture is changing a lot. I hope they go back to their roots."
good,Working from home when needed. Working with the employees at the corporate office. The training from the corporate office. Also the flexible hours during the week.
good,"too much given even to new employees as if they had been there for a year to do. Also, work load given to new employees to have to take on 6 months of back log of work to do in 1 to 2 weeks. Not getting trained in specific areas neeedd to perform the job."
good,Current health care climate dependent on Medicare and Medicaid is a rocky place to be at this time.  Stability much needed in such a young environment with an uncertain future due to government desired directions.
good,"great benefits, the raise could be better since only 1 -3 percent annually. loved the co workers and everyone is like family. quarterly bonuses are given based on performance ranging from 150-900 each quarter."
good,Overall my experience was great. They are a great team to work with.  Teamwork was always amazing with the staff. I do admit many of the supervisors and leads could be a bit more considerate to the employees. There was favoritism and it seemed unfair and unjust
good,"Great company, great pay, lots of work to be done, can be tedious and repetitive at times. Great company to work for. Friendly management."
good,"While most of the staff are solid and pleasant to work with, there is quite a bit of turn over and I believe it's largely based on the fact that there is very limited support and structure. Priorities, direction and requirements change throughout the day with little connection to what the impact will be on timelines and the product."
good,"Typical day is reviewing, analyzing, and complete audits to meet report deadlines,."
good,"Supervisors are generally good and care about employees, the company, however, is set on 0-4% salary increase which is discouraging"
good,I worked for the company 5 years. No room for growth. Tenured smart and loyal employees were passed up constantly for advancement because Molina chose to hire outside of the company and often the managers were NOT knowledgeable and they left within a year. Corporate is not involved enough with the other states and seem to turn a deaf ear on what is going on.
good,"Fast growing, dynamic place to work. An opportunity for women to advance in the corporate world."
good,"I worked for this company for almost 5 years and while all other employees worked there less than me, I was the one that got laid off. But I was the only english speaking CM that got laid off."
good,"Molina is going through a change period. New leadership from the very top,  and in between.  "
good,"Due to restructuring, there have been layoffs and department reduction. The company was a great place to work for and unfortunetly many people have had to look for other employment."
good,This company is going through growing pains. Once done it should be another great success. My direct manager was a great leader and wanted everyone else to learn self improvement skills to further their knowledge.
good,"Molina is a fast-paced company with diverse departments, offering a multitude of learning opportunities.  Many departments are able to offer very fair work/life balances."
good,"Molina Healthcare was a great place to work. Great people great experience but within the 3.5 years I was with them there was 4 major lay off 3 of which I survived minus the most recent one. Other than their unstable financial issues, Molina was indeed a great place to work."
good,"A typical day at molina health care was very excited, you get to meet new people on the incoming calls and able to assist them with the daily questions from members. The work environment was awesome with a wonder team management helping along the way."
good,"I've learned a lot here at Molina, regarding Medicare and Medicaid."
good,Employees are vastly underpaid. Corporate management has no interest in the concerns of the lower employees at off-site locations. I have been massive layoffs and the company refuses to hire people to replace them or give us a pay raise because of the additional work that we have to complete now. NowManagement  lied to us about relocation
good,"Company offers amazing benefits for employees and is a welcoming, friendly work environment. Molina Health Care is constantly hiring new employees and is open to hiring people with little experience but that show promise so they can train you into an amazing agent."
good,"must have great customer service and lots of patience to work there.  Supervisor are there to help you succeed, but the Manager will micromanage everything you do."
good,I want to be around positive driving people. we cannot interact with each other we have to sit and be silent. there is no joy in this department. I want more from my everyday being at work.
good,"Company started out well with training, fast-paced environment. Have to be willing to deal with change continuously, company needed to make lots of changes which caused lots of layoffs. Company became more micro manageable"
good,"Molina Healthcare is a great company to work for, in other departments. The community health workers typically drive hundreds of miles per day."
good,"The work was easy and the training was more than adequate and entertaining. After the thourough month long training when you're assigned your cubicle, your allowed to listen to your headset while working."
good,"I was one of the unfortunate individuals who got laid off.  The management also was poor.  Overall, I did not intend to leave Molina Healthcare."
good,If you are not an RN there aren't many opportunities to advance within the company. Compensation is low. Good benefits. PTO is accrued based on hours worked.
good,"Molina healthcare is a entry-level job. I believe for me this company has added to my experiences, and has prepared me to move forward to expand my career venture. Overall it's not a bad company, however they can have more training for the management team."
good,"At the time I was working at Molina Healthcare, I had one of the most, if not the most, difficult training sessions.  Miscommunication of company information was all too common.  Shift bids were the main issue for myself because I was a student at the time and Molina refused to offer me any other options outside of resigning from my position or to cease furthering my education.  Overall, I was very disappointed at the lack of care for employees who were thriving in the workplace."
good,"You are not compensated according to the responsibilities and the stress you carry. Subordinates get paid more than the supervisor."
good,"Management is not local to their clinics and change their minds from one extreme to the other on a daily basis. It makes life difficult because just when you think you've finally got the hang of what they really expect from you, they change the rules again. "
good,"This is a great company to work for, if you live in Albuquerque and don't need to commute everyday. Excellent benefits, Medical, Dental, Vision, 401K, and life insurance."
good,"I am currently employed with Molina as a temp employee. Working with Molina for this past few months has been a great working experience. I have learned so much in such a little time. What we do is Medi-Cal, Covered CA and Molina Enrollment. It is very nice to be able to help people in the healthcare field."
good,"- Answer all inbound calls and assist members with any issues."
good,This is a Long Beach institution. It is expanding accross the country. The grouth is a good thing but it is going through growing pains.
good,"Its not an awful place to work at, but low wages equal constantly working OT. They just did a massive layoff and there are no guarantees that there won't be more layoffs coming. Jobs are slim to none in being able to advance. Management is either too relaxed and doesn't care or super micromanaging. Insurance premiums are going up yet our wages aren't. HR doesn't do anything. They do try to keep morale up, but doesn't always work. Only get 18 days off a year and that's for sick and vacation."
good,a normal day would consist of about 40 calls at most. most calls are complaints due to the company not being organized. websites are not up to date w/ provider info and it cause members & providers to call in for things they should be  able to do on the site.
good,This is a monthly consultant position-review of profiles to match goals and pharmaceutical management and current best practices. Enjoy discussion across the state. Multiple levels of experience of reviewers is great. The goals are very defined.
good,"Management would make  many promises for advancement but no fulfillment when the time came. The Utah office would rather hire outside than promote from within. Pay is ok, as long as you are happy taking what they give you and not what the payscale says you should be making. "
good,A typical day at work consists of answering the phone and talking to members about issues they have with their health insurance
good,"Workload is consistent. Be prepared to see changes within company policies and regulations as the norm and be flexible to adhere to them.  Overall, job is manageable and management supportive."
good,Pretty good company to work for. Loved the ability to work from home occasionally. Good location with plenty of parking. Added a gym so you could work out on lunch or after work.
good,"I enjoying working at Molina, it is a good team that is focused on assisting the customers and resolving their issues. The immediate management is outstanding."
good,I enjoy my work because through the time I have been there I have built business relationships with co workers that has enhanced my knowledge and I have had the opportunity to teach some and help them advance within the company.
good,"Learn many new skills, great office moral, management was great. Training and location was exceptional. Many incentives for employee's that went above and beyond."
good,Call volume is very slow. Not enough on hand training when hitting production parking is pretty far especially for people that work in the mornings. But good management!
good,"The direct supervisors in LTSS for Houston are professional, supportive, knowledgeable, and maintain an open door policy."
good,"Over all experience is good, worked as business analyst role acquired knowledge on systems and supported existing systems. Work culture is good  and organised in good manner."
good,"Fast-paced team adept at changing quickly. People here work hard. There are opportunities to advance and further develop professionally. You are accountable and team has high expectations for performance because the programs we administer are demanding. This workplace isn't a good fit for those who don't want to work hard, quickly adapt to change, or have difficulty receiving feedback they receive."
good,"The parent company of Molina Healthcare is great, with a good mission in helping people of low income secure medical services.  Working for Molina Medicaid Solutions, the Medicaid IT branch of the company is slightly different.  The pay is not not commensurate with education/experience, and is low for the work being done."
good,Very Nice administrative staff and very busy as office as well.  They provide Great programs and Care for the community by accepting only Medical and Medicare insurance only.
good,"I was very passionate about working at Molina due to the way they treat everyone like family.  I enjoyed interacting with the community the most, giving back was the greatest part.  The hardest part was that it was difficult to work there being stretched so thin and with so many responsibilities.  Some days were stressful due to the low resources."
good,"One of the best place to work, good experience in ping pong table excellent team coordination. I learned a lot how to mingle and how to handle team. My team manager was very helpful he is given a suggestions how to work in there."
good,"Great while it lasted, independent work,good onsite cafeteria. Gave me exposure to other areas of medical care and insurance maintenance. Would have preferred higher pay and different hours."
good,"I learned a lot about medical insurance and how to operate a multi-line phone system."
good,I absolutly love my place of work. I would reconmend this company to everyone if your looking for a place to work that is willing to train
good,"Molina is a great place to work, a little slow because we are new to SC. But, in a few years this will be a good place. I enjoy coming to work everyday! Great employees!"
good,"Typical day was waiting for mail to see how our work would go, more mail means busy all day,open up o 1000 single envelopes per day, labeled the doc and scanned, as a file clerk when i ended at the assignment that was alot of papers to keep up with and to file away."
good,Good company to work for any the beginning but due to recent layoffs the environment has changed a little.  Molina has gone through a lot changes but still a good company to work for.
good,"Overall the company is not bad to work for the entry level compensation is good however, there is not much room to advance and for this to be a health insurance company the benefits offered to the staff are horrible."
good,"Paid very well from the beginning, and benefits are great. Can choose to be paid hourly or salaried (and would recommend hourly because overtime does happen if infrequently). Starting position as Case Management Processor is a typical 8 to 5 workload. Keep on top of your documentation. Work quotas were never an issue and one can easily exceed expectations. Everything is done on a computer - learn the keyboard commands. If you can get your foot in the door, I recommend doing so."
good,"Enjoyed working with employees and managers.  Busy place to work.  Technology not always functioning properly and delays in repairs were frustrating. Loved the fitness center.  Cubicles small, 6x6, but appreciated stand-up-desk usage."
good,I really loved my role. Helping members with their urgent care to access needs was very rewarding. I only wish my department hadn't been laid off. Great Employees work at Molina.
good,Molina offers competitive pay and offers great benefits to it's employees. However the company has many great things the foundation could be stronger.
good,"Love the job and the company's vision, particularly when I started almost 3.5 years ago.  With that said, throughout the years, it's been difficult to watch questionable leadership decisions for unqualifued people placed management positions which has resulted in many losses to the company.  Although staff suggestions for improvement has been provided, senior management has always functioned in a reactive manner, instead of a proactive manner.  Senior management has implemented certain things without proper testing, which has also resulted in an overall lack of productivity.  This again has lead to poor decisions and losses.  Apart from that, the company has been wonderful to work for and the those whom I've worked under have been a wealth of knowledge for professional growth.  I've been able to learn so much about healthcare in general."
good,"Terrific, dedicated people.  At the top (at least until recently when the CEO and CFO were replaced), there is a sense of sincerity and inclusion. The Molina family made a concerted effort to include employees in their overall view of the operation."
good,"Job was pretty good, you can get pretty burned out if your a good csr and want to please the member. Management was not more knowledable and that makes a difference."
good,At this time I do not wish to review this company. I do believe that the company for the most part is flexible and understands the importance of family/work life balance
good,Nice place to work. Most departments could use some organization in training new employees better. If there were better training in place the turn around would probably not be so high
good,Upper management was a complete joke.  The company as a whole was amazing and I loved the culture and my team!   They had told me I would be brought on fulltime after my contract and did not follow through...
good,Typical day is busy and productive. I've learned about different lines of business and  lots of rules and a guidelines for Medicaid. Hardest part is lack of training.
good,Molina healthcare is a good place to work. offers 401k which it matches as well as health and dental benefits sick paid days and a life insurance plan sponsored by the company. room for advancement is provided.
good,There is always work to be done. There are constant changes which is normal just something to keep in mind due to contractual obligations. Great benefits. Co-workers are awesome. Make sure you keep communicating issues.
good,"its was different fun work  would go by quick because its  fast pace"
good,"Like what I do, but it is constantly changing and there is no consistency. Upper Management does not provide good motivation for doing a good job."
good,"Great people, good comraderie; good ongoing training weekly; work is never done -however, that is typical of healthcare"
good,great place to work.  fast paced and long work hours but staff and management are very friendly and supportive.  collaborative team and encourages team work.
good,Good experiene and more family oriented business. Great company that values its employees
good,"Always something new going on"
good,Molina is a very fast growing oraganization.  There's always room for additional talent!
good,Molina is a Pilar in the medical field and they are recognized on a global scale. This sheet size of the company makes for an interesting experience for someone with will and drive.
good,Long term care is a complex position however I enjoyed my work experience at Molina. My supervisor and team were amazing and I the benefits were great too.
good,"When I first started at Molina, I could see myself here until retirement. Management only cares about numbers now. You are a number, the member is a number. That is all they care about."
good,I found that as long as you do the work that is asked and kept a low profile things were pretty consistent. Work/home balance is great. The pay scale is fair and plenty of opportunity to learn.
good,"I was good experience a lot to learn daily , the hardest part of the job is the public some time it could be nice people , sad , angry .and you have to be able to have a control of emotion."
good,"Tried to advance in my department but was never given the opportunity because ""was not what they were looking for"". Very Cliquish. Had to go out of my department to advance."
good,"Molina Health Care es una excelente compañia, ofrecen salario competitivo y beneficios marginales."
good,"Molina is a team-oriented organization with cross-training, paid volunteer and group event opportunities.  The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing I'm serving the individuals with quality healthcare."
good,"Enjoy working remotely after adequate training. Good supportive management and a ""family"" workplace culture. The hardest part is managing high needs member's needs vs. work requirements. Social interactions and corporate sponsored fun activities."
good,"they were letting people go for attendance"
good,"As a pharmacy technician, managed care positions are hard to come by. You will sit in a cube all day, talk on the phone, and stare at your computer screen. It is not a bad place to work but is extremely boring."
good,Molina Healthcare is a great company to work for . I love the fact that it was started by a passionate physician. My role in community outreach allowed me to make decisions to improve the lives of the community.
good,Good place to work with good hours. There is always a chance for advancement after you have been there for six months. You are able to gain a lot of knowledge by attending the training programs that are offered.
good,"Not a bad place to work, somewhat stressful due to deadlines and the nature of healthcare work. Management were not great at development and promoting from within. They preferred to hire contractors, and this hurt morale."
good,"Molina was a great company to work with till the marketplace was taken off by the government, Management was alright, hardly around for any assistance due to being in meetings, work was always shifted from working escalations to taking calls to working social media issues to HICS and claims."
good,Going through major changes so there have been layoffs.  Overall the culture is good and the work environment is positive.   I would recommend Molina as a good place to work.
good,"On an average day I take about 50 calls. Between that I do paperwork for reimbursements and member follow up. I will also take the time to train new members on our team after they have left training, as they need the help."
good,Molina is a good organization with loyal employees that is going through some organizational and staff restructuring. Molina has had a significant amount of senior leadership change recently.
good,"with this company a person needs to have patience and empathy because you are dealing with people around the us that needs help with coverage, medical needs, and understanding how insurance works"
good,"the majority of the staff here are friendly, depending on your position and ranking your day can be long and stressful or a walk in the park. I work in a very hectic department and my day can be easy or really rough."
good,"This company is an amazing place to work, offers good culture and benefits. When it comes to advancement or transferring within the company, it is difficult to do unless you know the right people."
good,A lot of opportunity to work on diverse projects. Nice people. Great working environment with plenty of space to spread out and get your work done. The management seems to know what they're doing.
good,"Molina is a Great place to work and offer great medical benefits. The opportunity for growth is good, BUT, if you are under the wrong leadership, you may find yourself stuck. Since there is no union here, management pretty much has to like you for you to succeed. There are people in management that can't manage their own lives, so they don't make good people managers"
good,The ability to work from home when necessary due to a family illness or when needing to complete work late at night to get a report completed. Co-workers who were cross trained to help out with work load.
good,I am one of the younger employees and Molina healthcare boasts an understanding team in reference to school and modifying schedules. This was my main motivation for going but through m time there I found other motivations for staying.
good,enjoyed being back in an area that would offer stability from so much previous change. enjoyed the change of pace and the challenge of a new position.
good,"In this department I have learned to be productive and proactive. All my assignments were in a timely matter and was close to details. It required a lot of research and clarification. My job was to add provider, groups and hospitals into the system to affiliate them with Molina healthcare insurance to either allow members and doctors to be assigned to that specific group, provider or hospital and affiliate them to be able to get paid."
good,"My typical day at work: Was at a computer screen 10 hours a day reviewing cases to approve for surgeries, therapies, rehabilitation, etc... Management was not as approachable as other work environments I have been at... Co-workers were awesome... My hardest part of the job was staying in my cubicle 10 hours a day... I need to be moving around... The most enjoyable part of my job was I learned a great deal about insurance company's and how they work .."
good,"The departments within the organizations are vast and there's always room for growth if you seek the right mentor ship. I can describe he company in one word, longevity."
good,Since taking the company over from the Molina Family much changed. They are becoming more of a conglomerate and less interested in their clients. Some of their top staff seem to come from United HealthCare. This is in direct conflict with their business goals and model. Layoffs and RIF's are customary just prior to bonus time for the heads of the company. Then mass hirings after the fiscal year. The tendency when I left was everything from above and no return communication.
good,"The work culture is good, typically a day shift and sometimes needs work for extra hours based on the work demand. Management is well supported by work."
good,"The pay is good, flexible hours and optional overtime. There is a lack of communication between upper management and the other staff. Coworkers are friendly and Directors try to show appreciation for the staff at their locations."
good,"It can be a great place when you have leadership who a acknowledge and appreciate great work."
good,Molina healthcare offers a great work/life balance.  I am looking for employment outside of the company because room for advancement doesn't seem possible.
good,"Non Applicable, it’s good to work as a team and there are very strict with the attendance, there is not sick time, and if we sick we have to work at the office sick"
good,"Enjoyed working with Molina Healthcare and would not have left if company had been given state contract.  Learned a lot, learned good time management skills and enjoyed working as a team."
good,"It was better before the new management team took over. Busy, constant work. You will  never catch up. I don't feel comfortable writing a review about a place I still am employed at."
good,Training is thorough and it is understood that it takes time to learn the job. Production goals can be a little stressful. I have had a good experience with recognition and upward mobility.
good,"I enjoyed working at Molina with staff. Most wete supportive as peers. "
good,"Healthcare is going through changes and as we navigate them, we must realize that organizations will go through changes as well.  I like my job with Molina and would love to continue working there but I am concerned about the future of my position with the organization."
good,"I would take 38-50 calls daily. Generally the customers were calling in about 1 of 4 problems. we had most everything needed to assist the client with their issues. The position was not hard, you just needed to make sure you are able to pay attention to detail and put the caller first."
good,"I really enjoy my current job. I was the 1st person to be employed for the program for which my company hired me. Despite some challenges including visiting patients wherever they live, the program has had a tremendous success and we are 5 nurse practitioners in my area now. I have the possibility to start my day with the most complex patients and finish with those close to my home address."
good,Molina Healthcare is a FORTUNE 500 company that is focused exclusively on government-sponsored health care programs for families and individuals who qualify for government sponsored health care.
good,Molina Healthcare is a Fortune 500 company and has a lot of perks. You just cannot get promoted if you are not in the 'in' crowd. If you're looking for a job that gives you a paycheck then this is the place for you!
good,"A typical day at work would involve constant income of claims. The hardest part was keeping up because the job was fast-paced but, that part was also enjoyable. I learned a lot on the job when it comes to verifying claims. The job was also enjoyable because it was formatted much like a family. We were every connected."
good,"Molina is a great company with good benefits, however management needs to change they need to be more flexible with the employees. Perks and vto are amazing!"
good,Enjoyed working at Molina. Compensation was poor. Work case load was a lot. Carried about 60 members on case load. Also sometimes had to do home visits with unsafe members. Members that were recently released from prison.
good,I feel they could have handle layoff with more sense of humanity instead of being treated like a number. the company has laidoff personell in a moments notice instead of allowing the employee time to adjust and  or finish the project at hand.
good,"This opportunity provides a variety of tasks which include pharmacy prior authorization reviews, medical reviews, and MTM services.  This is a great company to get to know great people and the people are what makes you want to stay and do your best."
good,"Typical day was low stress. Very structured, I always knew what my first task of the day was and was very easy to get into a rhythm once I began. "
good,"I have worked at Molina for almost two years and the management is flexible and understanding. If you need to take some time off work for an appointment or other life events, you can accrue hours during the week so you do not have to take use your paid time off. A typical day at Molina entails answering emails, a team huddle, loading appeals and helping another department complete their work. I have learned the process of appealing unpaid or underpaid claims and the value collaboration. The workplace culture can be stressful - there is always something to learn and issues that needs to be resolved within a timely manner. However, the managers try their best to make the workplace more enjoyable. The hardest part of my job is having to not only complete my task in a timely manner, but to help others complete theirs as well since every thing is time-sensitive. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to have an open conversation with my manager no matter what the issue may be. I also enjoy working towards a goal that I need to complete at the end of the day."

good,"I enjoyed most of the people that I worked with as well as the flex times.  I also enjoyed being able to listen to my headset while in working hours as well as the company gave us food days and expressed our accomplishments often.  I did not enjoy the flex pay in regards to Molina, I felt as though as a new product that some of the pay decreases due to error should have been negotiable as they were a brand new product.  Some of our data versus their data did not match and we were penalized.  This caused me to receive pay way below scale."
good,"As a UM nurse reviewer, your day is busy completing reviews, taking provider calls, preparing for rounds, etc. It definitely requires being organized. Supervisory and training staff are very helpful; it is very professional. I became more educated in the discharge needs of a patient working with case management. I enjoyed going to work every day.

I am truly lucky to work at a job where everyday brings something new to learn which helps me grow professionally.  I have learned more about the state of FL standards for LTC healthcare programs. It has been exciting to use all of my years of experience in the healthcare field to assist members in the community and in facilities.
good,"I enjoyed every minute of working there. Great people to work with. It felt good that everyone relied on you for support. The toughest thing for me while working there was dealing with coworkers who were very negative all the time and knowing that no matter what they will always be there if I stayed. I'm a very happy and positive person, I do get frustrated at times but having to deal with coworkers that were always negative was something I couldn't deal with. My manager and supervisor were great. Even though they were located in other states they were always there if you needed them and very supportive. I would've loved to have stayed there and kept working under them but like I stated coworkers were so negative that it was tough going into work. But if I had the chance I'd work there again."
good,I will attempt to explain what I mean by overall great place. This experience I had was relatively new. Molina has just embarked on some new programs.  With a few growing pains it was evident that Molina belonged in New Mexico.  Hopefully over time they will be able to win back the contract and continue to show families that they are exactly who the day they were.

A family oriented company. Not being able to assist and help members and providers.. Helping the members and providers with their needs..
good,I worked here for a while but it was a good place to work. Just a lot of phone calls a day. Management is good depending which supervisor you get. But overall a good company to work for.
good,"The company as a whole was pretty good but they were more concerned with keeping their profits steady than to keep their employees because once they dismissed Dr. Molina everything changed and they blamed their ""financial struggles"" on him and ""were forced to lay people off"". Somehow the company is still making millions but they ""had to let people go"" which makes no sense to me. Benefits were good and there were lots of opportunities but it all depends on your supervisor and your department because it was obvious some where better than others. The people there were almost always great, they attract good people but people are always coming and going."
good,"Great place to work with great benefits and management."
good,"I usually start my day at 7:30am, collaboratively plan my ay, and make sure that the most urgent work gets done first. I check my emails and calendar to try to make plans such as organizing my work and meetings.  That way I can increase my peace for doing work and be more productive for the day."

good,"I have enjoyed my time at Molina Healthcare, and learned a great deal about health plans and outcomes. I would have preferred more face-to-face contact, given my background."
good,"New to the company, lots to offer and plenty of opportunity if your willing to grow and stretch outside your comfort zone. Still lots to learn, looking forward to more opportunities."
good,Best company so far that I have worked for. Management listened and backed their employees. Benefits are great and they offer purchase of their Stock and a reasonable rate. Family oriented company and will not frown if requesting time off for family reasons.
good,"Though I saw that the company was continuing to grow rapidly, I felt that some of the daily and weekly work goals were unrealistic. One can only try to do their best and the management did not seem to appreciate those numbers. Maybe there was a better form of time management that could've been found. I found that while trying to maintain those needed numbers a lot of corners were cut by other co-workers which meant more work for those already trying to maintain."
good,This job was fun and easy. People are always willing to help you. If you do your job right your day will go smooth and fast. Managers are easy to go to and talk about anything.

Overall really easy job with somewhat decent pay."

The president of the Physicians group is intelligent but very biased and dealt unfairly with me for most of the time I was working in Utah.  She was overzealous, emotional and reacted before getting the facts."
good,"Working here is great and I have a great team, which I'm lucky. I think something lacking is the clear policies and procedures on how things are ran. This makes teams reliant on certain people and when those people are out of office things have to ""wait"" until later which presents a problem. Aside from this my personal development in the company has been good. Hard work and collaboration does pay off. Clear communication to your leadership is definitely a need and plus to be able to balance work and life."
good,Typical day at work was answering phone calls entering data in excel sheet. Managment wasnt the great they were discrimintating. The hardest part about the job was the managment

I learned a lot and some very nice people work there.  I would love to be able to do this type of work from home, like some people were able to but I also missed patient care.  It was difficult for me to sit or stand in a cubicle for 8 hours or more, that's why I was hoping to be able to do that type of work from home.  When Molina put in a gym for us, I loved it and I made a lot of friends there and I was able to get some exercise after being in a cubicle for so long."
good,"Excellent Health Insurance"
good,"Very friendly employees. Great place to work. Make phone calls, update excel spreadsheets."

good,The manager was cool. The director was cool. The work was easy. I just got tired of the phones. The supervisor is lazy. Overall it's a good company to work for.
good,I like my job. I find Molina a great place to work. There have been a lot of changes over the last couple of years.  This changes have included layoffs and changes in job responsibilities. So I can understand why people would feel they had a negative experience at Molina.  There continue to be changes and sometimes the job can be very stressful but I still love working for Molina.
good,Helping member's with what they are calling like changing providers or ordering id cards and getting there needs done when they call the work place is great very mellow as far as management some managers needs work but most of all a great place to work

good,"I worked at Molina for 3 years. I really like the company. The management suck, my supervisor was never at her desk.  She could never assist me with any questions i had for her. She has no clue on how to assist the agents. She has management skills but not claims knowledge advising that she would follow up on issues. However, she would never follow up and or reply to the tons of emails sent to her. She has family members and close friends on her team. She doesn't want to see her agents grow. No growth. Stuck in the same position for 3 years with no raise base on the supervisor's say so.My co-workers are awesome. You will learn so much. Some training is online, some on the weekend. Alot of peer training. The company has room for growth under the right supervisor."

good,"Not excited about leaving having to do so to State contract changes. "
good,"Typically, each day is busy with phone calls. I learned more about Medicaid insurance. Management was on site, but not as hands on as necessary at times. The hardest part of the job was taking disrespect from some callers, but that is a part of customer service. The most enjoyable part was accomplishing more complicated calls and issues, and just being able to make people feel better in all."
good,It was fun. They had a putting machine. The culture was diverse and there were frequent potlucks. Great location in downtown Long Beach as well with lots of food choices.
good,"Molina is a great place to work and has given me a lot of valuable gifts that I will cherish and I will be sad when I'm gone.

good,"Molina Healthcare has over 20,000 employees and yet they make you feel like you are a part of the Molina family.  They have a wonderful benefits package which is second to none. The company has many corporate discounts which I have yet to take advantage of but they are there for the taking. Molina emphasizes a strong work/life balance and encourages it's employees to  take the generous paid time off that employees accumalate each month they are employed with Molina. I have been with Molina for seven years now and plan to be with Molina for many more years to come."
good,"Very challenging work environment:  Job was very multi tasked and time constraint.

good,A typical day would start with a stand up meeting as we used to follow the agile methodology.  I had lot to learn as it was my first ServiceNow project.

good,Company was very nice to work for. Management and supervisors were very nice. Work environment safe and quiet. a lot of departments to be able to transfer
good,Definitely loved working here! I was hesitant in leaving and now regret leaving. But their hiring for new positions takes forever. I was interviewed for a new position and 3 months later I got a response. Which led me to leave because an opportunity arrived sooner somewhere else and I really needed the income at the time. There is a lot of growth opportunity depending on the supervisor that you are assigned. I started as a regular employee and within a year I had become a Subject Matter Expert and was given the opportunity to help with new hired employees and special projects. Yo have to be proactive and be nosy with the Molina website and ask numerous questions to leads and take notes to learn all you can and be assertive and volunteer in everything to get known. In Molina its all about Team Work. I highly recommend this job.The latest you will be out by is 6pm if you work for Medicaid.

good,"I was fortunate to start off with the nurse advice line, pay is decent, the supervisors are great people. Benefits package is great, 18 days pto per year is my favorite part of the package."
good,A typical day begins with the assignment of cases to be reviewed.  I learned/brushed up once again on my McKesson Interqual skills. Management was very supportive.  My co-workers were fabulous.  The hardest part of the job was finding that their training was unstructured and therefore fell short of what was required to be able to work efficiently.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with Molina employees that genuinely reflected Molina's corporate values.
good,I enjoy Molina Healthcare INC. It is a fortune 500 company started by a MD and his wife for those less advantaged to help them get access to proper healthcare. I find it very rewarding to work at Molina. One of the best jobs I have every held.
good,There is always change in the insurance industry. Plenty of training and great people to help out.  Management stands behinds its staff and provides the necessary tools to meet and exceed job duties.  The pay is highly comparable to other companies and the ability to move up and around the company start first with internal candidates then moves to outside prospects.  IT and software is probably the biggest complaint.

good,"I processed 150-300 claims for south carolina providers."
good,"Wish there were more opportunities for training within my department. The work/life balance is fantastic and very family oriented. I couldn't ask for a better Director and Manager. I work solo and feel I can reach out to my team at any point but again, wish there was time for training set aside."
good,Molina is a great work environment. Coworkers are very helpful and most managers and higher ups were very nice and accommodating. HR needs work but loved working for Molina.

good,Fast paced environment. Big staff. Management isn't always consistent and neither is the staff. Great place for job growth.

Assist all members with care coordination, medical needs, traditional-non traditional reimbursements. Since being with Molina I have learned what it is like to work directly with members that require a higher lever of care as well as members who are need of assistance with medical direction. We are all in a day to day changes due our contract with the State of New Mexico. We are all on set requirements from the state along with reporting within all standards. Our Co-Workers are as well the most positive people to have in what can be an stressful environments with deadlines.The hardest part of my job as well as any care coordinator there is knowing that you have exhausted all the members benefits and there is not much more you can do. In this instance I always maintain an positive relationship with the members that are assigned to me. Daily communication as well as weekly calls to ensure they know that if something should come up I will be the one to help them and get what they need. I as well enjoy my job because I have been an end user to receiving assistance from New Mexico Medicaid and I know what it feels like to have someone there to help me when I needed it the most. Just hearing someone tell me that I have helped them and they fell comfort in my calls. Makes my job worth it all."

good,Molina has been one of the best companies I’ve worked for. The knowledge i’ve gained over the years has helped my development of my professional career.

In the short time I have worked here I feel I have grown tremendously as an employee."

I was able to learn how to reverse engineer a medical billing claim to refund the providers, reprocess the claim or make the payment. My colleagues were very supportive and knowledgeable if ever I had a question about how to work a claim for a provider. The hardest part about working in medicare/medicaid is keeping up with the ever changing policies and updates to the system. The most important part is to remain flexible and willing to learn.  "

good,"My job is retention calling, helping our members out with any problem solving as best as we can. I talk to almost 150-200 members during the day and each one I come to contact with is such a true Blessing because when they hear that you called to check up on them and want to help out the members are so relieved and shocked. Just to help is a great feeling but to hear it just through the phone and knowing I have saved a life from just that phone call is a heart warming smiling feeling."

good,"I worked as a member Service Rep in West Allis, Wi and I loved my job I didn't have any problems I got along with management, coworkers and when there was a problem that the members were having such as transportation I did see some changes because I spoke with the president of the company when they paid hotel fee, transportation, air flight to California for the classes we had when we were hired in. We also had a corporate credit card so I read everything everyone has said but no one said how the company paid for there flight to California and welcome them into the Molina Family. Maybe some of you have had a bad experience at your location or maybe it was just your attitude but I never had a problem with MOLINA. I give MOLINA KUDOS and I THANK YOU for everything. Just in case you want to know the reason I left is because I am moving out of state. For everyone reading don't let the ones that use to work for MOLINA make you think they are bad to work for try it out yourself. You never know they might just be the bad ones. The hardest part of my job as a member services rep was the members calling and complaining about how the doctors are billing them and not suppose to.
