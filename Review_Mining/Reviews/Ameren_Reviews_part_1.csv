rating,review
bad,"For not enough pay and far too much politics, religion, and bureaucracy, it's a paycheck with benefits. "
bad,Ameren has an issue with persons that have medical conditions.  They do not follow policy of FMLA as they should. Employees have been followed and harassed during their employment.
bad,"When it storms, you're forced to stay.  Management is not very supportive. Your entire life has to revolve around Ameren. Management will not let you forget that you need them and that they don't need you."
bad,"There is still a lot  of racism there. The culture needs to change. Upper management wants to, but some folks have been there for 30+ years! They need new blood .  Too many old timers"
bad,"A great entry level position for a college student but nothing long-term. The bonus structure was sub par and the advancement opportunities are limited,"
bad,Would definitely not recommend working within local operating centers as management.  Very untrustworthy and unprofessional.
bad,"Absolute worst company to work for. Management and Human Resources are ego driven idiots. Would be better at a grade school as that's their level. Completely unprofessional behavior by the ""instructor"" and team leads. I've never met people more motivated by their feelings and hurt ego than this place. It's insane, you think it's a joke until you realize they are serious about their butthurt in which case you realize you're in some kind of nightmare. I don't care how much you think this might be for you, STEER CLEAR. It's the laughing stock of Decatur."
bad,"I worked at Ameren for 10 years and thought I would be there for the long haul.  The company and culture depends on your immediate supervisor.  The last supervisor I had was more than horrible when it came to being fair.  Upper management has no clue what is going on and the company thinks things are changing.  It was an interesting last year at the company.  There are many changes, new senior leadership and lots of ""new"" college grads.  The people that have been there a while are frustrated because they are left out of the new changes and no one in senior leadership cares what is going on.  "
bad,"The job detail is not bad however the management and corporate policies are hard to balance. Employees who have been there for 20 years dont feel they have job security due to ever changing policies. very micro managed to the point of excess stress. mandated overtime is out of control. Employee moral is very low, with management not having any plans to boost."
bad,"Definitely who you know. The company tries to keep employees from advancement, hinders job growth and does not acknowledge employees previous training or experience. They try to keep employees in apprenticeships so they can claim they are training all these employees and justify rate increases."
bad,"Change your address because there’s is no work life balance."
bad,"At Ameren, health and safety is constantly shoved down your throat, until it comes to your health and safety when they want you to be available to work. Senior leaders and management could care less about your personal, emotional, mental health when it comes to being ""top tier customer service"". What about ""top tier EMPLOYEE FOCUS""?! You are expected to work a 10 hour day, sometimes more. Never are you told ""thank you"" or ""good job on that call"". Calls are monitored weekly, and constantly picked apart, told what you've done wrong, and never what you did well."
bad,"Certain managers not in compliance with employment  or contract"
bad,"Benefits are good but this is a corporation, not a family friendly company to work for."
bad,"As a consultant, I was hired for a year contract as a P6 Scheduler. After I started I was assigned to do work that wasn't my experience and I never received clear understanding of what my duties were. On top of it all, I moved over 2500 miles from my family and friends to come here for failure even before I got a chance to start"
bad,"IL side of Ameren could use more diversity. Although they display that is what they are trying to achieve, the population of the IL employees does not represent that policy."
bad,"good place to work"
bad,"Worst experience I’ve had at a Fortune 500 company. If you enjoy being belittled and picked apart, this jobs for you! I would cry in the parking lot every morning! Whatever you’re taught in training is reversed when you get out on the floor!  It’s a revolving door of reps. Every 6 months there’s 6-10 new people on the floor. Once each desk is filled on the floor, they start looking for people to fire."
bad,"Sadly, it was a great place to be a customer service rep. New management, but in last few years higher management has made the job expectations stifling. Negativity and fear of job loss are the motivators. Reps are encouraged to ""rat"" on each other rather than support one another in a highly stressful, high call volume environment. Overtime expected almost year around and can be mandated at any time based on their discretion. It is a thankless job. Find another job to build your career."
bad,"The individuals that were placed as supervisors over my department in the Pioneer Park office were ill equipped to be in that position and therefore there were many problems and complaints by all of my peers.  Also, in this department, there was not much room for growth in the company."
bad,"Not a labor friendly company, management is lack luster unqualified and dishonest,  Not a place for someone looking for a career.  Very undesirable working conditions and fly by the seat of your pants management styles.  Advice keep looking"
bad,"As a current employee, I would be willing to get paid half of my current salary vs dealing with the every day bs. The benefits are great but I don’t think it’s worth your sanity."
bad,"if you haven't been there for more than 15 years, you don't matter. they don't listen to new ideas. they are stuck doing things just because that is the way they have always done them, at least in the IT world."
bad,"It would be helpful if older coworkers are more welcoming to internship student but they are rather hostile. I Had more than two supervisors assinged to me and they have me work on unrelated project as compared to the project that I was hired for. One of the supervisors mentioned  they intended I fail in my internship experience. "
bad,"Started with the best of intentions to stay for a lengthy time. It wasn't long before I learned that regardless of work quality and previous experience, you had no chance for advancement without at least a 2 yr degree. Any advancement was based on seniority + college education. In the interim, the entire premise of the job and possible advancement are based on a very narrow margin of quality control graded calls. When you entire future within the company is based on less than 1/10th of the actual work done, the scales are very much unfairly tipped against you. The support system they provide is a false front. The company presents a very caring compassionate forefront, everyone friendly and welcoming, but the main focus of the company is to prioritize their Diversity and Inclusion message at every turn, when you are supposed to be learning about a new policy, procedure, safety addendum, or software program. I left very deflated knowing that none of my opinions and issues would not be addressed if I spoke my concerns."
bad,"When i started there i used to love going to work. The longer i worked there it got very frustrating. "
bad,great company 35 yrs ago. has gotten progressively worse due to upper managements ineptitude.
bad,Work environment was good. The full time employees were helpful and understanding. Had a good supervisor but management pacified questions of real concern. Hardest part of job was not having benefits or clear expectations on requesting time off or sick time.
bad,"Utility / Energy sector company, headquartered in St Louis."
bad,I feel as though it would be great company to work for if they did not just look for things to fire their employees for. Instead of appreciating the good in their employees they only focus on the negative.
bad,My management doesn’t want teamwork just military style management and micromanagement. My review was totally a bad surprise. No coaching or leadership. It sucked.
good,"The company is focused on their profit goals. Raises have been suspended for non-union salaried employees several, but compensation was adjusted upward for senior management who ""were not making comparable salaries"". Projet budgets were usually overrun."
good,"A typical day at work was very busy and stressful, I learned that the corporate would is very cut throught, management is very insensitive and can be very rude, the culture is very competitive which make a hostile work environment and it is all about who you know there are a lot of husband wife and other relative at the top of the top of the company, the harded part of the job is that everything is such a secret when it come to your performance and i would not recommend work for this company unless you are part of the union. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay."
good,The workplace culture is positive at Ameren.  The asset base is strong and the company is certain to remain an ongoing concern for the foreseeable future.  The balance between newly hired and entrenched workforce remains uncertain.
good,I had a torn rotator cuff injury.  Company denied Work-Comp.  Forced to use regular insurance and had to sue.  Once returned to work as a Certified Repairman I was placed on a 90 pound jack hammer on my first day back.  The supervisor (Sioux Plant) didn't care to take my injury into account in assigning me a job. That did it for me. The money wasn't worth it anymore.  I left the company and couldn't work due to my shoulder not healing properly for the next five years after I left.  There is a saying: Not all money is good money!  I chose my health first.  You can have it!
good,"Broken promises, no place for family, employee input on change not valued, rules bent for some not others, discriminatory, wages are good if you can tolerate the rest"
good,"They work you to the bone and say you should be grateful to have such a good paying job. Thank goodness for the benefits, I needed antidepressants to work there."
good,"Ameren would be an awesome company to work for if they would get rid of the horrible supervision and management. The benefits are good but, the cultural makes it very hard to enjoy going to work everyday. It is supposed to be a safe-to-say culture but, it is absolutely not safe-to-say!"
good,"Last option I would consider.  Old school, too many older employees that need to retire and move on.  Lots of excess overstaffing, waste, hugely bureaucratic, inefficient, tolerate bullying and toxic, retaliatory behaviors by managers.  Directors have no spines or think they are little kings and queens of their universe.  Need Carl Icahn to come in and gut it and start over."
good,If your one of the good ole boys your great. If you question the supervision you may be considered confrontational to supervision and targeted.  So just play along.
good,At some of the remote locations I feel micro managed. I have a few more years to work so I would like a new challenge. We have been through several management changes recently.
good,"First started it was like a ""family"", then several changes were made, they brought in a new Manager, who is all about the ""numbers"" not the people. All of a sudden you couldn't go to the bathroom without someone checking to see if you were in there on your phone or actually using the bathroom. If you were away from your desk for any amount of time, two-minutes up to five without what they considered a good reason they came to see what you were doing, regardless if you were at the copier making copies of items to send to customers."
good,"a typical day includes forecasting generation, daily phy buying/selling, forward fin hedges, physical scheduling, addressing backoffice/operational/accounting issues as they present themselves"
good,"Work was in a coal fired power plant, so it was filthy, hard and hot work, with managers constantly in a state of urgency, even when not needed. The pay was very good; which is the only reason I stayed for 34 years."
good,Complex structure and heavy management layers makes work environment somewhat less productive than it could be. New hires often selected for higher level jobs rather than preparing and promoting from within.
good,"No one in group went out of their way to engage or be social. Would often spend several days focused on task without any more than a hello from coworkers. Work was very monotonous grunt work that needed to be done and was fairly easy but with little challenge or thinking involved. Good experience and learning what Ameren was about, but this particular group was not very friendly or welcoming."
good,"In the position that I hold, a typical day is never typical.  The location and hours change greatly as no two situations are ever the same at the energy centers.  There is always something new to learn, as the resolution of any problem requires development of a new set of skills or inspection method."
good,Some divisions of Ameren are treated better than others.  They have too much of a focus on diversity and not enough on improving their core business of making power.
good,"This is a timed call center environment.  You must make minimum talk time requirements in order to stay employed.  You must also maintain quality goals.  A typical day includes logging in, putting your head set on, and taking calls till assigned break times.  You have the option of sitting or standing through out the day.  Your supervisor and a quality team listen to your calls and review them with you weekly.  There are no other duties.  Management focuses on the quality requirements of each call.  Management does everything they can to make a pleasant work environment, ie, food days, certificates, etc.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with extremely angry customers and, as best you can, to diffuse the situation.  I learned more about the utility industry than I thought possible.  The most enjoyable part of the day was assisting customers with their needs such as starting and stopping service, reviewing billing questions, assisting customers with lowering utility bills.  Coworkers were all very nice."
good,"I was at Ameren for almost 9 years. customer service rep. took calls gas and electric service, made at least 7 calls per hours. bonuses not good  also pay not good"
good,"I was only with the company for a couple months past training (which is the same with most of my entire training class that I started with) before I was let go for having to miss some of training. Training was fun but as everyone that works there will tell you, after training it is very stressful."
good,I loved my job everyone was so amazing. It’s like a family over there. I really wish i could’ve stayed for my co workers but i couldn’t and that’s fine. But the company treats you like family.
good,just come in do your job come home dont get into all that extra things that they have going on . i liked working over time was the best thing of my job
good,"I do not wish to rate this company.  I have worked here and learned a lot of things, but do not want my opinion to affect decisions of anyone reading my resume in any way."
good,"I was working as a consultant thus not entitled for any benefits which Full Time employees get like paid time off, sick leaves and medical insurance etc."
good,"This job was great in the fact that I got to use my drafting skills. I used the program Microstation, which I wasn't extremely familiar with, so now I am fortunate to have gotten the chance to better my skills in that program. It wasn't a hard program to pick up on, but I learn pretty quickly when using the hands on method. I got the experience of working with engineers to make necessary changes to their substation drawings and going back over them to make sure they fit the engineers expectations."
good,It is a good company to work at if willing to manuever office politics. Can be stressful but that can be with any company.  Medical and dental benefits are wonderful.
good,Handling customer concerns with billing and provided services. Learned how the business aspect and the electric and gas services the company provides are delivered to the customer. A very female dominate location in Peoria. Very mentally exhausting with the constant high call volume and lack of support
good,Ameren provides a lot of training in order to help their employees develop and grow within the company. They give lots of feedback on how well you are doing your job. They pay pretty well.
good,OK Company to work for considering the temporary basis of employment there
good,The pay and benefits were great for the area. The co-workers are easy to work with and are willing to help. There are extreme requirements for training and security (nuclear facility).
good,Loved working with the managers and employees. Everyone worked as a team and we all got projects and goals completed timely. Pay is very good but hard to advance in the company and loved the job but being on the phones 90 percent of the time is very stressful.
good,"While I enjoyed my time with this company, it just could not sustain my families needs.  Had this job been full-time, or even led to full-time employment, I would have stayed."
good,"They are doing the best with the changing cards they are being dealt from external forces. Internally they are trying to make the best of it and increase the interest and relevance of what otherwise is pretty mundane work. When there is no competition, there is no sense of urgency about much except internal programs which have the exposure to and anointing of top management. Within these programs, their handlers can do no wrong and $ doesn't seem to be a constraint. In most other areas that actually run the business the $ constraint is very real and is becoming increasingly austere with every budget cycle."
good,"Ameren overall is a good company. Being listed amongst ""The Fortune 500"" companies Ameren is plays the face of diversity and creativity. I emphasis on 'play' as this foundation is set equally amongst all departments. "
good,"Although the culture of the job has changed over the years, my co-workers still make the workplace enjoyable. However, management  is top heavy and completely disconnected from day to day operations.The pay is one of the primary reasons for working here. The compensation and benefits are outstanding!! The ever changing demands of the job are a downside. The demands of the job interferes constantly with family time."
good,Typical mid-western electric & gas utility.  Nothing flashy - focus on operations and execution.
good,A very conservative utility company and the senior management is poor in listening to the employees. We have annual survey but the actionable items never pan out. It has become so bad that people go through motion to fill out the survey and never expect anything out of it.
good,"Within the call center the nature of the work is extremely mentally taxing.  The majority of the calls are irrational customers who are not interested in working the issue out, they are wanting to work the ""system"".  When there are consequences for lack of responsibility, the customers are typically extremely beligerent.  Very, very difficult work tasking."
good,"Good pay, early hours, bland atmosphere. The people I've worked with are extremely pleasant, however. The people make it bearable. The location makes it impossible to go out for lunch, but that's okay"
good,Ameren has amazing benefits but the opportunity for advancement is not there.  Management and co-workers were great.  Hardest part of the job is being straight with customers.
good,"Strong leadership at highest levels, but it becomes muddled in the middle because of people who have been in the same job for 30 years. Many people assume they will be promoted because they are next in line after their supervisor retires. Low diversity."
good,"Work start at 0700 I get in at 0630 to relieve the other supervisor. We talk about what has happen that day on operations. Then I contact the other supervisors to find out what is going to be worked on today and have it ready and tagged out. Then at 0700 the operators relieve on sift we talk about what's going on today. We talk about any safety concerns they have and what is on the plans of the day.We keep track of boiler chemistry and add chemical if needed"
good,Its okay the environment was a little out of the ordinary inound outbound calls data entry
good,"I was not contacted for 3 months after the interview.  The work was not what I was expecting. The people were nice the work was interesting.  It was in another state I'd have to join a union and work within their regulations.  It was a 50 mile round trip drive each day, which wasn't worth the pay"
good,"A typical day at the Ameren call center is answer  in-coming calls and assist customers with their questions and concerns. You may also have clerical duties like sorting and distributing mail, as well as assisting customer via email communication."
good,The work life balance is great. the pay could be more competitive on a national level but the pay is good for the region. The company is large and sometimes objectives get lost or out of focus.
good,"I learned a lot about collaborating with other departments. The most frusterating part about working at Ameren communication between the union and management, it can be difficult to find answers to questions."
good,"Friendly and family based environment. Numbers speak for themselves. The hardest part of the job is staying to yourself and out of work relations, and the best part of the job is completeing the work day."
good,"Great employees, dedicated to getting the job done. Innovative and willing to explore new ideas and ways of doing things,"
good,"The company has been proactive in a challenging and diverse energy setting that has developed nationally.  Great company, great people working at the company."
good,"office work, handle incoming payments, via e-mail, and regular mail"
good,A typical day at work would be sitting in the office doing my work on the computer. Management at our workplace is very helpful and understanding.
good,"Worked for Ameren for a very very long time."
good,"As customer service rep. I took care of all inquires from customers, setting up and disconnecting service, making payment agreements and dispatching for outages and gas leaks."
good,"Lots of work, learned a lot in this position, co-workers are hard workers good to work with, nothing really hard about the job, all prts of the job I enjoy."
good,Customer service is the worst department within the company. We all have different responsibilities but they treat each department as if we all take phone calls
good,Fun place to work with exceptional benefits.  Hard to move up and if you turn down a promotion don't expect to be ever asked again.  Very top down mgt. style (military).  Have many union employees working in what are traditional salaried positions which I found quite bureaucratic and which slowed progress.
good,This was a temporary position. I enjoyed the short time I worked for the company. It was a very pleasant environment. I will definitely apply now that I am job searching.
good,"I was originally hired as a temp for a 6 week period.  The HR staff at Ameren allowed me to showcase my admin skills and my assignment was extended for an additional 6 months.  Unfortunately there were no positions available at the completion of my assignment.  By far, Ameren is one of, if not the best, company i have worked for."
good,"This is your typical big company with lots of technical debt and no plan to fix what is broken. The management doesn't hire from within so there is limited room for growth. The pension and benefits are nice, but the pay doesn't come close to market rates. It is a good place to work for people that want a long career with one company. Not a good place for people that want to work with the latest tools and technologies and want market leading pay. Expect to work after-hours and weekends if you are in development or operations in IT."
good,"Good company, however it is slow to change.  Work life balance is good, management can be challenging, advancement can be tough,, but overall a good place to work."
good,"Ameren has been making strides to improved personnel safety and continuous, reliable service to its customers.  Co-workers at the Callaway Energy Center are generally cooperative."
good,Great team of people. Responsive manager and a good environment to work in. Fast paced but not micro managed. Good location with easy access to St. Louis airport.
good,"Being outside  all summer was not the best idea for someone who usually spends their days indoors, but being to meet new people every day was entertaining."
good,"This was a great place to work.  My pay rose very quickly and there were many  opportunites for advancement.  Unfortunately, I was at a stand still with moving up and I resigned after 10 years to pursue my Bachelors.  Now I am working on my Masters."
good,"Great benefits, competitive salary, work life balance is a little challenging in certain departments, great  coworkers, too many politics at times within upper management."
good,"Ameren was a good company to work for, but was also very physical and time demanding. I was able to advance through apprenticeship program, and make a good living for a high school graduate. Overtime to keep power plants online required a lot of time away from family. Co-workers were excellent, management sometimes very demanding out of necessity."
good,"Ameren was a good place to work,you got to work on a variety of powerhouse components and with alot of great people."
good,"Ameren gives great benefits and work/life balance. Unfortunately, if you don’t start out early with this company, you are pretty stuck in the position you in which you’ Hired."
good,"Ameren was a great overall place to work. My supervisor was a great leader and taught me a lot. I worked in the gas storage department and learned a lot about the processes involved in providing natural gas to customers, how it is stored, and the importance of natural gas safety. I worked with five engineers, a few interns who were in the process of being engineers, and other department employees. The engineers were great to work with."
good,"Nice please to work, friendly atmosphere. After a year of employment will you will have to  opportunity to advance in the company.  There is overtime available."
good,"Ameren personnel  allowed Me the contractor Project Manager to "
good,"Good place to work and has been good to me for many years."
good,"Federal Reserve system really interested me, and I was sad to leave due to some outsourcing issues.  Employees are mostly genuine and honest, and strive to make the enconomy better."
good,Was a good company and the people were all great to be around.
good,"This is a very big company with lots of change happening. The benefits are excellent, and there are a lot of great people there. Particularly good for those just starting out."
good,Ameren was an excellent place to work. I was offered a considerable amount of training and support. The benefits were well above average for the position I had.
good,Good place to work with many benefits.  Ameren covers a large part of Illinois and Missouri.  Culture is very focused on safety.  One of the difficult things about working at Ameren is that they like to implement things before they are really prepared or have trained employees about the changes.  Ameren is a good place to work overall.
good,"Unionized environment"
good,"Public Utility that strive to provide a good service to its customers ."
good,Great place to work and leadership that is willing to mentor all so they have a very well knowledge of the company's business and culture. There are multiple opportunities to advance within the company.
good,"Ameren is a great place to work concerning the wage & benefits offered to employees.  The work family you create is awesome, Ameren is family oriented and family comes first.  There are opportunities for advancement various times throughout the year.  Vacation, sick time, paid holidays and FMLA are offered.   Recognition of major holidays are also celebrated.  Immediate supervisors are available for employees at any time and use every resource available to assist employees, very supportive.  The hardest part of the job is the mandatory OT plus you have to volunteer also.  The most stressful times for calls are March through October of each year.  Disconnecting of utilities begins April 1st of each year, then begins the college move in & move out of students.  Call volume is extremely high and a lot of stressed and tired coworkers,  Most enjoyable part of job was being able to actually  the customer with a one call resolution that met or exceeded their request..  It definitely requires the desire and drive to help people to your fullest ability."
good,"Inbound Calls pertaining to customers gas and electric bills. Setup arrangements, explained their bills, disconnect and issue re-connects to the field techs."
good,"Ameren is a good, steady company.  It provides a secure work environment.  There is a good culture among employees and it is a fun place to work.  The one criticism I heard from employees is that is can be slow paced."
good,"Able to work with little to now direct oversight on major projects and presentations for sales and management. Was frequently called on to work on ad hoc projects and produce actionable point-of-view (POV) analysis. Enjoyed working with trader, sales and management teams. It was difficult sometimes getting all the information needed to produce and feel comfortable producing actionable POV anaysis."
good,Excellent Benefits.  They treat their people right.  Plant that I worked at was sold to another company.  The new company did away with a lot of people.
good,"Very good company with great pay and benefits. Culture is good, with management up to speed on what is going on at the lower level. Management cares about employee safety."
good,Great company I enjoyed it. they were always eating and having parties. the company really care for its employees and didn't mind showing it...............
good,I enjoy working at Ameren.  I received extensive training to prepare for the job duties.  They always gave support to grow and move within the company.
good,I have grown through Securitas. I have learned a variety of things that will help me advance my career.I have worked for Securitas for almost nine years but I do believe that it is time to move on. The benefits and pay are not all that great and I know for a fact that I will be a wonderful asset for whatever company that I work for. I chose to continue my education so that i would have an oppurtunity at a great job.
good,Great place to work with excellent pay and and offering benefits.
good,"Very friendly, focused employees. Great professional corporate culture. "
good,"I have learned alot about working in microstation, falcon, and smarteam. My co-workers have taught me a lot."
good,its a good career if you like working in all weather coniditions.  A lot of overtime and plenty of time off when you get your time in...................
good,Great company. But not much training for advancement. No upward mobility. They keep you part time working three days a week for a year or longer. The benefits for part time are really expensive and affordable.
good,"Lots of work, learn a lot through my career here, co- workers are great to work with, Hardest part of the job was being on the Road 95% of the time. Different things to learn all the time."
good,"Ameren is a great place to work.  They have excellent benefits, training and job security."
good,Ameren is a great company with great benefits.  I would probably have stayed at Ameren until retirement but I am not going to be retiring in the St Louis area.
good,I have had a very good experience working for Ameren. I have gain experience to move on.It is a very productive place  to work.  Good people to work for.
good,"I was a temporary employee when I worked there but the department I was in was very friendly.  They never made me feel like a temp.  They were very accommodating if you had to adjust your hours due to home life, very thorough training but also very willing to answer any questions you had."
good,The day consist of being on the phone dealing with customer requests. The pay is great with constant pay increases. There are lots of opportunities for advancement. Being on the phones the reps are micromanaged due to the strict rules of customer service in the utility industry. The culture is great and the people are better.
good,"Ameren is a great place to work. The culture is very diverse and Ameren is very dedicated to diversity. There are many opportunities to learn on the job, continue your training via outside education institutions or internally through Ameren's Training Group. There are also many opportunities to make ""lateral"" moves into new positions and learn something new. "
good,"I loved working for this company. They were concerned about diversity and their employees, they provided great benefits . I worked well here for 18 years."
good,An excellent company to work for.  Plenty of work challenges and good work environment. Worked on replacing mechanical equipment during a unit outage.
good,"Great pay for simple work. I would recommend working. Great benefits. Stressful at times, but remember each day comes to an end and you start a fresh new day."
good,"There are multiple meetings, trainings and leading. I learned a lot about Lean Continuous Improvement. I enjoyed the cross functional trainings and meeting different parts of the organization"
good,In my position of Utility Man I had many duties. These ranged from lawn care to working inside the coal plant. Towards the end of the internship I was put on a safety team. Our job was to find different safety hazards inside the plant and paint them yellow.
good,"We started the day with a shift turnover & a plant walk thru checking all online equipment. We did water chemistry on all water systems,loading or unloading of different material,brought units online or taking off line depending on needed steam & electrical loads.Management was pretty good,as well as co workers. The hardest part was doing some of the maintenance, the best part was being able to make split second decisions that kept things running smoothly."
good,Load dispatcher for a transmission and sub transmission electrical utility.
good,"I worked at Ameren for a summer before heading back to college.I received the job through the Manpower Employment Company.Due to the fact that it was just a summer job,there was no compensation/benefits package nor was there an opportunity for advancement.So the lack of ratings in those two categories in no way reflect negatively toward the company.Everything about the job was first class.The employees were always helpful and courteous,and really made working there easy and managable due to the inviting work environment."
good,"Everyone in my department got along. Highly technical work in a fun, relaxed atmosphere. Mapping of gas facilities.and calculations of pipeline integrity. Review of completed orders scanned and sent from all over the state.."
good,Relax place to work. Not a lot of stress. Nice lunch room. Your able to take a shower after work lockers in the locker room . Coffee machine in the break area down stairs.
good,"Everyone that works there, are very friendly. The atmosphere is very positive. Sometimes there were some days dealing with costumers when they call in about their high bill."
good,"When I worked there, all jobs were full-time. There were no options for flexible schedules or part-time work. This is why I ended up resigning after 13 years.
