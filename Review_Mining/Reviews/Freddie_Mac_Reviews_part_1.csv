rating,review
bad,"A horrible place to work. This is a place where you see many consultants coming because they knew your managers and hence your job will also be in line to please the consultants. So you would wonder while ia ma working for the company, why my manager is favoring consultants - it is because they come through their family and friends circle."
bad,"had an eye opening experience, bad programming practices that pre date Y2K . My reporting manager had the view that one not being on H1 needs a write up so they are more servient. Making friends in other groups or presenting in business case along with other teams are absolutely shunned and ends up with a write up that effects future growth, bonus. My reporting manager who allegedly graduated from Purdue, had typos in the write up along with fabricated lies of not delivering a project that she herself was presen during hand off. The desperation to control US citizen is pittyful."
bad,"Lot of Politics and no scope for carrier advancement."
bad,"Overall, the company has great benefits, however, stale management and poor leadership is prevalent.  They tell employees they want them to be empowered but handcuff them when they try to make decisions based upon the expertise they hired them for in the first place.   They rarely ever listen to suggestions from employees and have a management in place that bullies their employees.   "
bad,"If you worked hard to obtain that PMP, don't waste it on Freddie Mac - you will receive no respect, have zero authority and be treated like dirt by upper management while your team members will be rewarded for undermining your credibility. It's a kiss-up / kick-down culture in a dysfunctional organization, and believe me, you don't want to go through that. Now, I get four to six calls a week from headhunters trying to get me to go back to work at Freddie Mac and it's not because the mortgage industry is expanding at an astronomical rate - it's because the turnover rate for project managers at Freddie Mac is so high. So skip this gulag and sign on somewhere your skills and talents will be appreciated."
bad,I worked on CSC SOW project. No one knows what is happening in the project. CSC never sits in the meetings and there is no productive system and requirement discussions. 2006 Freddie Mac is much better than 2013 Freddie Mac. It became a Market in stead of positive work culture.
bad,"The job itself was easy and the people for the most part were helpful, don't go in as contractor and you should have a good experiance. other than that yeah it's basic help desk work, lots of sitting and very specific breaks."
bad,"Unless you enjoy boredom - contractor culture is such that you are often invisible, treated a level below FTEs. Have to park miles away and take a shuttle bus in - minimum 30 mins to get to your desk AFTER you get to work. Nickel and dime attitude re timekeeping. Top-heavy, overthought processes fraught by layers of redundant management."
bad,"terrible, stay far away I would not want my worst enemy to have to work there or settle for a job there, use this place for money, time, but it was the worst IT job I've had in 20 yrs"
bad,"1)quick  Team meeting"
bad,"Responsible for specialized duties related to certification mortgage loan documentation."
bad,Hard work is not rewarded.  Office politics are in play.  Management is not fit to be management. Hard work is not appreciated or rewarded.  Office politics are.
bad,"I learned a lot ath FM on how not to."
bad,"Be ready to feel like a slave. FM has changed and not for the better. They hired a bunch of foreigner on visa's because they get 2 for the price of 1. They continuously apply tension, reminding you, that a foreigner can be replace you if you don't work ridiculous hours."
bad,There are a lot of wonderful people who deserve a lot better leadership.  10 years of conservator-ship have made leadership lazy and more focused on looking good rather than delivering on objectives.  Loyalty and leadership are two concepts that escape the senior leadership team and that lack of faith is felt across the enterprise.  Supposed leaders build fiefdoms and focus on themselves rather than collaborating with other divisions to be successful.
bad,"The single most nightmarish position I've ever held. Cut-throat, political and politically-correct, stifling bureaucracy. Managers allowed to lie and run amok and connected employees have free reign to bully and scheme."
bad,"Due to the outsourcing to a global staffing agency, the environment is overwhelmed with a sense of uncertainty, distrust and hostility. This seems to be the culture higher management wants. It's a stupid fatalistic performance enhancement strategy that subscribes to a ""survival of the fittest"" approach. In fact it's just laziness in leadership. Immediately after finally establishing stability and harmony in my team, the team was released."
bad,"Bad company and poor management.  Everyone is worried about the future of the company and only thinks about their survival.  No training.  One on one meeting with manager consisted of a hostile, one sided conversation. I will never apply to a Freddie Mac position for the rest of my career.  Its a sad place to work"
bad,"I would not suggest my worst enemy to work for Securitas. Securitas eventually lost that contract due to a project manager having inappropriate relations with a floating security officer, that should have been terminated several months earlier, in a conference room after hours."
bad,"No growth. Lack of leadership. Director of Business Initiatives group is highly unqualified, and is a task manager at best. No direction and no big picture mentality. Lack of people management skills or technical knowledge."
bad,"not a good place to work for, constant changes with management, all politics and real work is not appreciated, connections, useless goals and reviews, no bonus"
bad,The whole place is a magic show. They're shady. You will provide analysis and recommendations and if they don't like the results because of their own agenda they berate you and change it to fit their own needs regardless of whether or not it's accurate or ethical.
bad,"Segmented work force, company is constantly bogged down in corporate process.  Prides itself on hiring a diverse workforce, language barrier common."
bad,Very antiquated technology. Going back in time -- might as well roll in a typewriter and carbon paper. Acts very much like a typical government agency. Lots of red tape and bureaucracy -- hard to get anything done. You better conform to the culture which is also antiquated or you are out. Run not walk away from this place. The people are also very unprofessional and nasty to work with.
bad,Bait and switch on management.  Manager was terrible.  Ended up leaving after a few months.  I wish that there wasn't a character count because I'm done.
bad,"The management treats you like you are their property. They think they ""own"" you. Signing your time sheet means he is supposed to be God to you."
bad,"All levels of ""management"" in my field were incompetent, poor leadership qualities, micro-managed, very poor people skills. Lack of trust afforded to staff. Employees felt hampered to make decisions based on their knowledge. Fear of making mistakes"
bad,"A young, and blonde analyst from no-name college was promoted from an analyst in a year.  The head of group is a middle-aged white male with little knowledge of mortgage securitization.  Hired a consultant at $200 per hour to help him do his job. The middle-aged white male only talked to the young blonde like she was the only employee in the group, and constantly put other four employees at back burners.  Ridiculous sexiest environment. HR did nothing to prevent or stop this."
bad,"I was a temp here & became a victim of domestic violence. While that person was in jail, I didn’t have anyone to watch my children & shortly afterwards my car was also repoed but I still made it to work. My supervisor was my greatest friend when going through this & told me not to worry, I still had a job. I had to schedule with him coming in 2 hours late with his approval because of cour dates & he said .”it was fine but long story short, he laid me off two weeks later saying “I need you here"
bad,"The organization has an old school view of business and how it functions in the real world.  Leadership team has been in the company 20 plus years each and therefore appear to have been living in a vacuum."
bad,The company has good work life balance but lot of stress in day to day life.
bad,"Very Racist culture, and poor management.  They woo you to get in the door, but they are not geared toward giving your best.  "
bad,"One of the worst places I have ever worked as a contractor. Inept senior management. No sense of team or mission. Dog eat dog and survive the next re-org is the name of the game. Cronyism and attrition being the only means of advancement. I only met and worked with 2-3 solid middle managers who kept their heads above water. The rest were poison and very hard to work with. The ground troops who actually do the work are over worked and not supported very well. Cross team communication is a joke and again, senior management all the way up to the directors had to constantly crack the whip to get teams to align on missions/projects. I can go on but you all get the point now."
bad,"Higher management is more political and have very least technical knowledge, beside they are stubborn and force developers to implement their stupid ideas."
bad,Work at Freddie Mac was interesting. The work is done in teams. They key is to be sure you have a supervisor that knows how to lead.
bad,"Freddie Mac can afford to pay the contractors (Security) more than what they pay them. A typical day at Freddie Mac, starts with me getting to work at 0600 eating breakfast, signing in and then standing at the front door greeting and welcoming the employees and visitors to the building with a Big Good Morning or Good Afternoon, I've learned there computer system management is ok, there are different cultures that work there. The hardest part of the job is standing all day and the most enjoyable part of the job is making everyone who I come in contact with smile."
bad,"Freddie Mac makes homeownership and rental housing more accessible and affordable. Operating in the secondary mortgage market, we keep mortgage capital flowing by purchasing mortgage loans from lenders so they in turn can provide more loans to qualified borrowers. Our mission to provide liquidity, stability, and affordability to the U.S. housing market in all economic conditions extends to all communities from coast to coast."
bad,"If you just want to go to work, do your job and get a paycheck, this is a decent place to work for entry-level employees. If you expect to climb the corporate ladder quickly, though, it's not going to happen. Because nothing happens quickly at Freddie."
bad,"A typical day revolves around resolving important risk and control issues, which in turn, may affect the result of a home owner getting a workout; which always translates to them keeping their homes."
bad,"I was a contractor so my experience may not be representative of most peoples experiences, but it was by far the most difficult companies to work at. The team of 15 analysts had to squeeze into a small room, working 12-17 hour days, we also involuntarily worked weekends. My manager even went as far as to reprimand some coworkers for asking for time on Sundays to go to church. HORRIBLE experience."
bad,would not advise anyone to work here. They change the bonus plan mid month. No one has a clue whats going on
bad,"Bad work culture and there is no work life balance. They will call you anytime after office hours and expect you to be available.  "
bad,Typical day is full of meetings and good learning and management is good but stressful.Too many meetings and hence have to work overtime almost everyday.
bad,Freddie Mac employees were very difficult to work with on project and assignments. I would not recommend it to anyone b/c of the toxic work culture for young people.
bad,"I was a contractor for six months. I was not treated as part of the team, at all."
bad,"joined Freddie Mac about 3 months prior to the layoffs, fraudulent loads. Bad environment. Management lacked basic skills for day to day operations and no leadership / advancement. Favoritism"
bad,"The CTO group was excellent.Overall, I can't say the same thing for Freddie mac as a company. The atmosphere is now almost completely south east Asian and the salaries in general have plummeted."
bad,Opportunities for improving culture for being helpful and supportive in resolving project issues and risk mitigation plans when implementing new technology.
bad,"Contractors are treated like lower class, Bullpin seating, rows of tables lined up with people sit right next to and across from each other on one side of the floor and across the hall is the employees in offices and cubicles.  Micromanagement doesn't work especially when all the Employees are running around doing what ever they want and working from home most of the days."
bad,"It is hard to understand and comprehend business processes, training, deadlines and there are no operating procedures."
bad,Started working there in 2014. Things were going well until the talk of voluntary retirement starting with the age of 50. Started to feel discriminated against my age as well as being put into a position that I was not prepared for nor offered any guidance.
bad,"Poor management. The job description did not match the actual work, which was little more than data entry. The team I worked for was demoralized and was incompetently led."
bad,"Nepotism and cronyism abound!  My manager was non-technical user of the software he was managing; a software that he did not understand how to administer because he was only a user.  His manager was his friend, so he was not reprimanded for his poor performance."
bad,"Visa employees have more chance getting hired than skilled US citizen and more chance to keep the job .. also if you have family member."
bad,New CIO and CTO want the folks for CIT where they come from and are getting rid of the loyal company employees. Seems they have never managed this size of budget and company before.
bad,It has a buddy-buddy culture. CIT is the new IT for Freddie Mac where the new management wants to bring their own known people to run the company's IT.
bad,I have learned a lot in Freddie Mac but they don't like to Hire Military Veterans in fact they let me go with no reason!
bad,"I spent years floundering. It was my first IT job out of college, and there was zero in the way of mentorship or managerial guidance. I don't recommend it!"
bad,"Freddie Mac was my first job after leaving the Bank. I anticipated a great career with a large company, but the competition and the hiring protocols within this company was extremely strict."
bad,An average place to work. We can learn on Home mortgage secondary mortgage domain and there is a lot of scope to learn on home mortgage products. I would say work culture is ok.
bad,"Easy, low stress job. So many people work from home that the halls are empty. There is a gym on site. Very well paid job, but there are a lot of reorgs."
bad,"Poor work culture and improper work management and project planning."
bad,"Great people that I worked with when it came to me looking forward to coming to work. My team was very welcoming from the beginning. "
bad,Good place for full time but bad place for consultants. Wouldn't work here again as a consultant.
bad,Huge discrimination between temp contractors and full time staff
bad,Not happy with management. They have favorites and just try to promote them in incremental cycles. They decide performance ratings much before they request feedback from people you actually worked with and give good ratings/bonus to people they like.
bad,I was in charge of automation for a project and there were many problems with the framework and divisions to where months would pass by and nothing would be changed or implemented. Not that there werent solutions to these issues but either red tape or management would get in the way to find a solution
bad,"I you are young, have no family an ready to work endless hours this is the place for you. High pressure whatever it takes to get the job done environment."
bad,"Freddie Mac is broken down into several independent departments / divisions.  Each one works as a stand-alone entity.  They rarely talk to each other.  There is a lot of duplicate efforts happening within.  Senior Management does not seem to have the experience or control.  Plus, they will not listen to SMEs that have the experience they are trying to incorporate."
bad,Hard to get anything accomplished and too many people who has only known FM their entire career and they stop innovation or even bring in fun to work.
bad,Freddie Mac was created to ensure people had access to credit for the purpose of purchasing homes. The secondary mortgage market provides stability for lenders.
bad,"Management is very demanding, and don't motivate their employees."
bad,"Big corporate that feels more like a government agency. Does have a diverse workforce. However, you will notice people being hired in some areas with big titles are not living up to their titles. More that sometimes, it feels like the company has lowered its standard for hiring people with ability to articulate and communicate effectively."
bad,"Technology is too old. Still EJB 2. Not very good place for contractors. Parking lot is too far. Gym opens only to full-time employees, not contractors."
bad,"Work life balance is great, no doubt. Recently, there is big issue due to incompetent higher management that is causing great problem for career growth."
bad,The leadership is dysfunctional.  More politics than usual corporate environments.  The pay is good and work/life balance is excellent.  Don't go in there expecting to make a career of it.  They will toss you aside if you're a high performer.
bad,"Over all good but not easy.   The issue there (in general) is that underperforming departments must be tolerated by all the other departments.    Thus suck-it-up, that group will not be fixed for at least a year."
bad,"There are two cultures within the same organization.  Teams that male driven, racist, misogynist; and teams that are progressvie.  Managment sees it but it is not addressed. The only way to know it is to be on the inside. The organization has tools in place to combative the old culture; however they are not utilized.. They constently take surveys, but little is done to move those out that refuse to adapt to a inclusive work environment.  If you are so fortunate to get on a progressive team it can turn out to be a good experience.."
bad,Pay is good.  Work is stressful.  Managers are horrid. The only way up is to kiss up and that is no guarantee if you don't have a friend in management don't even think about moving up as it is far too cutthroat.
bad,The company is going through a lot of changes and layoffs so that means that your job could be gone tomorrow. Sometime management is kept in the dark.
bad,"If you can get fulltime employment, it is a great place to work for a while.  Good if you are starting out in your career or are happy to stay in one place indefinitely.  Constant ""reorganizing"" leaves morale fairly low.  Benefits are being cut left and right.  Take advantage of the training opportunities and other perks.  My experience with management was that ""transparency"" did not happen.  No respect given to longtime employees- discouraging.  Very disappointed with the way that management conducts themselves."
bad,Productive work environment.  Consulting practice is very mature. Good learning environment.
bad,It was a challenge to get information approved thru Sr. Management
bad,Freddie is an awesome place to work.  Successful staff have been with the firm for years and grown with the company.  Onsite gym and cafeterias are great!
bad,Big mistake working for them
bad,"Freddie is an ok job, but as a career, there's too much uncertainty about the future that it makes key jobs hard to handle: no investment in innovation or technology yet you are expected to monitor KPI's on a spreadsheet?"
good,"They pay well but do not stand by their employees.  If your position is eliminated, for example, they do not help you or give priority to you for other open positions within the firm."
good,"Depending upon the group you work for, it could an rewarding experience. Most people are dedicated to what they do, but sometimes not open to change, some groups are siloed and does not what other groups are doing resulting in duplication of effort."
good,The guy that I was working with Fred he was good people the owner of the company not so good but I like that flipping houses remodeling I enjoy seeing the end result
good,"Chaotic constantly changing environment . Long hours. Contractors are treated poorly. Dealing with management, "
good,"Management in the Business Rules area of Strategic Delivery demonstrates cronyism on a daily basis.  If you are not one of their 'favorites', they will go out of their way to withhold support and advancement opportunities.  Leadership is poor, at best.  The leadership team understands the technical side of the business but has little to no experience managing people."
good,"Peers seemed to have much less responsibility with more pay. Diversity initiatives are a joke!"
good,"Under NDA to not discuss details of my experience at Freddie Mac.  However, generally, front office employees are well treated; back office employees, much less so."
good,"I think that Freddie Mac is a great place to start a career or be a senior executive. It is not a great place to be in the middle of a career. The compensation for experienced professionals is not good enough to warrant the mountain of bureaucracy and nepotism that is taking place. In addition, there is not much contingent pay on the table for people with a track record of performance. It is not a good place to be a ""deal maker""."
good,"One of the biggest issues I had working at Freddie Mac was the culture shifts, there were a lot of managers that still view dependability from a young employee as overcommunication and being overtly visible...i.e. a brown nose. It is hard to advance in this company if you are viewed as different, your work can be supreme and you can be the best speaker but if people are not ready to receive you because you choose a different lifestyle it is an awful place."
good,"Gives most vacation days that I have seen at any company.  Sometimes a struggle to use before the end of the year. "
good,Great benefits.  Need to improve technology in order to reduce long working hours.  Hired too many consultants because some managers & directors are not as competent.
good,Lots of bureaucracy and hierarchy. Open plan has been adopted yet the organization is still not flat. Remote days allowed and benefits package is pretty good.
good,"Bad managers-  they say they want to improve the culture, but there's a backlash if you say anything negative.  Constantly changing direction but no strategy to move forward"
good,"Just time to move on  not sure what else to say, it’s big, cumbersome rules, but pays well. Not the place to be if you want a stabile IT job as they’re changing up everything again( 5 times in 8 years)"
good,"Freddie Mac is making progress to improve its internal employee culture. Much more open, honest and humble environment. They seem to be hiring a lot from the outside, so that can be good to bring in new people. It can take several tries to get promoted from within."
good,It is an ok place to work.  Several projects to choose from.  To pursue a career makes it a good place to work.  Lots of information available to employees to learn the business
good,"This is a great place to work, but unfortunately, is hindered by an excruciatingly complicated processes structure that contributes to an unnecessary stressful environment."
good,Does not allow for separation from work and family.  Your always on-call (24/7) Everyone wants to be in-charge and there is NOT enough people to support all the work that they want you to do.
good,"Great benefits (medical, dental, vision). Upper management needs thinning out. A lot of employees with not much to do. Needs to be more of a 'lean' company."
good,"Great people to work with, although there is quite a disconnect between management and the workers in the ""trenches"". .Getting laid off because of the supposed re-org was devastating and came as quite a shock.  "
good,"Management changes often"
good,Average company still experiencing management leadership changes.  Work life balance depends on the department vice president.
good,"review 12-15 appraisals, SFR, Condo, Multi-family, verify value of home."
good,"When I joined in 1993, Freddie was a great place with wonderful potential.  However, the culture began to change in 2004 / 2005 as the company went through the accounting restatement and the high level of senior management turnover.  A lot of subject matter expertise had left and was replaced with limited experience."
good,"An ex-contractor with Freddie Mac.  Software developer with the web/email systems.  The systems are complex, there is no help available most of the time and the task deadlines are unachievable.  If the pay wasn't good I'd have bailed out earlier and I'll never go back."
good,It was Fun place with Great team mates. They offered interesting work but required long hours during close time. Also currently the company is dealing with lots of changes and that is impacting the morale of workforce. I have acquired lots of skills during my work-life at this company.
good,Great people to work with and great benefits. Workplace culture is hit and miss depending on what part of the company you work in. Dynamic mortgage industry and great partners in the industry.
good,"I didnt enjoy my tenure at Freddie mac.  It was too stressful.  Managers are supported.  Processes are not well defined.  Work culture is toxic, I would not want to work there again if i can help it."
good,Very bad management.  The manager created a culture of intimidation and fear. Mean and nasty. Witnessed the manager speaking to employees in a very undignified hostile and mean way. The worst boss I ever worked for and one of the worst people il I've met.
good,"Lots of bureaucracy and politics.  Too many layers, culture was horrible but employees are great.  Don't expect too much from management or leadership"
good,Our department has been reorganized under five different officers in less than a year.  They take change to a new level.  Their attitude is that there is always someone on any given team that is below plan and this is not always the case.
good,"There are a lot of meetings and it takes times to get issues resolved to work on.  "
good,"Very large corporation, with multiple levels and various divisions."
good,The department I worked for uses very old technical knowledge. And people focus on following rules and having meetings to collaborate work. too much talking than working.
good,A SAS program development assignment for program conversion. Hardest part was to obtain clear cut requirements. Mid tier management was not familiar with SAS technology at all. A short commute was the enjoyable part.
good,N/A - Teleworking twice a week was a huge benefit and was a main reason for my stay. Too many hoops and politics to move up in the company especially if you are not in with the right people.
good,"I believe many areas of Freddie Mac are great and have good and supporting managers.  Unfortunately, my last manager was absolutely terrible.  No communication, did not provide tools or means to make you successful.  The manager only thought about herself and her success.  Many HR complaints have been made regarding her performance but nothing has been done."
good,It can be a challenging work environment due to the oversight by FHFA and the organization adapting to that oversight.  Most initiatives need approval.
good,"Over all its a good workplace to be a full timer not as a Contractor, lots of processes , controls ,   200% work load, nice cafeteria,  worst "
good,great people. multicultural. many buildings on the campus but they have a shuttle and are close together. The building has a parking for contractors may be improved as it may be 1/2 mile away from the building.
good,"Good culture. Productive company moving in great directions. Great co-workers, network opportunities.  The learning experience is an asset you carry with you to other career opportunities."
good,"Freddie Mac is a secured campus, with five buildings in row that reminds me of a college campus. Cafeteria was delightful and Tysons Corner mall was a five minute ride up the street."
good,"highly bureaucratic, huge cost cutting is going on, Contractors are let go when contract expires, Not a good place for contractors now ."
good,"Overall, a good company, good benefits good facility, good cafeteria, availability to training onsite.   On the downside, they need better managers who are good leaders and role models. Managers that treat everyone fairly and equally without being biased towards a certain group or person(s)."
good,"Pros:"
good,"In my opinion, there is no place for progression and or promotion.  There currently are workers there that have not had a raise in over 5 years.  There is no room for constructive criticism as the slightest bit of disapproval of what someone says  could result in personal vendettas set out by management.  Manager used obscenities  and through temper tantrums at times during team meetings and one on one meetings.  The overall experience there is, however, an amazing place.  The people there are very nice and open to engage in conversations, and will certainly try to help you get ahead, depending on what team you are on."
good,Average work environment. Less opportunity to move up the ladder.
good,"Freddie Mac is a challenging, safe company, but does not favor a technical career path. This culture of limiting the advancement potential of technical folks has only gotten more restrictive over the past 15 or so years.  Otherwise, it is a satisfying company to work for, and I have very fond memories and lifelong friends from my time there."
good,Okay company to work for. However they have a hard time assigning tasks based on skill. Management had no clue on how to match skill with project since they had no technical backgroud
good,Fast paced environment with overlapping deadlines. Great people to work with and many different benefits. There is a lot of room to grow and move around in the company so you don't get burnt out in the same role.
good,"Productive and good learning. Several methodologies and tools to learn and contribute. Great business knowledge, Amazing cafeteria and positive environment"
good,"Contractors are treated as second class citizens, but its a great place for the full time employees. No work from home allowed unless you are full time employees."
good,"I worked at Freddie Mac for about eleven years, in a number of different positions during the Great Recession.  CEO Office was a revolving door, so that made for a frustrating lack of direction at times."
good,"Freddie Mac is a wonderful company with many benefits, work/life balance and good compensation. However, I had a bad experience with my immediate supervisor -- I could not respect or feel good about myself while working for this person. My supervisor's supervisor and the one above that person were almost as bad, since they allowed my boss to behave that way. Plus, all three of them were constantly taking time off, so it was difficult to get anything done."
good,Willing to go with what currently work without process improvements. Typical day require handling two to three project of various sizes.  Many meeting with project manager fairly assertive in follow ups with project team and shareholders
good,"Good company to work  and grow."
good,I worked in ODM and java development.The work was good but overloaded. Other than that it was a good learning experience. I worked in Agile environment so the tasks were fast moving.
good,"Overall, the job culture at Freddie Mac is very relaxed, but at times stressful.  The company has started to have frequent layoffs.  The management staff needs more people skill training as well as knowledge about the specified products in their business areas."
good,"Clean, productive place to work, enjoyed my co-workers they were the most enjoyable part of the job. However advancement is hard and management is poorly trained."
good,"The company stands to make home-ownership affordable, create liquidity and stability in the market place. Which to some of us is very interesting and rewarding."
good,Absolutely a fantastic work environment with great team and management support.
good,"Freddie Mac is a great company to work at for work/life balance. Lots of flexibility in picking hours or teleworking (where it's feasible), gym and cafeteria on site, and overtime is rare. The work can be interesting and the pay is pretty decent."
good,Great place to work with good benefits and work/life balance as a priority.
good,"Learned to use tools on what the job was required. "
good,I got egg on my face for things that truly weren't my fault. I was pitched a certain type of role but when I got there it wasn't at all what I thought we discussed. It was also very cliquey.
good,Excellent place to work.  This company has strong work ethics and is very professional  throughout.  Freddie Mac keeps it’s employees in the know.  They reward their employees for going the extra mile.
good,"Freddie Mac is the favorite company I've worked for so far in my career. First and foremost, the company has an amazing company culture. People are really good to one another here. While people are smart and driven, they also care about making sure that everyone works together well."
good,"Lot to learn about various system"
good,"Working culture is good. But one needs to be self aggressive in grabbing new technology  or new projects  else company will make you  busy in legacy work ,"
good,Very collegial. My area though was awful as the manager was a narcissist. People claim the work of others as benchmarks for their annual goals. People are hired lacking essential skillsets.
good,"Good company overall, but has been slow to make large gains in technology until fairly recently.  Good company, overall good benefits.  Currently under conservatorship with FHFA government regulators, along with its counterpart, FNMA, after the 2008 financial debacle."
good,It was a good company to work for the benefits were good. However it was a strict call center environment. The hours were great. The management could have been chosen better there was a lot of favoritism.
good,"Felt like a book on a shelf. Not a lot of action. Knowledge not so transferable [within software industry], given such an esoteric business space, and obscure government-like operations."
good,"Work Culture needs to improve . "
good,"- Some smart people work here"
good,i was a temp so i had no issues I did what I was ask and they had issues keeping me busy. but overall I did like to few people I meet. they did keep their employees happy and provided free refreshments.
good,Freddie Mac provides flexible workplace environment for the employees. It has a strong vision on new out of the box ideas and implementation and collaboration across different organisation. I feel there is a unique diversity which adds extra value to the company's vision and strategic goals.
good,Fast paced servicing with all the needed support and backing needed to handle the tasks at hand.  There was not much room for advancement.  Nice work life balance.
good,"I have been working at Freddie Mac as a contractor. Worked on 2 different projects. Wonderful people to work with. Get to learn a lot. Projects can be challenging at times, but its a good thing at the end."
good,Great Work Life Balance. The company had a great way of working with employees and developing their technical skills with catering programs that were able to grow them.
good,Great place to work. Overall a pretty good place. Job stability is very low. Good advancement. Much team effort. Management team micro manages on a regular basis
good,The corporate offices were just remodeled to open seating. There is no privacy and it is very loud. It is hard to concentrate. There have been 4 re-orgs in the 3 years I have worked there.
good,"Freddie Mac is fairly investing in new technologies and products which facilitate business operations. From employees' perspectives, we are able to be exposed to new technologies."
good,Great place to work. Plenty of exposure. Great skills to be learned. Wonderful environment and great people to work with. Highly recommended for any new comer
good,It is a place of many people from all walks of life and from all parts of the world. They invested heavily in making sure you have a decent place to work. The on site cafeterias are great.
good,"I had very nice time in that place , They were very helpful and they did every good thing to me , I hope that I go back there some day , The team which i worked with is very nice team"
good,"Constant learning on the feet required in a fast paced environment. Good team structure and decent hours. Great benefits, market rates with management providing a culture for growth."
good,"Management style changed over years some are not familiar with the process roles, more concentration on taking on new task without bringing on more staff to provide sufficient coverage."
good,I worked for Freddie Mac as a software consultant for several months and was not an actual employee so my ratings and answers aren't applicable in this situation.
good,I didnt enjoy my experience here so rather than badmouthing the place I just wont say anything. Like work in any company it all depends on what youre doing.
good,"Dog-eat-dog culture. People are unwilling to explain complex mortgage concepts or provide any help. Teamwork is frowned upon, work is highly independent. Hard to get promoted. Many senior level employees have been there for 20+ years. They pay very well. People cant leave because they are over-paid and revert into survival mode."
good,"Some partiality was exhibited within the Account Receivable department. Carrollton office love to celebrate federal holidays, but promotions were hard to come by."
good,"Great working there."
good,I enjoyed working at Freddie Mac. It was a good transition from active duty military. The position helped broaden my knowledge in IT Security as well as gave me a start in the field.
good,"Upward mobility within the company is difficult. Deciding factors to your success include: work place politics, who you know and made friends with - not necessarily your work, education/ certification level.  Come here to retire or coast, not necessarily to move up."
good,"Scrum meeting daily "
good,"During the potential transition from Public to Private, Freddie Mac was a tough work environment. Not everyone will do well there, as it can be both challenging and dull at the same time"
good,Would recommend for strong commitment to company.  Tremendous workforce and very diverse.  All-inclusive company that empowers individuals to contribute collaboratively.  Work environment is very professional and team-oriented.
good,"I actually worked as a Java Consultant in Freddie. The co-workers are pretty nice. The work load is not much and they respect your personal life. However, the problem is first, there is no plan or management in project. Second, there is too many process or blockade that impact your work and you cannot do much but just wait. Third, the technologies or methodology are out of dated in Freddie."
good,"A backbone to the mortgage industry, Freddie Mac is fundamental for making home ownership possible for millions of Americans.   As an IT employee for over 25 years, I was constantly proud to be part of such an important corporate mission.   "
good,"A typical day at work starts with a scrum call and giving an update of what happened,what we do today and what we plan to do."
good,"I manage and research the mailbox for Dallas and VA office. Requests and escalate the email to right person in Dallas and VA group. Research loan documents, review claims, Run queries through the Access daily, enter update for cash report. Work with Servicers and Realtor daily regarding the property. Work with all the Loan Origination documents, Servicer document, and closing documents. Manage REO presale offers, and file claims.  Hazard claim and Eviction notification."
good,"Gave me a good learning experience, co-workers were good and co-operative."
good,"• Effectively manages a delinquent mortgage portfolio of 300+ accounts"
good,"Cozy place to work, since it's under conservatorship though you can't get a raise"
good,similar in Fannie Mae in many ways. The company is generous in general.
good,Good place to work but has big uncentainty currently. Good benefit and work/life balance.
good,I worked at Freddie Mac during the housing collapse and it was a pleasure to see the hard work put in by all my coworkers to help get our country back in order.
good,Dynamic Environment that provides opportunities for expanding technical skills and professional career growth.
good,Exiting conservatorship and culture is getting more cut throat. Freddie will go public and management is performing a money grab. New CEO is wiping out the old regime
good,I work in FM for six years and my job was ended a week before Thanksgiving when company decided to layoff permanent employee to save money and hire the new candidate as a contractor. We were gathered by telling us a corporate meeting and CEO announced that all employee who are present in this room are no longer employee of FM.
good,Freddie Mac is a typical large corporation with familiar benefits and challenges.  The company is undergoing a multitude of changes trying to exit conservatorship with a new CEO.
good,"Freddie Mac was generally a good place to work. Very good working accommodations, easy commute and work was generally challenging although there were times when it could become mundane and redundant. Overall positive experience."
good,"Money's good, no job security.  Location is not optimal, tons of traffic."
good,"Freddie Mac is a strong flexible employer.    The commercial real estate capital markets are ever evolving and so working within the industry is always changing.  Freddie Mac is no different.  I enjoy the fact that our mission is at the forefront of solving the housing affordability gap crisis in the country.  It feels good to know your work serves this critical social need.  The most difficult aspect of the job is being under conservatorship and the negative outside perception of the GSEs contribution versus risk.  Many benefits of working within the capital markets, such as conference attendance, are not available ."
good,"Company tries to keep pace by offering attractive benefits to the employees, but the culture is tough to get things accomplished. The organization is contently moving teams/groups around, but management and culture does not change, so hard to get things to move forward."
good,Company pays well and offers remote days but advancement and decisions are not based on merit but on who you know. I am not looking for advancement so this is a soured opinion.
good,"Great place for women , flexible working hours. The best part is you can get variety of projects which adds to learning Highly process driven culture."
good,"The working culture is nice. people are helping each other, but the desk setup is a bit tough. The desk space is very very tight. have no space to put any personal stuff."
good,I enjoyed open communication with my VP and felt involved and engaged while managing his group in all aspects in administrative field and enjoyed planning all sorts of team events for my group with satisfactory results which was rewarding to me.  Also enjoyed the diverse cultural environment of our department and the whole organization.
good,"i was an intern here for 4 months.  i had a unique experience working 80+ hours a week. It was a great learning experience and set me up. However, the management was okay and it was a lot."
good,"•	Supervised accounting and reconciliation "
good,"It's not a bad company, the issue with the company is its small, and people in positions of leadership do not dedicate enough effort to grow young employees."
good,"Productive work experience and opportunities. If you're a college graduate, you will find many new opportunities within the company."
good,"A great place to work, but an odd culture to navigate.  Great training and training programs. Good work life balance.  Too many layers of management in some areas and not enough quick responses to address our clients needs sometimes."
good,"Everyone is friendly, and the environment is very laid back. As long as you get your work done, you are never really micromanaged."
good,"Freddie mac best fun place to enjoy your work, my experience as Business analyst was great learned from my seniors, improved my analytical skills and tools."
good,If your looking for stability Freddie has that. If you your looking for excitement and advancement possibilities based on performance and not tenure....then go into the open market...even though Freddie is supposedly independent (its in govt receivership right now) there is still the hand of govt bureaucracy everywhere. The most enjoyable part of FM is they are very flexible with the work/life balance.
good,There are more chances of career growth as freddie mac is adapting to new technologies and implementing them. However the testing work environment is not that suitable to contractors.
good,The work atmosphere was free of distractions but working with a team located in Virginia had its drawbacks and the work was demanding.  Now that I have worked there I would not recommend the position in IT unless you had no other choices.  The DR exercises were very distressing and demanding.
good,"We see a substantial number of transactions, which keeps us aware of what is happening on the market.  Also, Freddie Mac, and many of the organizations that I work with, have some really great people."
good,It's been quite a few years since I worked there but when I was there it was a good place to work for work/life balance. It was not as competitive as a true for-profit business but was a solid company with a good purpose.
good,Good work life balance. Need more opportunity for advancement. Managment is generally looking out for best interests approve of CEO and Facilities are being improved
good,"Culture depends on the department you're hired; It could be work centric Or Work centric with people considered as one of their precious resources. The culture is propelled from top to bottom in Divisional Heads leading up in pushing culture to lowest resource within their scope."
good,"Good place for family life balance.  Management needs more people skills training. Company is loosing their reputable stance as a prestigious company to work for.  "
good,Good work life balance and workplace culture. Great people to work with. Great place to work as a consultant. Once internal it is hard to move up and get a good salary
good,"The company has a great company culture and for a large company, they do a good job of maintaining flexibility and adaptability with their products and processes."
good,"I worked at Freddie Mac for 26 years.  The company has had some struggles in the last few years, but when I retired in 2011, I can honestly say that - while I miss working there, I miss the people the most."
good,"Unfortunately, the culture of the company will not advance past 1972 until the historical relations are exhausted.  The company is still stuck in the 70's with its same management and staff.  90% of the employees including management are vested with at least 15 years."
good,"The secondary mortgage market is endlessly interesting and the reason why the US has 30 year fixed rate mortgages. However, Freddie Mac's recent history is common knowledge, has stressed the enterprise, made workers nervous, and adversely affected its collaborative culture. For example, Freddie Mac used to understand the value of developing resources by encouraging them to work in multiple organizations. Recently, however, they have begun to restrict internal job transitions only to their top performers, which is counter to organizational learning. Too bad."
good,Freddie has done a good job in developing its analyst program
good,Good place to work very professional. Worked days 8 to 5 overtime according to work load. Great co -workers and benefits were good.
good,"A full-length review is not available at this time. The company is experiencing a significant amount of change in terms of process, people, and job culture. A full review will be determined once the changes are implemented."
good,"Good work environment but long, long hours.  Highly stressful. Meeting production numbers is more important than work/life balance.  Good benefits package. Excellent 401K company match."
good,I enjoyed working in Freddie Mac for six years. I started first as a contractor  and then I was hired a full time employee. I managed Citrix farm and worked with the users on daily basis to resolve their issues.
good,"I didn't stay there for long, but while being there I did enjoy my time. I enjoyed all the different buildings that they had. It was a good culture for the people that I worked with"
good,"Great place to work at with many opportunities to learn and grow. Benefits are great and with FMU, there is always something you can learn,"
good,"Freddie Mac offers good work life balance to employees. The benefits here are also pretty good.The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with the team, the hardest part of the job is getting things done as there are lot of controls involved."
good,This is not a bad place to work. You get an excellent work life balance and for the most part there are no long hours and they are open to flexible working arrangements. The benefits are amazing - great health insurance and 401K plans. I find that employees are paid very well.
good,"Working at Freddie feels sort of like working for the government.  It's a large company with some opportunities to move up internally.  Like any big organization, there are lots of internal politics."
good,"Great place to work depending on your nature of job. My job was Very fast paced, required regular long hours. However, you also learn a lot. Most number of trainings offered."
good,"Quasi-government, therefore bureaucratic.  Inefficient, nice place to work if you like to be part of a huge team working on small issues.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with the over abundance of staff."
good,"This place really is about who you know. It is a company with very bright people, but the management can be hit or miss. There are many who are managers but should not be. It can also be hard to move up."
good,"8 hours work daily"
good,"Good place to work, food work life balance culture. Encourage everyone to get training in all the skills required. Well maintained infrastructure makes easy to work."
good,"I would mentor everyone to find a new job every 3 to 5 years in the current environment."
good,The company was based out of West Virginia. There was technically no one there to follow up with with providing better assistance to employee on technical stand point everyone was located at the main office. Which made it difficult to assist with issue that was not covered  properly
good,"My experience working for Freddie Mac is fantastic.  Freddie Mac is a company I have always wanted to work for. My time was only for a year as a contractor, but was asked to stay a little longer due to my work ethic and the ability to accurately make strong decisions."
good,Once you've accepted a particular role in this company you are likely to be locked in that role for your entire tenure. Current management places little value on experience and excessive deference to degrees.
good,Great place to work. Good environment. Proper work life balance. Would highly recommend to work there. Management is the best. Long term contracts. good place.
good,"Cut-throat environment with little leadership at the top (depending on your department).  Everyone has a different experience depending on your manager.  Some employees allowed to work remotely 2+3 days a week, while others cannot work remotely at all."
good,"Great mission, company, clients and colleagues. Buildings are clean and the cafeteria is fantastic. Management is very level-focused and that needs to change.."
good,Great place to work. You can learn a lot from various system applications. Staff are very friendly and very accommodating.
good,Overall a good place to work but can be so much more better if we can get a lean and smart management.
good,"great company to learn and gain good experience, I worked on the following ;"
good,My typical workday consists of entering data from emails recieved and filing them into the proper files and create new files when necessary.
good,enjoyed working in an agile team. Very cooperative developers for testing the Application. Demos and retrospective often helps to develop skill . 2 weeks of iteration is little hectic.Nice cafeteria and lot of varieties of food.
good,I have been working in Freddie Mac for 2 years.We work hard to provide our employees more in return. Its Flexible working in home and we can work from home and in the Location
good,Good Learning environment and fast pace work culture. Management is friendly and provides support to learn new stuff. Teams are good but there is no job security.
good,"Great team, great people to work with. Projects are very short which can be a struggle. But work is interesting and lots of learning. They do not encourage work from home but are not too fussy about 8 hour shifts."
good,"Actively Looking for Sr Program/Project Manager Positions in NJ/NY. More than 17 years of experience in planning, developing and implementing IT Technology and Infrastructure solutions."
good,I worked as a consultant at Freddie on multiple occasions on different projects. Job satisfaction will literally be determined based on what project you are on.
good,"Rewarding experience."
good,"It was an nice work atmosphere. Great location, free parking and shuttle bus from the Metro to the office. Onsite café' in every building."
good,"it's a super chill environment for a finance company. i only left because i wasn't into finance. but as for as finance companies go, this is the place to be."
good,"Freddie Mac makes homeownership and rental housing more accessible and affordable. Operating in the secondary mortgage market, it keeps mortgage capital flowing by purchasing mortgage loans from lenders so they, in turn, can provide more loans to qualified borrowers. Freddie Mac's mission is to provide liquidity, stability, and affordability to the U.S. housing market in all economic conditions extends to all communities from coast to coast."
good,Friendly staff and nice place to learn new things in your field. I did not had work from home provision but it did not bother me. Food here is awesome.
good,It is nice to have BFS experience especially with a company with $2T in assets. The culture is accepting of a diverse background of candidates but the traffic is horrible in McLean.
good,Company is focused on employees and does not always recognize middle management.   Executive Management needs to show consideration to the actual working managers and provide them with support and feedback.
good,Great benefits and culture. Lots of opportunities for collaboration. Difficult to learn new jobs unless in the job as current roles demand full time attention.
good,Good work environment with customer and IT working in same location which gives many new opportunity to directly working for end users and understand and discuss project expectation. There are pros and cons working here... however if you enjoy learning new things.. this is good place.
good,Working at Freddie Mac was a growth opportunity for me and the skills I learned while I was there prepared me for other opportunities.  Promotion for contractors is not always fair are available.
good,"A good place to work and at present focused on technology, compliance, regulation and data-driven management. I had a good experience working at this company and understand that changes in the industry changed the focus of my area of work and l became not part of a strategically important group. I will work again for Freddie Mac if given the opportunity and I still have a few good friends working there."
good,"Freddie Mac provides above average compensation while expecting a low level of skills."
good,"The company is well ran.  Good experience nurturing talent and executing change management.  Worked well with management, directors and senior executive staff."
good,Nice Place to work and it is a continues learning process when you work with this company. Overall it is a very good working experience working in this company.
good,"i loved it - stayed busy, great coworkers, learned a lot about home loans, banks, mortgages. management was good and culture was positive.  enjoyed being challenged"
good,"Organizational culture is a system of shared assumptions, values, and beliefs, which governs how people behave in organizations. These shared values have a strong influence on the people in the organization and dictate how they dress, act, and perform their jobs."
good,"It is a great company with many positive traits.  Opportunity, flexibility, super benefits, and some great people.  It does struggle to find a balance between effectively managing risk and making decisions to be more nimble.  The company is working on changing the culture but change and embracing a new set of values has to come from the top down, and that is not happening quickly.  There is a disconnect between words spoken by leadership and action taken."
good,"Freddie Mac is a great place to start and finish a career. You have many different areas to advance  within the company. They are very interactive with the celebrations of children, women, veterans, the disabled and many more."
good,Smart motivated people doing good things. One challenge is that the perpetual state of conservatorship makes it harder for the company to align itself with long-term business goals.
good,Management is very good about respecting work life balance. I worked in the Single Family Operations department. Training opportunities is excellent
good,"the day when we got customer's pressure "
good,"Dedicated, hard working people who are invested in the mission of the company.  Good benefits and work life balance support."
good,NW region's quality assurance manager.  Lead team of quality assurance personnel in determining repurchase violations and marketing the early years of automated underwriting.
good,FreddieMac is a good place to work. The people are excellent. The job offers many challenges and opportunities for learning.
good,"Like all mortgage/financial industry positions training is usually very poor. This position was no different. Supervisor worked from Texas while 80% of her team worked in Tysons Corner office and she was very insecure about this. She slowly implemented micro managerial tactics to know what and where we were at all times, even a daily log of how many loans we reviewed a day was sent out to the team. The plus side is the stress level is very low and the cafeteria is AMAZING! Imagine like all the options in a mall cafeteria. And a reasonable price. Down side is all the full time workers can work from home 2 times a week but contract workers can't."
good,"I haven't worked at Freddie for a number of years, but remember the culture, the people and the working environment being top notch.r"
good,"Great company to work for but sometimes feel work is not value added. Amazing benefits. Free gym on site with classes, 3 cafeterias, free parking"
good,Excellent career development opportunities if you chose to take advantage of them. Future of the company is unknown. Exceptional benefits package.
good,"Fast Paced Work, Energetic Environment.  Work can become somewhat cookie cutter.  Limited ability to think outside of the box."
good,They train engineers to the industry standards and have their own software division. Good place to learn new technology and to work
good,"A good company to learn and work."
good,"Great benefits, good people, free soda. The commute can be a bit difficult with all the recent construction."
good,"•	Designed and created Risk Sharing Central Data Mart according to business requirements in production."
good,"I worked at Freddie for many years, and found nearly everyone to be capable and hard working."
good,"Working for Freddie Mac was a lot of fun , I just wish there was more of a team . "
good,Very relaxed environment and co-workers. Lot's of perks inside the office including gym and dry cleaning.
good,"It was a pleasure to be a part of Freddie Mac. I learned alot about working in a large organization, dealing with many different levels. The downside was the politics that come along with such a large organization. The workforce is generally a bit older and so it was little harder to form a good team cohesion."
good,Nice place to work. A lot of different departments to work in.
good,The environment was fast paced with very tight deadlines. My co-workers were willing to assist one another for the most part.  The company offers great benefits including telework options.
good,"Freddie Mac has great benefits, but the IT department was continuously re-organizing while I was there, which made for an unstable environment.  In addition, their review practice had a lot to be desired - HR makes it a point to make managers pick and choose 1 person who needs improvement (even if they don't have someone) and only 1 person who can exceed, even if they have multiple people on their team.  This is a ridiculous way to get people engaged, or give feedback to people, since it may not be a rating they deserve."
good,Excellent benefits and amenities. Training classes available and encouraged. Opportunity for promotions within the organization. Work life balance and healthy lifestyle through seminars available and encouraged.
good,It seems good place to work.  But it can be better organized.  There are some many unnecessary work streams and they can be organized in fewer streams easily.
good,"I really needed the cash. The contract position only paid about $14 an hour.  Lots of hard work, but I loved it. The cafeteria was a plus. I was a floater between three distressed loans departments.  I was instrumental in teaching the clients what was expected of them. Many did not report correctly because they didn't know how. I got so many compliments that a full time employee must have felt threatened and requested that I be moved. I helped a lot of people by calling and asking if I could assist them in getting their reporting done on time. They were pleased to have someone who could assist."
good,Working at Freddie Mac as  contractor is not great.  Full time employees are blessed to work at Freddie.  Contractors are not treated great here.  Managers think to squeeze the contractors.
good,"Freddie Mac has not been able to give raises for a while now.  They recently gave employees a raise this year. Additionally, I do not feel that the salaries represent the amount of work we do.  Lastly, there is not a lot of opportunity for promotion."
good,"My time at Freddie Mac was exciting, full of innovation, and I felt supported by management.   I worked there during the crisis, so it was a critical time - I felt Freddie Mac was doing its best to recover, help the banks, servicers, and public, and advance the market in general.  I am happy that I worked there.  I really don't have many cons other than it does take a while to work through government bureaucracy sometimes and that can present timeline and efficiency challenges."
good,"Managers were not overly strict as to what time you came into the office as long as you arrive between the hrs of 6am-9:30am. Had a decent cafeteria that was vegan friendly. High paced work environment, team leads expect high production from team members."
good,Extremely fast paced and stressful. Heavy travel and report writing. But I did loved the assignment as I believe then that I was part of a mission to indirectly help borrowers from losing their homes
good,Great working environment with a true collaborative culture.  A balanced mixture of FTEs and contractors with a lot of opportunity to transition to other opportunities.
good,I gain positive experience everywhere I work.  Positive no negatives I would like to see other people go far and pursue there goals at the company good luck.
good,"I was a temp contractor with the company for a large audit. I worked on several projects there and it was a nice environment. However, contractors were placed at large tables in an open space with no privacy to work. That made it a bit hard to concentrate, but it is understandable."
good,"Nice Place to work where employees are allowed learn and contribute to their satisfaction."
good,Its good company to work for depends on which department you work for. benefits and flexible schedules are really good things to look for. it has a great cafeteria too.
good,"Learned how to work well with others."
good,"It""s a pretty good place to work--- flexible hours, reasonable schedules on tasks etc."
good,"Hiring process is tedious , recruiters are apt to not get back to you after interviews you must chase after them.  Takes too much time to bring people onboard. Once  you are in, and depending on  your department. its a fun, flexible and relaxed place to work."
good,"Overall, a good environment to work. Management and teams are communicate well but there's always room for improvement. There's room for individual growth if you choose to push through the years."
good,"My Manager gave complete liberty to handle all releases, budget and resource allocation in his portfolio. This responsibility made me to excel to  ensure high quality results and deliver on schedule. I did my best  during my tenure and i wish to work with my manager in future if opportunity knocks at Freddie Mac."
good,"It has been a great experience working at FreddieMac. The director was extremely friendly and professional, I had good work/life balance. They have a great cafeteria."
good,"I worked at Freddie Mac for just over 16 years.  I had the opportunity to learn so many new things.  I worked mainly within one division for those 16 years and the people I worked with and for were great, like family.  The company is ever evolving to meet the changing demands of the housing industry."
good,"Good management and fun place to work."
good,"Freddie Mac is a good place to work.  The company adhere's to its mission and supports employee growth and opportunities to advance, where available.  The hardest part of my job is not being able to work from home in another state full time"
good,"I enjoyed my time at Freddie, but over the years the cultured changed from being more a family oriented place to more stiff and corporate. However, not a deal breaker. If not laid off I'd likely still be there. The pay was dreadful getting 3 percent raises a year."
good,"Reorgs, construction, shifts in management and all of it leads to nothing.  Every time a new executive is brought in they feel they need to make major visible changes to justify their being hired.  The changes lead to nothing, middle management doesn't allow good changes to go through and also blocks some of the bad changes so really all that happens is there is another round of instability."
good,"Freddie Mac is a good place to work, where you can get a great work life balance and simultaneously work with the new technologies. The benefits are good and they do care about their employees"
good,"FreddieMac is an interesting place to work because you can be rewarded for your work or totally ignored for your job well done. Meetings are constant and the running joke is ""I don't have time to do my job because I'm always in meetings talking about what I need to do."" The buildings are being redesigned and updated, but like most places of work no it's just a large open area with lots of desks and no privacy, but as long as you're working near your team, it's not a problem. The management can be a little harsh as if they have forgotten what the ""worker bees"" are having to do on a daily basis and the distribution of work is also unfair. Some are working 10 hours a day and others are working for just 6. The company offers competitive benefits and compensation and there's a new VP shaking things up and giving back to the employees. My favorite thing about the company is the employees because at the end of the day we all understand we're in this together and will assist each other when needed."
good,I worked in three separate departments and all were extremely different.  In the thick of operations the teamwork either can make or break the work stream so it was important to have a cohesive bond with your coworkers.  In general a lot of your career success will depend on the department and the manager.  Sometimes the hardest thing is getting a decision made or approved due to a bureaucratic nature.  The CEO is trying to change that and the overall culture but as he found out it takes time.  He remains focused in doing so.
good,"Very good company to work for. Culture is collaborative and team based, but work/life balance needs to improve and office politics needs to be contained."
good,"good company, good atmosphere, helpful training, helpful  staff, very nice office, got to travel a lot.  Really enjoyed my manager and my staff all very good"
good,"Good solid job. Not easy, but a good solid working experience. The culture is diverse, and quite inclusive for all. The management while there was good, and helpful."
good,"Good place to work, stable environment, small company feel with large company perks. Is regulated by the government, so feels like a government agency at times"
good,"Busy place, lots of interesting projects going on. The IT side of the house tries to do good work. Trying to migrate to a true Agile environment takes time and understanding. I truly believe they are trying."
good,A great company with a critical mission for our country.  Fortunate to have a job doing what I am passionate about and working with excellent folks.  Customers are considered partners.
good,I felt welcomed as soon as the start of my internship. My manager was very informative and helpful in my adjustment to a corporate environment. Very diverse.
good,"Professional yet insular. The culture of fear and risk avoidance leads to frustration. This is not a new compliant about Freddie, it's been that way since 2008."
good,Great place to start a career.  Lots of learning potential and lots of talented people.  Benefits are great and there is ample diversity of projects to keep interest.
good,This corporation's huge investments in industry leading technology are creating new opportunities in a field where the products and services provided make a difference in people's lives.
good,"Daily responsibilities include"
good,"Since  Freddie has been under government control the fast paced life is long gone.  Has turned into more of a government office, but the perks are good and the work life is great."
good,Team Lead - Managed Loss Mitigation Negotiators and Closers - ensured proficiency. Trained new associates. Ensure all industry requirements are met pertaining to FHLMC
good,Working for Freddie Mac was great. Working in Loss Mitigation. Helped organize the Making Home Affordable Program. Assisted with managing the closing department. Trained servicers on HAMP.
good,Fun place to work at. Very friendly environment. Management is strict but very relax and approachable at the same time. My colleagues are understandable and ready to help at all time.
good,"I absolutely loved working for Freddie Mac, plenty of work opportunity for a company that supplies everything their employees need to be able to be highly productive and efficient. Benefits are above and beyond with plenty opportunity of advancement within the company. I enjoyed working and learning from my former colleagues, whom I am still in contact with today. "
good,"A typical day at Freddie Mac would be me coming in, and checking my que for tickets. In order to complete the tickets we use remedy ITSM version 8.1 and Service Now. While at Freddie Mac I learned how to Configure users accounts using Active Directory, Microsoft Outlook, and Lotus Notes. I also help with new hire by provisioning of accounts and equipment responsible for the on boarding process. My co workers are very helpful and supportive when it comes to working with me. The management in my department is very ""political"" and straight forward. The hardest part of the job is time management because I can have many different task, but i enjoy working with different people of different ethnicity's."
good,My time at Freddie Mac was a good experience and provided the career challenges that I was seeking.
good,"Colleagues are willing to assist one another, fast paced enviorment with very tight deadlines."
good,Freddie Mac is a great place to work - the people there are nice and they are collaborative. The cafeteria and benefits are great and the pay is in line with industry. Where Freddie can use more work is clearly defining the career trajectory and milestones they expect employees to hit.
good,"Overall a great place to work, but is severely lacking in paying employees what they're worth and not good at moving employees from one internal role to another."
good,To be quite honest I don't have anything bad to say about this company . Overall Good place to work ...................................................
good,Professional and competitive environment.  Can be very fast paced at times so being able to work independently will enable you to keep up.  This can also be a drawback when having a heavy responsibility task load.
good,"The company had many development positions for Java related technologies and people sat in open space next to each other in big tables.  The teams compete with each other for projects and budgets, and there were many political activities going on which affected the atmosphere a bit.  There were many developers for different teams, each recruited by their own team, so to get transferred to another team was a bit difficult.  Other than that, the agile projects management were lean and efficient.  There were separate SIT and UAT testing teams."
good,"Great work life balance here at Freddie Mac.  Though, at times I find the work a little underwhelming and not challenged enough......................."
good,"good place to work for career growth. It is a fast pace work place and i have learned a lot regarding agile methodology, BDD process with good management support. The culture is very diversified and it is really hard to leave the company. The most enjoyable part of the job is you work hard along with some fun."
good,"Of course I could complain about how I believe I am underpaid. I can talk about the political red tape which clogs the decision making for upper tier managers. But instead I want to mention the stability and security of my position. "
good,"Good company to work for. They skillfully balance on the edge between decent salary and stressfulness of work."
good,Job feels secure.  Racial fear everywhere; be on your toes.  Be politically correct and you will survive.  Performance reviews are tense.  Don't put all your eggs in one basket.
good,Freddie provides a lot of opportunity for advancement and change if you live in the DC area; remote positions are far and few between.  Many management improvements over the past few years.
good,"Great place to work if you can put up with politics. A culture of too many meetings, which bigs down efficiency. Great cafeteria and gym, ability to telework"
good,Good company to work for with good work life balance and very good benefits. Frequently there is politics and lack of career advancement opportunities after a certain level.
good,"Freddie is a good company. It's pretty much a straight 40 hours a week company, even in finance where I work, so there's great work-life balance. They offer great benefits and plenty of PTO and management is generally pretty good. That said, it can be hard to move around unless you know someone personally - everything is who you know, not what you know."
good,"Every day casual dress, student loan reimbursement program, free coffee, be prepared to work!  Different management styles, room to grow, some sites have a full cafeteria"
good,"My first job was eliminated, so i found another position to  andi worked my butt off in operations.  The work life balance did not exist in this particular position."
good,As the environment in Freddie Mac is very joy able and perfect place for doing work.And the work in this company is very productive. The team members are very talented. Thank you .

good,"While Management is very political and bureaucratic in nature, this company offers employees great opportunities for work-life-balance at a reasonable pay."
good,As a previous team member the company is doing good work in the REO area to assist homeowners.  The company is aware of how the REO department can impact homeowners and has put some really good programs into place to assist homeowners possibly stay in their home and/or assist the homeowners move to the next phase in their life.
good,"Friendly staff but with micro management. "
good,"A typical wok day for me starts at 7 AM - 3:30 PM, The normal work day is 7.75 hours with a average work week of 38.75 hours.   I have learn how to be open to changes as the environment we work in is always looking for new and improved options for the customers.  My co-workers are always open to step in and help you out if you happen to have a problem or obstacle to handle.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the flexible option for work from home days.  Currently I have tow days a week slotted for WFH, and if we happen to have a period which can be multiple times a month for heavy pricing we are also allowed to WFH those days as well."
good,"Wonderful co-workers and customers, great benefits, and meaningful mission and corporate objectives. People make the job enjoyable and worthwhile."
good,Productive and a fun place to work.  Traffic coming from Maryland can be a little dicey.  Overall very corporate and a nice place to work.
good,"Company is good to work for, however over the years the culture has declined from collaborative, supportive and motivational to defensive and blaming in some areas. This has more to do with Sr. Management and so many different and conflicting corporate goals and strategies. Information is not as forthcoming, and it's become very political. Sr. Management in almost every area has an issue with favoritism."
good,"Trade clearance, settlement and maintenance."
good,Overall it has a good work life balance. People are nice. very friendly. Freddie mac offers a lot of technologically related trainings to people. I have learnt a lot about the business processes at Freddie mac.
good,Dynamic company that is undergoing a business culture change and adapting to a new business environment while trying to outline future steps that will meet future government guidelines and the needs of the marketplace. I learned and worked with new decision modeling software
good,Very good place to learn new concepts and Methods. Good place to grow.

good,Work on different architectural assignments.Pretty good learning into mortgage space
good,The ability to cultivate business relationships in an effort to meet the desired goals in resolving Quality Control repurchases issued to lenders.
good,"Review and analysis of performing, non-performing and loss mitigation loans sold in the secondary market by Sellers/Servicers.  Personable and very knowledgable colleagues, management and Executives. Hardest part of the job is disputing QC Policy & Procedure reviews. The most enjoyable part of the job is being entrusted to manage a large pipeline, with minimal supervision and oversight due to my expertise in the industry."
good,There are some Pros and Cons to working at Freddie Mac but overall being an employee at Freddie has been an excellent experience. 
good,"Over the last 6 years I have used my relationship building and customer service skills to become a great point of reference for servicers in need of specific information on the regional team within Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae regarding workouts, risk management and analyzing financial data. I have had the opportunity to audit many servicers and provided feedback to their senior management on issues negatively impacting compliance and guide support"
good,"Some of the best reasons to work at Freddie Mac included the opportunities to work in different job functions, receive training, develop professionally."
good,"Good quiet location in Mclean. Freddie Mac hires frequently from what I know. As a contractor, i did not benefit from the gym and other faclities that FTE had. Good company to work at and develop your skills."
good,IT department was a good place to work.  Solid co-workers with team oriented goals and achievements.  My manager was very good with work life balance.
good,"I really like working here as I have balanced work and family life."
good,good place to work and it is one of the best place where you can see growth but salary is not that great. Depending on the position respected accordingly
good,I would say the overall culture and environment is comfortable and casual. Very difficult for entry level employees to find mentoring though. The hours are flexible and the cafeteria and gym are nice and accessible.
good,"Good place to learn new technologies and Modern Delivery. good management. "
good,More skills and proficiency in those skills are needed to enjoy the job. Time sensitive and financially sensitive work. Reasonable yet professional quality work expected.
good,"Although Freddie Mac is a fast paced, highly technical environment, team members were committed to their goals and facilitating team members to excel."
good,"It was a bit bureaucratic, but I was used to that."
good,Great company to work for and provides opportunities to advance your career internally!  Provides flexible work schedules and ability to work remotely.
good,I find it highly inappropriate to be required to provide reviews of prior employers. I will not participate in such a survey as it violates privacy laws regardless of whether it's kept anonymously.
good,The biggest problem I see at Freddie Mac is their inability to effectively / correctly manage the resource allocation process for projects and engineering work in IT division.  Many people who have approved allocations to projects are frequently not available.  The reasons for this vary but in the end IT management feels no motivation to correct this issue and have resources under their management work where the approved allocations are.  The culture is to just blame the Project Managers for this even though they have no power to change this in a loose matrix environment.
good,Demanding and fast paced. I learned how to analyze data rapidly and problem solve. Management differed depending on what team you were in. Diverse Culture.
good,"Freddie has culture probs due to its CEO, and bc the very tenured employees have a very entitled outlook.  But colleagues there are extremely smart and well intentioned.  Work life balance is great, and people are highly compensated.  However projects and goals are subject to the whims of its senior exec group - which is predominantly comprised of over 50 white men."
good,"There is constant change at Freddie Mac due to the changes in the economy and housing industry. As a result, you can learn a lot, and no two days are the same. Employees are motivated by the mission, and with the many changes in senior leadership over the last 10 years, the company has changed and is thriving."
good,"I learned a lot while I worked here.  Like all places, your manager matters.  I didn't have the best while I was there but there are plenty of sharp people at this firm.  Don't expect quick advancement here because a lot of lifers are still there clogging the top positions."
good,Change management is continual with an eye toward efficiency and reducing costs.  Many jobs have been automated or eliminated due to customer-facing software advancements.  Jobs in REO fluctuate with the need for support of refinancing home loans.
good,Freddie Mac is a great environment for anyone looking for a company that values work life balance. My experience with management in recent years has been very good and still continues to improve.
good,"Rewarding learning opportunities and career advancement.  Everyone contributed to make it a great place to work."
good,"Great place to work.  Benefits, 401k paid time off and good experience.  Each year inside Freddie Mac is like a decade of external experience.  If you have a chance to work here I highly recommend doing so."
good,"Excellent Work Culture"
good,"Good place to work, good pay/benefits. lots of different opportunities within the company. More IT driven than i would have guessed."
good,"Its a very professional environment, and help is always there when needed. Also the new material that is ever provided to has complete instructions on how the work should be done."
good,Enjoyed the people I worked with.  If you put in hard work there are opportunities to advance.  There can be times where the work is overwhelming along with pressure to get results.
good,"Good work environment. "
good,Nice place to work. If your a Contract worker its not the best. Its Hard to move up but its possible. Most of the managers are very nice and some are just rude and difficult. Life seems to be great for Full time perms here. You can work from home 2 days a week and the parking is good.
good,The company needs to improve their Technology Analyst college hire program considerably. The culture is relatively laid back
good,"This job was challenging, however the REO market is shrinking and there was little job security. The culture is positive and the people are easy to work with."
good,"worked for the asset recovery division , they had asked me to move to Detroit and I was unable to do so. Great place to work"
good,"Huge and complex organization and a major player in the secondary mortgage market.  Takes a while for new people to understand the business due to this complexity. "
good,"In order to advance, you have to know someone in the department or area you want to move into. It is all about who you know."
good,"Job search made easy."
good,It's a large company with many departments and business areas which allow you to concentrate on one baseline work.  The benefits are good and there is a gym at work.  The employees are team workers.
good,"Great people, a lot of smart employees. "
good,A typical day at work was long. I learned that work without zeal is boring. The management style was transparent. My coworkers were focused and determined.
good,Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae also have pretty sophisticated IT environment. Definitely it is one of the places to be if you want to learn about financial management in the mortgage industry and the IT tools to use to get an idea as to what it takes to run a country's mortgage related statistical and bookeeping data.
good,"I worked with so many great people during my time at Freddie Mac. I learned so much, not only about the business and software development life cycle, but also about myself."
good,Excellent company! The Management works with their employees to enable them to succeed. They keep them engaged in different projects and provide opportunities for them to grow. The employees are professional and friendly.
good,"I was a temp employee so I did not get access to the full benefits of the company, however even as  a temp the company was great to work for and rewarding."
good,"Great working environment"
good,"Freddie is a great place to build your career.  If you don't get laid-off.  When the entire Team (except for a few Team-Members of the original Team getting other assignments) and you were eligible for re-hire, you apply, interview, got excellent reviews before lay-off, letters of recommendations and still not re-hired, what is the the real issue?"
good,I have many great memories from my years at Freddie Mac and learned valuable skills along the way.  I would definitely recommend working for them to others.

good,"lots to learn , everyday is always different. good pay and benefits room for growth if  your willing to work for it. great company yearly party and recognition."
good,"Freddie Mac is a great place to work with good work-life balance and friendly coworkers! Due to the heavy focus on mission most teams are open to collaborate. The financial institution mentality makes it difficult to innovate. There are many internal regulations that can hamper Freddie Mac's ability to innovate new products or change old processes and IT. However, this creates great opportunity for management."
good,Nice and warm place to work. learn about the work done behind the mortgage industry. Management is strict at time but often relax depending on one work delivery and performance.

good,"Freddie Mac is a good employer. Large organization, but permits a person to have options within his/her own department and others. "
good,I worked at Freddie Mac for a couple of years but this was by far one of the best companies that I have worked for in my entire career.  The only reason that I am not still an employee at Freddie is because the program that I worked for ended at the end of 2016.  The Making Home Affordable program ended in 2016 and therefore our jobs were eliminated.
good,"overall a great Company to work for , and all good experiences and great people that was pleased with their roles.  good environment, the cafeteria was amazing and would recommend FM to all as a career choice... I am currently seeing a FT opportunity and hoping to become a permanent employee with this GREAT employer"
