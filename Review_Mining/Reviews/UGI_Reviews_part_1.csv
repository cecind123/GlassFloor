bad,none. No comment at this time or in the future in reference to UGI Energy Services or for UGI Utilities. I have no comment at this time.
bad,"Upper management has all the supervisors walking on egg shells. They are scared to make a decision on their own and forget about sticking up for the workers. The pay is good, benefits stink, it is a union shop but the only thing the union does is take your dues. It is a shame UGI does not care about it's employees. I loved meeting most of the customers. It is also a shame UGI cares less about the customers. I have turned peoples gas back on because they were shut off for only owing $1.20. UGI only sees $ signs and does not care how their customers are struggling in this economy. Here is something the PUC should know. All the inside safety inspections that are being done on the inside meters are no good. The so called leak detectors that are being used when the meter readers are doing the inspection do not work!!! They never go off. If the person doing the inspection thinks there is a leak it is because they think they smell something. The manager at the lehigh office knows this but they do not want to spend the money to get detectors that actually work. All they care about is getting the inspections done so they can satisfy the PUC seeing that they must be done every 3 years and they have so many to do."
bad,"Management does anything they can to break Union membership down and terminate the older guys that have been there for 10-20, even 30 years!  They then hire guys off the street for half the wages & benefits the old timers were getting.  Problem is, these new guys don't realize that UGI can terminate 50% of all new hires of a calendar year without cause, justification or seniority.  (read the contract, boys!)  Union officers are a joke!  Many of them are receiving pay for overtime that's not actually been worked.  I guess if you keep the officers happy, the officers have no problem back stabbing and feeding lies to the guys they've worked with for years and called ""friends""."
bad,"In the last 6 months, more then a dozen employees left the company due to unhappiness with their job. Waiting on job evaluations that were due 3-6!months prior, only to find out they got a 2-3 % raise. Lack of communication and upper management are very good at throwing people under the bus. "
bad,Very busy Multi-Tasking. Time goes by quickly. Co-workers work well together as a team.
bad,"Very cut throat atmosphere!  Management constantly seeks to write up/suspend/terminate most senior Union employees in an attempt to break Union membership.  New hires are paid 40% less than senior employees.  Company can also terminate up to 50% of new hires at any time, for any reason, without notification and in total disregard of seniority.  ""Union"" is considered a ""captured Union"".  Officers are a joke and inept.  They are nothing less than ""yes men"" and let the Company do as they please.  IN FACT, the Union President has told Union members, word for word, that ""It's their Company.  They can do what they want...""  I would not recommend UGI or membership in UWUA, Local 406 to ANYONE!!"
bad,"If you're looking for broken culture, people and management then this is the place for you. This place is dysfunctional to say the least. To summarize, the people are highly paid and grossly under motivated. Safety here is the lowest priority and change is not received well. If you are looking for a stressful, dead end and enjoy walking barefoot on broken glass then sign aboard. If you're not part of the clique they'll just get rid of you. Just so you know this is NOT UGI Utility! Don't fall victim to UGI Energy Services."
bad,Working for UGI is like being in highschool. My son tells me that the kids in his school are not even as bad. HR acts like they care but the entire company is about covering up for management. The actual workers are just a number and all the good ones are leaving.
bad,"poor management, everyone for himself/herself, racially biased makes you wonder if there are no educated black folks in Reading. Cut throat and backstabbing . You cant trust HR on any issue."
bad,"A typical day at work was answering telephone calls for 8 hours to make payment arrangements on delinquent accounts, schedule appointments for people who were moving in and out of a property,  interruption of service and emergencies.  Different requirements were utilized depending on the type of call received. Payment agreements were based on PUC (Public Utility Commission)  guidelines, payments were processed toward balances owed, credit checks were performed for new services to determine if a deposit was required, etc. In between calls, from daily reports outbound calls were made to issue notices or contact customers to see if can get information to refer to assistance programs offered. The hardest part of the job was that it was very stressful.  The best part of the job was the people I worked with."
bad,Great company as to pay and bens....but outside of that its a drama filled nightmare. The service mark ugi dispatch is so filled with chaos and redtape you will get dizzy. When a process in place is proven to be useless or needless they fix things by adding more process ontop. You will be blamed for things out of your control and unless your a part of the clique in crowd you will be trashed when there not to busy trashing each other. Upper management will blame you for there failure as leaders.
bad,"Not a good company for pay increases and on time pay raises. There are people still waiting for a raise after a few years."
good,"UGI is one of those state places where if you land a job everyone there just wants to retire. This is not so great if you have ambitions. It's totally awesome if you just want to sit there and plug your 401k. Yeah, the ambitious need not apply."
good,"I did my daily task without issues. Provided recommendations for process enhancements and implemented but was never recompensed. You better be part or accepted by the premier group or else. There are some nasty people working there, I meant attitude and smelly"
good,A lot of mandatory overtime but you work those long hours beginning of the week and it’s possible they send you home early at the end of the week which you  work overtime for straight time and the other three other locations get paid double time after 40 hours which is not fair to location in Reading  and I’m not too fond of the union either had my mishaps before in the past and I kind of brushed it out of the rug
good,"The organization is a family of companies and is undergoing change. Each business unit is autonomous and has their own individual way to stay competitive. Sometimes this  competes with their need to find synergies. There are individual agendas within each business unit, a Change Management nightmare."
good,"A typical day for me is, I get in and check voice messages and emails. if there are any call backs or emails I take care of them right away. If there isn't much to do because for the most part the mornings are quiet. i get to scanning and E-filing."
good,"Overall a good experience. Not for the creative types or those that wish to be in a role focused on idea generation. Very siloed place, very bureaucratic, lots of micromanaging & cliques."
good,"They gave good training. Starting salary is good. Benefits were good."
good,"Quick paced environment.  Not a supportive manager unfortunately. Causing a lot of people,to leave. Good,dedicated hard workers leaving due to poor management"
good,It's a good place to work. Good benefits & time off. Co workers are very friendly and nice. Co workers are willing to help if you have a question.....
good,The employees in the company were very friendly and love working with them. There were certain departments that had managers that were not very friendly.
good,"Decent, reliable work. Management is a mixed bag of good and bad. Work life balance can be difficult and pay is low, even for the utility industry which is traditionally low."
good,"was put in collections, just was not my job type, not enjoyable for me and would get hung up on I guess because they had to make payments. I dont recall much more about the job"
good,Loved working here until UGI took over.  Was previously PPL Natural Gas.  Just not enough people in call center to handle incoming calls
good,"small crews work together,when it counts. my short time there produced good bonds, senior people took time to explain and show how to do things, non union, management actually seemed to practice what they preached."
good,"A typical day of work involved the management of several operators in an effort to meet production goals and maintain a safe and compliant work environment. My exposure to a diverse range of working conditions opened doors to new experiences and the opportunity to learn new management practices on each site. My co-workers included a group of highly educated engineers, project managers and skilled field technicians. This provided me with the opportunity to interact with a wide range of skill sets and gain the confidence to overcome the challenges I would face on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep my operations staff motivated and focused on the tasks at hand. The part of the job I enjoyed the most was the freedom to manage my operations staff under the schedule I created and at a pace I deemed necessary in order to be successful. "
good,"Good Job, Great workers. Good team stability. Had a great learning and working experience with this company. Learned a lot about the natural gas industry from the other side of the natural gas debate being an environmental science student"

good,"- Company is always concerned about their employees safety"
good,"A typical day at work started with a recap of the gas flow from the previous day and a forecast for the upcoming day.  I learned to create some complex spreadsheets to account for our daily flow and various other reasons. There were deadlines that needed to be meet on a daily and hourly basis.  "
good,"UGI Energy Services is a great career building and solid base to begin and work until retirement."

good,Great temporary job with wonderful bosses and coworkers. Lighthearted tone in department and mutual respect among workers. Fast pace made workday go very fast.
good,"I gathered information from customers, input it into the system and also transferred information from one system to a newer version of it."
good,In the last 6 years there has been a high change over rate in part due to attrition and and in part due to firing of several key field personnel to include the low level management team.

good,"Excellent company with great leadership, I gained valuable experience working in a variety of positions."
good,"A typical day a UGI was processing invoices into the Oracle database system. If I had problems that I could not solve I was to report them to the supervisor. I prepared payments, ACH, checks to satisfy vendors liabilities. Research and resolve invoice discrepancies in a timely manner. Resolve and research vendor balance statements that were more than 45 days old. Process utility bills through Utility Bill Tracker. Review invoices for sales/use tax applicability.	Provide backup to department personnel as needed"
good,"I was only 18 when I started working at UGI. I found it to be a friendly working environment with a lot of diversity in duties. For that reason, I remained at UGI for twelve years and left because the birth of my daughter."
good,I only worked at UGI during a summer between college classes for an internship but it was a good experience for my short time there. They brought me around to the different sections of the company and I got to work with many different people. Being able to see all the aspects of what they did at UGI was for beneficial to me and I really enjoyed working there.
good,"Wonderful Work culture, fantastic management. Really care about the employee safety. fair benefits package as well as fair compensation based on qualifications."
good,"I am at a lot of different locations and the days go fast. No two jobs are alike, they are all different. The hardest part of the job is pinpointing and locating the gas leak."
good,"To be honest working here has been a great experience.  I can definitely say that I have learned a lot from working here.  I have grown and matured during my employment here.  My co-workers are awesome and easy to get along with.  The other employees I had to work with were also great, most were very friendly.  The hardest part of this job I would have to say is the commute.  Traffic can get a bit crazy in the king of prussia area.  The most enjoyable part of this job was that my boss was really nice and allowed our department to basically work out any problems we had on our own.  "
