rating,review
bad,management does not support employees and micro-managing is taken to a whole new extreme. employees feel defeated and unhappy. the culture is not inclusive.
bad,In order to advance you have to be in the in crowd.  You either have to be willing to kiss up or you need to know someone.  It helps to be related to someone up high.
bad,No support  you start by cold calling or reaching out to family  promised a boatload of up front money which wasn’t actually the case.  Then they turn around and charge you for your office space which was a cubical
bad,Full of lies and promises when you're a new employee. You have to come up with your own network and recruit friends and family for them to put in their Dada base. No thanks!
bad,"Employees are constantly told that the law does not require the company to provide breaks during the day. Management is not only unsupportive, but has no working knowledge of the job duties or basic functions."
bad,Bad culture to work. Would not recommend to anyone. No one takes accountablity for their actions. Was averaging 50 cold calls a day and was not appreciative of my hardwork. No direction.
bad,"I worked at a branch office not at the company headquarters. Straight commission. 1099 employee. You have to provide a list of 300 of your relatives, friends and former coworkers, set up meetings with them, then beg them for references. It felt like a pyramid scam. The people who survive at NM were already well-off prior to their employment or they are living off of their savings."
bad,"A typical workday consists of doing a morning meeting, conducting 40 dials a day to schedule meetings, and meeting with clients to sell them products. They will make you start with friends and family and ask for referrals to try to build your ""business"". Realistically, they'll want you to do joint work so that when you leave, the other advisor will pick up your client."
bad,Numbers drive this company. Little to no concern for employees. If you’re not meeting their standard you will get pushed out and rarely will a safety net be offered first. Initial training is very lackluster. If you don’t have knowledge/experience in the industry I would not suggest signing on. There is zero management/experienced salesperson led training to introduce new people to the products. Findlay office is push push push. There is not an opportunity to work remotely; you are made to go to office every day even though allegedly you are an “independent contractor.”  Also be sure you know your contract inside and out.
bad,"This was an absolute horrible experience. I felt used for contact numbers and the most savage survive. If you can make it through to the first couple of years you should be fine,but an absolute awful internship."
bad,"Super unethical company. They act like they have mentors and a system in place for you to succeed and that they will support you through out, but it's all a scam for them to bring in more potential clients. Managers in Walnut Creek and SF do not care at all about who they bring in. Pretty much if you are willing to follow orders they will take a chance on you. No Culture. No Salary. Less than 5% of people that come in stay longer than a few months. Really bad company. They only care about making money for themselves."
bad,"Not a place I would recommend working. They all over emphasize the importance of Life insurance, because that's what they sell. Whole life, life insurance is not as profitable as they claim and they don't tell clients about how their withdraw of their policy's cash value is considered to be a loan after they pull more than what they've paid in premiums. Very shady sales tactics."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this company to a self-starter. This company is very frustrating for which to work: Too many meetings, so consensus oriented, avoidance oriented,"
bad,"No autonomy, they don't care about the admins. You have no freedom to give your opinion, thoughts or anything without being judged or criticized. The management is self-centered, clueless of their employees, and horrible. Good luck if you go in as a rep and stay away if you want to be an admin there."
bad,"They underpay and don’t offer any growth opportunities. Along with this, there is an absence of loyalty. Great products, though. I hated every moment of working there, but they offer great financial services"
bad,"My boss was very type A, I had the worst anxiety going to work.  The building is very high school like, people talk about one another and don't socialize outside of work."
bad,This was at convergys and the project ended.pretty abruptly. This thong wants me to type 50 characters but there really isnt 50 characters worth of stuff to type so here's some random nonsense.
bad,"The first couples weeks will seem like the dream job to have but soon after you will discover that they treat people different depending on if they like you and how much of your personal business you share during one on ones with managers. Training process with the coaches is horrendous. They literally allow you to fail multiple calls and are completely useless. They are not up to par like other fortune 500 companies Ive worked for. Extremely cheap when doing thing for their employees. Parking is 15 minutes away from the door. So leaving to get lunch is slim to none. The free food made me sick most of the time due to them serving the same entrees for a week straight and they are completely unsanitary. Worse company I ever worked for and to think I turned down a better offer for them makes it worse. The pay is not worth the stress or the amount of work they add on you. Do do it, RUN!!!! This mainly applies to BILLING & PAYMENTS. Some other areas may not be as bad."
bad,I did not learn much from NWM. They were not willing to train and I had never been in the financial world before. The team I was on pulled me from my current job to use my linked in contacts for recruitment purposes but did not tell me that when they brought me over.I felt very awkward reaching out to folks on linked in to get them to come in and interview for NWM.
bad,"At the beginning everything seems great and that they aren't using just for your leads to people. But, in the end they are just using you for your leads, they don't have a sustainable training program if you don't have the market."
bad,i worked as an intern here and really enjoyed the idea of finance until i met the mentor he ruined the experience for me and several others. It was okay until that time
bad,"If you don’t know at least 300 people, don’t have family with millions to invest or if your looking for support, stay away."
bad,"Don't come here if you want a meaningful internship. Horrible experience, didn't get paid for the first three months I was there. Finally received my stipend after being at NM for 12 weeks and received it steadily for a few months. Management then ghosted my text messages and I didn't receive pay for another two weeks and left. "
bad,"they are there to bring in new people for the contacts only. they will use you down to your last dollar and then send you a bill. They don't tell you about LAG times for being paid. Also they try to get you to recruit your friends. especially if they are a minority or women because they have a problem in that culture of all white men. Sketchy, sketchy, sketchy!!!"
bad,"It wasn't what I had expected. I loved the thought that I would have freedom of creating my own business, however, it was required to share meetings with ""experience"" reps. This was not always easy trying to schedule someone that was available when the potential client was."
bad,This position will have to in a constant dilemma as you wrestle with the fact that you are leveraging every personal relationship you have ever had for financial gain.
bad,"Do not work for this company! You work for spin off companies representing NM. They do not pay fair commission, charge for every expense, force you to do joint work and split commission with warm market."
bad,"They asked me to come back to work and then let me go, but told me they would give me a letter of reference because my work was very good.  They also said they would not decline unemployment.  That's all I can say without crossing a line."
bad,No support. Constant quotas and micromanagement  but no salary.Awful. Terrible environment. Paid too little for how  many hours we are supposed to work. Have to have another source of income to survive.
bad,"The whole company structure tells you to go out and try and convince people they need their product. They start off by having you make a list of people who are willing to ""help"" you. Then they have you call all your close friends and family on this list and attempt to scam them."
bad,You are asked to call on your family and friends to begin your career. But when you leave none of them are your clients and the managers are counting on this so they can make money off your family. Terrible pyramid scheme. Then they attack you when you leave. They are very vindictive!
bad,"i did not enjoy working for the company. high stress, no leadership, thrown out and sink or swim style. only commission made it very hard to live while trying to get started."
bad,"The mission of the company is selling people products. The management is only concerned with metrics and not really concerned about the people who work there. The only benefit was paid time off and a small contribution to a 401(k). "
bad,This company is built like a pyramid scheme and they prey on interns and make it sound great until you get there and they use you.They get interns to get leads and they take them.
bad,Exciting opportunity at first until you learn about the culture and the huge turnover of employees in some network offices. Very scary and no job security if you work in a network office as you are contracted to the managing partner directly. Working in a network office also means there is no HR you can turn to in case you are not being treated the way you should. Whether you stay with the network office or not really depends on the managing partner liking or not liking you anymore and you have no support.
bad,Not much room for growth. There was nothing to gain from working here. I wasted my time. And the mission was not followed at all. Im looking for better
bad,"By far the worst leadership in any business I've ever worked for. Not just saying that to be malicious. It was a free for all, and no guidance. There was just a vibe of ""I'm above you"" mentality."
bad,Northwestern Mutual is not client focussed. It is all about selling whole life insurance products. Whole life is for some people but it is not for everyone.... NM does not understand that.
bad,"They need to focus a little bit more on what systems and applications need to be upgraded to help the technology coordinators in the field.  There is room for growth, but  they relay on a failed system to chooses if you succeed and not on hard work and success."
bad,"Dishonest management and self-serving leadership. Self promotion and back stabbing seem to yield results. Suffocating environment, where managerial courage is promoted but god help you if you call something out. Ditched the annual Gartner Surveys when they were seen to be so far behind in their sector."
bad,"The company culture is terrible, it is like the wild wild west when it comes to colleagues stealing clients from you. They lie to you about the job to get you in there. There is no synergy and they don't care whether you leave or stay. Once you leave they try to ruin you and your life. They do a good job of that. They put pressure on you because they can. I would never recommend working there."
bad,The Managing Partner treated employees dismissively and with contempt. He also unlawfully took a larger commission without written authorization. The Company was made aware of the issue but  choose to ignore the ongoing issues.
bad,The company does have great product and planning tools.  They also have a great customer service in the home office.  The big problem is the structure of management which creates an atmosphere that forgets about the advisors.
bad,"Generally, depending on which area of the company you work in your either love or loathe your job.  They emphasize the customer experience but do not focus on the areas where this truly matters.  Very cut throat, too many consultants that do not know the customers, the work, etc.   I would not recommend this if you work in any operations role. They massively underpay staff."
bad,One of the worst places I've ever worked.  Managing Directors only care about them getting paid.  They fake care about charity as more of a promotional tool.  Commission only with products that everyone either already has or nobody wants.
bad,"I am a full cycle recruiter prior to joining, they were looking for warm bodies for financial service reps to sell to their friends and families."
bad,Was an awful experience can be summarized in one phrase: pyramid scheme the rich get richer and the poor continue to starve. Overall an awful job to start out a career in the financial planning world.
bad,You hassle everyone you know to come see you and you look at everyone as a number. It's commission only so it has it's benefits at times where you make a lot of money some months.
bad,"Terrible experience - very, very poor training given for a job that deals in legal contracts, unrealistic work load expectations.  All clients were not treated the same -  manager catered to the high end, wealthier clients.  Office could not keep a recruiter because of the pressure to ""convince"" young people to join the company.  Lots of negative comments about other agents in the office.  Very negative environment."
bad,"The pay is low for the industry, their is a cut throat culture that encourages people to stab each other in the back to get ahead, management treats all employees even fellow management as hourly employees punching a clock. The benefits are horrible. The current CEO is destroying everything that was good about the company."
bad,"Bad experience, bad training, Work life balance sucks, managers steal renewals when reps leave, very low success rate, they do not give you full disclosure during interview"
bad,Well established company with solid products.  Great training program.  Collegial environment.  Fast paced business suitable for people with high drive and motivation.
bad,"NML used to be 'the' place to work. My last year of employment there was cut-throat. The hardest part of the job was knowing if you 'had' a job, and also trying to trust coworkers in an environment where layoffs were on everyone's minds. It created a very negative and hostile environment. . "
bad,Was mislead in the total commission I could expect to receive. It's essentially your own business but you have a boss at the same time.  The products are competitive and are good for customers but expensive in comparison to other companies.
bad,"typical day: boring "
bad,i got licesed and worked in newburgh and this was while i was a sophmore.  this was a good experience met a lot of people and got my foot in the door.  learned how to cold call
bad,The best thing about working their was my supervisor. She never judge me regarding my color. I loved my job. I just hated working there. There was only one person that make my life miserable.
bad,"Good to work with Northwestern Mutual.Lot of good working knowledge and work culture is excellent here."
bad,"The entire IT department was laid off. Terrible company to work for. The lunches were free and delicious which was a perk. The management style is who are you best friends with, not who is the smartest or hardest worker."
bad,"Too many things to do in one day, not enough time to get it done. Management does not really seem to care about you. Juggling work load, on phones the entire day, best part of the day is going home."
bad,There is no base salary.  They want to to call on friends and family to sell and then when you leave they hound those poeple.  they expect a young college grad to spend all their money traveling everywhere.
bad,"know what you are getting into - you are on your own no matter what they tell you about support - income is slow to come and you WILL have to tap into savings to live - there is no assistance - you will have to pay for all your own office supplies, copies, phone, paper, printing"
bad,"I was hired to set up appointments for the sales reps to go out and sell. Almost a year and not one sale. The owners niece was one of the reps, she was just awful. She not only was calling my potentials back from my outlook calender  before I could set them but then wouldn't show up to the appointments on time or at all. I brought it up to my manager, then they laid me off."
bad,"Only about 1% actually make a halfway decent living. Health Insurance is very high. They do a terrible job retaining employees. Left me deeply in student loan debt, because I couldn't pay any bills because I made below poverty standards. Every office has the same mentality of bs."
bad,"Do not do the internship. It is not worth your time, effort, and complication it puts on your personal reputation."
bad,"Misleading company, about every 3 months reps gets fired for not meeting quoatas .... The company is known to say one thing...... and do another... They are looking to sale to the top 5%. If you are not rich and or know a lost of rich people, think twice about the job. You are NOT a Financial Rep/Intern you are a sales person.... Very few make the cut, about 1% a year( that is why they recruit year around). You will struggle and have no help, after "" training"" its all up to you to tell people they are investing in the future...(but their not) and work to get money out of your friends and family to make a living..."
bad,"Everyone wears 2,000 dollar suits and maybe 1% of the people that work their can afford it."
bad,"want u to sell to your own family"
bad,You get roped in with promises of becoming rich and being able to write your own ticket.  Nobody cares about your quality of life.  They don't care about how much you suffer along the way.  Its a numbers game for them.  They throw as much as they can against the war a see what sticks.  The don't are about the price a person pays.  Why is the divorce rate so high.
bad,100% Commission is impossible to live off of. Not enough of a market for these services.
bad,Office manager. Owner did not need Office Manager. Ran things himself. Convicted of fraud. Office closed.
bad,They do not offer salaries to their sales people--its straight commssion. Be careful when accepting a job because the turnover is extremly high
bad,They only want you to bring them clients. They train you and make you take that insurance exam only for the sole purpose of gettng clients from you. They do not really teach you how the premiums or percentages are calculated. NO LEARNING CURVE.
bad,The agent I worked for needed to improve on their people skills. This was a position that once I started was not what I expected nor was it what I was lead to believe it was going to be. I did not have other co-workers it was just the agent and me. I learned about life insurance.
bad,"Very frat bro work culture"
bad,"The company grabs college seniors before they know what is good for them. It is essentially a sales job, where you are forced to push life insurance on your family and friends. They say no cold calls, but that is because you are expected to torture names of friends of friends to call them relentlessly in the attempt of a sale."
bad,"Wasted almost 4 years here holding every license my rep had making peanuts. Didn’t even have the benefits that we push for our clients. Wanted to look for another position within the company and was told I had to announce it to my rep which gave him the opportunity to fire me first because of course, who wants to keep an employee once they’re telling you they’d like to leave? I’m sure working in Milwaukee is great but I’d never recommend working for a private rep doing all their work watching them taking home a couple hundred thousand while you’re lucky to bring in $40k. It’s a joke."
bad,"Empty promises. Don't believe the salary expectations. Maybe, at 5-10 years in, you'll be at 60k MAYBE but the management team plays favorites and to get to a sustainable level of income expect to work all evenings and weekends and spam call your close friends."
bad,"Not inclusive, doesn't promote from within. Lots of favoritism. The company was once a wonderful place to work. Now NM is no longer warm and friendly."
bad,"I was briefly at northwestern mutual, but there was numerous people let go while I was there.  Culture was not up to the standard as expected.  Management did not seem engaged and most contact was with the training team who were let go."
bad,This is the worst place I have ever worked.  All levels of leadership are terrible.  I wouldn't even advise someone to be a policy owner at NM.  The current leadership regime will run this company into the ground.
bad,"preparing paperwork assisted new agents with starting they career, new management, lack of training, lack of leadership which leads to a failing company"
bad,"If you like hounding people and begging them to buy life insurance then this is the job for you. I came from a large bank doing investments, they promise you that you can sell funds, stocks, etc...yet once you start all they do is hound you on trying to get your customer to buy whole life instead of investments. Steer clear!"
bad,"There were many inconsistencies between what they told you and what was true. This was a sales job through and through, and as hard as I tried to do what was absolutely right for the client I was always pressured to make a sale. Good lessons learned even if they were bad ones."
bad,"If you are someone who does not have any prior internship experience, their internship can be a good resume builder. I do not recommenced attempting to make this into a long-term career."
bad,This company has no integrity. It's not about what you know it's all about who you know. In order to advance to any higher role you must be related to or be friends with someone of a higher holding position. They also don't compensate you for being bilingual.
bad,sell your heartn out selling insurnce sell lots call lots mostly cold call never warm unless you dont care you are shaing your warm circle but whatever if you want money
bad,"All they want is your natural market, inability to develop young talent. Or they have the ability and just don't want to develop you. They care more about getting your business in the hands of the company top producers."
bad,High turnover in this position because its very demanding and wages are low for the amount of work required. No incentive for reps to want to stay in position. Great-West Financial pays their reps almost $2/hr more for this same position.
bad,"I would prefer not to review this company any further."
bad,"High turn over rate, unprofessional and waste of time. It is a dishonest job."
bad,Just found out that ComputerWorld magazine rated NML
bad,"Very fast paced environment. Wasn't paid, only commission based."
bad,They are excellent at making you feel like you can't do better than working for them. Management will look you in your face and lie with ease. This place can be toxic if you aren't a strong individual.
bad,All they ask you to make calls and nothing else. Not at all a suitable job if you are an introvert. The salary they provide to the interns does not even cover weekly expenses.
bad,"Management did not have experience with the work yet tried to tell us that we were inefficient and prone to errors. Attempted to create a service that was potentially profitable so would hire less skilled workers for less pay who had no understanding of the work. CL&I suggested interventions that were completely ineffective. Employment agency representatives did nothing to help their people  learn, develop or provide support."
bad,"IT is dying here. They outsourced 1000 jobs over the past couple years, losing centuries of experience just to save on employee costs. The culture is deadly, with a you maybe next regardless of your performance."
bad,"Run and run fast if you have a sliver of a personality! Team leads are awful, middle management ok, upper management near invisible. Audits contain no semblance of common sense whatsoever, they’re devised to funnel money upwards. If you approach this issue, they have “language” for everything and scripted responses. Be ready to be treated as a 5 year old who needs to learn a lesson. This is the culture of management they promote there, especially team leads. The best is they actually show concern at the employees leaving, like they’re worried there will be some backlash. But nobody leaving cares enough!  Joke of a company. Need to get over themselves and their free lunch. Not worth it."
bad,They hire  group of people for their yearly campaigns and then fire almost everyone in group they hired. Managers are horrible don't ask questions because you will be fired
bad,"Management is very poor, no opportunity for growth, work life balance is a joke,  health care rates going up, lot of offshoring as "
bad,I did not receive any benefits from Northwestern and I felt I was thrown into a team with many issues.  They all split up within less than six months.  I was hired to help the new recruits and they quit because of the treatment of them which put me in an uncomfortable position.
bad,They sell you a dream and don't train you on basics. had a bad experience at a good overall company but culture and management sucks and they have these trips that you have to go to that come out your own pocket.
bad,Agents have are very temperamental especially when they don't get things their way with clients. Often times when things are good they'll leave you alone and let you do your work. But when they go bad for the agent they will take it out on the staff.
bad,"Best job ever! Learned so much working in the stock market, ins and learning a new culture in New York City!"
bad,"In the beginning you work very long hours if you want to be successful, and the contract pays well in the first few years, but decreases each year after the first year until you get to about 50% commission. it is 100% commission, so make sure you have a lot of money set aside before you choose to do this career.  The flexibility and benefits are good, full health insurance and pension/retirement (although it takes years to be even partially vested). Northwestern Mutual as a company is great -- strong financial stability, security, etc, but the culture within their system for women and POC is horrible.   The management in my particular location/agency was absolutely heinous. They say they value diversity and inclusion, but the moment you don't ""fit in"" they make you an outsider.  The company has a lot of work to do if they want to truly make it feel like a safe space for minorities to work in.  The good definitely does not outweigh the bad."
bad,"Pro: "
bad,I was promised a commission that failed to materialize.  I was told they were current on there investment knowledge.  Seems like there was no one in local office to assist on transfer of accounts and necessary paperwork needed by the company.  Just seemed like no one knew what they were doing.  They are very much insurance driven and not a complete financial plan company.
bad,"PTO is given to employees, but there are no available days to take off.  Very little coaching support.  Not a very supportive environment.  There is no work/life balance."
bad,Everyone at the local level is related and getting along with the local franchise owners can be challenging as most are not well experienced or educated.
bad,"Poor management. Sell you on free food, which is not good. Poor culture. Do not keep up with the expectations they speak of. Limited knowledge learned on the job."
bad,Stressful place to work with poor middle management as well as poor job security that isn't offset by above average pay.   Trying to sell themselves as a digitally leader but its in words only.
bad,"The department was stressful with all the ""procedures"" to follow and mico-managing that management did.  High turn over in this particular department."
bad,"i was at a branch that was run terribly, management types that i would never associate myself with again.  not a place that was fun or interesting to work at."
bad,"They care mostly about their hiring numbers, not about their retention. A good portion of their business is milking recent college graduates for business from their family and friends. When that dries up, those recent grads are unceremoniously shown the door."
bad,Not financial planning; you’re selling life insurance. Although NM has probably the best product in risk industry making a career there is challenging. If you have wealthy friends of family they will hire you. MD gets percentages of everything you bring in & joint work partners will get half; so be prepared to have a lot of best friends until your iPhone contacts (your book of business) stop responding to you.
bad,While working with northwestern mutual through manpower there were lots of confusion. Management didn’t communicate clearly what they expected. The work was repetitive. Lack of advancement opportunities and the atmosphere was cold.
bad,Not the best place to start as they do not pay you hourly. They pay by the contract signed. This is hard to stay in the game when you are not pushed by a salery.
bad,"Everyone in the office is labeled as a winner or a loser. The managing partner would routinely call underperforming new people ""bottom feeders"". It was a terrible work environment. There were many hard working high achievers, but only the very top would be recognized. The mentorship program is deplorable. The mentor assigned to me was never prepared for our weekly meetings and instead just talked about the plans he and his wife had, or would go through role playing scenarios and interrupt me throughout with comments like, ""No, that's stupid, why would you say that?"" This role playing berating would also occur in new advisor training. Northwestern Mutual is a meat-grinder, chewing up hard workers and spitting out the bloody pulp."
bad,It is so far from what they describe during the interview process. I believe the problem is with this office itself. The other office within the network are good but Memphis just gives off bad vibes and has some of the worst management and culture I've ever been apart of. Do yourself a favor and consider elsewhere
bad,Terrible pyramid scheme for interns. I'm sure being a fully licensed FA at Northwestern is a good career path (MAYBE) but absolutely do not do this internship. All they want is your family and friends before you quit.
bad,NM treats contract workers very poorly. You are reminded several times a day  that you are not an employee of the company even though contractors do most of the work.
bad,Very independent work style. Everyone is on their own although there are very strict guidelines you have to meet. Most days consist of meeting with a few people and putting together plans.
bad,"Culture was bad; not good leadership within local office.  You are completely in control of your destiny with this company which is cutthroat, so any guidance and luck would be helpful--just don't expect it."
bad,"It's soul crushing, it's gut wrenching, it's tireless, thankless work, but the paycheck is steady and you'll have more management than you'll know what to do with. Welcome to the world of long term contract IT helpdesk work."
bad,High expectations and sales requirements.  Higher than average compensation for the industry.  Sales training and mentorship program provided.
bad,"Early start, learned alot about finance and planning. Management spoke of support but acted light on support. My co-workers were very supportive and willing to help. Hardest part of the career was having work (applications) rejected after the hard work was completed. Most enjoyable part was working with others and building relationships with new clients."
bad,"You have no bosses, so you can come and go as you please, but downside is if you need help on anything it is difficult to get guidance without having to give up some of what you are paid."
bad,"A typical day is driven by your desire to make your practice successful."
bad,Not a place for senior advisors.  The expenses are too high for a new advisor.  They discourage FINRA licensing for at least a year.  Which forces the new rep to leave money on the table or give it to a senior rep.  In either situation the unlicensed rep isn't compensated.
bad,It was an ok job that had less than ok pay. Lots and lots of training and then not a lot of help once you’re out on your own. They micromanage everything and if you’re interested in moving up forget about it.
bad,"Northwestern Mutual is a great insurer.  However, the local agency leadership was less than stellar to work with.  Not to go into much details, I did not enjoy working in that environment and dreaded going in every morning at 6:30 a.m."
bad,"Quality has rapidly declined at Northwestern Mutual.  In the company's effort to make the clients their primary focus, they have completely neglected their employees and the poor work culture that many employees hush about, yet management refuses to discuss head on.  "
bad,"Management does not communicate enough with employees"
bad,"Very tough market to build business from scratch.  Good experience if you are starting out from school, provides a certain work ethic that is unmatched.  However, difficult business to build as career changer if you haven't already secured a book of business.  Compensation will be close to nothing for at least 1-2 years.  With a condo in new york city, and already established lIfestyle, not a good choice for me."
bad,"You wake up and get to work by 7. Call all your family and friends over and over again to try to get them to sit down with you. You'll go through their financial picture and they only way to help them is to sell life insurance and disability insurance. Everyone needs it. But for someone coming straight out of college, none of your friends wants life insurance, even though you know its good for them. Its not a new persons game, you need a lot of professional relationships before you start."
bad,"All professional organizations, like people, have their flaws and shortcomings.  However, as with any relationship, once you observe red flags you should take a moment to review and evaluate.  Northwestern Mutual looked great on the outside and does have some 'nice' perks/attributes, however internally; above normal politics and bureaucracy, poor cross-group communication, few or non-existent development processes/procedure in place, did I already mention poor cross-functional communication? And management team that, other than title, is non-existent. If senior management had a clue what's going on, they would literally have a cow... no offense to my Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism, and Zoroastrianism friends. From a CMMI assessment, NM would be a level  1 (or below, if that were possible); Processes unpredictable, poorly controlled and reactive, unclear/undefined roles and responsibilities.  Development is definitely in a state of contraction and turnover high."
bad,"They only need you for the first 5 years. Management doesn't get paid on Reps after 5 years. They will try and convince you to enter the leadership program and recruit your friends so they can milk them for their contacts. You will sign a non-compete/ non-disclosure that keeps you from working with those contacts you made clients while with the company. During this non-compete window, they will have other reps under 5 years contact those clients, telling them you are no longer with the company and try and sell them something that's completely unnecessary to make the commission and overrides. It's a mess and management will tell you anything they can to make you think they want you there for the long term. I have worked with several organizations over my life and this one was by far the worst decision I have ever made."
bad,"They make you cold call friends and famiyl to buy life insurance, no teaching about anything else. The only number that mattered was the number of dials made per day/week."
bad,"Loved work for Northwestern Mutual.  I had a great experience with them as I was a stay home mom most of my life, raising two boys and helped my husband at home doing bookwork as my husband has is own business."
bad,This was an internship consisting of cold calling potential clients to sell insurance products. They utilize your personal contacts as leads and try to gain referrals from them.
bad,"Very slow paced."
bad,"The staff is extremely helpful to all agents and clients.  If you don't mind a racist owner (of the Tampa Bay agency, not the home office), this is a great place to work.  The staff is not a reflection of what the agency owner says behind closed doors."
bad,"A typical work day at Northwester includes a daily meeting in the morning to go over the previous day, followed by dialing potential insurance buyers, and finally going out and pitching to potential buyers through sit-down meetings. All potential clients must be acquired through your own network, no leads, so there was a lot of cold calling."
bad,"Working at Northwestern Mutual was bad, it is a company for someone that is experienced and already has a book of business. "
bad,"I interviewed for a position as an intern and it turns out that the internship is just trying to get college students to see insurance to their friends and family members while receiving a small cut of the sales. Pyramid scheme. I expected better, but students, don't waste your time."
bad,"They are sneaky and deceiving. Training is on the job. Management will smile in your face and then talk about you behind your back. Job is easy, just takes a lot of your day. The culture is very chilled and laid back."
bad,Made my own schedule which was awesome. wouldn't work there if you are young.
bad,"After experiencing Northwestern Mutual, I cannot offer too much in the realm of positivity. Any insurance company who pushes Whole Life Insurance onto ignorant consumers (or ""clients"") deserves to be treated as scum."
bad,Working here is great except for the way management handle sensitive situations. The politics take over the decency of the place.
bad,"I loved working for Northwestern Mutual.  It is a great solid company.  I only worked for one rep, and he didn't really offer advancement, pay increases, vacation day increases, or positive reinforcement.  I didn't really agree with how he obtained business.  After almost 2 years I was offered another life case management position and that was my passion so I chose to leave to take another role.  I wish him the best, I just didn't agree with his work ethic compared to mine.  I worked very hard for him, kept him organized/structured, and got his cases placed in record time so he could break national records.  I'm glad I had something to do with it, but I have to trust my employer and know he has my best interest at heart.  In this instance, he did not."
bad,Call grandma and see if she's thought about dying then sell her a life insurance policy. This was the extent of the internship. Would not recommend to anyone.
bad,"If you get hired for any of their sales positions (Financial Advisor, Entrepreneur Sales Representative), expect to sell to your friends and family. They pay is extremely low (as it is commission based). You are pretty much expected to cold call. They pressure you to sell to everyone who even speaks with you."
bad,"I recently interviewed and went to the orientation here. To start I had to go through three interview processes. One of which consisted of me having to write down a minimum of 200 people that I know on these sheets in order to show them I can come up with people to sell too. They push you to sell to your friends and family first with out providing any other leads. Before my last interview I received a call from the hiring manager who after I missed one of his calls due to school. Told me that he ""should not be chasing after me. If anything I should be the one chasing after him for such an amazing opportunity."" When I went to the orientation, they showed us a tour of the office which was two floors with barely anyone working there, lots of empty cubicles. It looked as if the company just started up. Then before we left they insisted that in order for us to return after orientation they needed us to upload all the people we put on those sheets along with their information and numbers to the companies data base to ""make it easier for us"". Why would I provide that information to the company so everyone can see it if they are going to be my clients? This is my first review on this website and I am writing it to warn any younger people out there who just graduated college like myself and are looking for their first real job. This is not the place."
bad,"As an Intern all of the new business you generate will be allocated to your CUD if you do not continue with the company after the summer session ends. You exploit every personal connection you have in order to make other people money, sort of a pyramid scheme if you're an Intern"
bad,My experience with this company was horrible! The first month or two are  great! The trainers are weird and mildly crazy. They want to know your business. Everyone is extremely unprofessional. People gossip too much and if you plan on keeping to yourself don’t! They will treat you like an outsider!! The job was not explained well you will be doing much more than expected. Run please! You will hate the work environment and the people.  I put in my two weeks notice after 6 months! Very micromanaged! The turnover rate is high. One of the trainers made unprofessional comments. My manager was extremely unprofessional. It was a big mess save yourself a headache and run from this call center.
bad,"Management was the good 'ole boys club.  You were expected to act a certain way, talk a certain way, dress a certain way and drive a certain type of vehicle."
bad,I respect the company overall but the individual financial representative I worked for was awful. I was paid pennies compared to the money I made for him.
bad,"This company was a stable employer for many years, but recently they have had huge layoffs, so I would be somewhat concerned about their ability to provide security knowing that you can complete your career."
bad,not a great place to work. no salary. only comission. offered a full time job but declined. did not learn anything. spent way too much time studying and passing the insurance test
bad,"Try to pitch the position as finance position. This is 100% cold calling friends and family to try to sell them life insurance. Sales training is solid, I left as soon as the training concluded."
bad,"hated every minute in the West Hartford CT "
bad,As a financial rep you will be challeneged to live in a comission based environment in whihc the process to secure clients and earn your comission often takes longer than the amount of money in your bank account to support you while your struggling to get business.
bad,i already did this i already did this i already did this i already did thisi already did this i already did this i already did this i already did thisi already did this i already did this i already did this i already did thisi already did this i already did this i already did this i already did thisi already did this i already did this i already did this i already did thisvvvi already did this i already did this i already did this i already did thisvvvvvvvi already did this i already did this i already did this i already did thisi already did this i already did this i already did this i already did thisi already did this i already did this i already did this i already did thisi already did this i already did this i already did this i already did this
bad,"Thats what you eat, breath, and sleep. Better get used to it if thats what you want to do"
bad,"This company was terrible to work for. Pushing products on people especially friends and family is not something I want to do. Also, they never came to a good reason why someone should have a certain amount of Life Insurance. It was just, ""you need X amount, so buy it."""
bad,about 5% make it and only because they exploit their family and friends.
bad,The world of wealth management is dominated by men. I have worked closely with our firm to promote the work of the women on our team here and diversify the culture.
bad,"I have learned this kind of experience is the most expensive lesson."
bad,"You are given goals as an intern, but unless you are the top of the group, you will be constantly pitted against eachother. They offer great training, but little follow-through throughout the rest of it. The sales representatives you are paired with do not care for your success, but what family members and friends they can take advantage of."
bad,"Hard to make money on a steady basis. Their model is designed to get as many people in the door as possible to generate business for them, and then take their renewals when they don't pan out."
bad,they make it seem nice and easy to get your career moving but the downside is that you are working for yourself. Being someone young and without a vast older network this place will eat you alive. I recommend building a network and client list before entering into this work environment
bad,"7:30 Internal Training - Sometimes useful"
bad,"My role currently includes all of the typical life insurance underwriting tools and processes I am accustom to utilizing however I also find I spend a lot of time during my day doing non underwriting or clerical duties of which I find no personal job satisfaction in."
bad,"Calling friends and family to get started and working 12 hour days M-Th. Difficult to to set meetings with people you do and don't know. It's a very important topic that everyone needs to look into but a lot of people don't care. The culture is cut throat and dull. Everyone is just out for themselves because that is how Northwestern Mutual's business model is set up. Only 1 out of 10 agents make it two years. The biggest hurdle is to mentally deal with the constant rejection every day. The benefit is knowing when someone meets with you, they learned something new and that you made a financial impact in their lives."
bad,"If you're employed by a financial advisor rather than the company then you are under his or her payroll/benefits which are entirely up to his/her discretion.You may enjoy working for this company if you have a great working relationship with the representative you work under, but that was not my experience. I worked for a very type A advisor who did not respect boundaries or a work/life balance, who criticized, micromanaged, and would not take ownership unless it was beneficial to leveraging the business. I was under paid and did not receive a fair commission schedule or dental insurance, a 401k was promised but never started. I made some connections in the office but did not enjoy the office culture mainly because of the passive aggressive attitudes and felt very isolated most of the time. There is no efficient on-site training program to acclimate you to the role and you are likely to get several different answers to the same question when calling to the home office for support."
bad,"- unstructured internship training program"
bad,There was a highly competitive atmosphere with high turnover and little instruction or help. I would not recommend this company to most people because of its culture.
bad,"If you get hired on to work there, you aren't working for Northwestern Mutual itself, but an individual advisor. Due to this, your benefits ranges differently. The advisors I was an assistant to had no leadership training or management skills. They would yell if things don't go their way. They throw you into it without any formal training. There isn't a way to move up, unless their practice grow, which is slim. Since they're also frugal, expect to get paid low but work 3 people's job. I wouldn't recommend unless you're getting hired on by NM itself. I would never go back there, no matter how highly rated the advisor might be."
bad,"The unfortunate truth is that you are being evaluated behind your back, not to you directly. The ""office manager"" needs classes on how to manage. The person that trained for this position did not do so in a cohesive style, it was all mixed mash and up to you to figure out where a particular task ""fits"". Very disappointed."
bad,"If you are an advisor, you will be fine.  Tough for a woman on staff to advance.  Sexist leadership locally.  Nationwide the company is amazing.  Poor local leadership."
bad,NML uses a variety of contractors to staff their help desk that supports their field agents.  Contractors are viewed as expendable and the bar for success is quite high.  They focus entirely on job metrics to the detriment of morale and actual productivity.  They would likely get better results if they relaxed their demands and considered other aspects than call metrics.
bad,If you like a sales job that’s 100% commission and sitting at a cubicle cold calling all day then you’ll like being a financial rep. That’s not how this job was presented to me.
bad,"It was frustrating to work in this role. I was with the company for over a year to see it out. Unfortunately, I'm on the other end of things feeling like it was a waste of a year."
bad,All about who you know. Sales process is long an challenging but if you are willing to go through with it you will  see returns. Management depends on the office. I unfortunately had a poor experience with mine.
bad,"Training was great but basically, they are looking for you to call close friends and family for business. The office I worked at let the interns come as they please did not promote personal growth well."
bad,"You enter the role as a ""Financial Adviser"" only to realize you are slinging insurance to your family and friends. The job is what you make of it but the culture pushes insurance over actual advising."
bad,"They like to pretend and state that they're different but the reality is that they are like any other carrier except that the only difference is an exclusive distribution channel meaning you can only be appointed to them to sell their product,,,no broker channels"
bad,"Going in, the management team makes the job seem very pretty, fun and rewarding.  Then you are hit with a harsh reality that you make no money, you have to scrape, claw and grind to make little money.  The training is good but not where it should be.  You are required to build a financial planning practice from the ground up and you dont get enough time to be able to fully get it up and running once you get the hang of it without possible termination looming in front of you."
bad,"They paint a great picture but in reality it is cut throat and you never know if you are going to get paid or not. The training is great and will help in other careers, otherwise I do not recommend it."
bad,"Northwestern Mutual was a great place to develop. As a financial services professional, I would recommend this as a stepping stone to anyone's career."
bad,"I worked at NM for 9 years. I dedicated my life to this company and always received amazing yearly reviews for my hard work and dedication.  Then I experienced serious health issues for a few months that were explained to them by my doctor and was let go.  While working there, it is next to impossible to advance unless you are part of the chosen few.  Promise after promise of advancement and raises if certain goals are met, but then not honored for those achievements as promised.  Everyone is sitting on top of each other in the workspace provided with no personal space at all.  Once upon a time this may have been a great place to work, but those days are over.  Firing hundreds of employees while building a new $450M tower.  Shame on them."
bad,"The job came down to cold calling and late hours of begging for sales. The management were nice, but the atmosphere is very sterile and most of the business is being lost to online sales. Good luck if you go into this company because there are no sales tools available for new employees."
bad,"As much as I thoroughly enjoyed the management and the clients I was able to speak with, I did not enjoy the representatives I worked for. They made promises that were never kept, manipulated me because of my age and lack of experience and showed they really did not care."
bad,"a good company to gain basic knowledge of the financial industry and personal skills.  However, it is a career where you are on your own. Either sell, or eat a lot of Ramen."
bad,Working in the BP call center is very busy and overwhelming at times. In the beginning your self care  and well being is important until actual on the floor is full-time.
bad,Asked to sell life insurance to your family and friends. Not a good comprehensive internship for someone pursuing a career in finance. Very sales driven and a lot of pressure to be put under as a college student trying to make money over the summer.
bad,"Working here has so many benefits that it would be hard to list them all. However, the amount of stress, lack of understanding/respect, and finger-pointing from management outweighs anything good about this company. 1- The stress stems from no salary and the difficulty to succeed in the industry. The financial rep position comes off (in the end) like it is designed to milk candidates of all their contacts/relationships. Once someone has gone through the people directly in their life- the jobs becomes more difficult and the company loses interest. 2- Management only values the production numbers. If you know a ton of people WITH A LOT OF MONEY- then this career is for you. Management picks favorites solely based on how much money someone is making the company. When someone takes a vacation- management instructs individuals to be rude or make fun of people taking any type of vacation. ""Apparently you don't like growing your business since you're taking off the day after Christmas."" 3- Finger-pointing is the biggest reason to avoid this company. No matter what problem is going on, or who is struggling- managements only answer is ""well... you just aren't working hard enough."" There is 0 respect for personal life or boundaries unless you've been there more than 5 years."
bad,Company has been around for a long time. Company should focus more on work life balance. There are good benefits. There are a lot of departments with opportunities.
bad,You need a network or people to be able to be successful at this job. Very heavy in insurance so If a client doesn't buy that not much you will be able to do for them
bad,"A typical day is very busy, more than half of the day are on the phones. Sometimes lunch and breaks had to be missed.  Training could use improvement."
bad,"Local office is lacking leadership, direction and vision. New employees are set up to fail. The training and mentoring structure is very overbearing, rude and ineffective."
bad,"Unfortunately there is currently no visible leadership."
bad,This position did not allow effective training application you get it or get left behind. Training methods and time frames were non traditional. I passed each test but was told to increase speed.
bad,"Northwestern is a company which will give you all the necessary tools to obtain your FINRA licenses in a short amount of time. The organization culture and compensation is extremely poor however. This job is only appropriate for those with a significant amount in emergency savings as well as an affluent network or ""natural market,"" as they refer to it. The old method of networking through your natural market is a dying one, and unless your network is high-income, you will struggle to survive financially at Northwestern."
bad,"Business is to use your friends and contacts to join the organization. Very uncomfortable, awkward work environment. Poor leadership. 100% commission based only."
bad,I don't feel inclined to write a review on this job since it wasn't really a job. It was more of a call center designed to funnel clients into the main advisor in the office.
bad,"-Poor management"
bad,"Was a high demanding, stressful experience.  Sales on commission position that encouraged you to use all your personal connections to recruit people to the company.  There are some good people and some bad people that work there.  A lot of gossip and favoritism.  The amount of pressure is out of control.  I would not recommend anyone going to this company.  Also, the turnover is huge.  About 5% of the people I knew from my time there are still there.  The people that recruited me and helped my career have also moved on."
bad,"On paper, Northwestern Mutual seems like a great place to work. Wonderful benefits, highly rated each year as an employer, etc. However, the culture itself is difficult. Office politics is the worst I have ever encountered."
bad,Our management was very poor it had very little accountability and were not managers of people they were more concerned about daily tasks then their staff and their career development.  The structure to which the area was ran was consistent chaos and the lack of technology held the efficiency and production quality required to meet the goals and standards to which management requested.
bad,"this company provides great financial products and services to clients but does not provide great assistance to its client facing employees. costs as much to work there as you are paid sometimes,"
bad,Worked two temporary positions with Manpower at NM.  I was promised temp to perm.  Both contracts lasted longer than a year.  Management made promises that they couldn't honor.
bad,workplace culture changed dramatically in past couple of years and became a more stressfull place to work. benefits are good but job security not what it used to be
bad,"The internship was somewhat beneficial, but when you transition to financial representative; then be prepared to call on everyone you know and everyone that they know. They push you to sell products that people don't need, quite an experience."
bad,"Through the Fast Start program you were pressured to provide names of friends and family to develop and grow your business. Compensation depended on product sales to your warm market, which, often times were the most difficult sales. Hence, building a business was more difficult then they cared to admit. Although management attempted to pair you with those of similar personalities/backgrounds, if you did not have high end customers to sell to, you were overlooked for the required guidance you needed. This made the work environment extremely tense and difficult to enjoy building your career. I learned that you must do your due diligence with this company before making a decision to join them because you will be left to build your business on your own. If you are not properly prepared you will not make it. Atmosphere is very competitive. As one of the few female sales reps in my office, I encountered a great deal of defiance from fellow colleagues. You must have a very thick skin to do this job."
bad,Northwestern Mutual Brand in itself is great and powerful. However where the down fall is management. This doesn't fall on NM because technically NM only have 25 employees. If you have a terrible MD then you will NOT be successful in this industry. It's a numbers driven business and they tell you that you are your own boss but that is NOT the truth. You are micromanaged. They tell you all the good things to get you into the door but just like anything that's too good to be true you have to read the fine print
bad,"NWM is a strong company. The financial representative role has unlimited potential for a few. Failure for most. As a candidate they will build an income projection. It will be favorable. Take it with a grain of salt. Do your research. Compare Industry failure rates. If possible gather information on specific district you are a candidate with. Recruiter should be able to tell you. Its a difficult career path. Be prepared to devote long hours with little financial return early. As a contract employee business expenses will be on you. Insurance and misc charges will rack up and will be deducted out of future commission checks. Daily operating expenses will also build up (printer usage). Business model is set up to build book of business off of friends, family, and close network. Prior to pursuing be sure you understand your foothold on your network. You will not succeed if you are unable to 1. produce from your existing network 2. are unable to expand and build diversified network. Maintain high energy level and hit the ground running. Regaining momentum is extremely challenging. You lose traction and you will fail. Do not fall behind on administrative business practices or technology. Difficult to receive clear path(s) forward. Do not wait for someone to get back with you. Must be diligent and hammer shared services and admin all day every day."
bad,The advisors /reps hold extremely high expectations a lot with little compensation or room to grow. The most enjoyable part is working with the people at this company because they are beyond amazing.
bad,It was a job that required me to operate outside of my comfort zone.  I soon realized it was not the career move I was hoping for.
bad,Being your own boss is great but if that is what you are looking for then start your own business.
bad,"When I started I thought it was my dream job. Seeing how I’ve been trying to work for NM for a few years now. My thought process changed quite rapidly after about 1 month in. NM would rather you socialize, network and be well liked vs. being exceptional at your job. Networking is beneficial when it’s appropriate, but to take on meaningless lunches and meetings just for people to see your face. I think not"
bad,"Unfortunately there is no room for growth within the organization at the Macon Georgia location unless you want to sell insurance and be a financial representative, I was hired to work at the front desk with the hopes of being a personal assistant to the agents. This never happened and after two years I was still working at the front desk. The managing director told me in my exit interview that he is ""not supposed to be a feeder of assistants to the agents"". I wish I would have been told this in my initial interview. The managing directors personal assistant gave herself the title of Director of Operations and subsequently started talking down to others and thrived on control no matter the cost. The branch is not growing and it is a shame that good people get run out of this location. The pay and benefits were not terrible for the position to start out. However, college educated people are not okay with asking to get up and use the restroom. The control was insane."
bad,"They promise you the world and when they squeeze every contact you have, you're done. If you still decide to do this, make sure you have at least a years worth of expenses saved up because it is purely commission. At times I found myself selling unnecessary products just to have money come in to cover expenses for the month."
bad,"Northwestern Mutual Dallas-as a Financial Representative a typical day is you making phone calls and scheduling meetings (as many meeting you can possibly fill your schedule with, knowing 50% will not meet). If you can constantly stay on the phone and call people to schedule appointments you will do well in this career! The job in itself is great because you have a flexible work schedule, but also with a flexible work schedule means if you do not work you are not getting paid. You are your own business owner and you are responsible to take care of everything as far as expenses go etc. (meeting with clients/taking them for meals, all health insurance/hiring staff). The workplace culture is definitely competitive everybody wants to make money. If you are not bringing in business (high net worth people) do not expect to have friends. I also say in this role culture does not even matter. The business teaches you resilience and builds character because of all the rejection you are getting constantly. Although the career is a rotating door it is extremely rewarding 20 years looking forward because you will have residuals. The hardest part of the job is making ends meet at the earlier stages, do not forget you are 100% COMMISSION. If you do not come from a wealthy family that can support you financially or a spouse that can cover expenses until you get the boat to float you will sink for sure in this career. I learned what it truly meant to be a business owner (the long hours, the rejection disbelief from family & friends, the fake corporate relationships- do not focus on management"
bad,"If you are looking to sell insurance, this is a great place to be.  If you are looking to manage wealth, look elsewhere.  Good people, but it is definitely a sales job"
bad,"There was no formal, structured on-boarding plan for new skill sets required.  Unless you have the EXACT skills/tools needed for your job you will be set up for failure."
bad,The company does not have a culture respecting tenured talent.  This company has been systematically moving leadership from the local corporate office of Milwaukee to New York after a poorly managed attempt to integrate an acquired company named LearnVest.  It retains a very top down hierarchy and does not provide job security to employees.
bad,"Good stepping stone for future career in sales oriented work. Basic skills required, repetitive, and sales-centric. Low level of training, management is out of touch."
bad,Was a waste of a summer. Impossible to make money without high pressure sales of high commision rip-off life insurance policies to family and friends. Only benefit was learning about the industry and how they paid for us to get our licenses to sell insurance.
bad,"Ever since the ""re-invention"" (the dismissal of hundreds of employees and many early forced retirements) that happened last year, the culture at NM has changed, in my opinion to the worst.   The environment has become very cut throat and everyone is worried about themselves, not the team itself.  I have also seen micro management be more prevalent recently."
bad,"The environment at nwm was very hostile.  Management was too busy gossiping to even help with a concern. The facility is gorgeous, the personalities of the employees were not so much. It was a long walk to my desk, especially in the winter. They provide lunch to employees, which is nice, but you only get 35 minutes, so that leaves little option if you need to run an errand, being that it takes 10 minutes to get to your car."
bad,"Northwestern Mutual has been around for awhile and their college financial representative internship is rated one of the tops in the country."
bad,"Typical day included trying to procure hot leads by any means necessary. This procurement involves using friends, family, and past coworkers to find individuals who may or may not need your services or could be willing to point you in the direction of someone else who may or may not need your services. It is basically cold-calling within your social network. Management treats it as fine (of course) because they profit off of you trying to sell these policies. Other employees were cool and the training was in depth however. I learned quite a bit about future planning as well as the need for retirement plans and options that are available to people from all walks of life."
bad,"If you are a financially licensed and you think of leaving for Northwestern it is career suicide."
bad,"They drain your book of friends/family/references and only about 5% make it through month 6.  Want 15-20 face to face meetings/week kept along with another 5-10 internal meetings micromanaging you - very draining, not for everyone."
bad,As an Intern you are kind of thrown to the sharks in a sense that you are given no leads and the first thing they tell you is to ask your friends and family to buy their products. From there you must ask those people who they know and so on and so forth.  Would not recommend if you don't already know at least 75+ solid people you can sell to up front.
bad,This was the toughest internship I have had in terms of the tasks at hand. Expecting you to sell life insurance as a young inexperienced individual is tough.
bad,Do you want to sell insurance and pretend it's financial planning services? Do you want to work at a company that is an industry leader yet simultaneously is like every other sales company? Look no further!
bad,"All Advisors are self employed so when you are hired to work for a Northwestern Mutual Advisor, you are their employee.  They can be a good employer or a bad employer. You are not protected by Northwestern Mutual. You are at the mercy of the Advisor."
bad,"Northwestern Mutual is a firm designed around being an insurance agent and a financial planner. the ones who succeed are the ones that can cold call until the sun sets and have no problem hearing the word ""no"" unlimited times. the atmosphere was fun but stressful, and if you didnt meet your goals you were called out on them. if you wrote policies, you were compensated very well, but if the policy cancelled within 13 months you were required to pay back that compensation."
bad,"I was excited about the opportunity of working for a Fortune 100 company. The sales training I received was 5 star. My day to day activities, were to make a minimum of 50 calls per day, and set 5 appointments per day. At these appointments, I would brainstorm on what the person wants personally, professionally, and financially; then provide them with the proper tools to help them get there. The hardest part of the job was setting appointments, and getting assistance from the organization."
bad,"Leadership doesn't seem to be held accountable for the massive layoffs that have been going on for over 1.5 years. NM strives to respect its employees, but it hasn't walked the walk during this situation."
bad,"Change to a ""software company"" and utilizing greater amounts of offshore/contract resources is shrinking the IT area.  A smaller amount of NM IT employees will have fun with the new NM.  The company is reasonably healthy as evidenced by the large construction investments being done.  If you fit into something that excites you at NM and want to spend a few years at it and then move on, that will work, but it isn't a place to spend a career with anymore for many.  Facilities, amenities, and many people are top notch making it a fun place to work most of the time."
bad,"Overall working at NML, I gained a lot of essential and transferable skills that I will be able to take with me in the future. The work load varies week by week depending on the rep. A typical day consists of following up with underwriting, clients, scheduling appointments, and communicating with the lead financial representative. Work place culture is dry and strict. Hardest part of the job would be cold calling. Most enjoyable would be interacting with the enjoyable clients."
bad,"Team setting, management needs some work (very indecisive with how the work be presented), lacking accountability within team, allows work from home option, minimal face to face training due to work from home option."
bad,I learned a lot about insurance policies and how to identify prospects needs. Management was not helpful. Co-workers were basically non-existent. The hardest part of the job was learning everything on my own and having to apply what I learned to real life. NWM provided little to no assistance while studying for insurance license. Not very many things were enjoyable about this job.
bad,"It was my first company for whom I worked within the industry.  There were  duplicity promoting, and requiring, the joint work aspect.  Many reps experience situations wherein more experienced reps attempt to market to their clients when brought in for [sometime required] joint work, or to show you have a slew of support behind you despite being new in the industry.  However, if the more experienced rep tries to get your client as his/her own, the office justifies it by saying ""Whoever the client wants.""   In fact, in one instance a rep who accompanied me to a client later informed me, ""I'm going after your client.""  What then is the benefit of bringing in a more experienced rep or conduct  joint work if they will try to steal your client?"
bad,"A typical day at work starts with an eight o'clock meeting, then hitting the phones promptly at nine. You are expected to call 40 people and set 10 meetings. Starting at 11 you are expected to meet with 5 people a day. During a close they want you to take out a vetran rep so they share half of your commission. They always reccomend their number one product whole life insurance, no matter what the clients situation. The hardest part of the job is setting meetings and closing cases. It is very hard to make it a year in this industry and management knows that. They have a very high turnover rate and rely on bringing new people in to sale to their friends and family. Then when they run out of contacts their pretty much kicked to the curb. "
bad,Was not given the opportunity for any type of advancement. I would not advise anyone looking for a career in a financial advisory role to work here.
bad,Typically we would show up early in the morning for meeting and discuss the day with the advisors. You would then make calls to try and bring potential business into the office and schedule meetings.
bad,They only care about the names of the people you are bringing in. It was a very pyramid scheme feel to the entire organization. You have to make cold calls and it is all commission based. I was misled during the time I was getting recruited.
bad,"The role for this company was a paid-internship. I quickly learned that commissions and sales based positions are not my forte. However, i was able to excel and succeed in the role just not a preferred position."
bad,"The passionate people who work here really add value to the culture. The company is genuinely helping clients. The Financial Representative role is the hardest. Only 10% of people make it in the career. You need to have a really good network of people to get referrals from and the job is commission based. From what I can tell on the staff side, most people are paid below market standards and growth is limited."
bad,"Basically another way for the current Advisors to get more clients. "
bad,"They do a great job training on insurances but advertise themselves as ""hollistic"". They have no regard for 1st years and take their clients when the advisor leaves, continuing to fuel the companies financial needs."
bad,"I interviewed for a position as an intern and it turns out that the internship is just trying to get college students to see insurance to their friends and family members while receiving a small cut of the sales. Pyramid scheme. I expected better, but students, don't waste your time."
bad,The management in the Diversity & Inclusion department do not treat contractors well.  They are very patronizing and superior towards them.  I heard good things about other locations within the organization but did not witness it personally.
bad,"Upon starting at NWM, you will be asked for a list of 200 friends and family. That is then your book of business, and you are expected to hustle family and friends from high-school and college. While this approach works for some, it was not ideal for me. Very little help in acquiring new leads besides telling employees to get referrals."
bad,Although the internship wasn't for me I have to warn others. It is competitive. You need to have a strong will to win. Can be stressful but you make the most of it.
bad,"The overall experience lacked structure and training. It also felt like the main goal was to use interns to have them contact wealthy family/friends in order to meet with them and hopefully win them over as clients, without actually teaching the interns all that much."
bad,"I think this survey is only directed for FR's. As an associate, I do not feel as if NW cares about you or your quality of life. They have not been supportive in anyway. It is high levels of stress with little reward."
bad,The people on teams have got what it takes however they are rarely listened to or valued.  Upper leadership is egocentric and incompetent.  Communication is riddled with corporate speak and actions do not reflect the vision.  There is no trust in the organization.
bad,They hire you so the higher up representatives can take all of your hard work once the internship ends. They make you call family and friends and put you in awkward positions.
bad,We work for the rep and the rep has a lot of authority over how he/she treats his/her employees. There are no HR options that can handle a cruel/inappropriate rep. I was the fourth person in my position in a year. I stayed for 2 years and quit to go back to school. I can honestly say that it was some of the most stressful and emotionally exhausting months of my life. My rep thought nothing of verbally and emotionally abusing me and my co-workers loudly/publicly. I was warned about him by multiple people in the office. NM staff either could not or would not curb his behavior. Unacceptable.
bad,"Too much pressure, too much non reimbursed travel for training, and this company hires anybody. No drug screen, didn't ask for my resume, and while learning about the company, I strongly disagreed with some of the people and their views on how to do their job."
bad,"misguided initiatives, lack of quality leadership, extremely poor technology platform and case management system, high quality field advisers that are not serviced to the level that they and their clients deserve."
bad,This internship was describe in a way that was not reality. I was faced with many challenges and did not like working in corporate America.  It was bad
bad,I did not like northwestern mutual. i did not like working there.  the people we're only interested in making money and pushing expensive whole like insurance policies.
bad,Stressful environment if you aren't hitting your weekly expectations for number of meetings you set. They teach you to build your business through your personal network and can be uncomfortable asking family and friends to buy life insurance from you.
bad,Though there is opportunity to be very successful not many people are. Very cut throat competitive environment. Support staff are used and not rewarded or recognized. Inadequate training provided and no structure provided for expectations etc.
bad,"Great company but their internship is them just benefiting off of your contacts. I guess it's for ""self starters"" but an internship should be learning a whole industry's in's and outs."
bad,"Northwestern Mutual is undergoing a ""reinvention"", which has resulted in firing approximately 1/3 of the company. Many of the jobs have been replaced by offshore teams."
bad,"The day consists of entering data needed to generate comprehensive financial plans, risk and investment proposals, and other paperwork for financial representatives and advisors. It was a contracting position."
bad,"A company in search of an identity.  As part on the information technology part of the business, you will be poorly led, over worked and under compensated/valued."
bad,"Woman dominated culture. They look after their own. "
bad,"The company itself is great but trying to move to another area due to extremely poor management is difficult.   Tried working with HR to transfer was a nightmare.  They were very unhelpful.  No mentors are available."
bad,"This is a company you work for in order to build your resume, not to stay long-term. The jobs there are fully dependent on your personal network, which gets exhausted quickly."
bad,It was my first Job out of college and it was alright. They end up training you to sell products to people that may not need them so you can hit sales goals and make a paycheck
bad,Compensation is usually very low considering the work that is expected. Reps are the most important and any other employees go unappreciated. There is little to no room for advancement.
bad,Very tough job for anybody just starting out. 100% commission so if you aren't producing you won't be making any money. It is more of a figure it out as you go job.
bad,"During the interview process they really sell you on how much money you can make, and they don't say anything about how boring life insurance really is. Also they fail to mention how many tests you have to pass in order to actually be qualified to do the job. During training is the most stressful thing, I literally studied for all the tests and worked on my ""approach"" to customers all day and had zero leisure time. I would work and study nonstop, I honestly hardly had time to sleep. Eventually I resigned because I don't want to work more than 40 hours a week, and it really just isn't my cup of tea. Oh and 100% commission is rough."
bad,Very fast paced environment since I was working for a top-producing agent.  Resources were good if I had any questions or needed to learn a new product.  There was not much advancement for positions like mine in the company though.  And it made motivation tough.  But the most enjoyable part of the job were my co-workers.
bad,First day of work i had to turn in about 100 of my friends information to the company. Have to be a sales man.
bad,Use their internship as a lead generation system. I saw many advisors stealing leads from interns and one another.
bad,The company did not support you past training. It was all commission based.
bad,"NWM will tell you they are about providing insurance and investment products on an as needed basis and only after doing an in depth client review.  They will preach that they are not about sales volume but only sales that are established to help the client."
bad,Was great to get started in business/finance/marketing but unless you're looking to make a full career out of being an insurance sales rep you will not get far.
bad,"Job had nothing to do with my previous experience or my degree. While I learned some valuable life skills (like how the rich get richer and how trickle-down economics is a myth), I don't feel like I gained much from this professional experience and I was relieved when I quit."
bad,"They are a good company to work for. My personal management was a very poor situation, others in the company were delightful. I learned a lot about my own personal finances."
bad,Overall this company just wants you to recruit more people to do financial planning. A lot of cold calling and referrals. If you’re not into sales or uncomfortable with it this is not for you.
bad,"For some reason the name resonates with a lot of folks."
bad,"Don't intern here unless you have no other options. It is an extremely sink or swim business that has you calling up friends and family constantly to sell insurance. They take all of your dial and meeting numbers and show them to the rest of the intern class and openly rip you if you do not meet their standards. Full commission, 100 dollar stipend a week that they are very reluctant to pay out. They are focused more on what you can produce for them and don't actually care about you the intern and your career advancement. The retention is extremely low 8-9% and you are ultimately a foot soldier salesman for the summer. This internship will only serve as a resume booster. Employees love to brag about how much money they make, have little class. I can honestly say we were promised so many things from this ""Top Ten"" internship, and they certainly did not deliver/ they lied completely. You lose the drive to work very fast once you see and realize all the BS. And if you still try your best and don't get any sales completed by a certain point, they'll fire you anyways before the summer is up. That happened to half the intern class after a few months. Close: Don't do it unless you have to. It helped my resume and aided in landing me a real finance job. That's about all it offers. Oh yeah and they'll pressure you to buy insurance policies as a 20 year old kid who really has no need for them. Its to insure they have their ROI on you."
bad,I only worked here for a summer while in college. I really did not have much of a chance to put much effort into the job as I went to summer school. The way this program was set up is to use college kids as a referral base to the other reps whereby parents and relatives would likely sign up for insurance products if their kids were working there. The rep would get an 80 percent cut and the intern 20.
bad,"Wouldn't do it again, I wasn't at all a fan of my manager and the way he chose to run things and treat his employees. Felt like there was an inappropriate intersection between personal and professional life."
bad,They will position your career as a full pledge financial planner (even though you cannot call yourself that until you have obtained the CFP designation. However you are just in the business of selling life insurance.
bad,"I did the Northwestern Mutual internship and it was definitely a learning experience that I would not recommend. You are required to bug your friends and family until they buy from you and introduce you to their friends and family as well. The college interns are told that they are ""Financial representative"" and Full-time employees are 'Financial advisors,"" but the truth is that they are all insurance salesman. The financial advising they offer is to put everyone they can into term, or whole life insurance as an investment. As a full-time employee, you take your series 6 and 63 to sell investment products but the fact is this is an INSURANCE company that sells some investment products as well."
bad,"Program was not helpful in assisting me with work"
bad,"It's just selling life insurance to your friends/family. They try to make it look like its ""financial advising"" but its not at all. At least not the internship."
bad,"If you aren't looking to actually sell insurance, don't work here! They do not care about you as an employee, management is strict, and will hound you to SELL insurance and that's it. They do not care about your well-being , family, or future. All they care about is their numbers. Everyone who works there is selfish and only cares about themselves. If you're a friendly individual, don't come here, this place can turn you bitter."
bad,I spend the first three hours telephone marketing and spending time soliciting in the local communities. I worked with Blue Cross and Blue Shield health insurance company approving prospects.
bad,"Manager was taking money out of my commissions. He was later fired for it. I don't like to bad mouth a man who gave me my start. But as a rule, greed will kill a working relationship.."
bad,They sell you on building your business and make you call your relatives and friends to sell whole life insurance.  Coworkers were okay but not a great experience there.
bad,The demise of NM as an employer has accelerated over the last 3 years. Firstly the great pension rip off to build the new building. The whole bonus structure was designed to funnel money upwards. They executives have a mechanism to defer salary to avoid tax. They are everything that stinks about corporate America. Off course the staff just have to take worried for their jobs and benefits. When is the country going to learn that employer provided health care gives the company too much leverage over the staff............freedom!
bad,Poor leadership and communication. The culture is only as good as your leader and when you have someone in charge that does not lead by example in their personal production or how they lead others it doesnt make for a great office environment.
bad,They do not care for their agents and my agent was making more money and they company wanted more of my agents cut. He refused so they let him go. They are a greedy company. I would not recommend this company.
bad,Sales is not for everybody. There is no base salary only commission. It is very difficult to start and you always find yourself prospecting nonstop. Never truly stop thinking about work. There is the possibility for unlimited salary but constant sales mentality.
bad,"This specific location was very lenient when it came to scheduling which is both great but also very bad. With out much guidance you are thrown in blind and need to hustle to get new clients. Although everyone who worked there was very friendly and seemed like a little family, it was hard coming in when you aren't referred by a current employee. Your day will be calling prospective for a few hours then setting up meetings and going out to meet with them. What they need to do during the interview is reiterate that it is solely based off commission."
bad,"its your own business and everything falls upon you, you need to always be cold calling and pretty much expect not to be paid."
bad,"One must feel comfortable calling potential clients on the phone, or success will be extremely difficult in this industry. The language and methods used to land prospective clients is effective. Building your own financial book is only possible if you are able to sell a certain amount of Life Insurance policies."
bad,You get what you put in just like any other sales/commision based job
bad,management was very unorganized and poor company culture. there is alot to learn and its very beneficial but the company culture was not enjoyable at all
bad,"No further advancement, no cost of living, paying for health insurance increase and longer commute is the reason for leaving.  I have been with my employer for over 20+ years."
bad,Forced to sell life insurance to friends and family. No leads given for sales calls. All prospecting on your own. Only want to sell LI because thats where they make their money
bad,"While I have had a different experience than many, I was looking to be an actual financial advisor - one who takes into account his/her client's entire financial portfolio and their individual goals.  NWM will sell you on their ""holistic"" approach teach you dodge and redirect sales techniques to scare clients into loading up on insurance whether it is appropriate or not."
bad,"The pay was low for the work I was doing, it wasn't full time, and there were no benefits. There are different teams and I was working for a single person."
bad,"NM is a well respected company but in deep trouble. The world of finance has changed and NW is struggling to adapt. Very insular culture. Few people are empowered to make change. Lots of big titles floating the halls but few dare challenge the status quo or drive change.  Some tired senior leaders have been forced out, but they have been replaced with defenders of the status quo. The company is entirely wed to permanent life insurance and can live off its legacy financial strength for years. But Americans are abandoning PLI and NW has no answer for that other than doubling down a new planning experience tool that does nothing really to change the selling dynamic for financial reps who are the company’s lifeblood."
bad,"If you're a financial rep, you work endlessly and pray for commission. If you're staff, you get pushed out so the owner can hire in another one of his relatives. The people are nice, and they pay pretty well, but there's no job security. It's a pretty formal office, with a pretty strict dress code. There's no schedule flexibility. Benefits are pretty good. Free parking pass downtown any time, any day."
bad,The company itself - Northwestern Mutual is fine. The financial advisor I had worked for was very unpleasant to deal with and did not make me feel like I wanted to continue working for him in particular.
bad,"Northwestern Mutual had built an enormous amount of trust and brand loyalty in their client base over the 150+ years in existence. Also, it had a solid corporate culture where employees felt valued and supported. Though, it had an antiquated infrastructure, systems, processes and staff. In the past decade, the company has transformed with the intention of properly aligning the business with the changing financial industry. This includes increased digital accessibility of information and a more wholistic offering of financial security beyond the flagship life insurance products. Conceptually, this transformation sounded like something I wanted and did choose to rally behind. Though, it quickly became apparent that the list of cons outweighed the pros. There was a significant loss in strong leadership which had enterprise-wide impacts including lack of strategic vision, significant loss in company-wide, departmental and team communication and collaboration. There was an overwhelming and continued failure in properly and respectfully managing team and organizational restructuring (staffing loss/gain) resulting in an immense amount of employee fear, distrust and overall inefficiency. Looking back, I recall how the company felt slow moving due to said outdated items. Though, now the company feels slow moving due to an overwhelming amount of chaos, lack of leadership strength and collaboration. It's understandable that achieving massive change at a large corporation would involve some chaos and/or mess, but I feel that while the company pursues their transformation they have negatively"
bad,Was not that great a job. All commission. They obviously just want to milk you for your markets and to sell to family then kick you to the curb in a revolving door of reps.
bad,It's a job if you really need one! If the managing partner thinks you look the part then you may have a shot. It is not for faint of heart. There is money to be made but you will grind to get it.
bad,"Weilert WUnderlick Armstrong is a great environment to learn and became proficient at financial planning however the work culture is negative, harsh, and unorganized."
bad,"Lots of change happening.  Job security is not a definite thing as it once was in the past.   Over the years it was a good place to work with hard working, dedicated employees.  Not too sure you see that today.   The shift is work for a few years and move on to a new company.  Do not plan to retire at Northwestern Mutual."
bad,"Duties surround financial and medical underwriting of disability products for personal & business usage.  In a typical day I review multiple medical records and corporate tax returns for suitability in our line of disability products."
bad,Tons of cold calling. Management does not help you in any way. Recommend you call your family and friends to sell life insurance to. Extremely difficult to start out.
bad,Management was weak in district offices. They do not know anything and always refers you to call the home office to get information. The vibe with coworkers is very nice though. Very down to earth and cool to hangout with after work.
bad,"If someone is into sales and has no issues with contacting those closest to you about buying insurance products, then this is a great job. However, from my experience, the intern program is not what it is cut out to be. Many of the full-time workers were closer to sharks than mentors, and they expected interns to contact everyone of the personal connections to try and force insurance products on. I did learn a lot about the industry and financial planning, but I also learned this was not the career for me."
bad,On the plus side you get to plan your own day and when and where you get to meet your clients. On the downside it is a referral based business where you have to start off with your friends and family to find people. You only make commission so if you have a bad month selling you have no income.
bad,"They will promise you that you will learn how to do financial planning, while in reality they teach you how to sell life insurance."
bad,"A basic day consisting of meeting with your mentor to review goals, making cold calls and meeting as a group. Sometimes there would be travel to a potential client to pitch to them. I learned communication skills, developed a thick skin, and gained a very solid foundation of knowledge of the industry. The workplace culture was nothing to write home about -  I was one of two female interns in a class of 20 that summer. The hardest part of the job was continually generating leads and actually getting someone to agree to meet with you. The most enjoyable part of the job was gaining an understanding of how incredibly important financial planning, life insurance etc. is for all of us. Young people, as well as not so young people, tend to think life insurance isn't necessary; they are healthy so why spend more money? The younger and healthier you are the better policy and rate you are able to lockdown, and the more you are able to do with that investment. Talk to an agent to figure out more!"
bad,"If all offices are similar to the one I was in, be prepared to constantly be asking questions. There is a lack of transparency in terms of aspects you are just expected to have known/learned right out the gate without any heads up."
bad,Very nice place to work if management wasn't so bad. I wouldn't recommend the call center. Great place if you were working in a different department..
bad,Mediocre Company that is trying to be diverse are still struggles I wish nothing but the best for the company however it wasn’t the right fit for me at the time
bad,The financial representative internship shows you how to build relationships but also forces you to sell to friends and acquaintances. Not the most pleasant experience for someone without a strong natural network.
bad,"You sell insurance, cold calling which is never fun. I would not recommend unless you like making calls. Glad i had the opportunity to find out that this wasn't for me."
bad,"Management hired a lot of interns and essentially threw us at a wall to see who would stick. Not much help, tough business to crack in to anyway. Rewarded well if you ""work hard"" or have a preexisting client base, or one big anchor client. All about selling life insurance as much and as often as possible."
bad,"Good luck, they will make you call your entire contact list and anyone you know to try and sell them on the insurance. It is a good gig if you are good at sales, but tough to get started."
bad,"Northwestern Mutual is incredibly cut throat, and you are not put in a position to succeed. You feel incredibly pressured to call your friends and family. If you do not have an incredibly large network it is really hard to get your feet off the ground. With that said, it is incredibly lucrative if you have a network and live a life without fear."
bad,"The changing of the environment and culture has completely devalued the companies brand as a great place to work, grow and or build a career.  The environment is more job focuses and no longer a place to have a career."
bad,"Until 6 months ago, this was a destination employer with fantastic work life balance, security, and benefits.  It recently changed it's hiring philosophy, laid off hundreds of local employees and replaced them with offshore resources.  The morale is now extremely poor and the environment is unpleasant to work in."
bad,"Typical Day:"
bad,"This company changed a lot during my tenure.  Good leaders were laid off and strategy became erratic and career paths simply disappeared."
bad,"There are some many financial representatives to work for but not all of them are not financially stable. The Business is kind of like a dog eat dog world for the representatives and they are very aggressive. If you have the experience and stomach for the job I would recommend you to try to be a Financial representative. As an Assistant you are left with everything. If a rep has a big team (5 or more), then the work load is manageable. If not, be prepared for challenges everyday, high stress, and 50 hour work weeks. There is something new to do every day, so this is not a routine job. Make sure that you can multi task and have great attention to detail. Financial representatives are always in and out of the office, and when they are in the office, be prepared to be side tracked, and stay late to finish work that you did not have time to do. All positions are Salary. The money is good but its like selling your soul to the devil. I have never been in a position where my boss expected me to be perfect and if not you will get yelled at. They have no remorse for you and will fire you at anytime because they feel like it. Also there is no HR! So you are forced to deal with the Financial representative or leave. There are a few employee's who get lucky and have a Rep who is understanding and easy to work with, but I would be very careful when trying to become a Assistant Financial Representative. Do your research and ask questions."
bad,They hire contractors to do all the work their employees don’t want to do. Contractors aren't treated fairly for all the work they do. I can’t believe I stayed there 4 years in that kind of culture.
bad,"It wasn’t the company I didn’t like, it was my boss and lack of training. They pay wasn’t very good and no benefits. I worked for a Financial Advisor, so it was his responsibility to set pay and benefits not Northwestern Mutual."
bad,"If you don't care about learning actual financial advisor skills and want to just sell insurance.  This is your place.  If not, I'd highly advise going elsewhere."
bad,"good career, only if you have a solid financial foundation of your own, as compensation is commission-based only. Cold-calling is strongly encouraged. Products include insurance, investments, and retirement."
bad,"The culture is amazing, and everyone is very helpful, in your first couple of months. After that, you have to hustle and be very independent. If you are young and do this job, there is a 99% chance you will not make it. It is strictly commision unless you become an underwriter, so it is not a stable job either."
bad,"You have to be very disciplined especially when you're first starting out. They want you to produce 100 lives your first year. If you have the opportunity to do the internship program I highly recommend it. You have 6 months to build your clientele base and if you're hired full time after then you're able to hit the ground running. Unfortunately, I wasn't offered an internship spot and I went into the business with a poor natural market. They wanted me to get out of my natural market and build life long relationships with these people. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to build life long relationships with people outside of my natural market as quickly as they wanted so they fired me 60 days after hiring me."
bad,"false advertising people. NM is a great place to work, but don't be fooled by the hidden pyramid scheme. They make money off of you and any business you bring in! The turnover rate is something like 87% so basically whatever market you bring them they get their cut first and happily avoid mentioning that to you at all! Don't get me wrong, its decently easy work, but the individuals that make it past 5 years have it easy. All they have to do is wait for noobies to come in and give them ""jointwork."" You've been warned! If you want to work in the financial arena do it somewhere where its Base + commission."
bad,"I worked at the Franklin location. Training is not the best its rushed and they have everything scheduled bc it was a high turnover dept. calls were back to back, training was not thorough. Insurance is like $300 mo. They like to make improvements, but not so much implement new things when it causes a change they like to keep their structure. For ex. In training we tried to suggest a review the next morning a short one, but that was asking too much of them. Its a 6 month training program i would have imagined it being through."
bad,"Not paid much"
bad,powerful resources to help you move forward.... diverse culture....... most enjoyable is the people you get to meet during daily interactions............
bad,"Good company, I learned a lot. Created many detailed documents that would show each client where their money was, how it was working for them, and different ways that would be able to help them make more ."
bad,"Easy to succeed if you have the skill sets. I learned how to grow a client based practice.  How to network and cold call.  Was a good job for me out of college, but I want something with benefits and security."
bad,I worked for 2 advisors as an assistant. You were expected to get your life insurance license and series 7 after a year. I wasn't interested in the field so I chose to leave after a year and a half.
bad,"It was challenging to respond to the questions, because I used to enjoy working here and had the utmost trust in leadership. However in the last five years or so, the changes in executive leadership and has left the company adrift in uncertainty.  It's difficult to tell what their vision for the future is and their strategy to achieve it.  Neither does there seem to be any alignment as to how to move forward or execute the elusive vision and strategy.  Instead of making decisions based on what is best for the company and policyowners in the past, most people now make decisions based out of fear for their jobs.  Instead of fostering a culture of courageous conflict and accountability, they are inadvertently fostering a culture of ""yes"" people who won't hesitate to throw a peer under the bus in hopes of saving their job and the next quarterly downsizing.  "
bad,Not the best internship. Expected to bring your own contacts to sell insurance to. It is mostly a sales related experience. Not for everyone. The people are nice enough.
bad,"I worked at Northwestern Mutual as an intern. Let me start by saying this position is a great experience for certain people. Those certain people are those that know this internship will turn into your full time career at Northwestern Mutual. For those who are interested in this internship because it's a proclaimed ""Top 10 internship program"" and just want to stay there for the summer, I would NOT recommend. "
bad,"I came into the summer financial representative program expecting it to be a proper finance program. Unfortunately, the majority of your time consists of trying to sell your family and friends life insurance they don't need, and then cold calling businesses and trying to do the same. If you're just looking for something to put on a resume, this is fine, but if you're looking to learn skills and have an experience that will actually be valuable, don't waste your time here."
bad,"Was told in person that anyone would be given warning before being considered for being fired for any reason. It was a lie. The work was very easy, and not very demanding, but not a trustworthy area of management"
bad,"i would get into the office for 8 usually, and we would have an office meeting in the morning, Then i would either be going out on appointments or on the phone trying to schedule appointments. Management was good, they would try to give you ideas to help grow your business. The problem was they wouldn't actually help you get any clients. The hardest part was trying to schedule appointments because i was completely on my own. It was very stressful because i was reaching out to people i knew, or friends of friends. Never wanted to come on too strong but i would not get paid if i didn't because i was one hundred percent commission. I decided i was not comfortable trying to be forceful. The best part about the job was doing the actual job when i had the opportunity to meet with potential clients. I loved going over and creating personal financial plans for each individual client. I was meeting with a lot of young people and after going over their financial plan, most times i did not think it was in their best interest to be investing at the time. Unfortunately that meant i did not get paid"
bad,It was ok. The location was nice. The staff was friendly. It was just not the career for me. I was looking for something more than cold calls and bothering my family for referrals.
bad,"Working as a Financial Adviser requires a diverse and wide personal network. You must possess exceptional sales skills to be able to sign your friends and family as clients. A vast majority of your business will be through referrals, which can only be obtained after satisfying the insurance needs of people you already know."
bad,I felt the the entire premise of the internship was just to generate extra sales for the specific branch. I didn't receive much guidance and was just told to start making clients on my own. There was no help or assistance I was just told to come in every day and try to make as many insurance sales that I could.
bad,Although I enjoyed my time at NWM. I left to continue to give baseball a go. I did very well on the insurance selling side of things. But I had no desire to be a financial adviser.
bad,"The company was switching from traditional waterfall IT project management to some form of Agile, Scrum, KANBAN, or SAFe, but it was never clearly defined.  They tried making all teams fit into one category, which clearly wasn't working."
bad,"This was an internship which was basically just trying to sell life insurance.  As a college student, approaching someone about life insurance was not going to work.  I think this internship could have been productive if it was more designed to shadow the senior reps, assist with paperwork and products, etc to gain the necessary experience.  Sending us out to try to do it on our own did not lead to success in my case.  Also only paid around $100/week I believe."
bad,Hard to make a career in it. Great skill builder in sales but wouldn't advise it as a career unless you are well connected in your area. Great management..they really care about you and your success.
bad,"Use lots of interns to get their families and friends to sign up, don't pay you other than a stipend that wont even cover parking/gas. Expect you to call family and friends and pressure them into buying insurance and stuff."
bad,"Great for those who have extensive networks (family, friends, community) who can then turn that network into a profitable client base. Don't join unless you can bring in your own clients."
bad,"Large management looking for high volume interns and recruits to increase pool of ""warm leads"" and call base. Managers were more worried about their own sales than teaching the new prospects."
bad,Need to be able to stick it out. They are not holistic planners. They just want to sell Life Insurance products to clients. It you can't get on board with pushing life insurance it's not the company for you.
bad,"Upper management can be extremely nasty to employees."
bad,"The best part of the job was the work, I enjoyed my job responsibilities but did not have much respect for any of the 4 managers I had while I worked there and felt my coworkers were among the laziest I have ever worked with in my 30+ years in computer operations."
bad,"First professional working experience. Friendly co-workers, always willing to lend a hand and teach. Did not stay for an extended period of time due to other offers."
bad,"Learning as much as I did about benefit plans, insurance plans, and managing money was truly beneficial towards my career; however, sales is not entirely something I would be interested in doing for a long-term. I feel that my knowledge that I've gained through school would be better used elsewhere, but this company gave me a better perspective to some topics that I've worked on later in school, such as tax accounting."
bad,You will be calling all your friends and family to sell them life insurance. Good opportunity if you have a large funnel of financially successful friends or family members.
bad,The best part of the job is you get to create your own schedule and meet with the people you enjoy.  Providing financial security for my clients has been very rewarding.
bad,"I'd rather not comment on this business.  I handled a large amount of confidential material, but the backup and appreciation wasn't readily known from the head manager."
bad,Make sure you have enough money saved up to anticipate not making any money for many months.  Great income potential and you better have a lot of known people to hit up for presentations.
bad,"The internship I was hired on for, a Financial Advisor Intern, was made to sound much more glamorous than it was in actuality. The lack of transparency was something that bothered me. However despite all this, the training and skills I gained from them are invaluable and I still find myself using them today. "
bad,"Northwestern is one of, if not the hardest places to work. You are expected to do most work for no compensation in hopes that you will get a sale months down the line of the sales cycle. If you are able to build a business and succeed, you can be set up for a life of financial stability and  be able to control your hours. At the beginning though, it feels similar to treading water of trying to keep your business afloat. The people that work here are all very enthusiastic and motivated and it is a great culture when your business is doing well."
bad,A very good company to work at.  A very serious corporate mentality. I worked there for 37 years 11 months and they ever had a job layoff. They also provided lunch
bad,"I learned a lot about the insurance industry and how it operates from a sales perspective. The company culture was always open and friendly, with the senior representatives taking time out of their day to help interns. The hardest part about the job was actually making the sales of insurance to your family members and friends. I really enjoyed working with a good amount of other interns because it seemed like we were all in it together."
bad,Don't start a career unprepared with connects looking for insurance- it's an uphill battle that starts everyday even before you begin employment at Northwestern
bad,"While working for Northwestern Mutual, I found that the company culture was not close knit and a bit awkward. They skimped over proper training, so I never felt as though I was going to mess up the system."
bad,"I took this job as a summer internship.  I thought that I would be making calls with hot and cold leads and selling insurance to individuals and businesses.  However, their model relies heavily on utilizing your own contacts to sell insurance to family and friends.  It is a good job if you don't mind asking your friends and family to give you money, but can be awkward otherwise."
bad,NM is a great place to work but should only be for those who are looking to go into sales and are truly interested in financial planning.  Selling insurance is extremely difficult and should not be something put on the backs of college students in order to make money.
bad,Extremely fast paced environment. Commission based salary made for long weeks with no pay. Management was spectacular.
bad,This was a good work environment and is well suited for anyone wanting to become a financial representative. There is a lot of calling friends and family required to attempt to sell them products.
bad,This was a horrible experience for me. I was the receptionist and I was to report to the office manager. She was horrible. She sat in her office and looked at her daughters myspace and other websites all day. She would give me her work with no explanation on what was to be done and I would have to either figure it out myself or ask someone else what was to be done because she would not answer my questions. I put in my notice that I would be going back to school in a month and by the end of the week she called me into her office to let me go. No real explanation. It was bizarre and all around not a good experience.
bad,"I loved my management and my team.  I just felt as if, it was a pyramid  scheme.  Everyone at the top is making beaucoup bucks, and the financial reps aren't making anything other than the 4k we received for training.  It's solely commission.  Training is long, and you're thrown into it without much guidance.  Great people, although not a great experience and not worth the time and effort unless you're SURE this is for you.  Feel as if I wasted so much of my time."
bad,"A networked based job. If you are okay bringing your personal life into your business life, then a job as a financial representative with NWM might be for you."
bad,"Lack of training on financial products but pretty of role-playing to teach you how to get referrals for more reps to replace you. Quick to tell you to bug your family and friends for insurance sales. If you can gather your own leads and work a ton to make a very inconsistent pay-check, maybe this is for you."
bad,Need to have a build your own business attitude. Can't be afraid to talk to people. This type of work was very relationship based. You are asking questions many people don't feel like talking about.
good,Throw representatives at a wall and see who sticks.  Solicit your family and friends.  Cloaked in secrecy.  Highly opaque.  Antiquated methodologies.  Sticky business.
good,Distinctive association between contractor and employee. Not benefits from the association of employee to the benefits of a contractor. High security profile. Parking lot and free food at the cafeteria.
good,Interns are expected to help drive the sales of the company. Then leave
good,Great place to work if you don't need money for 6-12 months.  They charge you for several things that you don't find out about for a few months.
good,"Not a job. Lots of increasing expenses. They tell you to get FINRA series 6/63/SIE. After you get these, there is not much training to help you earn from these. They will suggest joint-work instead of real training. It is suggested you split your pay 50/50 to learn from senior advisors. This never happens in reverse. Last person who made it past 5 years was 8 years ago. Not an inclusive environment."
good,Not much room for long term career advancement opportunities. No benefits. Company keeps temps on for long periods of time with no hope for permanent placement.
good,"The climate of the company is changing significantly, there is a lot of confusion in the team/company.  There has been recent job layoffs which has caused more uncertainty."
good,"All compensation on commission, no support"
good,All compensation based. No salary. Hard to sell in a recession environment.
good,"Make sure you have a lot of savings, because there is hardly no pay after the first few weeks. The job is commission only. They do pay for your listeners the first year tho."
good,"After all the effort people put in to getting hired at NM, I thought the hiring managers would work just as hard to retain good candidates. Turns out they over-hire because they create high turn-over. Seems like a great corporation to work for, but mostly it has a shiny exterior. Once you see how the sausage is made, that exterior doesn't quite look the same."
good,"I learned a lot however, the culture was less than ideal. "
good,This working environment is geared toward the individuals who can bridge the gap for the first 6 months to one year with financial support from others. Taking the time to develop the advising relationships and gaining clients is a long process and takes patience. You must have at least one or two seasoned advisors who will be willing to work with you at this company and show you the ropes to be successful.
good,"Low pay for the skills and licenses required to do the job. Micro-management that has terrible communication skills. It did have health benefits but with really high deductible. Co-workers were nice people, but often inappropriate."
good,Working a straight commission position when you have a family especially as a female is much harder than most other positions.  There aren't a lot of female influencers in the insurance field.
good,"Joined the firm as a Rep. As it is typical in the industry, particularly with the firms which came out of the life insurance agency models, we were coached to compile a project-100 (family and friends) to call, prospect, and ask for referrals. As I was not local, it was particularly challenging. It is often said that the first two or so years starting out as a financial advisor is difficult. Portland Northwestern Mutual office has great training programs and general culture is okay. It would also be helpful to get to know who your potential ""director"" would be - as each team runs differently and the personality of the right director will be beneficial for the aspiring new rep."
good,Working for Northwestern Mutual was very educational. I learned a lot about the insurance and investment industry. You need to be very detailed to be able to work there. Lisa Tran was a joy to work with.
good,"I was employed by one of the brokers himself under the umbrella that was NWM.  He was a good guy, they pay your salaries themselves and basically run their own businesses."
good,"the people are amazing to work with, but the work itself, I was employed for only 4 months and loaded with tons of responsibilities which I was willing and eager to learn but by that 4 month period, because I was a ""slow learner"" they said I was in over my head and no longer was going to be kept on board. It was disappointing that nobody was willing to do further training with me or help me better myself for advancing."
good,"They do not prepare you for the job you do, ultimately you must be wealthy beforehand to succeed in this industry. You also need to have a lot (over 400) contacts to people in the city of your choosing in order to make sales"
good,"NM sells you on a lifestyle of income, independence and impact.  It is a very high sells, long hours and little return for time spent. It takes a long time to obtain that lifestyle of working 20 hours a week and earning several hundred thousand dollars a year. I didn't want to put in the time to see if I could make that happen.  Furthermore, the training and education did leave a lot to be desired."
good,"I do not recommend this internship. They do not provide you with leads, you will have to provide your own. You will be required to sell life insurance to your friends and family."
good,"The job is difficult because you are entrepreneur and in charge of your own business. Although the company offers good training it lacks on going training in developing new representatives. Also it seems like out the office I worked out of, there were people they wanted to succeed and provided them with the tools to do so."
good,I got a better understanding of financial planners and their everyday life. I learned a lot from the Sales School class that was taught to us by the intern director.
good,"Hard and stressful work, only go for a position here if you are able and WANTING to work like a dog and effectively employ any underhanded tactic to getting into meetings with people. "
good,I worked with the the executive manager and the new representatives coming in. I taught them the paperwork and the proprietary software. Northwestern Mutual does not offer any compensation to new representatives. It is a commission only job which makes it difficult to recruit.
good,"I worked in a dish room with 4 people and we took care of over 2,000 employee lunches in a 2 hour period.  It was very hard on the physical end.  I wanted to move up but there was not a chance for advancement."
good,"Everyone there is fake. They pretend they care about you but they couldn't care less. Only want to help you if it makes them money. Not a good place to start for a new career or someone who's directly out of school. Barely got any experience, very discouraging if this is your career choice."
good,"The company is great - solid and respectable. It becomes challenging in the field as a support person to an advisor. Being sales people, they are not trained in management so you have to care about your own development and work-life balance or the job could swallow you up.  It also depends on the advisor you work with and if their personality and work ethic matches or balances yours. For most cases, don't count on the advisor to value you enough to really compensate well. The more common attitude is how they can minimize their costs and get by with as little staff as possible. What we do has great purpose - helping people manage their financial lives - but that noble purpose often feels like a marketing slogan in the day-to-day stress of not being in any way the cause of losing a case for the advisor."
good,A good company with good products but the training is a joke and they know it.  Do not attempt if you do not have at least a year worth of income stashed away and previous experience that provided great training or you will not survive as it is a commission only setup.  The people are friendly if that is any consultation.
good,"A staff role at Northwestern Mutual is good for your first job, but there isn't much room for growth beyond that. Compensation is horrible and there are nonexistent perks. This is only for staff roles, the financial advisors have autonomy, advancement, and better income opportunities."
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a company that is highly based in Life Insurance. It really pushes the issue when it comes to selling life and disability insurance. I 100% agree with the business model but the way they go about doing it is interesting. They drive the ""under 5"" reps to do 40 dials a day and to do as much joint work ""teaming up with other reps"" as possible. This is only due to the fact that there is a high turnover rate and Northwestern Mutual does not want to have High net worth clients to be orphans. "
good,"I was a contracted employee at Northwestern Mutual for about a year and a half.  Throughout my entire time, I obtained overwhelmingly positive feedback from every single one of my colleagues, as well as management.  Yet, when the time came for a Full-Time role possibility to get off of my contract, I was offered a ""Long-Term Temporary"" position instead, because there was not enough headcount for a Full-Time Position.  Long-term temporary employees must pay double for benefits and do not receive the full benefit package as the normal full-time staff receives.  This was their attempt to string me along and was extremely discouraging due to the feedback I was receiving and the quality of work I was producing.  "
good,"They use new hires to capture their ""circle of influence"" giving employees false hopes of success.  Only 5% stay with the job after a year.  Takes a minimum of 4 years to establish your business.  You need living resources to overcome obstacles until income is generated."
good,"Northwestern offers the best outside sales training that I've ever seen, and I have been through several sales trainings with other companies. They used the One Card System when I was there, and I still use it to this day.  Nice people, you make it what you want there."
good,You are basically on your own after 4 weeks of training.  They are more so concerned about life/disability insurance than investments.  The most enjoyable part is working with other financial advisors
good,Poor work life balance. Managers ask about your ambitions but work to prevent movement within the company if you're of any value to the current department. Benefits have definitely taken a nose dive in the recent years with primary doctors that use to be covered not anymore with limited options outside of Milwaukee. Expectations set by management and the business are often out of touch with what the engineers state are obtainable with the end result of the expectation that you are available to work 24 hours a day.
good,"Fantastic company, but an inadequate compensation package consisting of 100 percent commission-based-pay. Very high turnover and no continuity amongst office."
good,"I worked here over 10 years ago, and from what I remember, there was a lot of criticism from the agent I worked for.  She didn't allow much independence or value employee ideas.  The agent was in and out of the office and was very micro-managing, calling constantly or looking over my shoulder when I was working.  It made for a very uncomfortable work environment."
good,a good opportunity if you know a lot of wealthy people who trust you without knowing you very well.  Calling up people to get in their business was not for me.  All members of the oppostie gender think it's a date.
good,At the time of entry into the industry the market share was poor.  The company and training was great for an insurance and financial services company.
good,"I loved what I did, I just didn't enjoy the large ability to be taken advantage of in my position. My role was very much subjective to tasks and activities, so the role was not fully described when I received the job offer, and for the amount of work I did and amount of overtime I did (even as a salaried employee), I was not compensated properly. I had a base salary, but that's it. One Christmas bonus was awarded, but none of the promised bonuses were ever given, no benefits whatsoever were offered, and the office gets so hectic during 2 periods of the year, that no one is ever in a good mood or excited to go to work at all."
good,"While the people I worked with were nice, a 100% commission job is extremely stressful.  No leads were given.  Supposed to make 40 - 50 cold calls a day."
good,I can not limit myself to their product and I ended up selling very few policies because of this. I refuse to take the chance that the service I'm providing the people I care for is subpar.
good,"Decent place to work, but be prepared to work in a very corporate culture. If that's you're thing, then you may thrive here, but it wasn't for me. The people I met were all pretty nice, but the pay and benefits were meek compared to other places I have worked."
good,They are very set on an antiquated sales method. I worked as an intern and chose not to continue working full time. They ignored my request to work in a non-sales position.
good,"This job is all about being uncomfortable, and if you don't like that, don't even try. You have to start out dialing all your friends and family and then prospect out beyond them if you can. People who are part of the 10 percent who make it past five years do well, others find something else."
good,There is a lot of room for upside potential but it includes a lot of risk. I would recommend this job to anyone who has a lot of energy and the ability to talk to anyone at anytime.
good,"Great company, best products, but the pay scale is terrible.Long hours of hard work, dialing, but the income from all of that is dismal."
good,"Northwestern Mutual is very good at management and understanding of working with youth and younger population."
good,During my time at Northwestern Mutual I gained some sales experience through their training program but felt that much of the time I spent searching for leads and prospecting instead of interacting with clients. It was a very open work environment where you could make your own hours and put in as much work as you needed.
good,"I work for 3 separate financial representatives on a daily basis. Each of them run their businesses in their own unique way."
good,Responsible for all staffing efforts for summer internship
good,Learned a great deal about the life insurance business. All commission based.
good,Very unclear guideline and very challenging. Get internship if you like to sales insurance to your friends and family members
good,Sales are heavily endorsed at this company regardless of who you promote products to. Family and friends are the target for new representatives. Long term sustainable products are not evaluated properly by representatives for individuals looking for term life insurance.
good,"Company has a lot of potential, however the recession made it impossible to survive with a commission only opportunity."
good,Financial representatives were thrown out into the field. We felt as though we were being used.
good,"I was continually given more and more responsibility.  There were days I was there for 12 hours in order to get the job done, but when I asked for a raise, I was denied and eventually fired."
good,"I was  really hoping for good portfolio or asset management experience, but this was more of a sales oriented role . and counted on you contacting your own contacts for sales."
good,"I was there 6 months. Seemed very disorganized in the HR area. Very nice management, but seemed very behind in the way things are being done. A lot of manual efforts where technology would be helpful. Not very open to process improvement suggestions. I worked with a lot of people that ""just needed a job"". I to need a job, but can't just go through the motions when I know what I am doing isn't correct work."
good,"Northwestern Mutual has a very old fashioned rigid business model that will soon be obsolete if they do not modernize. It is very important to have a large natural network of people to call when you first get there, because they will make you call your friends and family and push all kinds of insurance and financial services on them in order to succeed at the company. If you fail/feel uncomfortable doing this, they let you go pretty quickly. They also failed to adapt the model to account for diversity in age, gender, and race. It is no wonder the average Financial Advisor nationwide is a 55-year-old white male- the business model hinders anything else (generally). But if you do make it, you are an anomaly (or have really rich family friends and relatives)."
good,"The company is trying to hire a lot more women and minorities, but that does not mean the management of all white, older men can effectively train them."
good,"probably would not do this again as I'm not a sales person, but this is a great job with a lot of possibilities for someone who is good at sales position."
good,"Tough Career to get of the ground, If looking for a career that will start you out in debt but eventually get you to be a high net worth individual this is it."
good,"Good place to start off, hard place to work if you have a household you need to support. Lots of meetings, reporting daily. Must be a self motivated to continue in this business."
good,its a great environment to cut your teeth. you will face a lot of rejection and be forced to face a lot of your inner demons. if you can stick it out for the first 5-7 years you will be glad you did. being a career changer with a growing family makes the job difficult. you have to earn your work life balance and it takes years to get there.
good,"Have to manage your time - most of the job is calling friends and family. "
good,"NM does not offer a base salary and takes a zero risk investment in its employees by transferring risks including slow sales onto its reps. The company does sell quality products, but the business model creates high barriers to entry if you are starting a new career."
good,"So there is really not a typical day at the office since each day is completely different. Some day I can have as many as 5+ meetings schedule; while others I have only 2 meetings schedule. Learning wise, I have learn a lot both about myself and about where my overall vision for my future is. Workplace culture is great since people here are supportive of each other. Hardest part of my job would have to be dealing with some people who wants more profit for the company but don't understand that profit without satisfaction lead nowhere in the future.  Most enjoyable part of my job would be the people who I have the pleasure to get to interact with on a daily basis."
good,"Northwestern Mutual as a company is a strong, financially responsible company that for the most part takes care of their policy holders. The individual office and group that I worked in was quite different. They preached continuous improvement, but then shunned me when I informed them I was going to go back to school to finish my degree. The only people that really had it well off there were the ones that went through the internship program and committed everything they had at the sacrifice of having a family life. I didn't want that."
good,Had a bad experience with by employers. They treated me badly and didnt care to listen to anything I had to say. I wasnt treated equally when it came to my colleagues.
good,"I learned a lot about myself, who I am, what I'm capable of, my strong suits, confirmations of my values both personally and professionally and how I will always know I will excel in what I do by doing what is right and in the best interest of my client and/or company I am working with. Northwestern Mutual/ my team (which was different than the office and experience) challenged my limits, and made me set goals daily, weekly and monthly and held me accountable in a way that helped me grow. I wish Northwestern Mutual Greater Tampa Bay offices were set up differently and managed differently because I do believe there would be a lot more success for all the offices otherwise."
good,"Sometimes the business office can be pretty cliquey. Kind of like high school lunch. If you are not in the ""in"" group you will be left out of some of the company activities."
good,"I learned a lot about the financial services, such as dealing with insurance policies and investments. Management was decent but there wasn't much culture."
good,Get ready for the worst experience of your life. Who dreams of growing up and being an insurance salesman? The intern class I took part in was completely duped into believing we'd be working in wealth management.
good,"Internship for a summer. If you enjoy selling life insurance and health insurance then this is the place for you. All commission, employees were friendly/helpful."
good,"It was not what I expected when initially recruited and told it would be easy for me build a book of business with my sales background.  Regardless, you are at the mercy of whether or not your client is even insurable when they want to apply for protection."
good,Very good environment with values of taking care of the client's needs.  The company does the right things with each advisor running his/her own business which tends to make it feel more like a smal business in the work environment.
good,"Lack of advancement is the greatest opportunity for this company. The focus is truly on the financial reps, but staff employee could benefit from training and other developmental opportunities."
good,I would arrive in the morning and make sure my schedule was ready to go.  I would make my calls to my customers for the next day to make sure the appointment was still going to work for them.
good,Co-workers are great and pitch-in to help one another. If supervisor disagrees with you it is difficult to be heard. Things change a lot which is sometimes good but can be frustrating.
good,"As a student, you are required to attend a weekly meeting at 7:30 AM and a small group coaching session. That isn't asking too much, but you also have to call as many people as possible and set outside meetings weekly or you were considered as ""failing"" at requirements. Taking on a full semester and spending countless hours trying to call, pester, and beg for meetings for $100 a week just didn't add up for me. Not to mention, once you finally sold a policy, it took weeks for you to ever see any of the money. So if you are trying to pay for rent and go to school, you need a second job that pays $10 an hour."
good,9 out of 10 Reps in this company will fail. Expect to have your own leads and if you can't sell permeant life insurance then do not expect to make enough money worth the work. Great company and products....terrible leadership and model to succeed.
good,They do not treat you like an adult and care more about looking like they are doing something (in front of our home office) than actually accomplishing anything with our financial reps.
good,"This is a great opportunity if you have enough money saved up in the beginning while you build your practice, otherwise, it's a non-paying salary position."
good,"This is a career for someone who does not mind putting in 60 hours of work a week making cold calls to potential clients, including on Holidays. Although the products a Financial Representative sells (life & disability insurance.. etc) are valuable, the stigma of a life insurance sales agent remains. Although there is opportunity to advance in skills and provide additional services, by obtaining a variety of licenses, the job security and income consistency are lacking in strength."
good,The firm I worked for was managed poorly. The work environment was lax and unproductive. Communication within the organization was untimely.
good,It is very important to have a good starting market to get your feet off the ground.
good,Assisted Financial Reps in processing policies and making phone calls to follow up on renewals and new policys
good,Boss has favorites and the ones they dislike are treated differently
good,Even successful reps who have been with the company for years are living in constant fear of not making their numbers next week and loosing their jobs.
good,"A typical day in this position included maintaining all of the administrative work for the full time recruiting team, calling recruiting leads from the internet and other staff in the office, coordinating with candidates currently in the process, and attending career fairs and interviewing candidates for the internship recruiting team. This position required working with all levels of staff in the office, including management. The hardest aspect of the position was coordinating with everyone involved in the recruiting process, and completing the abundance of detailed administrative work that each candidate going through the process required. The most enjoyable aspect of the position was having the ability to do a variety of work each day and utilize my strengths of communication and relationship building."
good,"In the office by 0700, organizing and planning, writing up contracts, cold-calling referrals for appointments, taking care of policy issues with the Home Office and meet with clients the rest of the day. Usually home by 2100, sometimes later."
good,- Cold called at least 40 people a day
good,"A typical day includes phoning for new appointment. "
good,"NM gets in its own way when it comes to transforming the business. Executive leadership has a vision, middle management makes sure that it will fail. "
good,"I do not have anything to share regarding my time at Northwestern Mutual. It is a large corporation that is headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. It is an insurance and financial services firm."
good,Lack of culture in the office makes it difficult to succeed. Very little interaction with others. No excitement or enjoyment to go to work on a daily basis.
good,There is an inordinate amount of change going on right now. Employee morale is suffering. The company has been around for 160+ years so it’s likely not going anywhere. They have recently downsized mainly older workers in favor of hiring younger and from the outside. Seems like focus is more on tech than product fundamentals. The home office experience is completely different than being in a sales position or field office.
good,I don't want to take the time to do this. I'm not sure why i am required to. Just filling characters so this will leave me alone. Should be done now!!
good,"Company is in the middle of a transformation and it shows.  There is a sort of identity crisis around the Corporate culture.  They are trying to do too much all at once (and they don't know if they want to be an insurance company, a wealth management company, an innovative tech lab or some sort of ""disruptor"" in the financial services industry); they claim to be all of these at the same time.  One big negative is the sales pressure for Advisory Services and Permanent Life Insurance for employees, even if you don't need those products."
good,"Very difficult to develop a market in this industry. You are in a sales role also so don't let a recruiter convince you different. You are expected to make 40 calls a day and you have to find those people to call, the company doesn't do it for you. Starting off, you will be selling only life insurance, disability insurance, and long-term care.  As you pass your SIE, Series 6, and Series 63, you will start to sell all different kinds of securities. You job duties will not change though throughout the years. You will still have to call a lot of people and keep finding more people. If you're going to work in the financial industry, this is the best company in the world. However, it is a difficult career and not for everyone. You will take a personality test upon hiring to see if your personality matches with those who are successful in the business. This does not determine your hiring, but will give both you and NM a good idea of what you'll do. The job is 100% commission based with no base salary. As you get more into the career you will have renewals and advisory cases which will be more passive income but not nearly enough to survive on without new commissions."
good,There is a vast earning potential if you are willing to sacrifice your life outside of work for it. Lots of changes in management go on and goals are sometimes hard to establish
good,Insurance sales requires one to accept the FACT that he/she is as valuable as his/her last sale...constant pressure to produce more and a restrictive environment in terms of specific products to sell.
good,"Northwestern Mutual is an amazing company to work for if you have the market and a team to assist you doing so. Northwestern Mutual as a company has provided many opportunities to grow and create financial planning for both its contracted employees and its clients."
good,"If you can make it past 6 months it a miracle."
good,productive and fast paced environment. Great way to learn to work independently and as a team. if you want to learn and grow as a business person and as an advisor it will be an awesome experience
good,"Was a fantastic place to work initially, now too focused on the latest  trends in company vision. Do not appreciate employees and their heavy workloads."
good,Make about 40 cold phone calls a day.  Make at least 5 appointments a day. I learn that selling life insurance is very challenging.  Management is great to work with very supportive.  Great work culture.  Not spending very much time with your family and always on the road at people's home.  It was challenging finding new contacts every week.  You work with people on a daily basis and build relationships.
good,I wasn't to pleased with this company. They use college students as instruments to gain new clients such as their friends and family. Once we lose people to reach they let us go.
good,Unless you desire to be an FA this is just an ok place to work. If you are trying to be an FA they are very supporting and have good training programs.
good,Helped with kitchen duties and also dishwasher duties. assisted customers with getting their lunch. Filling up coffees and sugars. Help plate trays. Assisted the disabled with carrying their trays and getting food. Cleaning out food area. Cleaning out dishwashing machines and equipment.
good,"I didn't work in the main Springfield office, I just worked with one representative in his own office. I enjoyed it, he is a family friend. I worked flexible hours."
good,"My brief stint at NML was on the service desk."
good,"Go to mandatory meetings with leadership on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday. After the mandatory meetings you're on your own to find people to meet with, help with financially and procure sales. Repeat."
good,"As part of the agreement to my severence package, I am not allowed to comment on or say anything negative about the company.  That being said, the need for them to have such a clause in their agreement speakes for itself."
good,"They expect you to work 50+ hours a week, with little appreciation for the extra hours. The pay is less than competing companies pay their employees. The management gets a lot of perks, including paid vacations and shorter work weeks. Everyone else is worked very hard with few opportunities."
good,I loved the people I worked with but there was a lot of unreimbursed expenses especially if you live in a rural area. Also Payroll is every 2-3 weeks.
good,This was just an internship and quickly realized its not a place I wanted to work at. Selling life insurance can be a shady job that manipulates young people to essentially hand over their family contacts the older reps so they can soicate them
good,"company cares about you soliciting all your friends and family. Joint work is required at the company, few times my clients felt uncomfortable with another person being brought in"
good,"Excellent company that is focused on their employees.  The job is flexible, but demanding in a fast paced environment.  Great culture, management and people."
good,"Team work is rewarded. Sales goals are presented every week. Incentives are set the way is hard to make, so company saves money not paying bonuses. Over all is good place to work."
good,"This company is in a transition due to economic pressures.  It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to know what type of work environment it will have 12 months from now."
good,Not everyone is treated equal here.  Some areas are fast passed and others more layed back.  You have to prove yourself before you can get any work/life perks.
good,"At Northwestern Mutual you will work hard and for yourself. I learned a lot about financial planning and the money was decent. I had to work with more experienced reps on cases, which is fine, but some reps made recommendations that probably weren't in the best interest of the client. Overall Northwestern Mutual is a great company."
good,Northwestern Mutual is a great company that does right by it's clients.  As a rep you have unlimited earnings potential.
good,"The internship through NM was a very interesting learning experience. The ability to create your own schedule and a vast flexibility in your day to day routine was phenomenal. This also added a lot of pressure on yourself, as if you were not performing up to standards, it was generally your own fault. The materials provided to learning the products were sufficient, however it seemed very brand oriented. The compensation structure was very poor, especially if you planned on converting full time. There is no sort of base salary for people coming out of school, which really puts you through some financial stress in comparison to some other financial firms which offer up to three years of a small base salary. Strictly commission driven does not guarantee your job security or growth, and it seems to be really churn and burn oriented; aka you will most likely not see the people you have a month or two ago. Very production number oriented, as you announce your productivity numbers for the week in front of colleagues and managers. Also you have a desk fee when you go full time, which can be upwards of $300 a month."
good,"Required extensive training"
good,"A typical day at work can vary depending on the project I'm currently working on. Sometime very stressful, or time consuming. However, my goal is to get my work completed in a timely manner. I learned that nothing is impossible if as a team we are working in a proper way with full dedication. During the day, I came up with ideas and suggestions that will help manage the business function on a daily base. I really enjoyed my co-workers, they were 100% helpful and dedicated. The hardest part of my job was trying to complete so many different tasks in 8 hours. I enjoyed my job very much because I was constantly busy and I love being a hard worker."
good,"I've learned a great deal since joining the company including the fact that I have not interest in advancing my career and becoming a full time Financial Rep.  I rather help people than try to sell them insurance.  "
good,Little room for advancement. Many staff are stuck in their ways and you will do many things over and over again. There is a huge fear of embracing technologies within this organization.  
good,Its a sales job... Completely based on commission. If you like that kind of job and can generate your own leads then its golden. If you prefer more structure then this is not the job for you.
good,"I enjoyed working at Northwestern. They had a very family-like quality to the office. They were very flexible with my schedule around my kids. The job was very easy and fun to do, because you would learn new things about the stock market every day."
good,Day to day agenda depending upon client appointments
good,"The internal jobs are referral based- everyone who has a job in staff was referred by someone, therefore, the culture is considered as a big family. However, it can backfire a lot considering that all the directors are either related to each other, or are close friends."
good,"Though working for Northwestern Mutual the Reps are basically self employed so you are really working individually for the Reps.  Therefore, your work environment and experience can fluctuate."
good,Not a collegial working environment. Great company but you never know what the local managers and  their staff in the office will treat you like. It was not a friendly environment and things worked or did not work for you depending on your background and personality of senior people you worked with.
good,I enjoyed my time at Northwestern Mutual but it was a forever fit for me. I made some great friendships while I was there and was included in meetings to help grow my job detail. It was my first receptionist position and I will be forever grateful for the experience it gave me.
good,The culture has changed so that all that seems to matter is the compensation and benefits of those at the top.  Everyone else is disposable and easily outsourced and or replaced.  A very sad change for a company that was always about relationships.
good,It is tricky for a single parent to have work life balance. Training is good for those already familiar with the financial  sales industry or interns converting.
good,The internship program was very unorganized. I found it to be a waste of time and it is not helpful to a career in finance. I would not recommend the program.
good,There is a great opportunity to have an amazing life style once you make it past a certain amount of years as a Rep. Get used to relying on friends and family at first to build your market.
good,Not a bad work environment but it can be really difficult without any base pay. They do help you get your licenses if you stay with them but that can be difficult because of the hours you need.
good,"It was a well-paying job after working at a non-profit. I was able to move into my first apartment which only cost $500 at the time and my roommate was never around. Perfect."
good,"The Service Desk is very fast paced and allows you to get experience on various hardware and software platforms."
good,The company has a good training program. It allows you to run your own business but the truth is that isn't until you've sold insurance and had help from senior advisors for 5 to 10 years.
good,"I worked at Northwestern Mutual for two years as a consultant. I guess the best way to describe their business culture is ""confused"". They will jump into projects without preparation or a clear outcome in mind, ramp up and throw tons of money at a project, only to haphazardly abandon the project before it's completed or tested. After working on a project for a year and obtaining funding to move the project forward, the project was abruptly shelved as they laid-off more than 20% of their workforce to pay for the two new office buildings downtown. Interestingly enough, the company continues to give credit for my work to other employees. They have incompetent employees who are not trained or developed, yet they constantly praise each other for the outstanding work they do. Their field financial offices are given no support or training and feel abandoned by the parent corporation."
good,"They don't really care about there employee, if your working for the HO in Milwaukee.  If your working for independent business owners then that a different story."
good,This is a good company that provides good products. Job security does not exist. It takes a specific bread to work in the insurance industry/with Northwestern Mutual.
good,"Do not be fooled, this is more of a life insurance company than a financial company. You will be selling life insurance for most of your first year and are required to meet daily sales and production targets of 40 call a day and 3 sales a week. You are required to tap into your current network of friends and family and I was very uncomfortable being known by my peers as someone using them for professional gain. Some can do really well but many often leave because they can't make any money. A commission-only pay structure can be very lucrative, but also risky as the slow sales cylce of life insurance might mean you won't get paid for a month if you don't consistenty close deals. Don't say you haven't been warned."
good,"Typical work day includes a lot of customer service and problem solving for a variety of issues with client policies.  Not the most friendly environment/work culture, everyone says to themselves.  Very""figure-it-out yourself "" environment, but there are a lot of resources to figure it out.  Great experience to build problem solving skill set."
good,"They expect 85% of the new advisors to fail. It's a grind with making an average of 200 plus cold calls a week. Poor economy doesn't help and older reps can be snakes. All new reps are encouraged, practically forced, to work with veteran reps on ""big cases."" These are high potential leads that come usually from the new guy's family and friends. Then the vet rep runs the show and take 70-80% of the commission."
good,"Northwestern Mutual is great at selling Life Insurance. But, with regards to job satisfaction, benefits, and compensation, expect to struggle during your first few years. The commission only compensation encourages selling rather than helping clients and management does not encourage improvement or advancement through licensing in securities."
good,This company provides a lot of opportunity to learn about the industry. You deal with clients and building personal relationships. There is minimal support while starting your career (which takes several years).
good,It was a good company to work for learned a lot of financial information to help with financial planning. Meeting with persons who had questions about there financial goals and how to reach them were beneficial.
good,The company has good training and a communicative support network. Most people you work with are great and I found some good friends from this position. The job is pure commission based sales. Expect a lot of cold calling and creating your own book of business. I definitely improved my phone skills and scheduling skills from this position.
good,"It is a very fraternity type atmosphere where if you are one of the chosen you are given more latitude, but if you are anything else you are shown the door quickly."
good,dont really remember had this internship 10 years ago. they paid for my life license. Dont have anything else to tell. Only worked there 2 day out of the week for 4 hours.
good,"If leaders at NM would get together and go in the same direction, this company could be world class. But every VP and some directors are into ""empire building"" and only worry about their particular silo. Ask good questions in your interviews, and take great notes."
good,Be ready to absorb 6 months to a year of financial strain as it is a commission position. A lot of time will be spent on the phone setting meetings and reaching out to potential clients. Much more of a sales role than a financial one when first starting out in the company. You'll be dealing with mostly insurance and joint work to begin with.
good,"You have a lot of freedom with this career, its not easy what so ever. Its not for everybody but they teach you a lot. It's just not for me. I like getting instant gratification if I'm working. This job requires years of patience."
good,This job is all about timing.  Having good support in the beginning and a lot of diligence. First year will be rough. They have good training for new hires.   Lots of people do what you will be trying to do.
good,"Almost everyone that works here, especially the Lonetree Office is very nice and helpful. It just wasn't the right environment for me and I would only suggest becoming a representative if it is your true passion in life and you can give your all for the next 5-10 years of your life. I was not a representative but I saw people crumble under the pressure almost everyday."
good,"Good people, work environment is very nice. Work load is very heavy, can be quite stressful. Job is very varied, customer service interactions can be good and bad as with any position."
good,I learned a lot during the internship about life insurance. The job itself was to call friends and family and try to sell them life insurance. wouldn't want to work there full time. I quit halfway through the internship because I ran out of money and the pay was all commission.
good,"This job is great if you want to control your own destiny and your schedule.  The sky is the limit as far as earnings.  However, you better be prepared to be told no, and have the door slammed in your face on a regular basis.  you really need to believe in what you are doing."
good,"A NM representative is challenged with the task of building a holistic financial planning practice by leveraging their personal network and referrals from that network to build a book of business.  It's incredibly challenging and as emotionally exhausting as any sales job I could imagine.  Most reps don't last long, but those who do are stellar professionals and the experience of even attempting it definitely builds character."
good,Northwestern Mutual is a great place to grind at.  It will force you to learn about yourself and go after what you want.  This isn't a place for someone who is not willing to be available around the clock.
good,"High pressure on interns with ridiculous deadlines and standards.Combined with high commissions, made financial planning not in the best interest of some clients"
good,it is okay. the management team does a great job recruiting. doesn't do a good job with giving complete information about the compensation as far as training pay and commission afterwards.
good,Lacks leadership in every level. Hard to get a solid foundation set. Not for everyone. Good learning experience. Learn valuable life lessons and skills.
good,they will have you reach out to all of your friends and family to sell whole life insurance policies. this company did very well at training for sales and motivating employees
good,Great company to work for! Has great potential to make a lot of money. But all depends on your network and confidence on asking them for money. Good company overall
good,Great company but difficult because it is only compensation based with no base salary.  Otherwise a schedule that fits with anyone.
good,Requires a lot of self motivation and time. You cannot expect to go into this position with out performing for your compensation.
good,"overall a good company to work for, advancement is not based on performance.  Free lunches are given and the menu has a wide variety."
good,"In this job I worked the control center monitoring the cctv, telephone and alarm systems. Toured the property if need properred reports. Assist with the security of the employees and property."
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a great company for the right people.  Unfortunately, those who really want to be creative and think outside of the box do not fit.  The ""NM Way"" is still very bureaucratic and rigid and is not aligned with the agile pace of business today.  There are so many great things this organization has, but the day to day employee experience is one of total conformity and that does not cultivate creative thought."
good,"Regardless how well you performed and made improvements, it never seemed enough. More work was given without training but you must come up with your own procedures while learning the job or Management would implement the PIP initiative for poor work progress.  The workload is quite heavy with little acknowledgement making day-to-day projects a chore and very stressful."
good,My time at this job was ok but the management gave to chances to advancement all thought I learned a lot but my time was very stressful i would not ever reapply to this company.
good,"I loved the job, just didn't like the environment. Free lunch but short breaks. The hardest part of the job was staying focused while having to sit all day."
good,"Great learning experience for first time sales job.  Built book of business from working with friends, family and networking.  Learned how to run my own business and profile individuals to learn about their financial needs."
good,"Unless you are a great salesmen who has no need for a base salary, this is a perfect job for you.  If you are a recent college grad, or someone who needs the money, this job isn't for you.  A lot of cold calling and people who simply aren't interested in life insurance products or services.  Difficult job to be good at."
good,"The company is solid, their strategy for attaining new clients needs work, they expect to hire college students and force them to sell to their families and friends and then once you're out of personal contacts they are quick to let you go. The structure at the particular branch I was in was highly inefficient. No teaching, No helping, Nothing to further you in your career."
good,"Don't bother unless you are already well connected, they don't help you find new people to sell to at all."
good,"While here I helped to grow my own business selling financial and insurance products to young families and business owners.  This was a job with a lot of potential, however the down market during this time frame made a difficult profession more difficult.  "
good,"I worked an internship for a summer at a Northwestern Mutual branch.  The company promised its employees much more than it could deliver.  After the initial bombardment of friendliness from other agents, they began to prove themselves very unhelpful. No one seemed to help one another which made me feel alone."
good,"This job was not a strong fit for me, but I learned a lot and the people were great."
good,"great place to work alot of fun "
good,Tough business to get started in. You have to develop a book of business through making phone calls to connections and setting up appointments to make sales.
good,This particular branch did not have a strong support system in place. I did enjoy educating families/businesses make smart financial decisions. Co-workers were mid-senior level management professionals. Competitive but unrealistic start.
good,A typical day at work is being tied to my desk and phone all day long with an extremely structured scheduled and no flexibility.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the free lunch and pay.  There is no time between calls to be able to talk with co-workers and it is made very clear to call center reps that we are not at the same level as leadership.
good,"Learned personal financial planning as compared to corporate financial planning, stategic planning and sensitivity studies. I met a lot ot interesting well known and accomplished people in St. Louis and an in depth look at the way to financially leverage personal business with lifeinsurance, annuities, disability insurance, and supplimentary retirement plans. I worked with an extensive group of individuals with totally unique and diversified backgrounds and careers. I expanded my horizons in phylosphy and psychology through this working experience."
good,• Set up appointments to discuss Clients’ current financial situation
good,"Northwestern as a whole has pretty solid products and one of the best financial ratings in the industry, but it is hard to survive in the industry."
good,It was a very flexible and independent culture within Northwestern. Co-workers were sociable and approachable. Consulting with clients was very enjoyable.
good,"Economic hardships have a great impact on this company. I f and when the economy is good the company is good, when the economy drops as it has the companies response is the ultimate layoff individuals considered nonessential."
good,This is a ppure sales job with 100% commission. Has the feel of running your own business which is not for everyone and requires long hours and lots of obstacles to become successful. Company and management provide good support but have high expectations.
good,"I didn't like getting checks that were not what they were estimated to be. When my commission requirements were met, I would still receive checks that did not reflect the work I had done."
good,They get you to sell to your friends and family before cold calling and vetting leads anyway possible ie linkedIN or yellowpages. Must use your own vehicle to meet with potential clients. Your Mentor takes half of what you sell in the beginning.
good,NM has a great team building culture.  Fast paced and adequately challenging.   A wonderful company to start as a young employee and build a future with.
good,"I really grew a lot in my short time with NW Mutual. However, it really wasn't for me. You have the ability to do very well for yourself, it just takes a lot of work and dedication. You don't get a call list, so you're calling friends and family asking for referrals."
good,"There's always another problem to solve and there are guidelines to fix them, if not documented fixes you can implement.  You have the autonomy to choose how you approach a problem and you have the ability to update the documented fixes"
good,"It was quite challenging at some times, but other times it was easier to accomplish. I learned many skills that I am now able to use in the real workforce and that I will be able to use for the rest of my life."
good,The only way to be successful at NM is to know a lot of financially well off people that have a fair amount of discretionary income. Some training is provided however it is limited in scope.
good,It is a challenge to work in a self-motivated work place; support is stronger with stronger performance. Expectations are not clearly defined. Office culture is competitive.
good,"company has the right idea of how they run things but they set a lot of people up for failure, they get you hyped up on how much you can make but that only works if your clients are high net worth. The give you plenty of freedom to do things your way as long as you show work for it."
good,The internship was very helpful in building the skills and experience that you will need to excel in the financial services industry. I would recommend it for any college student looking to get into the industry.
good,You'll be on a great team with great people.  Need to be aware change in structure is never ending.  Get to work with exciting new technologies.  Work in a new world class building.  Parking is not great.
good,They hired younger management without taking a look at current employees with experience. A college degree was more important than 20 years of experience with the company.
good,Must give most of your time/life early in career to be able to succeed. Culture was competitive between individuals. Management pick favorites and focused on their development.
good,"In my area, day-to-day work was overall a pleasant experience. The vast majority of employees are friendly. Lunches are healthy and help my work/life balance in that I didn't have to prepare my own lunch."
good,"I enjoyed working for northwestern mutual.  I worked as a campus recruiter and contracting licensing and registration coordinator.   It was a great environment, the leadership staff really challenged you to grow and you had autonomy in the role. "
good,Northwestern was a fabulous entry level recruiting opportunity. It helped me grow and develop my skills as a recruiter. the culture was very positive.
good,"I worked for NWM both in downtown Milwaukee and in Franklin Wi and the experience differentiation  based on location is unbelievable. My downtown experience was extremely work place progressive, we had no specific lunch times we went when it felt appropriate per your job and the business, there was micro management, we had frequent meetings with my manager who wanted to support the comfortability of us at work."
good,"As a financial representative, you are given a lot of freedom with how you structure your day and are often able to work from home on certain occasions. There is no salary base pay, only commission so it is up to you to meet with clients and make sales. Management could be improved in this area in particular, but the organization is amazing in the full scope of things."
good,"The role was very heavy on sales, with some opportunity to learn. It's like most financial advising opportunities. 85% of the time you spend prospecting for clients... I think the firms should make more of an emphasis on making sure people are well versed in investing and less so in the business (making profits) but I guess that's how the world is... people are so resistant to planning and doing what is needed (procrastination) that convincing people just to sit down and plan takes up most of your time you could be spent perfecting your craft."
good,"Working for individual financial advisor is fine, but it limits opportunity. Culture is like any other insurance carrier, hard to find good agents but support is really good."
good,"Northwestern Mutual agents are well trained and most will do an excellent job for their clients. Although, the training is consistent for one office to the next, the office culture will differ, so do your homework and choose wisely! As a whole, a great place to learn the business."
good,"I had a great mentor that helped me with lead generation, building my book of business and tracking my activity. The administrative staff was also very helpful."
good,"I never doubted how great Northwestern Mutual was as a company, but working as a Financial Representative backed by them was not quite what I expected. I knew the position was commission based and that did scare me a little, but everything I heard going into the position was as long as I work hard and use the information that is provided in training I will have a good start and then I would just have to keep up the momentum. I cannot speak for every office, but the office where I worked had several very successful Financial Representatives. The problem here was that they were extremely busy with all of their own work, so joint-work with them would at times be very difficult to set up. Also, several of these experienced representatives didn't want to take the time on the ""little fish."" These facts, along with my network not being in the same state as my office did not produce a good start, which lead me to feel like I didn't belong."
good,"Working as a technical support analyst was a stepping stone in my IT career. "
good,"I felt more like a pushy salesperson than I did a financial adviser. there was a very pushy sales culture and highly focused on reaching numbers. interesting marketing techniques, by using people close to you and using word of mouth. I learned a good bit, but was not the right job for me."
good,"You can become super successful with NM but you will need a lot of good, qualified and wealthy contacts willing to do financial planning or buy insurance from you when you start. Because you wont know anything when you start, and you wont be licensed yet to do the investments yourself,  you are forced to bring on the veteran reps to your appointments... and split the commission credit with them. All of your expenses are covered your first few years, but you better bank up enough renewable commission so that when they start charging you rent space, make you pay for your office staff and  your commission credits decrease, that you can still stay working and make any money. "
good,"I met lifetime friends there, PTO was nice too. When I started there the lunch was great but the menu items change for more healthy selections. Free gym."
good,Overall the job was not for me but I appreciated the opportunity and it was a wonderful learning experience. That being said I worked from7:30 am till after 5pm most days and was exhausted. I definitely would have gotten burned out if I had to do that all year
good,"when I was there it became too stressful to work there.  They started micro managing employees and the old feel of Northwestern Mutual was gone.  Management gotten to the point if a person spoke out about something against the company or duties that was being perform daily it could land in you ""trouble"""
good,"I enjoyed working at NM. However, the communication between management and HR was poor. They also have a very high turnover rate with employees. You have no job security and they lay people off every year. Overall, I liked working there but didn’t know until later that they let people go all the time."
good,Competitive culture. Comprehensive benefits package not offered. Always on the clock. Work life balance is hard. The people in general are great. There is not career advancement unless you want to get into sales.
good,"Northwestern Mutual was a strong company, that had good upper level leadership. I found that the culture was not aligned with my strengths, and decided that I wanted to work somewhere that valued innovation and creativity."
good,"Previously known as a great place to work with great job security and great benefits.  "
good,Culture is great and competitive. The job gives you amazing opportunities to learn and grow. Management department is lacking. You make a difference in peoples lives
good,I enjoyed working at Northwestern Mutual as they took care of their employees well. Good benefits and job security. However things took a turn when they began layoffs and large scale offshoring.
good,"Real tough to change when you have been successful with one business model for so long.  Good product, yet need a reality check regarding what will lead to future success, and changing culture to get sense of pride back."
good,"Northwestern Mutual is an A+ carrier.  Each office is privately owned so each office is different.  The Greater Tampa Bay/O'Connell Financial Group is a Network Office so has the most employees, more job security and better office culture than the District Offices."
good,"After awhile the work becomes repetitive and boring.  Many callers don't understand their annuities at all.  Department was understaffed.  People would transfer out or leave completely, leaving an increased burden on those left behind."
good,"no benefits, no time off. They allow me to work the hours I want but I get all time off unpaid.  No room for advancement, really looking for something I can grow in."
good,This is a tough career and not something for everyone.  You are truly running your own business and nothing is guaranteed.  Can be a great career long-term.
good,Not a bad place to work. Business was slow.  I never got the training that was promised at hire.  Never provided work handbook to know what was expected.
good,Responsibilities included answering calls providing exceptional care to clients regarding upcoming premium increases and offering guidance on product changes and general product inquiries.
good,This is a very difficult job and environment.  It was a good experience and can be very rewarding for the right person both personally and financially.
good,there was no training or support.  Did not have flexibility to life work balance.  Did have wonderful folks in this agency however compensation could have been better
good,"Fortunately, each employee sets their own schedule to allow freedom of their own work day. The day consists of meetings in the morning, phoning, and then meetings that one may have scheduled. The rough part is the fact of one having special abilities and confidence to phone everyday, which some lack. The culture of the company truly is Top 10 in the nation, but the success of the job may trump that overtime."
good,"If you enjoy hard work, putting yourself out there and a competitive atmosphere this is the place for you. If you have trouble working outside you comfort zone not the place for you."
good,Industry leading provider in life and health insurance. Great opportunities for economical and career growth for the right person(s). Lacking in a substantially acceptable training program. More of a throw everything at the wall and see what sticks mentality.
good,"Internship program is based solely on whether or not your willing to make sales to family and friends. Management was not very helpful. As far as internships go I would recommend another, especially if there is a real training program involved that allows you to develop more as a professional."
good,They were really eager to train us but when we actually started working it was not that friendly. We learned a lot on our own though which was good in a way.
good,Recruited college prospects who applied or were interested in the financial planning internship. Conducted interviews for candidates.
good,"Its a very cut throat environment, they are looking for a specific type of person and if you do not meet that requirement, then they wont spend their time trying to train you."
good,"go to work call clients for an hour every day then go to meetings if you can set them."
good,"Great solid company. Lots of benefits and perks if you put in the work and time. 100% commission based salary makes life a little stressful. Requires a ton of networking everyday. Must be comfortable using high pressure sales tactics. You pay all your own taxes, so keep track of your business expenses. Management puts a lot of pressure on you to make sales. The worst part about the job is you will never be able to look at anyone the same way ever again. Everyone you run into will be a potential client for business. Deciphering work relationships and real relationships becomes difficult. Be prepared to put in long hours if you want to be successful (70+ a week). Great starting career for anyone looking to grow personally and professionally."
good,"I am an intern and basically just give admin support to my boss, I haven't learned a lot, but the work is easy. I was thrown into the mix after I took the internship over from my friend and I was only trained for 3 hours."
good,"Need to find leads from your own network only and effectively multitask many aspects of the business. Typical day is calling a minimum of 40 of your own contacts, setting 5 appointments, having 5 meetings scheduled for the day and keeping at least 3 of them. Check emails to follow up with applications and underwriting to obtain any additional information or forms needed, and obtain it from your client. "
good,I worked as an AFR. Once you're an assistant you're always an assistant. All the FRs are men and all their assistants are female. Super weird traditional culture.
good,Overall this was a good company to start my career in the financial industry. This internship afforded me the opportunity to gain licensing in the state of Massachusetts to sell life and health insurance. If you are interested in getting into the financial sales industry I recommend getting into this internship.
good,"Seems that those who succeeded at this job were mainly those with a background in the industry.  Lots of studying and lots to learn if you do not know about the industry.  "
good,Great company and atmosphere depending on who you are working with.
good,"A typical day with NW was making phone calls, setting up appointments, following up with customers, or creating insurance plans based on customer recommendations and qualifications.  One could be traveling all day, or just in the office, each day was different.  I learned sales techniques, became comfortable with talking to customers in a personal  format, and learned to manage my expenses so that I wouldn't exceed my budgets.  Most of this job was done alone, but my supervisor was very supportive and there to offer assistance whenever needed.  "
good,"The company has some great small organization values, but overall not a place for a long standing career unless it is in the field of Financial Representative."
good,"-Management could be better"
good,"My day changes by the hour and can be very unpredictable which I enjoy overall.  The fact that it is never the same and that I have flexibility within that, is something I appreciate.  I really enjoy being out of the office and working with people as that's all I've ever known.  I spend most of my time at meetings with clients or potential clients as well as trying to set meetings.  I also spend a lot of time communicating with my staff to get business submitted and paid for and servicing clients.  The hardest part of my job is that I am 100% commission and can lose money due to someone else's hardship.  That is the most uncontrollable which effects my stability the most.  What is also difficult is being completely financially responsible for my staff, supplies, benefits, travel, etc.  I have learned so much about myself and what I am capable of accomplishing.  I was a social worker prior to Northwestern Mutual and inspite of having no sales experience and no financial background, I have managed to be a top 6% representative within the field.  I am very hard working, a fast learner and can prosper in almost any environment.  I am just looking to simplify my life with a potential base salary with commissions and eliminate business overhead expenses out of my own pocket."
good,• Participated in an internship program rated top 10 in the country
good,"The company overall is a good company to work for. What I have learned (and this may be just for me) is if you do not have a very large natural market of people to prospect for and meet, then you will fail in the business if you do not have the drive to find other means of meeting people. I happen to find that in the insurance industry now. I myself rather start with a salary and commission rather than commission only. The company is very repetitable in the business world, but not well known by working folks."
good,Good job opportunity i love working hard so if you can work very hard you can succeed. Takes many long hours and long work weeks. You also have to pay for alot on your own
good,"This was a great company to work for, but honestly the culture of the representatives and management is so competitive they easily betray each other over if they have an opportunity to advance. Not everyone is like this here, but too many are for my taste. And there is a serious lack of training to really prepare you meet the clients needs, only to sell them something. If its too good to be true then chances are are it probably is."
good,"To have a chance of being successful you need to enter the internship with a list of at least 500 names that you could hypothetically reach out to. These names consist of your friends, their parents, your parents and family. To be blunt, your parents and friends parents don't want to talk about their finances with you and your friends most likely are just starting their jobs and have no real interest in life insurance. Your best shot to being successful is networking off of your parents and that can be difficult as well. This isn't easy, but if you can make 10 lives and keep going you're looking good."
good,The goals for sales are very high. The company is great and the pension is amazing. Lots of time spent on phone sales for life insurance. Lots of cold calling involved.
good,"The products were good and underwriting was very difficult.  If you got your clients placed you could feel good about it.  However, clients would get rated and premiums would skyrocket and if you don't have a brokerage on the side, you are screwed."
good,"always on the phone, Management is great and helpful. Great location downtown. I do believe they are relocating soon. You will work a lot of hours, but it can pay off if you know the right people with money."
good,Northwestern Mutual Investment Services works to the client's best interest and is compliant. Northwestern Mutual Investment Services offers several investment programs.
good,"Beautiful campus locations, free lunch, good benefits, smart people, the opportunity to learn, charitable gift matching program, 401k, paternity leave, volunteer opportunities."
good,"The training was awful.  They won't give you any warnings if you're doing something wrong. They require you to take a test, and if you don't pass it on the second time you're told your not ""catching on fast enough"", and they will let you go. In my opinion the workplace culture was nice, but you could also tell they acted fake and played favoritism."
good,"Northwestern Mutual was a great internship to launch me into the professional world. I learned a lot of valuable information for future jobs, but along with that I had to do a lot of cold calling and calling friends to try and get them as clients. Being from out of state I couldn't sell to any of my family members unless I got another license which wasn't mentioned in the interviews. I think overall I had a beneficial experience, but a lot of the work is not the most interesting."
good,A typical day consists of pitching to potential clients and always trying to acquire new clients. The purpose is to cover the financial needs of your clients
good,It was a good workplace and I enjoyed my time that I spent there but overall I was wanting some more than just what was offered there. I am extremely grateful for the experience but as of right now I was to explore other options.
good,The intern program was a good intro to a basic sales position. I learned the basics to help drive a foundational understanding moving forward. A positive experience that helped build my resume moving forward.
good,"I cold called all day. Went with associate to doctor's offices to drop off information on retirement and life insurance. I was not paid, but the associate was great and I learned a lot."
good,"Lots of transition of teams, reorg of the organization and turnover of staff is a constant distraction to delivering real value for clients and the field representatives."
good,Being a financial advisor takes a lot of inner strength and interpersonal risk. Timing has to be right and the job has to be a great fit in order for you to find success. The job and the company can provide a lot of security and a wonderful career for the right person.
good,Great internship opportunity for a college student. Manager was flexible and provided real and relevant learning opportunities. It was a good experience.
good,"Working at Northwestern Mutual is rewarding but tough.  They offer competitive compensation that is commission only.  However, the management and leadership is lackluster at best.  A military approach is taken to the training, development and coaching.  "
good,"If you  love calling 25-50+ people day this is the job for you. I learned how to run my own business and manage it, along with numerous of other skills. Management is there when you need it, to help you a long the way, so take advantage. It's a fun place to work if you are doing what you suppose to do. the hardest part is getting the the sales, you hear the things you don't want to hear for prospects. Once you on the upside of things and things are going good for you it a great feeling to experience."
good,"It would be great if the company offered work from home options for individuals who live outside milwaukee county.  With downtown parking space and work/live balance at a premium, employers offering alternatives to working on site have a negative impact on attracting talent"
good,Worked on the help desk which was a giant call center taking phone calls all day. I prefer to physically work on computers and interact with customers
good,The company was great as well as the people but the job itself is still sales and semi-cold calling. You call friends and family to start but you still have to be decent at sales in order to succeed; I was not one of those people. Learned a lot but make sure you know yourself and abilities before going into it.
good,"Had to make own book of business starting with my natural market and ending with cold calling unknown individuals. It started off great, but as time goes on referrals became less which is when cold calling came in to play."
good,"good place to work for them when you are looking to get a start in the financial services industry. i was in a great office with great senior leaders who really watched out for me,"
good,Was there for 9 years. You are either a 1099 or work for a 1099. You do not work for the company unless you are at corporate. Reps care about their salary before paying you.
good,"Being a mutual company means we've been there for our clients since day one — and will continue to be — because we report to them, not Wall Street. Instead of having to worry about short-term gains, we take a long-term approach – both in the way we help people plan, and in the way we do business. This has served our clients well through all kinds of economic ups and downs – even the 2008-2009 financial crisis.2 Mutuality also means that our policy owners get to be a part of our company and may benefit from annual dividends.3 So when we do well, you do well, too."
good,"Great place to work if you value work/life balance.  Able to work at home and take paid time off as needed, no haggling or negotiating for time off for appointments or other needs."
good,"Make calls, set meetings, find about prospects situation, inform people on different retirement accounts, taxes, answer questions, schedule, reschedule, reschedule, reschedule, cancel.  Build financial plans using pretty cool software.  Close a case!"
good,You are basically told you're a wuss if you don't want to sell a product to your family you're unfamiliar with. They do great things its just not for me.
good,"The work in itself at Northwestern Mutual is amazing. With that being said, the process of getting to assist people with holistic financial planning may be difficult if you don't plan accordingly. Northwestern' culture is highly independent."
good,"Overall, not a bad place to work.  Good work/life balance. Customer focus but products are quite expensive. A good place for a recent college grad. Average compensation."
good,My time at Northwestern Mutual taught me what it was like to work in fast paced competitive work environment. The workplace culture is largely determined by the representative that you work under and the specific elements of your job.
good,"I had to deal with technical recruiter Cody Cox. He never responded even afer serveral emails and phone class once after offer letter. "
good,This was a temporary position until I found full-time employment that allowed me to return to school. I feel very impartial to the job and my experiences there.
good,The product is good but the job is 100% sales focused. Very aggressive sales oriented people and very high turnover. Its currently listed and one of the best opportunities in the country but its certainly not for everyone.
good,Enjoyed the people I worked with. Management can be helpful if you have a good supportive leader. Didn't make much money but the experience helped in other jobs.
good,Good. I thought that the company did the right things and valued their employees. I think that working at NWM was an overall positive experience that I am glad I went through.
good,"While the experience of communicating with people I do not know helped build character, cold calling people everyday trying to sell over the phone is not a career path I intend to pursue."
good,"Running your own business in a sense with their support. A lot of traveling, be used to hearing no. Need to work with your own network. Be confident and know you are assisting people."
good,"A typical work day may include one or two meetings.  It included meeting new and potential future financial reps almost daily.  Working with them to get them off to a great start in their new career.  Sales data was compiled daily, weekly and monthly and reported to Southern California offices.  Calendar management, researching for presentations and developing presentations was an integral part of the job as well."
good,"It can be a great place to work because of everyone that works in the office. Although, if there's the off chance that you are working for a not so great Rep, it will definitely not work out for your career."
good,"In a recent survey NM performed poorly on the OHI index due to mass layoffs and employee dissatisfaction with their management. Employees do not understand how they fit in the company strategy and management does little to address that concern. Also, NML leaders seem to put those managers in place that know the work but have little to no people skills. This contributes to high rates of turnover and low morale among employees who stayed behind."
good,The work allows creative freedom and group collaboration.    The culture is very meeting heavy so time management skills are a strong must have.   Benefits are good.
good,"This is a better program for people who can afford to go without much or any money for 6 months, and then rely on relatively small income for a couple of years while they build up their book.  Not good for parents or people who have an established lifestyle."
good,"Good work environment. Resources are always available for you to progress in the company. Mostly commission based, with a small amount of stiped. Would recommend to a person who excels at sales."
good,I found that I was not suited for insurance sales and lost interest in this line of work. I worked for Northwestern Mutual as an intern when I was 20 years old.
good,"The college adviser position  at Northwestern Mutual was interesting opportunity. The management was extremely willing to train and wanted each of their employees to be successful. However, the way you make money is having a large network and selling insurance to people in that network. A lot of cold calling."
good,"lots of work, commission only, lots of prospecting, need to sell whole life to be successful, must be a self starter and have a solid network of friends/prospects"
good,"Fun perks such as free lunch and onsite clinic to name a few.  During my time, had some bad managers that drove people away instead of supporting a collaborative environment.  Company talked about innovation and moving in a new direction however there was a major disconnect from leadership and business operation employees.  Besides this, there are people who genuinely care and are there for you if you reach out."
good,Be aware what it means when they say it's commission only. High level of stress can be seen all over the office. Upper management cares about their bottom line and how you are making them money.
good,"Good productive family atmosphere coupled with a world class company.  Challenging work but fulfilling.  You are your own boss, so you have flexibility to run your business how you want."
good,Very Difficult to gain new business. Mostly cold calling current/old friends and your family members in order to get them to buy life insurance. Learned a lot about sales but not so much about financial advising/real finance.
good,You can go far in this role depending on your level of commitment and how well your rep does. If you put in minimal effort you will likely be replaced. Most reps are very good about sharing their success with associates when you put forth the effort.
good,"Each day I met with professional financial advisers and spent a couple of hours in the office. I then spent an hour or two calling connections or sending messages via LinkedIn to set up meetings for myself with potential clients. I would have one or two of these meetings in the afternoon and then head home. But by July I was running out of local connections. The process of building a base was difficult as a very young man without much credibility, and few of my connections were willing to share contact information of others (and understandably so). Regardless, I learned a tremendous amount about insurance, sales, and finance in general along with new communication and networking skills."
good,"Great company, nice people to work with.I think it is pretty awesome that they provide lunch for their staff, and they also give employees enough time to enjoy their lunch! Pretty cool!!"
good,"It's never easy to sling life insurance and because of the commission nature of the business, you have an incentive to push whole life/universal life products with higher commissions as opposed to simpler and likely more appropriate term life insurance products."
good,"Good people. worked so many hours on commission only. good months and then slow months. This all I want to say about these people, bit there is a minimum amount of characters. Thx"
good,Its a great company as a whole. But not all of the financial reps can be described as the same........................................................
good,"Was there for about 6 months, then they transitioned to direct-hired staff.  Job was fine while I worked there, doing mostly 2nd shift technical dupport,"
good,I enjoyed my time there and I learned a lot about the Insurance business. The particular agency that I worked with was one of the top performers in the country. Very competitive.
good,"This job is not easy, but the potential rewards are worth it. You are given the guidance of senior staff of the company, but you are able to create your own days and hours. It takes a good amount of time to build a client base, and most people don't make it. The people that do, however, reap what they sow for a long time."
good,Unless you have a very affluent natural market that is willing to help you reach others who have the disposable income to purchase financial products you will have a very difficult time being successful.
good,Good place to break into the financial services industry.  Good place to get licensed and go a different direction.  That was just my experience as people in the AFA role are working directly for an advisor so each advisor will vary.
good,"The job highly requires you to contact your personal network to set up meetings to sell life insurance. If you have a small network, it is extremely difficult and success is unlikely. This position would be great with a strong personal network."
good,Good company to learn a new industry and IT upgrades. IT engineers are great.  There are ton a great managers who are welcoming and open. However there are a lot of staff that are not interested in change or seem to not care at all.
good,It was very difficult. I would recommend going into this career with a savings account that can pay your bills for a minimum of 6months. This career can be very lucrative but it takes time. You will make very little in the beginning while you are getting the hang of selling insurance.
good,"Job security, plenty of employment opportunities, multiple site locations,  24hr employment hours ( jobs for all shifts),  full benefits, great pay, weekly paychecks."
good,"I loved the Financial Rep I worked under/with but the job was monotonous and too sedentary for me. Good experience gained and would have received a promotion had I chose to stay but sometimes good pay and nice people are just not enough to compensate for the lack of training, boredom, and person distaste for the daily tasks."
good,"Never-ending work day. No matter how long or hard you work, they don't value you. "
good,"It has a great company culture. They're very understanding towards students. They should market their financial representative internship a little less, since it makes them seem like they have low standards. Otherwise it's a nice company."
good,It's been too long since I worked at Northwestern Mutual to fairly assess what it's currently like to work there.  The best I can say is that employees are generally satisfied.
good,"It was a good overall place to work. Benefits are very good, and the culture has changed for the better. Upper management could communicate and motivate staff better."
good,I worked as an intern at NWM. Basically they hire everyone they can and make you reach out to friends and family. The senior advisors make money off of those people and then kick you to the curb if you are not selling enough life insurance.
good,they do not follow their mission statement. the company will break moral values to make board members happy and to satisfy obligations to board member companies.
good,An average company to work for with solid benefits. Difficult company to grow and advance. Very stressful work environment and will not reward employees that go above and beyond normal job responsibilities.
good,This is a great place to learn the business acumen needed to run a financial adviser's office.  I was fortunate to have the opportunities to further advance my skills and education in the area of financial services by enrolling in the tuition reimbursement program.
good,This was a part time job for an agent who was about to retire.  Most of the time it was just me in the office and my responsibilities were minimal.  There was no office interaction and it was a very boring job.
good,I did not enjoy my time at NWM. The PR manager did not know anything about her job and left me confused. But I have heard great things about the finance internship.
good,"Great way to get to use to meeting people. "
good,It was okay. I was a member of the summer internship program. I obtained my Life Accident and Health FINRA certification prior to employment. Was not the best workplace for me.
good,"I was an intern in a branch office. Good sales experience and was able to get 0215 - Life Insurance Certification. However, as an intern I felt pressured to sell to my friends and family which I did not like."
good,"Northwestern teaches strong ethics and has a strong training program. Advancement fast with licenses. Leads are hard to get, but product is excellent."
good,"NM is a nice company to work for. However, for certain areas it's hard to move around into other departments and advance your career. It's a very competitive company."
good,"Entrepreneurial opportunity, but don't be fooled into thinking this is self-employment.  Selling insurance is a must.  It is a good opportunity for the right individual, but it is not for everyone."
good,Northwestern Mutual is a great opportunity for individuals who have an entrepreneurial desire to create financial plans for clients. The representative has the ability to build the practice they desire.
good,"Decent place to begin a career. I wouldn't recommend this as a long term financial planning career. The internship was great, but the full time opportunity was disappointing."
good,"Most positions have or are being outsourced to India."
good,The internship was just a way for them to get leads on life and health insurance. You do not learn much if anything at all and it is essentially unpaid.
good,Not the same stand up company it used to be. Company changed and I feel they really don't care about its employees. Well at least the lunch is free...
good,"Working hard and selling was a big part of my job. You need to Gove yourself a chance and if you are able to make it to 5 years, you will be rich, with clients and pay."
good,"In my current position I have learned quite so much in regards to underwriting in so little time. I've learned about medical impairments, treatment, and symptoms. I've learned how to make an assessment based on the information provided in the client's medical records. I also learned about certain prescriptions and the different impairments the medication can be used to treat.  I understand the importance of having our agent's and client's be honest in the process which allows underwriters to their job more effectively."
good,"it was a supportive environment, but I couldn't financially afford to pay to ""work""-- suddenly self employed was not what I signed up for. My friends and family did not like me asking for referrls."
good,"Totally a sales job with commissions only. Freedom to run your day is the image they tell you, but it's all about selling insurance to your friends and family."
good,"The workplace culture is wonderful. The hardest part of starting off as a Financial Representative Assistant is that there is very limited training, if any. It would be great if the office had training programs and different methods to learn the systems and processes; especially for a recent grad."
good,"Nothing wrong with high expectations, but the salary and earning potential should match that, which they do not. No real room for advancement unless you fully drink the koolaid, or are a family member of management."
good,"Responsible for responding to regulatory inquiries, filing U4 amendments and “for cause” Form U5s, investigating and responding to customer complaints, reviewing and approving outside business activities"
good,"Responsible for ensuring the Contract, License and Registration department’s policies and procedures comply with all regulatory requirements and Company standards."
good,Not a great place to work if you want to make money. You are basically sold into thinking you are going to make all of this money by field directors but the reality s you are soliciting your family and friends only receiving a portion of the comission.
good,"Northwestern Mutual is an incredible company, especially to work with; however, you will need to bring with you your own pool of initial contacts to begin finding prospective clients. It's tough, a little uncomfortable at the start, but if you can continue to generate names to show your work to, you'll succeed."
good,"Everyone at Northwestern Mutual is a wonderful group of highly educated, enthusiastic, ambitious group of people that want to make the business more successful.  Fill up your sales pipeline and you'll make a handsome living.  If you're lazy, you'll fail."
good,The hardest part of this job was the daily commute.  Most people there were very friendly.  The company had a great technology platform that made the job easier.
good,Solid training for interns and good experience for new graduates. Basically use the internship as a resume builder and go find something with a more stable income.
good,"I have worked at Nortwestern Mutual for 10 years. While it is a great company to work for, things are drastically changing and a bit unorganized at this point in time. We are changing our culture from conservative to modern to keep up with the ever changing way of the millennial world. I believe over time we will get where we need to be, however the career advancement is lacking in my opinion. I am currently in a call center environment in which is very stressful. High number metrics, micromanagement, and lack of consistency makes a very uneasy environment. Every department is different at NM, and I have worked in great ones in the past. I had some very strong leaders that made coming to work something you looked forward to. Northwestern is a great company and I am proud to say that I have spent 10 years there. However, when there is a lack of strength in leadership, the team suffers the most."
good,"I had a short Financial Representative Internship. The advisors are highly intelligent and qualified, they offer good guidance, but the clientele building requirements will be too much for most interns, myself included."
good,"It's definitely a place that if you have family working there...you can really do what you want.  The company itself was fine...it's the departments you have to be wary of.  Some are so disorganized, you don't know how they survive even.  Other departments run a tight ship."
good,"Management expects you to create your own leads and was only helpful the first few times you request help. If on those times you weren't able to close new business, the next time you asked for help it became more and more difficult to get help from management."
good,"I thought that this company was a good place for my internship, I learned a lot and was certified in life and health insurance which put me ahead when I was applying to other jobs."
good,"Great workplace culture.  Friendly and knowledgable management. Great place to learn about the 401k industry from top to bottom.  If you like to help people and make a difference, its the place."
good,"This is a sales job. Don't come in with the assumption that you're dealing with finance, a team behind you runs the numbers for you. You will need to make dozens of phone calls a day."
good,I only worked for Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance as a temp.  It was part of my schooling.  I did like it but the culture was not one that would allow me to grow in.
good,Typical large corporate environment. Many large projects happening at the same time.  Many teams working on many different projects.  Many people working on many different teams.
good,"minimal pay for maximum work and stress, there is a lot of turn over in staff, you will learn a lot of about the process a little at a time, no real training provided though mostly have to figure it out on your own"
good,"The work day at Northwestern Mutual is fast paced without being overwhelming, my peers were easy going and willing to help when needed. They do offer free lunch, a gym, and credit union which made the day a bit less stressful you felt as if there wasn't a struggle to maintain a work life balance. The compensation and benefits were great with pay above average for customer service and benefits that could be discounted for a healthy biometric screening. The most enjoyable part of the day was the variety of work you got throughout the day it kept you always learning. The hardest part of the day would be managing you schedule as there were no designated breaks outside of your lunch break."
good,"Low pay rate at the minimum wage for the work that's done daily, repetitive once you know the role back to back.Not a lot of career opportunities.Great training, good people, lots of direct sales experience, fun."
good,Productive company where you'll definitely learn allot. The senior advisors are actually really good at what they do but the culture is  toxic. Its all about life insurance.
good,"Changing considerably where the company was 20 years ago.  Company has focus to go in new direction- from Waterfall dev to Agile/Lean/Safe dev.   Flattened out  management structure and released employees for the first time recently in its 150+ year history.  Employees are given tools you need to complete work accordingly.  Overall, would say company is good place to work."
good,A very structured environment to work in.  A very corporate feeling in the workplace.  no real on-boarding program that would have helped immeasurabley
good,I enjoyed my time but dont see myself returning.  My bosses were encouraging and kind. My fellow co workers were very competitive. I learned a lot and had a good time.
good,"I personally did not fit well with this company.  I was a recruiter, but it felt very ""salesy"" to me.  Each day was different, but that kept it exciting."
good,"Must try to sell insurance within your network first, then cold call people after. Are willing to train you and sponsor you for your certifications which is a plus."
good,I enjoyed the location which was located in Downtown Miami. I learned to interact with different professionals. I learned to file. I learned new skills with Microsoft Excel.
good,"I worked at Northwestern Mutual for 6 months as an intern my last 6 months of college, so I wouldn't consider myself fully qualified to make a review."
good,"Overall strong company. Selling and dealing with insurance just wasnt for me. The company provides a solid foundation for new reps coming in, but you have to love to sell"
good,"A typical day at work starts early with morning meetings to discuss objectives for the day.  Calling begins shortly after to reach out to customers and advertise financial services.  Management is very straightforward and lets you know what they expect.  Workplace culture is very encouraging and motivating.  The employees are there to coach you, not instruct you.  The job can sometimes get frustrating when not successful with certain clients.  However, the satisfaction from a happy customer who is on the way toward reaching financial stability is well worth the work."
good,"Worked with this company for more than a decade and was NOT part of the workforce laid off (I resigned on my own accord), so this is not a biased review."
good,A truly lucrative prospective role with potential for financial and career growth with no specific educational background required. Hard work and dedication will get you far.
good,great for sales development and learning how to prospect and grow your own business / outside sales / responsible for generating your own leads and clientele
good,Excellent benefits.  Culture is evolving as a result of LearnVest/NM merger.  Digital transformation uneven so far.  Leadership is learning how to work differently and build new skills to embrace individual contributor autonomy and decision making.
good,"Depending on your capability of having a strong background of potential leads, this may work out for you. otherwise you will find yourself constantly harassing family and friends to buy insurance. However the corporate structure is well designed to teach young and motivated individuals who ultimately want to pursue a career in finance or wealth management."
good,Worked with them as an intern in college as a part of my graduation requirements. Intern program was pretty good experience but compensated very little. Often would find it cost more to commute for appointments and to the office than i would make per week in sales and income. Established agents with more experience do pretty good because their product is solid but the start your book of business by selling to your friends and family is tough for young people.
good,If you are ok with and good at making cold calls to prospective clients than this may be the right job.  It can be taxing at times to be told no all the time.
good,"A typical day at work is coming in to check email in the morning,then following up with the managing director on daily tasks. I learned to mature and gained more experience in insurance and finance. The culture in the workplace was very close, but there were many cliques. Hardest park of the job was the clearness of tasks. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with great people."
good,I thought it was great experience and I met some great friends and had good networking as well as learned some very valuable life lessons. I think it can be a good place to start your career.
good,"I did a college internship at Northwestern Mutual. I learned a great deal about the financial industry. Good business, life insurance sales just was not right for me at the current time."
good,"The future is what you make it. We are in challenging times that require people, at all levels, to think and act differently. When we can align the incredible resources we have we can a force that is truly unstoppable. Unfortunately, sometimes that means cutting away a few strong, but dead branches."
good,"At first I really wanted this internship because it paid decent, it would give me valuable experience, and I wasn't in sales I was in more of a human resource/administrative role, but after a couple months of working there, the work became tedious. Even though they said I did a great job, they never offered me a full time job or contacted me again."
good,"Great company to work for."
good,Spent a lot of time prospecting for clients and trying to set meetings. They have a great model that works if you are able to keep pace with it. Commission structure was tough and fluctuating greatly.
good,Amazing insight as to what the position entails. Very professional environment and the team is always willing to take extra time to mentor the newer hires.
good,"The people I worked with while I was interning there were amazing.  I learned at lot concerning in depth financial plans and interactions with clients.  However, the day to day of constantly calling individuals to try and obtain meetings and later business was not for me.  It is a job that someone needs to do, but that someone will not be me."
good,They pretty much ask you to sell every person you know. You call everyone you know and sell them insurance -- it was a grueling experience overall and I would not recommend it.
good,"Great job but all commission, perfect for someone with lots of connections and in a stable financial position. You get to run your own business and be your own boss."
good,"it was really hard work, But I think what they did is awesome and I have a great deal of respect for any who jumps into that industry."
good,"It was okay, learned a great deal, not much room for advancement if you're not a life insurance salesman. I had fun as an intern but grew out of it.  Moved on to bigger things."
good,"I did the summer internship during 2016. Their technology is way too outdated and you spend half your time on with tech support. I passed my licensing exam and then it took an extra month for them to sign my contract. The entire internship is insurance sales, if you succeed with that you can move up in the company, if not, then you might as well quit. Managers want to help but in the end, it's up to you to succeed. Not the kind of financial job I was interested in."
good,"Great experience for the right person.  Worked with amazing people.  The goal is to connect people with a great product and if you are the right fit, it will be a good company to work for."
good,If you don't need a manager to tell you what to do and are willing to be responsible for how much you make this is a good company. Not much training provided to new reps but good compensation if you try.
good,"Northwestern mutual is divided between finance and insurance. The technology and process are outdated. It is a firm that uses the phrase ""this is how its been done, so we are going to continue doing things this way."""
good,You must be really invested in trying to find people with money because it is a 100% commission job therefore you only make money when you sell something which is a difficult task that takes at least 2 or 3 weeks to do.
good,Company has a great deal of talented people. Career opportunities are limited but available. Have heard rumors of layoffs coming to manage costs.
good,"The people who work for NWM are truly amazing. They are dedicated to doing what is right for their clients. Unfortunately, as a staff member, you are not compensated fairly or considered as important as the reps because we do not drive revenue. Not feeling appreciated or acknowledged can be rather frustrating however I have learned that's just the nature of the insurance business."
good,This was no standard type internship for college credit. They will make you WORK! However they do want to see you succeed.
good,It was a good summer job. The people I worked with were nice. It was also a priority to keep the kitchen clean. It was a nice job that paid well for a summer job. They were very flexible when I needed to take time off.
good,If you like to sell insurance this is a good place but it is based on commission. I was an intern there and it was tough to do that as a full time student
good,"managed incidents in HPSM"
good,"Working here has been a learning experience, with a lot of self reflection. The structure within the organization for Administrative staff is not very inclusive. There are no group benefits; everyone is employed by/for individual financial representatives."
good,"I worked for an outside agent's office. They were extremely qualified and great employers. If the office location were closer to home, the job would have been almost ideal. Commute time was over 2 hours per day. Office did not offer benefits."
good,"I was the front face of the Company. I greeted clients, made sure they felt welcomed. I did anything from that to inputting client information, managing the office calendar as well as the managing directors calendar."
good,"Working at Northwestern Mutual has been enjoyable, getting to know the variety of Financial Advisors and the products available to clients."
good,Small local group who did landscaping work within metro Detroit areas. Learned to do blue collar work in a team environment efficiently.
good,Overall it was a great experience just wasn't the right job for me. It requires a high degree of salesmanship. I unfortunately do like sales. if you have the personality for it then you will excel.
good,"This was a great learning experience, however I was not as effective because of the extreme reliance on one's own market.  We had to contact everyone we knew in our warm market to set up meetings and hopefully turn them into clients. I did not like the sales part of the job."
good,Northwestern Mutual is a great insurance company. The people I worked with were very good people but they wanted me to be a life insurance salesman and that's not a good fit for me. I wanted to be a financial advisor or financial analyst and that is not what they needed. A great experience but not a good fit.
good,"Lack of communication and job delegation. The company is experiencing growing pains so you end up working well beyond your job description. Vacation time and benefits are great, the culture is great but very clicky, employees get promoted/ retained on a biased scale of who is best friends with the management."
good,"all contract workers - transient employees- lack of management"
good,This was a nice place to work. People were very friendly and helpful. They had a steady client base and were very knowledgeable with their financial planning advice.
good,It was a learning experience as I was an intern. Learned a lot about the sales and marketing side of business. Great mentorship program and you can thrive if you are good at sales.
good,"can really be a great job. Reps don't tend to provide their employees with the same benefits the try to sell their clients. Be sure to  find out compensation, bonus and benefits and get it  in writing."
good,"I learned a lot of skills which included how to communicate with customers, following up for records and information on applications, and keeping detailed records of daily tasks. "
good,Northwestern Mutual is a great company and I truly believe in what they do. I did not spend much time there so I do not know much about what kind of growth is offered but I do know if you are looking for something in Sales they offer good commission rates.
good,Assisting the managing director. Enjoyed working with co-workers. Hardest part of my job was leaving the job.Helping customers was the best part of the job.
good,There is a great environment in the company but the financial representative job is very stressful as you are expected to create your own lead. Great earning potential but only a few salesman reach it
good,"The work environment was good, but little to no training. It was a learn-as-you-go type job. My boss was had a micro-managing style of leadership as well."
good,"Good experience with customer service"
good,"NW is sales, so if you do not want to sell to your friends and family then be prepared to cold call or fail. The people are very nice, and most really do want to help you succeed and grow, but it is a very cut-throat industry."
good,"A lot of the same thing every day"
good,it was ok working there.very concerned with numbers rather than the clients needs.
good,Conflicting information from all different parties. Negative reinforcement. Good work/life balance
good,some morning meeting throughout the week. learned a lot about life insurance and the different types of coverage. management and co-workers were helpful. hardest part of the job was actually closing and completing policies. the pressure of earning 100% commission was also difficult and stressful. most enjoyable part was the flexibility of hours in the office.
good,"Making calls and meeting with people. Great opportunity with great people, but working on commission can be daunting."
good,"Was with NM for over 28 years and ever since the new building in Milwaukee was announced, the pension was destroyed and long time employees were let go for petty, nit picky items.  They are trying to scale back.  Loved the people but was glad I could get out when I did.  Pay is low but there is free lunch, although rumor has it that when the new building is complete, lunch will no longer be free."
good,"Great job. Gives you the opportunity to get compensated very well for doing a good deed, which is to help people with their financial security."
good,"When you first start you need to come up with a list of 300 names and phone numbers for those names. Every day you are expected to dial 40 individuals, and set appointments. This position is not for everyone if you are good at it, it can be very rewarding. But the front door is a revolving door, not for the clients but for the representatives."
good,Great environment. Great people. Great leaders. Very tough to start off. Have to put in a lot of time and effort to be sucessful.
good,"While we lose 80 to 90% of the reps it is a fun, rewarding job that you can feel good about.  A base salary would make it much easier to make it though."
good,"Good internship experience overall, room to learn a lot."
good,"Great learning experience that had it's limitations. But great entry into basic sales skills, cold-calling, networking, etc."
good,"A typical day at work is sitting in a cubicle, there is no flexibility whatsoever."
good,Internship was a great hands on experience with real world application.
good,NMFN is a great place to intern since they lay foundations for good work ethic.
good,i learned allot about life insurance and the importance of having life insurance co workers were fun but also serious management needs work not considerable of people with families.
good,"The more people you contact, the more success you will have.  There will be help offered from other employees if needed."
good,"I had an unfortunate experience with this employer. While working part-time, I found it very difficult to be able to communicate with my boss because he would complete (or assign) tasks while I was out, but not tell me what progress was made when I returned. "
good,"Overall a good company to start your career in, but you have to be  a self starter , and into selling insurance to your family and friends, "
good,I gained substantial sales and networking skills that I will take with me in further careers. 
good,The job is very difficult but there is so much potential for growth. One aspect I was not a fan of was a constant demand to speak to family members about becoming client. Was just not the job for me
good,Very high turnover. Hit the ground sprinting. A good opertunity for the right person.
good,Great experience learning about insurance and financials. Spoke and met with clients daily. Fun co-workers. Overall good experience.
good,"The most enjoyable part about this job is the freedom in scheduling your own appointments, and not being micromanaged. If you don't have a large warm market to start from as well as a large savings account to cover your bills for several months while you build your own practice it is hard to survive here."
good,"As a Financial Representative with Northwestern Mutual I operated my own financial services practice. I used a need based selling approach, similar to consulting, to discover the risk and offer a solution for financial security. I used networking, marketing, and cold calling techniques to grow my practice."
good,"Great experience. You will meet many affluent people in this business, as well as meet with business owners. Hard core sales organization. A cult, but a cult of mostly good people. The products are great."
good,Internship opportunity. Great for experience and sales training.
good,I was given mis-information when I was being recruited leading to this job falling short of my expectations.
good,This is a great company to work for if you want to be your own boss.
good,"I sold life insurance, but then left the job to go to law school."
good,Typical day includes making phone calls in the morning to set up meetings with future clients and then going out with 3 clients a day while reviewing their financial situation. I learned how to be a more independent worker since there we are considered independent contractors.
good,Making phone calls and reaching out to people was a typical day at the office in less there were appointments scheduled. Managing time was one of the hardest things about the job. Helping people was the most enjoyable thing of the job.
good,"The Call Center was being managed incorrectly, and any attempts to make suggestions were met with disciplinary actions. Managerial staff lacked an effective stategic plan that was mostly based on theory and not on Real World effectiveness. In the short time I was there over 20 people left due to the constant conflicting ideas by management and unrealistic goals."
good,Company made me manage my time in a very organized matter. Each day is a new opportunity to make the most of a sale. It was always challenging and forced me to work harder each day.
good,"A typical day starts with an early morning numbers review or development set forth by one of the advisors. It then transitions into an hour or so of calling potential clients and hunting for names to call later. Employees then typically meet with clients to sell them on insurance and investment plans. Management is good, albeit with a lesser role than likely should be with respect to interns. If you want to succeed in this job, it is an absolute requirement to call everyone and fight to see people every single day, because your paycheck depends on it."
good,Calling over 500 people a day to schedule appointments. Many financial concepts and terms that are very useful to prepare for retirement and protect your family in the event of your death.
good,"This work environment was fun and exciting at times, I worked at the Irvine location in the beautiful Boardwalk. But the culture could be improved for minorities. There was drama in the office."
good,A typical day at work includes starting your day by phoning to set appointments. Then conducting your appointments throughout the day whether they are in person or on the phone. My time at NWM taught me how to manage a book of business as well as allowed me to practice formal communication skills on the phone. Management was very helpful to me and there was a solid hard working culture. The hardest part of the job is that it is 100% commission based. The most enjoyable part of the job is making a positive impact on the community.
good,I like the internship experience but due to a medical situation I was unable to finish the internship to give a full description. Looking at my time there I have nothing but positive things to say about the company.
good,Working at Northwestern Mutual provided me with insight on how to build a business and manage a portfolio of clients. day to day activities includes phoning and booking client meetings.
good,"This would be a great place to work if you are a person with a big network. Lots of calling and meetings, but they do everything they can to help you succeed."
good,A typical day starts at 7:30am and ends at 7:30pm. You're expected to makes 40 calls per day to potential prospects and keep 3 meetings per day. Most important part of the job is prospecting. Most enjoyable part of the job is helping people become more financially secure.
good,"reorganization of groups and departments happens frequently, causing work disruption.  co-workers are among the best I have worked with.  management is not very transparent."
good,"Great opportunity, but it takes a special touch to manage building trust in the market at the rate necessary to sustain income. I would it difficult to manage the stress of learning new business, managing clients, and the delayed gratification of 100% commission compensation. I would have stayed if circumstances were different."
good,There is a lot of drama and gossip that exists. Bonuses were not as much as originally explained.  Frustration with training and assistance from co-workers. This creates the need to figure things out as you go along
good,"The management put a lot of emphasis on a metric system which aids in getting you going and a framework of what the day should look like.  They make you feel like you are powerful and can persuade anyone, which is necessary in the role."
good,"- Ability to make own schedule"
good,"A typical day would be meeting with 3-5 potential clients and dialing the phone between 30-40 times. If you do not meet these numbers regularly, you will be evaluated."
good,"Only been with the company a few months. It's a tough industry, which is applicable to selling insurance and financial planning as a whole. The company itself helps its employees and works towards their success."
good,"Great place to work. Wish there was a full time position available.         "
good,The CUD's are helpful when it comes to answering questions. The full time representatives help reassure interns that may be discouraged by the slow start to the sales cycle.
good,"I don't think they used or valued my full potential. They also need health insurance benefits. "
good,"The internship is a way for them to get new clients. They have you call everyone you know to set up meetings and try to sell them on the company's products. It was incredibly uncomfortable for me and many other interns I worked with. They pay $100 a week plus any commission you make. The intern director and everyone else in my office was very friendly and accommodating, but the job itself was miserable."
good,"Only join this internship opportunity if you're interested in sales, otherwise you will not enjoy your time here. You will have to commit a lot of time for training and getting certified even before the job. The 200 call sheet is real so only join if you love cold calling. Overall a very challenging internship but you are compensated."
good,"Lack of direct contact with boss.  Had to learn on your own.  Considerable client contact, proposals,  multiple projects in fast pace  environment.   Maintain accurate and detailed client records, responding to client inquiries."
good,"A very difficult job, especially starting out. Only got commission, and if you don't know anyone it could take a long time to make a sale. The culture is very competitive."
good,"It was a good learning experience for an office job. It allowed me to get my insurance license, and learn about this type of industry. It showed me what it would take to perform in a commission based job. It allowed me to determine the path to take in job hunting."
good,"Pros:"
good,"Competitive environment with a desire to be the best, by all employees. The reason I left the internship was because I am on the college golf team and could not dedicate as much time as was needed in order to be successful at both."
good,"This was my first internship while in college. It was a great intro to sales and client management. The leadership team was amazing and always so patient with the interns. They were a great example and let us shadow them while visiting their clients."
good,You make as much as you sell.  Strictly based on getting clients/selling insurance.  There can be high potential but it's stressful to get your own clients
good,"Northwestern Mutual is your typical fortune 500 company. I learned the investment industry and overall business management. "
good,No salary 100% commission. Very non-technical job. Same conversations day in and day out. Hard to have an effective network to sell to if you are young.
good,"Constantly calling and prospecting."
good,"Its a very good place to work with a centralized testing team."
good,"100% dedication needed to establish your practice, very tough with kids, family. I like working at NM very much but have to find another job that works better with raising my young son."
good,"It was a great work experience. They provide you with weekly training and sales mentor-ship. You learn how to call, prospect, and lead in person meeting."
good,"Overall NML is a good company to work for. Like all companies they have areas of improvement they need or could focus on. However, I had a good run with them."
good,"good work environment, very supportive. very stressful days when you don't know where your next paycheck is coming from. I learned a lot about sales and how to effectively explain the products you are presenting and why."
good,"Have amazing people working at Northwestern Mutual, simply just not the job for me. It takes a special kind of person to continually grind day in and day out without a guaranteed paycheck."
good,You must be able to conduct cold calls in order to generate business. It is a requirement to get licensed in order to expand your business. One should be open to networking in order to grow their contact list.
good,It was  a great job. Mr. Newton and I worked in the office. I enjoyed it.It was a very quiet and relaxing job. I ran errands alot. I enjoyed getting out of the office for a break.
good,The company is wonderful. It is a very sales driven environment with a big emphasis on production. Management is responsible and generous. Fun place to work with co-workers being motivating and team oriented.
good,"Northwestern Mutual Life is one of the most profitable and stable financial services companies in the world.  Milwaukee is not the best location for a Corporate Headquarters, however."
good,"It is a very tough job to learn the ins and outs of the business and build clients at the same time."
good,"A typical day at works involves being on the phone contacting potential and existing clients. This is in order to set up meetings with them to discuss their current financial situation and see if you can provide them with any service or product to improve their situation (whether that is retirement saving, life insurance, etc.)."
good,"I enjoyed working for the company as a contractor more than I did a permanent employee. The call center is the worst position to work in. You have to pick days for vacation based on seniority and you pick for the next year. Most of the days you can choose off are during the week, rarely any Mondays or Fridays. The probationary period was never explained. If you have to miss work and ask how it affects your employment you never get a straight answer until you've had ""one too many"" which is when they fire you. I would not recommend the call center to anyone with children because if they get sick and you have to miss work, you may as well start looking for another job."
good,"The experience I received through my internship with Northwestern mutual was exceptional, however, it required a lot of time and work. You have to be fully committed to the internship and it has to be your number one priority. The culture is very sales orientated if you like that you'll fit in great."
good,"It's all about relationships and getting referrals. If you put in the time and the work, the results will eventually show. Most other reps are more than willing to help, but at the end of the day, you are running your own business."
good,Advisors at Northwestern Mutual go through first class training and are put into position to write their own path. My experience with management has been great. There is very little required time in office or meetings as you are free to create your own schedule and daily schedule.
good,"A very big client in Milwaukee area with thousands of employees."
good,it is a good place to work if you can live on commission alone.  you set your own hours and create your own meetings. must have good phone skills to keep calendar full to ensure success
good,My boss created his own schedule and set up meetings with clients on his own time. I strived to work under a similar situation.
good,"Co-workers were fun to work with and collaborate with. Overall work was the same everyday, however varied with specifics."
good,"Appreciated the opportunity right out of college, but could not get motivated for the cold calling/solicitation feeling that accompanied the role. "
good,"Working as an FR or AFR is good, but the straight commission & cold calling takes some thick skin & it may not be for everybody."
good,The deck is stacked against you so much that you never feel like you can actually make a good income. Very hard to find people in the market and then take it all way to underwriting and then get paid what they promise.
good,This can be an extremely difficult career choice depending on your reach in the community. Success 100% depends on who you know. Your days are spent on the phone drumming up leads encouraging others to purchase life insurance. Again its a tough job but the compensation could be limitless.
good,"This position was based around ones ability to network and seek out new potential clients for the financial products and services the company offered. Requires lots of cold calling unless you have a preordained network of prospects. This is a position where you get out of it what you put in, but it is not for everyone."
good,"I love talking to people about their finances, but I was somewhat mislead about this job. We are basically salesman, which is not what I want to be known for. I did improve my communication skills while working there, but didn't really learn anything more about the financial industry. The management there basically wanted to use their new hires for their prospect list, and get half the commission. My co workers were great. I learned more from them than the management at the office. I would say the hardest part of the job was having to basically trick people into buying insurance that they really did not need at the time. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I was my own boss. I had a ton of responsibility, and if I did not perform, I did not get paid."
good,I had a great internship experience there but coming out of college and not wanting to have to move into my parents place for a few years its tough to start a career as a financial rep having no idea what your check will be week to week. The commission was great when you sold something but like I said it was very unstable and it was tough to plan ahead because you didn't know what the next check would be like. 
good,"Interesting experience but they push for sales a lot. You go in thinking it's one thing but later realize it's something else. If you can stick it out, the benefits are pretty great."
good,"Good work and home balance."
good,Good training ground for beginning in the insurance and investment industries.  Requires ability to work in industry with high level of state and federal compliance guidelines.
good,I don't blame the industry for the pay structure but for the college grad it can be very stressful for the first two years or so. If you do not have a strong network it will be TOUGH
good,You have to contact all of your friends and family and try to sell them life insurance and other financial products. They are very numbers driven so if you don't meet your numbers you'll have a hard time getting by.
good,I did the internship and ultimately it was not like I expected. They give you 2 days of training then make you call your friends and family to bring in clients. Now my whole family thinks I want to be an insurance salesman. Most of your pay is from clients which you split in half because it goes to the other advisers who help you and do most of the work. The pay that I was guaranteed took almost 2 months to come in. This internship gives you good experience but mostly it is to bring clients to NWM.
good,Great for advisors to grow and learn. Staff get kind of stuck with little growth unless you want to move to Milwaukee to work for corporate. Good place to get experience.
good,"My job here was pretty simple once I knew how to do everything, which was achievable on the first day. It was a good place to start working since there wasn't too much stress on you to get your work done extremely fast. They let me work at my own pace and left me to do my work as long as I did it well. The people there that I met were kind and great people and a joy to be around."
good,"A typical day included calling 25 people I knew and trying to get them to meet up with me so I could sell them Life Insurance. I learned a lot about having faith in yourself, and overcoming objection. Management was supportive and always positive. The culture was great, and my peers always watched out for me. The hardest part of the job was the commission based pay and the selling to my friends. The most enjoyable part was the freedom in scheduling."
good,Everyone really cares about their clients.  Good work life balance.  People take pride in working for the company.  I enjoy working with my co-workers.
good,Northwestern Mutual is a successful company nationwide. There is room to learn and develop yourself as a broker. As long as you soak in all of the knowledge and skills you will have a chance to produce.
good,Northwestern Mutual has many great people working for them with a strong culture in addition. However the job as a financial representative can be very challenging as it's 100% commission.
good,Too much focus on time wasting non important meeting with redundant information. If it was not for the empohasis on so many huddles and meetings NWM would have been my perfect job.
good,I was a administrative assistant to a financial adviser.  Upper management was good and easy to reach when necessary. The company's environment is good. Working for a very driven financial adviser is though and very fast paced. Overall I think NWM is a good place to work but it comes with many challenges.
good,Great opportunity for driven and resilient individuals. Continuous sales and product related training. Client facing role. Unlimited earning potential
good,"More sales than I anticipated and largely dependent on how many people you know willing to buy insurance to give you a good start.  It generally takes too much time to get on your feet and in a groove than I was able to allow and also too much time away from your family.  The people you work with a great, want you to succeed, and they also seem to generally be happy."
good,"For the most part I enjoyed working for NWM but it definitely isn't for everyone. The workplace culture is excellent and the people are what make it great but the lack of structure was a little too much for me. The business structure is different and wouldn't recommend this to anyone who really isn't into sales. They claim to do a lot of ""financial planning"" against advisers who only strive to invest your money but it's really just an excuse to promote life insurance."
good,"This job is great, however, there is no guaranteed income.  It does hurt not having that steady paycheck.  I found myself struggling to bring in money when my market went dry.  I enjoyed my co-workers and they all pushed me to be successful."
good,It was a great experience to work at Northwestern as an inter. Working with senior managers was the most helpful when trying to close deals. I found that the company had a great program for interns to learn first hand what the Advisor role had to offer.
good,Meeting everyday. Must call people everyday. Bring in clients to review finances. Must pass state insurance tests to perform in internship. Only paid $100 a week plus commission.
good,Great Training but only to work her as a resume booster. Need to generate your own leads. Primarily sell life insurance and do not like it when you try to broker and use other companies.
good,While still a good company to work it is not the place it used to be.  NMs PR team has managed to keep the company story of the layoffs out of the news and focus on the hiring they are trying to do.
good,"Because it is in transition, it is difficult to know where things will end up, but they are working hard on employee engagement, and making the work environment attractive to millennials."
good,A typical day at work consisted of cold-calling and meeting with potential clients. I learned multiple facets of the sales cycle but I did not enjoy the work environment. It was a very cut-throat work environment and each person always seemed to be stressed. The hardest part of the job was having to find your own clients as a young college person. I enjoyed shadowing and going with different sales associates to learn how they set up their sale with clients.
good,Northwestern mutual does provide an excellent opportunity to advance your career. However it currently is in a state of change internally that is causing people a bit of stress on the inside.
good,"The work is tough, but it pays off in the end. You need to have thick-skin for this job. The company needs to work on diversity, but overall it was a great experience."
good,You'll either make it or learn from it. Worth a shot. The best thing you'll learn is about yourself personally and professionally. Experience is worth every second but compensation...you'll either be extremely happy or extremely poor.
good,I learned several great skills and techniques for working for yourself. This position was commission based in a very competitive environment. I am forever grateful for the opportunity.
good,"This job is almost entirely commission based, and you are technically self-employed when working here. You are required to call almost everyone you know and try to sell them life and disability insurance. I wholeheartedly approve of what they sell, however, actually selling it can be discouraging. Average success rate is about ten percent so you will hear no quite often."
good,"Start by going through their training program which takes about three weeks. While you're going through the training program you are prospecting through your warm network. After completing the training program you have to either tap into your warm network and gain referrals or hit the phone cold calling. Management depends on which office you work for but are there to help you with language, goals and overcoming obstacles."
good,COmpany is great if you don't mind pushing your family and friends for leads and being the strong personality required to sell insurance. Very lucrative if successful. I quit when they wanted me to wash their cars if I didn't meet numbers.
good,Northwestern Mutual is a changing company.  No longer are they conservative in work style and are making changes to be more cutting edge.  Faster turnaround on project delivery and looking for everyone to work in new ways.
good,It's a run your own business kind of thing so it offers a super flexible schedule and some great advancement opportunities but you really have to work for them.
good,"Spent 20+ years at NM and enjoyed wonderful career development with top-notch employees and culture.  In past couple years there has been a dramatic change in the work environment with introduction of Scrum, SAFe, Agile methodologies.  This caused a lot of ambiguity and uncertainty."
good,This is a great company with even better training. This is a Life insurance company therefore you are a life insurance agent. This is a sales job. They will develop the skills you need to transition into a career as a financial Adviser.
good,Tough business to get into. This is a commission based business. You have to build your own network of clients and it requires a lot of hours and lead follow up.
good,"The experience was good, but I did not like how you had to call all of your friends and family to make sales. You do learn a lot about the business though."
good,"Work days are long, beginning at 7 am and lasting until 6 pm or later. There is no salary and is very difficult to get starting fresh out of college with no savings."
good,"A typical day at work at NM consists of: preparing applications for the representatives and their clients, handling mail, inputting billing information, inventory management, preparing policies, working the front desk, answering clients' questions, preparing illustrations, booking meetings, and am the Secretary in our Philanthropy Committee. "
good,"While I respect Northwestern Mutual completely and their goals I found the organization lacking in the progressive contact center forward direction that I was seeking.  "
good,"1. Typical Day: Hustling to gather leads "
good,Ongoing training is second to none. They really give you the tools to succeed. Company does a great job at marketing itself.
good,Very stressful but rewarding. Work long hours and are frequently dealing with damage control. Great office culture and company culture in general
good,Great part time job during college. I was able to make my own hours and take responsibility and ownership of my projects.
good,It was an exceptional opportunity where there was a great work life balance. Great co-workers that are very helpful. Put in the right amount of work and get great results.
good,"Cold calling for business, meet with possible candidates, and report financial opportunities."
good,Passed my 3-15 exam within a week of working there.  It is mandatory to pass this exam.  Learned how to communicate financial planning tools to people in a easy way.  This was more of a sales position and wasn't really what I was hoping for.  Management was great and conducted weekly meetings to keep us on track.  Great internship experience but not for me.
good,"A typical work day consists of making calls in the morning, and then meeting with clients the rest of the day. Management and coworkers were terrific, but interns are poorly compensated."
good,Its a great job if your happy with the work.  I wanted to do something more quantitative.
good,even though it is just a internship but i'd appreciate the time spending over there. I have learnt a lot from them.
good,"Spent a lot of days calling friends and family seeing if they are in the market for life insurance. Only paid if you sell insurance, really great incentive program, must be willing to get nitty and gritty with making over 100 calls a day."
good,"I learned a lot about relationship building and professionalism, but insurance sales were not my cup of tea. I am looking for a steady paycheck and did not enjoy the 100% commission based compensation that could be revoked if clients cancel their policy within a time period."
good,"I learned about insurance and the sales process. I  recommend it for someone who is really interested in a career involving life insurance and wealth management, etc."
good,"Make your calls daily"
good,"It was quite a learning experience. Self-determination is key to be successful in this company, but also you have to consider how close you are to your warm market when entering the field. This career will either make or break you. It also taught me how to cope with rejection."
good,"This is a great career if you can make it work, but from what I saw, less than 10% of people can actually make it a career. You need to know a lot of people, and have consistent ways of meeting new people established before you start to have the best chance of being successful long-term."
good,"The people are very helpful and supportive, and they definitely work hard to help you learn. That being said, a large majority of the job is cold calling your personal connections for recruitment to financial planning within the firm. Being a recent college graduate, it was very hard to successfully recruit clients due to my low credibility."
good,"The firm keeps the clients, Training is run by a failed rep. You are a 1099 independent contractor but they tell you what you have to do or threaten to fire you if you do not listen. The company has great products but a flawed program on how to keep and retain good people. Call all your friends and family and do joint work, when you fail they(joint work) keep the clients."
good,My job was alright. Technically I did not work for Northwestern Mutual I worked for the man I was an assistant to. On my paychecks it said his name so I can't fully say anything else
good,"It is currently a challenging environment, due to constant restructuring, but I am hopeful it will get better.  The culture is very political, and people are fearful for their jobs."
good,Working for Northwestern was an experience unparalleled to most career experiences. Every day I was challenged and forced to grow outside my comfort zone. I received top-notch education and was encouraged to think freely and creatively in order to achieve my goals. However I believe that northwestern mutual would do much better with solving their high turnover a problem if they were able to support their advisers to survive with in the first five years.
good,This job sounds great throughout the interview process but in reality the market is incredibly saturated. Do your research on the industry before agreeing to take this job.
good,"The staff and eveyone involved at NWM seemed to have my best interest at heart, but most seemed to be in it for themselves. Not all were that way, but more times than not. I did learn plenty about the job and how they wanted you to ""sell"" which was helpful for any type of position at any company. You were encouraged to work with other sr reps which is a good way to learn the business, until you can confidently go out and make presentations yourself. There was always someone there who knows much more about any one thing than you which was good bc it gave me a chance to bounce different things off of them as they had likely dealt with it in the past. The most enjoyable part was the work hard play hard mentality. They were very family oriented and liked to get the whole family involved in after work activities."
good,"Commissioned based with no salary. Work on your on time. Everything up to you. Cold Calls, set up your own meetings, and go through with them. Great coworkers who want to see the best for you"
good,Great co-workers that want to help you advance. But you must be willing to put in the time and the initial money to build your business. You must be comfortable with the word NO.
good,"I enjoyed my internship with NorthWestern Mutual. It provided a real insight of what being your own boss and working with clients directly is going to be like. It was at first a little intimidating but with the sales training they put you through it makes it a little less stressful on your first day. The internship and job life there is a result of how much effort you put in and how willing you are to push on during hard times. This is a commission based only if you are financial rep intern. Again, success is determined by you."
good,"You bring in your own clients. If that works for you then you will succeed, if not you will not make any money because it is 99% commission. Everyone there is very encouraging and helpful because they know how hard it is. Referrals are key."
good,A lot of phone calls and meeting with clients. If you do not enjoy reaching out to friends and family for business it is not fo you. A typical work day is generally laid back and can be worked around your preferred schedule.
good,"The company does a great job of rewarding hard working, loyal employees. Trips to Mexico and Napa. Summer concerts every year including Tim McGraw and Earth,Wind and Fire! They show loyalty to employees and clients who believe in their brand."
good,"lots of cold calling, good pay if youre willing to work, unlimited days off, but no money if you dont work. good staff, good management, good motivation"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of a lot prep work in the morning to set up and get ready for meetings in the afternoon. I handled a lot of paperwork consisting of my clients financial information and specific plans I recommended they need."
good,I enjoyed working at Northwestern but the Summer internship limited my time to focus on making it a career.
good,Solid work if you don't mind residential sales. Learned what it was like in a typical business office.
good,Established my own clientele
good,Tough to get started but the frameworks for success are there.
good,You will learn a lot and it is an exciting place to work initially. But you will top out after a few years while the financial reps that you work for have no ceiling. Some are very generous to their employees but some are very self serving and inconsiderate.
good,Hard working employees who have experience with insurance and people and businesses that need it. Most employees that have success and have been there are upper 20's.
good,"If you aren't comfortable with making sales and selling life insurance, don't do it. If you're okay with sales and work hard, you can make good  $$$.  Your income is directly correlated to how many dials you make."
good,"Great leadership and environment, poor work-life balance. Starting out is completely network marketing. They are an insurance company at their core, and will always give greater incentives to their salesmen to push insurance products instead of wealth management as a whole."
good,If you have a good client list it is a good place to work. Largely focused around life insurance sales. A lot of money can be made from sales. It can be very awkward as you are asked to call on family and friends for clients or even to sell to them
good,"The have free lunch."
good,The internship mines interns for their potential contacts. Wanted to push a product that was more for employee's benefit than client's. Didn't feel like they truly valued the interns' experience.
good,"Although there was unlimited income potential at Northwestern Mutual, a $0 salary made it a tough career to transition into. Building trust with potential clients to manage their money takes time and until then, there is no pay."
good,Phone potential and perspective clients with the intent to set a meeting to discuss financial planning. You set your own schedule. After you phone for about two hours you are then in the field conducting client meetings.
good,It is very difficult to advance in your career unless you work for the corporate office. It is hard to grow your own business from the gourd up especially if you are young.
good,"A commission-based position. No salary nor work schedule. This job requires one to produce results using their time and place of choice. One is not paid by how many hours worked, but by the amount of business submitted."
good,"I enjoy the work culture at Northwestern Mutual. The company is really good about walking you through all the required paperwork to get set up in their office. In order to succeed in this industry, you must be highly trainable and willing to cold call a lot of people every day. "
good,"Job doesn't compensate well as an intern, it's completely based on commission and a weekly stipend of 100 dollars. This became an issue because I was bad at phoning. The training staff though was outstanding, great group of people."
good,Not a bad place to go to work. The majority of people working love what they do and do it with a passion. The internship itself challenges participants in many different ways and allows them to learn a lot about themselves.
good,"Pure sales, nothing more. If the grind is for you then it should work out beautifully.  Locally some branches are better than others, managing directors being the difference.  Good managing director= good reps in office= good office culture= more success."
good,"You make your own money, if you are not good with people, don't try this career. Must be able to deal with rejection from clients on a regular basis."
good,"Promote themselves and help you succeed, but was all commission and little beyond that."
good,"Northwestern Mutual asks a lot out of their interns. It is not for the faint of heart. I started in the summer of 2012, working 40+ hours a week. The expectations of the intern financial representatives was the exact same expectations from the full-time financial reps. We were expected to network, call our referrals, and conduct business meetings. I learned more in my almost one year at Northwestern Mutual about financial investments, insurance, and business etiquette, then I have ever learned in any classroom. That being said, the environment was not one I enjoyed. If you were closing sales on a consistent basis, management went head over heels for you. However, for those of us who were struggling (and everyone who started with me did struggle) they were dismissive and did not do much to help you. It was a ""survival of the fittest"" culture. But, in my opinion, that is just something that goes along with the insurance industry. The hardest part of my job was not the specific responsibilities, it was the compensation. I was only making 55% of everything I sold, and on top of that 20% of that 55% went into an account made to just in case I had a rollback on one of my policies. They did have production bonuses, which were an extra thousand dollars if you hit there specific goals, we also received a weekly $100 stipend, spanned out over 10 weeks. All-in-all, it was a good learning experience, and a good stepping stone into the corporate world, but not a place I would want to flip full-time right out of college."
good,Great place to work at but tailored more towards experienced planners. More like a sales job than anything but you run your own business basically. I did the internship as a financial representative and had to start with my warm market (friends and family) but found it difficult to sell to them and get more referrals. Better to start with people you don't know if you can.
good,"This career is very tough to do it, however it very doable if you put in the effort. Management is awesome and everyone is very willing to help you succeed. Simply put, you get out what you put in. You are running your own office."
good,I  really enjoyed the Northwestern culture while I was working there. I learned a lot about financial planning and how the industry is run through the eyes of an advisor. I would not recommend working there directly out of college if you have no experience in the industry and lack a middle age market.
good,Training was detailed. Management was open to helping at anytime. They provided a great atmosphere. The hardest part was relying on 100% commission and waiting for those checks to come in.
good,"Commission based only, good for go getters who dont mind calling all friends and family to make them clients. Unlimited income and you work your own schedule."
good,"If you enjoy sales, this is the company for you. The compensation structure is the best in the industry, especially for young representatives. The companies training programs are world class."
good,"Northwester Mutual paid for training and certification. Compensation was fair, but a majority of the job is selling insurance instruments to friends, family, and whomever else in your network."
good,"Great atmosphere. They truely want to see you succeed, i met the most amazing people there. The only problem is that they REQUIRE you to do 10 joint work appointments a month which helps out the more experienced reps. Also if you had a client who purchased a life insurance policy from you and they decide to cancel in a span of 13 months, then your commissions will be reversed... which is horrible for anyone with a family or starting a family and needs to have stable income."
good,"Fun place to get your own business going. Tough when working commission-based only, but drives you to work harder."
good,"You can learn a lot about the sales side of business, which can be very difficult and discouraging. If you can avoid being discouraged, there is a lot one can learn."
good,This is a sales job. It is a full commission job and is difficult to get going. There is a lot of flexibility and freedom but your pay will reflect your time off. Huge potential if the employee is a natural sales person and is willing to put themselves in uncomfortable situations.
good,Typical day consist of a few meetings and then phoning to set meetings to meet with clients to help them become financially secure. Here at NWM I learned the in's and out's about the insurance world and the different opportunities there are working for the company. The hardest part about the company in this industry is that it is commission based.
good,"management are very nice. Very friendly and helpful people. Starting up your business can be overwhelming, you are the one finding prospects, they don't give you clients.  It is a good job if you are OK with getting a salary that is fulled shared commission."
good,"My experience there was great. Good people who appear to work hard."
good,Internship was fair and honest. I was offered a full time position but did not pursue a career with the firm due to compensation and lack of any type of guaranteed income.
good,Very productive work environment. We had a fun loving enviroment. Even working conditions were good enough. They really take care of their employees. So it was a condusive environment for everyone.
good,"Liaison between clients and the home office on a daily basis"
good,"Be prepared to work hard and do a lot of phone calling. Not the easiest place to work but offers a lot of autonomy. Bare bones it is a sales job, but you have the opportunity to help people. Be prepared for long hours with little to no pay and try to seek help."
good,"Most crucial part of the job is building a clientele. If you can't network and fill up your pipeline early you will be in trouble. Management tries to train you but your success comes completely from taking matter in your own hand. Typical day involves making phone calls and scheduling meetings. Will deal with a lot of rejection, tough to make it past the early years but if you are able to you will reap the benefits of this career."
good,"Build your whole business off of people that are close to you. Only way to grow is to use a referral system. "
good,"The company respects agents/salespeople more than admin workers. Although the admin is needed to make the organization run, the employees are not treated well."
good,Very competitive environment. You get what you put into this job. Commission based salary but no cap so you have the potential to make a lot of money if you're willing to put in a lot of time into this.
good,"I was not interested in selling life insurance"
good,"Fun but tough place to work. ""Live to work"" at this place rather than ""work to live"" mentality until you have made it. If you're not a high producer than you're not a favorite."
good,The compensation structure is not ideal. You only make money if you sell policies. A lot of people do not want to be life insurance so it can be really difficult to sell.
good,"Who you are employed by within the company matters most- some people have terrific jobs, others don't. The organization is structured in such a way that you could work as an office staff member or you could work for a particular agent. Agents create their own staff jobs, and typically pay out of pocket- so there's an opportunity to work for a ""good one"" or ""bad one"". Sometimes agents split staff members as well. Know what you're getting into first and go from there."
good,"The position allows you virtually unlimited flexibility and income potential, but it is 100% commission based, thus high activity and a drive to sell insurance products in your first year should be expected. "
good,"Not enough pay if you are FINRA licensed.  Unorganized company within the Policyowner service department.  You have to pay for parking at Franklin campus, even though it's on many acres of land"
good,"Nice warm,  team oriented atmosphere.  100% cold calling.  Great place to work, but you must be thick-skinned because the majority of people you speak with are not interested in financial planning."
good,Working at Northwestern Mutual was a great experience. At the end of the day it is a simple job...but it is not easy. You need to be able to thrive in the fast paced environment and be self motivated to go above and beyond what you are taught in order to be successful. There will never be an end in learning and applying new skills. A great opportunity for anyone who is feeling stagnant and looking for a daily/weekly challenge.
good,Good if you have a developed network but at the end of the day it's insurance and sales. It's a great product but the ideal prospect is very niche.
good,Not a bad first job to understand business environments. Great people and atmosphere. You are like your own Boss and the responsibilities are solely left on you.
good,Northwestern Mutual gave me an opportunity to further develop my interpersonal and leadership skills.
good,A beautiful environment with a culture of seamless service and exceptional food. The organization continues to grow.
good,"You will get exactly what you put into the internship. It is very challenging. You are provided opportunities for mentorship, but you have to follow up and use your resources. No one will do the job for you. This is not a simple desk job, it is fully sales and individually driven. This internship is not for everyone, but those who work at it will succeed. Many people will join the internship and most will drop out."
good,"A typical day at work is to have a meeting with mentors about sales and activity goals. You are expected to make at least 40 calls per day and schedule 25 meetings per week. This is supposed to be your own financial practice so all business development, most expenses associated with having your own business, and marketing is all on you. Sales goals are extremely hard to continuously meet and there is about a 5% retention rate of new reps."
good,"Tough learning curve in the beginning. However if you come from a high socio-economic status and possess many connections of high net worth individuals you can make a VERY large amount of money. It is possible to do well without a good socio-economic status, it just makes the learning curve even steeper. It is a role suited for those who enjoy working with people and have very strong interpersonal skills."
good,"Job differs per each Rep in the office. You have plenty of flexibility within schedules as long as all tasks are completed. However, each representative is different and may not be as flexible."
good,Its the big leagues of sales. It takes the right person to be successful in this environment. You have to have very thick skin to avoid being stressed out all the time.
good,"The job required that you Identified, analyzed, and suggested financial tools and strategies that aligned with clients financial goals and objectives"
good,"Not a great work life balance"
good,It was a great place for those who are only concerned with making a lot of money and having no work/ life balance.
good,"One of the best sales training porgrams I have attended. They do a great job to prepare you for running your own business. 100% commission is tough initially, but has huge rewards if you can stick around"
good,Hard to get into. They are going through a lot of transition right now. Your experience will greatly depend on who you work for - like most companies.
good,"100% commission is not feasible for me as a family of five depends on me.  Not sure why I am being asked to review my company, but am looking for a more local, stable environment."
good,Typical Day consist of whatever we decide to do in order to sell at least 20 lives in 6 months. I learned a lot about being an efficient financial adviser. The hardest part of the job was being okay with people saying know and actually getting quality referrals.
good,"if you want to be successful in the financial service business, you must start your day with a plan, learn how to manage your time, and don't let fear stand in your way!"
good,"Quick paced, quick turn around for things, but overall it was a good experience to learn the ins and outs of the insurance and financial industry. As an administrative assistant it teaches you to prioritize and really be organized"
good,"100% commission job. This industry in general is a good starting point for your career, but it really highly depends on the network you have or are able to build. Get your certifications and get out"
good,Great environment and amazing people. Their products were second to none and you were compensated well. The main issue was it was all commission and as a young individual starting out it was challenging not having a consistent base pay.
good,Starting this job is a sales role. People are pushing Life Insurance since that is the company's bread and butter. Takes a ton of work and a significant amount of luck to advance to the levels of advisor.
good,"NM is reinventing itself to attract millennials. The new Tower is specifically designed to draw a young, hip workforce to Milwaukee. If you don't fit that profile, search the Milwaukee Business Journal for current news on this company before applying."
good,Lots of cold calling and selling life insurance. Typical day would include trying to book meetings via cold calling. Once you actually get someone on the calendar then you can hopefully keep the meeting. If you then in turn actually keep the meeting then you have the opportunity to sell them.
good,"If you enjoy calling people that you're close to, family and friends, to ask them for referrals and business then you can succeed. It takes awhile to get going and you are only paid when you sign on clients."
good,"only the best , most persistent, and goal oriented people make it to working one year here. once you have your client base then it all begins to fall into place."
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a place for productivity and results, although compensation may not be as desired, the culture is strong"
good,Typical 8 to 5 that expects an individual to stay as professional as can be throughout the day.
good,Great people work there. It's a great company. A lot of pressure since it is 100% commission. There could have been a little more help from older represenitives.
good,"At Northwestern Mutual you are in a fully commission sales position. This by itself is challenging, However you are also expected to start your own insurance practice with little guidance beyond encouragement after the first week of training. I believe that my experience with Northwestern was a great one regardless of the challenges because it teaches you a lot about yourself. In the insurance business you, truly need to be a 110% self-starter and a self motivated individual. If you are not you will not succeed. It is a highly competitive environment and as a Financial Rep you are expected to be on call literally 24/7. All of the negative aside if you can succeed your potential is infinite. There is no glass ceiling beyond what you create for yourself in how hard you are willing to work. You will also have the opportunity to speak with the national Financial Rep leaders on a personal basis depending on which office you are contracted out of. Use these individuals knowledge to your benefit it will greatly help you in the long run."
good,"You are on your own, and you must build your business from the ground up. If you are not prepared to put your head down and grind, you will not succeed."
good,"The company was very pro business and pro relationships. However, the support team lacked in giving actual support. Everything was a numbers game instead of a progression game."
good,Great company with morals and values. Very little room to advance and grow. Poor management system. Focused on gossiping and rumors. Puts the financial reps needs before the support staff.
good,Work on contract for multiple years and always got renewed but never hired. Expectations are high but sometimes opinions or recommendations were ignored.
good,"The culture of the office was great!  The insurance sales world is run by over-paid, unqualified sales men with competitive sales goals.  This leads to underpaid help and a lack of transparency with clients.  I am glad to have learned the importance of financial planning and relieved to be out of that position."
good,Most important information I obtained at North Western Mutual were my sale skills and methods. I was able to get my nerves and self confidence up with sales.
good,"Great reputation in the industry! Lots of change and innovation, patience is needed to move forward with the change.  Great benefits (Medical, dental, tuition reimbursement, etc)"
good,"Northwestern Mutual is known for their great training program for those looking to get started in the industry or even sales in general. The team I worked with were diverse and always willing to help. The biggest gripe about the place is if you do not have your affairs in order monetarily beforehand, desperation can set in rather quickly when you have a bad month or bad couple of months. Plan accordingly and this could be a great way for someone fresh out of college to build their own business from scratch."
good,"I enjoyed working my time at NM you have to be committed and in a HEALTHY financial place to survive, but a very rewarding career . The corporate culture focuses on inclusion and the commission-based compensation helps to push individuals to do their best and continuously work on themselves."
good,This was a high stress job.  Everything seemed to be an emergency. I enjoyed the people I worked with and I enjoyed my direct supervisor as well.  It's an overall good place to work.
good,"I worked in the application input department, so I don't know how it is working for other departments. Application input was very repetitive and made the days seem so long. Management was more concerned about the numbers than their employees. I highly doubt people would have noticed if I didn't show up one day."
good,"I learned a ton from being at this job that benefited me greatly in life especially financially. However, it is a straight commission job unless you can move up the chain a bit. That does come with risks as it is extremely performanced based. If you do well in your own sales (how you make money) but not great in the manager side you will be released. If you do well in management but not in your own sales you will be released."
good,"Very positive, structured work environment with clearly defined goals.A typical day started at 7 am and lasted until 6 or 7 pm. I learned so much in such a short period of time! Senior representatives are always willing to help ease the information overload. The hardest part of the job is in the beginning, calling on close friends and family and being rejected or ignored by them. The most enjoyable part of the job is calling on friends and family and helping them understand how they can make such a positive change in their lives. Their gratitude is everything."
good,"make your own schedule"
good,"Client-focused legal research professional with more than 15 years of experience in the insurance and broker/dealer industry. Demonstrated strength in relationship building and collaboration, as well as independently delivering quality, efficient work product.  Experience includes: paralegal, regulatory, compliance, corporate governance, project management and information management for upper-level management executives and attorneys.  Excellent teamwork, interpersonal skills and ability to work collaboratively with employees of all levels of a company."
good,Northwestern Mutual has an intense intern training class that focuses on insurance sales.
good,"Made about 50 dials a day in order to secure at least 5 set appointments."
good,"managed fine, all commission.  If you have rich friends to sell to its a good start, otherwise build a following elsewhere"
good,"NMFN showed me the ropes as far as office work was concerned. I don't recal that the whole time I worked there I knew anything of the actual financial products that the agents sold, but I knew how to get Requirement A to Underwriter B & so on & so forth. I learned how to sort & process mail, I learned how to use multi-line phones, & then all of the sudden, they decided to cut employees & downsize the office. I was among 2 other employees that walked into work one day to be told that we were being let go do to office downsizing. Out of nowhere...kinda felt like I wasted all of my time there."
good,"A lot of telephone calls, setting appointments that sometimes do not keep. Learned a lot about the business language and sales language. great co workers. Unstable pay."
good,"As Marketing Coordinator for NMFN, I was in charge of all of our events and operations. We have about 10-15 annual events a year which I organize for our whole agency of 200 people. The events are from small breakfasts to black tie dinners to award shows. A main event that I organize is the Annual Meeting. This is a trip to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, every July for 80-90 of our Financial Representatives and their staff. I book travel, events, and coordinate hotel rooms. Besides working on our agency events, I handled the agency's operations. This inlcudes everything from managing the relationships with our vendors to fixing phones and printer problems."
good,I would not recommend working on the investment side of the staff  the managing partner is an insurance salesman with little interest in building a successful investment practice for his office
good,"I liked the management and co-workers. 100% commission was not for me, I have three kids and need a steady income.  Great job if I was fresh out of college."
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a great company to work for because of the friendly workplace culture and most of the management. You get FREE lunch with a massive cafeteria and plenty of options to choice from. They dress code is ""Dress for your day"" which is questionable at times because someone could be working the call center in shorts and a T-Shirt but then walk past an advisor having a client meeting and would need to explain why a worker has that attire on."
good,Phenomenal experience to learn from some of the most passionate and caring minds Madison has to offer for holistic financial planning. Great people and even better atmosphere!
good,good way to learn business skills for the real world of working. School doesn't prepare you for the real world but my superiors at Northwestern Mutual were able to provide that knowledge.
good,"Good company to work for! It totally depends on who you work for - benefits and pay vary greatly. However, it's a company with good technology, people, and is well positioned in the marketplace"
good,"Other advisors may have a better approach, but the person I worked for was very difficult. There was almost no training, and the expectations were nearly impossible to meet.  The company is rock-solid though."
good,"Great place to learn Sales! It is hard getting into the industry but when you get settled and learn the process, it is definitely worth sticking to if you enjoy it."
good,The summer internship at Northwestern Mutual was challenging but allowed me to grow professionally and gain experience in a corporate setting. The culture is supportive of its junior employees.
good,"Overall it was a great place to work if you have strong sales skills.  Believe in their products, just didn't have the sales skills to succeed and earn a reasonable living wage."
good,"A challenging, but rewarding opportunity. They have unlimited resources to help you succeed. People that work there are nice to be around and are always willing to help."
good,"Good environment with good people!  I took this part time role as a chance to touch on some skills I hadn't used in a while, some job re-entry experience.  Overall it was a good place to work."
good,"Flexibility in hours worked.  Learned from an experience financial representative about many areas of life, disability, and long-term care insurance.  Thanks."
good,"Great place to build character, discipline and learn to build a business. You will build lifetime relationships. Always put the clients before your own needs it goals!"
good,Great internship to grow and learn. Advancement opportunity and ability to work independently while running various reports and carrying out daily job duties.
good,"Great place to work.  Very supportive environment with terrific people willing to help at all times.  Talented people doing the training education. "
good,Job offered an opportunity to learn new skills and interact with a variety of personalities.  Encouraged a balanced work/personal life through flexible schedules.
good,"This is a sales-commission oriented role. Although the work is truly important and allows you to add actual value to your clients. I would recommend this career path to someone who has experienced a lot of life. For example; bought a home, started a business or planned for a family. Having these life experiences allow you to connect with your future clients, pulling at their heart strings."
good,"Still has a long road to travel in the area of promoting women, and other diverse groups. however, still has opportunity for an amazing people to grow if they have the support needed to make it happen."
good,Northwestern Mutual is a great place to work. Have the flexibility to work remotely.  Has uncapped commission.  Has a great mentoring and training program.  Has room for advancement.
good,"Sales keep you afloat. You earn your way to becoming a true financial advisor after you build a book of insurance business. You will sink or swim based on your ability to sell life, disability, and long term care insurance from the start. No leads provided. True potential to create a fabulous work/life balance with rewarding work if you can make it. Company is becoming more balanced with their planning process and investment services over time."
good,"The La Jolla office is a great place to work based on the culture and the competitive nature of the role. A typical day consists of administrative and training meetings early in the morning, followed by making your phone calls, and setting your meetings for the current and upcoming weeks."
good,"Excellent place to work. Colleagues are supportive, opportunities for growth present, and exciting and fast paced field. Earned Life and Health License within two months."
good,"At a different time in my career this could have been a great opportunity.  Timing was just off.  People were helpful to a degree, but at a certain point in my tenure the help changed to pressure."
good,Selling insurance with the opportunity to turn it into a financial planning position. You get out of the opportunity what you put into it. Hard work but can pay off.
good,"Working at Northwestern Mutual is like working on a team. There is a level of independence on completing the workload but you also work alongside a financial representative, sometimes multiple. I learned quite a bit about the importance of financial stability and steps to take to get there. I was shown how to analyze financial portfolios to best outfit clients with how they should invest their money for the long term. Management is solely based on the financial representative you work for but overall Northwestern Mutual has technology and tools that everyone uses throughout the company to assist their clients. The workplace culture was friendly and employees tend to collaborate with one another to make sure a financial portfolio is best suited for the client at hand. The hardest part of the job was balancing the workload between prospective investors, current investors, and veteran investors, all of which had different deadlines at different times of the year. The most enjoyable part of the job was attending the numerous conferences that helped advance everyone's career."
good,"Responsible for the handling, processing, and servicing of client’s branch transactions in a prompt, efficient, and accurate manner. Daily tasks consist of but not limited to processing customer deposits, withdrawals, and payments, opening/closing accounts, and setting up pay roll deductions"
good,"Strong coaching and mentoring.  Just follow the steps and advice given to you, and you will succeed in this business.  You must be very dedicated and motivated."
good,"The company was sales based, which is not what I was looking for. I am looking to be involved with equity, debt, and mutual fund research. The employees were nice, however."
good,"Employees are constantly bombarded with pressure to refer new clients and prospective financial representatives to the company, which is annoying. Other than that, it can be very lucrative and decent."
good,"Hard work and within the first few years very high turnover rate. You rely on calling known people first then through meeting and selling insurance, you ask for references to continue to grow your business."
good,"You really get to see what it is like to be a financial planner. You definitely need to try it out to see if the job is for you. It definitely takes a certain type of person to work at the job. The employees are very welcoming and eager to help new members of the team. It also is considered to be an independent job so you will have to do things alone. However, people are willing to help you if you get stuck."
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a great company to work at if you appreciate strong management and well-structured days. The culture is heavily focused on the companies mission statement and providing the best service for NM's clients. Also, the new corporate office is absolutely amazing."
good,"- A typical day consisted of managing a case load of 100-150 clients"
good,"Being a commission only job, everyone was very independent and concentrated on what they were doing.  The atmosphere was friendly but quiet.  The most enjoyable part of the job was travelling and meeting with potential clients."
good,The company provides exceptionally training and advancement opportunities. Experienced employees are generally very helpful and want to see new employees succeed.
good,"Enjoyed working at the agency office,  administrative staff meetings allowed exchange of helpful information and knowledge to improve assisting the financial advisors."
good,"Over the past 5 years I have been working with the firm, I have grown to understand more about how Northwestern as a platform to begin and grow your financial advisory business seems tough to beat. While NM has allowed me exclusive access to their insurance and investment advisory platform, they also are not captive to just their products and which helps me feel confident when doing financial planning."
good,If you are looking for something that is going to give you a lot of experience I would recommend a more advanced internship. This was definitely a good internship for a freshman student looking to get experience in an office/business setting.
good,Multiple hours a day spent asking others if I could help them because there was no work of my own. Far too many hours of downtime for my personality and work ethic.
good,Northwestern Mutual will provide you with every resource needed to be successful in your career but it is ultimately up to you to thrive in this industry.
good,"Training is focused mainly on insurance planning and reps are expected to learn the investment side on their own. Extremely difficult expectations, but they are achievable if you get off to a fast start. Having an older warm market is a benefit, starting straight out of college is very difficult considering most of your friends and peers do not need planning because they're broke and they do not have a need for insurance. "
good,Great learning experience and an awesome opportunity to sell some great stuff. Toughest part of the job is that it is commission only. Its a wild ride.
good,"I enjoy the company and the culture and the people at NM; however, I do work there as a contractor. Northwestern Mutual values their employees and is very good to them; however they have VERY high standards. I read someone else's review of the company on another site that said it's a great company IF you can meet their standards & I know exactly what they mean. I've worked for other companies with very high standards but none of them compare to the expectations that NM has for people."
good,"The company gave you tools to succeed but you have to really put in a lot of personal time and effort, outside of the office, to succeed in the business. No salary and full commission from the beginning."
good,Every day at my job we sit and discussed the day to day activities that would be implemented. This discussion takes at least thirty minutes and we worked together as a team.
good,"It is a great great to work regarding the financial industry. Competitive environment and fast paced. Management is pretty good. Overall, my experience at Northwestern was positive."
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a great company to work at granted you are willing to dedicate a lot of your time to it. 40 hour work weeks are standard but when it comes to client sourcing and education you are expected to put in after hour work. Advancing your certifications is the utmost priority there and this requires countless after hour work in order to accomplish. Staying late is a regular occurrence. Overall, a great place to work but high stress and unpaid after hour work is expected."
good,Currently work at this company.  I work with advisors throughout the company. A lot of middle management - company going through many changes. Beautiful new facility.
good,This is a great company for those who want to learn more about the financial industry but are still enrolled in school. They also pay for you to get your license and offer paid continuing education to renew licenses.
good,"Normal office hours would be spent calling potential clients. I personally did not enjoy this, but if you are good at it then it can be very profitable."
good,"Great sales and communication experience was acquired while working at this company. in order to succeed in this organization, you must be able to think outside the box, have a thick skin for sales and rejection, and requires plenty of sales/communication skills."
good,The opportunity there is fantastic and the coaching is known to be the best in the industry but the reality is that it is a very hard job that requires long hours and while you can pretty easily make six figures and in some cases 7 figures you will need to consistently outwork those around you in order to succeed in this business.
good,"Enjoyed this position for the learning aspect.  Learned a good deal about finances from this position.  The only issue is that you can run out of leads quick if you're not aggressive enough.  It's tough to stick with it for the first couple months but after that, things start to get better if you apply yourself."
good,Great focus on health and wellness. Continuing to focus on new strategy and how to best align culture of a start up and 160+ year old organization to best serve their clients now and in the future.
good,Great company with a long track record of success. In order to thrive in this position you must have very low overhead and low salary expectations to begin with but can be very rewarding if you stick it out and make a career out of it.
good,"This job was a perfect entry into the corporate world, though not in my area of interest. Personal finance and life insurance is a specific field for a sepcific type of person."
good,Great place to work with high level of flexibility and independence. Hours can be long but are rewarding. Great opportunity to switch careers and begin a new role!
good,At NM in Dallas you will undoubtedly have a strong support system through training and one on one development. You will also have access to the premier products and services in the industry.
good,"Hours are long, especially in the early years. Learned alot of running your own business and time management. You ""on your own business"" but have different required development meetings throughout the week."
good,"Company changing development philosophy, change in scrum master.  Too tied to Agile philosophy, need more ability to fit what works for the team.  Too many meetings about meetings."
good,"A typical day was arranging all meetings and office conference calls. returning clients calls and assisting  with all correspondence. learned to follow up on all corresponded for agents and clients, management could be at times difficult but fair, the workplace was pleasant, hardest part of the job was making sure all details were checked and rechecked for accuracy to ensure all management and clients were satisfied. Enjoyed learning from  all agents and assistants in the company"
good,"Typical work day consisted of assisting Life Insurance agents with all aspects of their business, assisting clients over the phone and in the office. Also helped with College internship program helping with interviews, hiring and teaching them the business process.  I received a vast knowledge of the insurance industry.  Great personal satisfaction assisting clients with all their needs."
good,"This is one of the hardest sales jobs. 5% chance to make it to 5 years. If you put in the work, have the right clientele, and constantly improve; you can make it."
good,"Great possibility for making large amounts of money, but at the cost of having the possibility of making little money. There is a great work culture but at the cost of having constant stress if you will have a paycheck."
good,"Interesting work, a company that promotes from within, nice coworkers, good wellness and benefits, convenient location.Opportunity to learn about the company and who they help, High ups listen to employees ideas and potentially implement those ideas."
good,This is still a great company. I learned a great deal about insurance products here even though I had been in the business for the previous nine years.
good,"A typical day at work for a financial representative includes calling and scheduling meetings with clients, going to meetings with clients, and training twice a week."
good,"- How to interact with clients on a professional level "
good,I loved the workplace culture. NM did a great job training new employees. It was a fun place to work and build long lasting friendships. Everyone was encouraging of one in other. There is a lot of room for growth but if you start in the call center there is a 22-24 month commitment before you are able to apply to another position internally.
good,"This is a top notch financial company and will use their services for personal use.  However as a career choice it is not something that I would recommend for everyone.  It can be an extremely fulfilling and rewarding career but as high as the highest high, are the lowest of the lows.  It takes someone with a drive for sales and finance to maintain commitment to this position.  It is a high standards company and the minimums are do able with a killer instinct mindset on a daily basis.  Not much creativity gets to be had as everything is on a very highly polished system.  The language is perfected, the sales system is perfected, all you have to do is show up every day and desire to be successful.  That is easier said than done however, you are the owner, operator, secretary, and janitor.  That being said there are many many other advisers willing to help but you must immerse yourself in the industry to be successful.  It is a sink or swim position, no showing up to work and punching a time clock."
good,"As an assistant for a FR I managed client cases as they moved through the underwriting process. I communicated with medical companies, home office representatives, clients, and the underwriters. "
good,I really enjoyed the work that I was doing with Northwestern Mutual. The only issue was that their was not any financial support for individuals starting their career. A lot of the success depended upon who you knew. If you did not know a lot of people in the area you lived you would have to work longer hours in order to find prospects. I resigned because I started to feel that I was helping people become financially secure while I felt financially insecure on a daily basis.
good,It is a good sales opportunity for new college graduates.  There was a strong focus on weekly activity and selling insurance.  There is an opportunity to improve the focus on coaching the sales flow and providing stronger product knowledge so that agenta are better aware of the client's best interest.
good,This job is full of potential if you have the contacts and the drive to make it worth while. Starting out is hard but after a year in the business money shouldn't be an issue.
good,Excellent brand and products. For the right person a very lucrative and fulfilling career can be obtained. First year is the most challenging as you have to build your cliental from the ground up.
good,"A growing culture to fit in the industry and market place. I had an opportunity to understand the business culture and the mutual values displayed by leaders. While there were major organizational changes in losing a lot of talent, the company strive to do what's best for their policy owners in maintaining profitability."
good,"l assisted Financial advisors and scheduled appointments with prospects for Financial Advisory in insurance services, wealth management, investments, trusts, retirement income etc. I also acquired my health.life and accident insurance producers"
good,"Northwestern Mutual exploits the temp agency system in order to keep a herd of workers on hand they can pay less with no benefits and fire at any time. If you actually manage to get hired on permanently (one of my co-workers had been a ""temp agent"" for them for 3 years I'm not kidding), then I'm sure it's a nice place to work! But getting cheated out of the most basic benefits a full time worker usually enjoys by staying stuck in contractor status isn't a job worth writing home about."
good,"Job is primarily insurance sales with a little bit of finance. Definitely would consider it more of a sales job, but it was fulfilling to help people plan for their financial future."
good,"Great culture and vision in a workplace.  "
good,"Great company to work for. Unfortunately going through workforce reductions. There are a lot of long term employees that work here. The benefits are very good, especially for long term employees."
good,"overall this is great company to work for, however the salary is low with no bonuses.  it is a comfortable atmosphere.  work volume can be high at times, multi tasking is a must for this job."
good,"NM is a great company for a career as a financial representative/advisor. Keep in mind that all associate positions are not working for NM, but for the employing financial representative/advisor. Some may or may not offer benefits. "
good,"Each branch of Northwestern Mutual is run independently, therefore, my experience at this location will be entirely different than what is experienced in other locations."
good,this was a good starting point to learn about insurance it also provides the ability to build and do it yourself. no leads straight cold call and network
good,"This is a difficult industry, but NML works very hard to see that their reps succeed. Great training programs and support from staff. This is a perfect environment for young financial advisors."
good,"Overall, great people to work with... hard to develop client once you run out of leads... most leads are family and friends and you pretty much just sell them life and health insurance."
good,its a place where you learn on your feet and have constant training. commission based position so you arent into the grind with a hustle mentality you will not survive. unless you have rich family and friends
good,Can be an exciting place to work as the company works to make itself into a Financial Technology leader.  Transition over the next few years will be challenging as new leadership takes over and the reshapes the work force.
good,Don't be fooled. This internship is a sales job. Be aware that you have to use your personal connections for your own client base. If your ok with that then you should have no problems with working here.
good,Northwestern Mutual is a very well run company that values every policyholder in the company. I truly believe they put their policyholders first and every decision is made with them in mind. I enjoyed going through the process of finding out clients goals and then helping them pick out a specific financial plan tailored to their goals. I felt like giving a client adequate life insurance was very beneficial and was the right thing to do to help the client. The downside of Northwestern Mutual was their training wasn't very beneficial and some of the other representatives are resistant to helping you grow and learn.
good,I work for them in the past and now rejoined because they are the best and they  have the best support in training in the industry  and working together as a team.
good,"NMFN is a strong company. They will be sure to tell you about that. More of a life insurance company than a financial services company, but they do have a broad variety of products to sell as a Financial Representative."
good,"Great place to work. Opportunity to work in different technologies if interested."
good,Great company to work for. Flexible work arrangement. Senior management are approachable. I have learned a lot about the Private Equity Secondaries Space

good,Working at Northwestern Mutual was very engaging and fun. I had a very supporting team. Everyone is very friendly and ready to help. Free lunch everyday.:)
good,"Company is growing wish I'll was still employed with Northwestern Mutual.  Great benefits and lots of perks.  Free lunch program, parking or bus pass if you use the bus."
good,Fast-paced work with a steep learning curve. Lots of multi-tasking. This is much more than a typical administrative job.
good,"NM has been in the industry for a while and has a large impact on the insurance business. "
good,"Northwestern Mutual provided a great opportunity to gain experience in the financial services industry in a professional manner. However, the compensation was commission, thus salary was very uncertain."
good,"Initially everything is based off granum, building a clientele. Most days are spend making calls to potential prospects and setting up meeting. Comprehensive analysis' are completed after a thorough fact finder. Management and co worker are all hard working and motivated"
good,Mcdonalds as everyone should know is a very big player in the fast food market. The job I had was line cook so you had to be quick on your feet to fulfill orders. Also ability to adapt to surroundings.
good,Good experience. Great for the entrepreneur. Must be ambitious and have a good network. You will gain great reward by putting in the hard work in this environment.
good,"The office was a great one to work in.  I enjoyed a lot of the other employees.  It is a different culture where you have some employees who work directly for Northwestern Mutual and then others (like myself) that work for the reps individually.  I had a challenging job keeping up with his growing business, but I enjoyed that each day brought something new.  I answered phone calls, set appointments, took applications, submitted applications, delivered applications, and kept track of all applications in underwriting.  I also kept his financial books, worked with brokers, and moved all paper files to a new e-file system."
good,"- I gained a lot of knowledge about the insurance and financial world"
good,"Working in college age students with regards to our financial planning internship. The Northwestern Mutual Internship has been ranked nationally in the top 10, according to Vault, for the past 20 consecutive years."
good,They give you the tools to succeed but you have to be prepared to put in the work 7 days a week. You need to be able to find your own leads and sometimes your referrals run out and cold calling is necessary to meet their standards.
good,Great place to work. Employee are given proper training. The supervisors and managers are very forthright with responsibilities for employees.
good,"very energetic career"
good,Good foundation to learn financial planning and advising platform. Good base for sales skills if effort applied. mentor a must if you plan to succeed.
good,"Great place to get your feet wet in the industry as well as the professional workplace. Keeps you extremely busy inside and outside of work. Always either working on or in your practice. People were great, however there was major room for improvement in the culture of the office."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you have helped make people aware of the need for the products Northwestern offers.  It is definitely a delayed gratification but it makes you feel good knowing you have helped a family or individual get started on the right path.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,"Great place to work with motivating individuals all around, guiding you in the appropriate way to help achieve your best"
good,Northwestern Mutual is a very professional place that is driven to make clients feel comfortable and informed. A comfortable office where you always have room for growth.
good,I enjoyed working at Northwestern Mutual. I enjoyed learning many new things and being apart of such a productive atmosphere.
good,"I truly enjoy working here!  Everyone is super nice, and there is zero ""drama"" in the work place.  However, I have zero benefits which is because I work for a Financial Representative."
good,This company allows individuals to make the most of their career.  Training is given and the rest is up to the employee.  Great history of the company and strong values allow for a great company to work for.
good,"A very difficult job for someone who cannot handle stress, objection, but unlimited financial potential, and unlimited ability to help people."
good,Sales rep for company to sell Life Insurance to personally built network. Lots of cold calling and rejection. Great support from within company when help was needed.
good,As a financial rep you are responsible for all of your success.  Although NML has industry leading products in the traditional whole life market they do not provide much support for financial practice management.
good,"Organized meetings with potential clients."
good,"Great people that I worked with, like a family not just "
good,"The location of the Cleveland office is great. We are right on the lake so with that view, a very positive work environment as well as flexible office hours, its a great company to work for. Insurance is something everyone needs but only a select group of people can sell it."
good,"I obtained great experience working with individuals face to face in a business setting. "
good,"NM is a titan of the insurance world, but the more you learn, you realize the less you have to think."
good,Been working here for about a year as a personal assistant. The environment is very friendly. A typical day at work is just going to your desk sitting down and working and occasionally conversing with the people in the cubicles around you. Management is really nice and approachable.
good,"The internship at NM is great. You get a lot of exposure and the company really invests in its future. The program is what you make of it, if you try, it's rewarding, if you don't try, you'll hate it. Selling life insurance is hard, and it's only made harder with a bad attitude."
good,Northwestern Mutual provided me with a unique opportunity to run my own business and develop my own clientele with unlimited earnings potential. I vastly expanded my network and enhanced my knowledge on personal finance.
good,"Great worker and employer interaction, learnt a lot of great knowledge on the ins and outs of the business."

good,Great place to start my career. Know what you are getting into. This is a sale position. You will be selling life insurance and disability insurance.
good,"Working at Strategic Financial Group, North Western Mutual was a Temporary Assignment through Office Team Staffing Agency. "
good,"Northwestern is not for the faint of heart.  In my office, you were either the best or not around.  There was a high preference for people to have a fast start to the career in the first year or they rarely let you stick around to slowly build a practice.  They call you business owners, but really you just sell there products and all of the clients you obtain, belong to the company."

My afternoons were spent on the review of Health Insurance client files for upcoming renewals and the preparation of benefit proposals.  In the late afternoon, my attention was focused on Insurance client cases including new policy applications, policy changes, premium payments, and review of the daily status reports.  The position demanded the ability to multi-task as the work flow was continuously interrupted with telephone calls and emails.  This was challenging as clients most often feel their issue is the most important and the most urgent. I truly enjoy establishing a relationship with the client, building confidence and trust which is essential in successful client servicing."

good,"A typical day at work is seeing people and fighting to see people. I would schedule four appointments a day and set aside 1-2 hours of phoning to schedule meetings. Mornings would consist of preparing for my meetings that day (prospecting list, case prep, follow up on emails), between 9-5 I would hold meetings with people and business owners (meetings consisted of fact finding or closes, prospecting and networking). In the evenings I would prepare for cases for the rest of the week and complete my admin work (filling out applications, case notes, and following up on phone calls/emails)."
good,"Fun work environment but certainly hard work involved. I was responsible for building my own clientele within an internship and discussing financial products with different individuals. This job expanded my knowledge of the financial services industry, more specifically the insurance industry. I understood how important it is to have your assets in good hands and also to put your money in smart investments, such as whole life insurance."
good,Extremely trustworthy staff and a sound investment choice for your future.
good,It was a great place to work
good,"A typical day at Northwestern always started with a business meeting of what all we had scheduled. It was a very difficult job for me going out and seeking potential clients for insurance policies, but I learned that I had to put that aside and do what i had to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was hearing the clients stories, they were so touching."
good,It was good to see what goes on in the insurance sales industry. Just not a good fit for me.
good,Worked alongside full timers. Great training program and feel for a career within the industry
good,Great internship to get started. You will learn a lot and expand your resume. It is fairly easy to get an interview so just reach out to their university relations coordinator.
good,Good place to work if you have a large network and outgoing . Have to stay on the grind 7 days per week.  Find a good mentor who is successful in the business already and latch on tight.
good,Great coworkers who were happy to help. Good experience as an internship while in school. They have a great HR department for the interns who are there each year.
good,Northwestern Mutual is a very strong and prestigious financial company but the financial field is very difficult to get started in without a strong background or market.
good,You are able to work almost completely on your own hours. It is up to the individual to determine what they can accomplish. It is hard starting out because of the small to no base however one can grow on each year and continue to build up.
good,"Company is a build your own business.  Business development, product knowledge, account management, and building ones own book of business is all it’s about"
good,"Challenging and meaningful work. The advisors and staff are all great to work with and overall the work culture is supportive, and competitive. Would highly recommend."
good,Great starting point for new college graduates.  Free lunch provided.  Decent work/life balance. Team outings tend to be fun. Decent employee fitness center.
good,"The job is centered around making sales calls to friends and family in your warm market (Northwestern Mutual does not provide leads), and financial planning."
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a great company, they put their clients first always. Although each firm is different, and my firm is not for me. I had a great experience learning about the company and how much potential it has in the future. "
good,"Flexible hours, confusing structure on the private practice level. Good cooperate culture, fun company, great recognition system for work completed. Pay was low for office staff."
good,"There was tough competition from reps. Got scolded several times for speaking to another advisors client even though he was a member of my networking group. You'll be a bird dog for a while and go to meetings with a Joint Work Partner (JWP) who can show you the ropes. "
good,Be ready for a grind. It turn into alot of cold calling if you are not prospecting correctly.  Make sure you come into it with safety net to get you through the hard first year. If you can grind past that the sky is the limit.
good,"Home office has all the benefits you could ask for Lots of training and generally good corporate atmosphere. If you work in a field office, your benefits and the whole workplace experience depends on your local management. Benefits, that are very expensive, just started to be offered and for a company famous for great life insurance and disability insurance, it's not offered as a group benefit! You can buy a plan of course, and get a discount but not as low as group rates. It's insane. Compensation varies depending on management as well. I do not get commissions even though I am a client-facing advisor. My practice manager gives a bonus once a year which is nowhere near what should be paid...Generally speaking, this company doesn't tolerate the prima donna terrorists that others in the financial industry tolerate from high producers so that's a plus. They instill the highest standards on their agents, advisors and financial planners."
good,"This job is what you make of it. Your success and failures rest on your motivation to set meetings to sell product which can be difficult if you do not believe in the mission. While it may be difficult, it can be rewarding knowing the product in which Northwestern provides is of the best quality. While you are your own boss, there are standards and metrics in which you need to do. The better you perform on the standards the better your results will be. This maybe difficult for those who are not self motivators as there is no one to watch your back and keep you in check."
good,"The training process is extensive when you are first hired and they make sure that you are knowledgeable about insurance products and procedures before anything else.  A typical day started with making phone calls trying to make appointments and when there were meetings scheduled conference rooms were available for those that do not have an office.  As this is basically a sales job, it was difficult to plan your meetings between 9-5 so many days you have to wait for your clients to get home from work to be able to schedule the meetings.  The job was very enjoyable however, the people are friendly and want you to succeed and when a client acts on the plan it is very rewarding to know that you are helping someone."
good,Its a very upscale environment. All workers generally are great to get along with and helpful. There is a constant need for engagement in work activities. The incentive packages leave as little to be desired however.
good,You can meet some very good people in this company. The company has does a lot to help you grow and they are a very good employer the culture the is one of helping others.
good,Great culture and amazing opportunity. Very competitive pay structure and hard field to stay in. Great support system and management in my office in DC. No base pay but strictly a commission and renewal pay structure. If you make it to 4-5 years in this company you will really start to excel and reap the reward.
good,I was an intern at Northwestern Mutual and was treated as a colleague by the full time agents. We were free to explore our own opportunities and were compensated well for doing so.
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a great place to work at if youre a highly sales driven individual. No leads, lofty goals and a ton of freedom make it a competitive environment. The pay could be better and nothing but commissions makes it hard to make a living sometimes. Management is great also."
good,"You get out what you put in to this company. If you’re willing to diligently put in a lot of hours and follow your mentors to a fault, you will be rewarded accordingly. If you’re looking for a simple 9-5 with average effort, you will not survive more than a couple months."
good,"As a rep there, It is very competitive to have a fruitful career, however if manage to overcome that, it will become easier for the future. I thank the experience, but will recommend to look into what exactly the position is and if is in your desire."
good,"Company hires whomever they can.  That can be a good thing, or a bad thing.  Nice to see some vets in there making things work.  They teach and train the best they can..  The senior folks are great."
good,"Although this career wasn't for me, I really appreciated upper management's support and approach to their careers. I have nothing but respect for Northwestern Mutual, and I wish them the best."
good,"If anyone is a people person, good at sales, and know lots of wealthy people they could make a haul in commission. If you only know limited people, are an introvert, or only know lower class people, you will need a night job to pay your bills. The company is awesome if you are good at sales, if not don't bother applying."
good,A large very conservative financial services and insurance company is attempting to change its structure to become a fast moving nimble start-up style comapany
good,"The culture at Northwestern Mutual was great - everyone around the office was eagerly willing to help out and offer insight. Prospecting is a challenge, especially in areas that have lots of financial advisors who attend the same kinds of networking events. Referrals are the main source of building a client base, which can be difficult for those coming out of school with a relatively non-established network - career changers can excel here. The training is good, but it is focused on the products more so than the financial planning process. The mentorship is designed to help with the planning process, but not all mentors are equal. Loved the culture, but as a 100% commission based role, it can be difficult to succeed (average turnover is about 85%)."
good,"You’ll get out of it what you put into it. "
good,Working at Northwestern is entirely what you make of it. The base salary is low but you have unlimited earning potential. Everyone was friendly but no real bonds or culture.
good,"The Internship was an overall great experience. Great Culture, Learned a lot, but was not compensated for the amount of work put in. I feel that everyone should do something like this to really see the pros and cons of the financial services industry."
good,"I'll always be a client, just not an employee.  If a Salary + commission was offered, this career would be AMAZING.  hard to get started without a large existing market.  However, if you put in the work, and luck is in your favor, the career here is amazing."
good,"This agency that I worked at provided a great amount of sales training and helped prepare you for the world of prospecting. However, this is a very competitive industry and you have to be able to prospect to keep your business alive."
good,"North Western Mutual is a firm that goes beyond wealth and asset consultation, income protection, education planning, and investments. Its network of advisers, and access to a diverse set of world class investment tools helps businesses and families make finance easy.  I will always recommend representative/adviser positions to close friends/family."
good,Good potential but be ready to dedicate your entire life. Also just a bit morbid to have to talk about potential death everyday so it would have been interesting to include other types of insurance.
good,"I learned the independent, entrepreneurial spirit of financial representatives.  Start building the foundation in finance, insurance, and sales that will help you deliver excellent financial security to your clients. "
good,"I worked for NM for years, and I can't think of a more admired or stable financial company, or one with more integrity - in fact, no matter what happens for me professionally, I won't move my investments from NM and will NEVER move or cancel my life insurance. The conviction the workforce has around NM's products is exceptional, because the products themselves are exceptional, and this conviction elevates those who work there. There's definitely a sense of belonging to a mission for good when you work here. This sense of belonging helps create closeness among those in the same offices and agencies, which is wonderful - I felt a tremendous amount of affection and respect for my colleagues, and the quality of my life has been enhanced by their friendships."
good,Enjoyed working with the teams and the clients. Afforded many opportunities for new environments and opportunities that allowed growth in a number of technical areas.
good,Great Personal Growth Opportunity. Strong Leadership. Unlimited Income Potential. High Demand. Self-Directed Schedule. Great Long-Term Career. Heavy Stress.
good,I enjoyed my time at Northwestern Mutual.  A typical work day consisted of getting your work assignments and trying to complete them by the end of the day.  The company has many resources that are able to assist you with your job function.
good,NM has transformed itself from a life insurance company to a financial services company. Part of that transformation has changed the culture from the traditional structure to a more startup firm culture appealing to the millennium generation. This has opened up the company to expanding and growing in the digital marketplace.
good,Culture varies greatly depending on department you work in. Some areas require evening and weekend work regularly. Opportunity to work remotely in some areas. Supportive culture - very big in diversity and inclusion efforts and team building. Agile environment - don't expect to do the same thing forever. Client and field-focused. People believe they are helping people with the work they do.
good,Great place to get your feet wet in the industry with a great name in the business. It definitely is not for everyone. Everyone is really supportive and has a lively personality.
good,"Pleasant work culture.  Professional staff."
good,"A typical day at work was spent answering phone calls, completing complex casework and revising/creating standard work procedures.   Northwestern Mutual has taken on CL&I (Continuous Learning & Improvement) within the past four years.  Lean management can be an extremely effective tool; however, id did not feel as if Northwestern Mutual utilized it to it's potential.  Instead of cutting waste, various departments were forced to complete daily, weekly and monthly procedures that added waste to job responsibilities instead of simplifying roles as lean management is intended to .  The best part of Northwestern Mutual were the benefits and co-workers."
good,I was an intern for Northwestern Mutual. I enjoyed the flexible hours and the freedom to talk to clients. You definitely have to be motivated to do well.
good,"Every day was different. It was a fast paced and learning was continual."
good,"The internship program is hit or miss. I was not aware of the licensing test when I started, which is very difficult and you don't get paid until it's passed."
good,Northwestern mutual offered a friendly productive work culture. Northwestern Mutual taught me how to build my own business by working with experienced advisors to effectively prospect and acquire clients.  The hardest part of this job is prospecting. At some point you run out of leads and are forced to either cold call or go business to business. The most enjoyable aspect of this job is the opportunity to change lives.
good,"Depending upon your team, you could have a very enjoyable and valuable work experience. Northwestern being the large company it is, has the resources available for you to learn."
good,"Great Teams, Great Commission, and the ability to build a very successful career.. I would recommend anyone starting off in finance to explore a career at northwestern mutual."
good,"A typical day was providing support to Sybase databases,  investigating issues that might be caused by data problems, business logic, Informatica mappings, Unix scripts, Sybase or DB2 databases, providing support to other teams that access the aforementioned databases, mentoring other developers by providing any help to them."
good,"Have to have own book of business, no help with leads, joint works splitting commission earned, no sharing of JW down,split commission on your leads that you have established"
good,"NM is a great place to work, only thing that could better is increased base salary and more hands-on training.  The drive to the downtown PGH office can be a hassle day-to-day."
good,Great place to work. New Challenges daily. Need to passion to be successful and the desire to work hard. Be resilient and do what your told and you'll be successful.
good,"Excellent company to work for with tremendous opportunity for professional development."
good,I very much enjoyed working at Northwestern Mutual. The managing director and managing partners did an excellent job of educating their employees and the the overall atmosphere was one of support and teamwork. The company does a lot to help new agents build their practice.
good,"Great company to work for, the people are smart, encouraging and respectful. I love sales and I'm seeking an opportunity that involves more of the arts, retail fashion, or creative type field."
good,"Learned a lot here, good amount of trail by fire.  Work environment is fun and laid back. Management is good and technology is on the cutting edge due to technology leadership."
good,"I have worked as a contractor at NML over the last 10 years and have always enjoyed my assignments. I was a member of the testing services group and found that my input to process changes, innovative techniques, and developing new testing methodologies was solicited and respected by my colleagues. I worked in a variety of domain spaces including Managed Investments, New Business, Life, Personal Planning, etc."
good,"Great culture for anyone looking to start a financial practice. If this is what you are looking for, this is the company to work for. "
good,"Great company and great career opportunity. Compensation is unlimited as you work for commission only. A typical day is phoning prospects and clients in the morning to set appointments, then client meetings the rest of the day. Very much have to be self motivated and good at sales."
good,"I have been pushed intellectually and go to bed exhausted each night. All solicitations are from referrals so you need a strong, vibrant and understanding personal network."
good,"My position wasn't as an advisor for NML itself, but working for an advisor. I had access to all of NML's resources and personnel to help me along, and in my opinion, they're unmatched in the industry. I can't speak to the pros and cons of being an agent of NML, but for the agent I worked under, he felt as if NML promoted a holistic approach to financial planning, but didn't give its full support to the investment-related aspect of the planning."
good,Very tough business to get into. hard to start out and your really need to work hard. it was not the business i wanted to get into.
good,"Northwestern Mutual has a great internship set up. They have extensive training and one on one mentoring. The management found high level candidates to participate in their program and had the ability to hire strait from that pool. I learned how to communicate better with people, a beginning understanding of being a financial representative, and how to problem solve in specific scenarios."
good,taught you how to work for your money. Had to drive everywhere to get to clients. Hard to close deal.
good,The key part of my success was learning the Long Term Care products and being able to sell them to clients. Once I gained that knowledge through study and mentoring I became the sales and marketing trainer for the office.
good,Worked for the Bohannon Group.  Always had my back and was surrounded by great people.  I would recommend this career to anyone looking to be in finance.
good,"My main focus, and job, is to build and maintain great relationships with my co-workers as well as many different individuals outside of work. My ability to do so is what drives my professional sucess."
good,"If you want to focus your business on insurance sales, this is the shop for you. The main focus and business model is on permanent insurance. Payouts and splits are good. Turnaround is higher than in other firms."
good,Started early and stayed very busy. Learned a lot about providing excellent client service. Management was great as were coworkers. Getting in sync with individual financial rep was most difficult.
good,Overall it is a great company. The hardest part of the job is getting started. You have to have a big market to hit. If you have a big natural market and alot of money to start out with this may be the company for you. It is definately a family atmosphere. If you can meet with enought people you can make good money while also helping individuals and families.
good,It is probably one of the most difficult industries to recruit for. You're selling a dream. You bring people in by the dozens and hope that someone sticks and that it is someone good. Trying to convince someone that it is a great idea to work on commission only and basically have no income for the first year is stressful especially because even the best candidates drop out of the process constantly. This is increasingly difficult when management is breathing down your neck and you have targets that you must hit. Your every move is micromanaged as well. 
good,"A great company to work for but is very hard to start your own ""business"""
good,Great company to start out and get immersed in the insurance and finance world. A lot of autonomy and freedom to build your own business. 
good,"Great place that offers a solid foundation for young people in the workforce. I've learned a lot about finance and running your own business, it takes a lot of courage and dedication. You must focus on the process and not let the negative thoughts beat you down. You are in control of your life and you have the ability to direct it in whichever way you want. It's been a great challenge and learning experience working at NMFN. There are a lot of hardworking and dedicated advisors in the industry, and even the best get beat down at times. My experience here has really helped me realize that everyone goes through tough times and the important thing is to focus on getting right back up and not dwelling on the negative. Reaching out to the community in our industry is tough because people have their own set views of what a financial advisor does and what they're about. It's important to be confident and stand strong if you want to succeed."
good,"- Begin with calling prospects, cold-calling, and set appointments."
good,"The most valuable aspect of Northwestern Mutual is the training. It prepared me with selling abilities, product knowledge, psychology/philosophy, people skills. The hardest part of the job was working on a commission only basis, yet this aspect encouraged a stronger drive for success."
good,"Great insurance company.  If you're going to be in the business, Northwestern is a great place to be- they offer great products and have the necessary planning tools so you can do right by your clients."
good,"Income shown in job listings is exaggerated. Maybe only 1 or 2 of 60 young reps hit the top figure and the mean income is the bottom figure. Could make much less. 90% of new advisors do not make it past their 5th year. However, there are advisors that earn 7 figures."
good,"Good organization to be associated with, had a great experience, employee centric, well organized and oriented. Flexible working environment. Satisfied."
good,"great overall business sales training, harsh 'fake it till you make it' mentality, lack of black, Asian, and female leadership, lack of overall diversity"
good,Northwestern Mutual is one of the top financial firms to work for. If you are competitive and an entrepreneur this company is for you. They have a unique way of tracking your prospecting activities such that if you stay on course there is no reason why you should not be successful.
good,"My typical day included checking email, checking statuses for submitted applications, prepping for financial reviews with clients, phoning to set client reviews and new client on boarding."
good,"If you are looking for a company that offers a great work-life balance, NM is the place for you. Employees are provided the opportunity to work remote and/or work from home.  Work schedules are flexible to allow employees to be able to be present at work and at home."
good,"insurance heavy, not as much hands on with investments and asset management. need to market family and friends from the get go. lots of turnover. but culture was fun and energetic."
good,Good learning experience. Opportunities to work with senior financial advisors and learn about different products and methods applied to financial services.
good,NM is evolving after their acquisition 4 years ago.  Multiple transformation initiatives in flight. Exciting to see the momentum. Benefits is great and pay is competitive.
good,Great company to work for specially for entry level candidates seeking a fortune 500 company experience. Intense but supportive work environment with unlimited help and advise from the most productive representatives.
good,Small office feel with good co-workers. Every agent has their own procedures and processes. Can be a very good job for the right person. Must be able to work well with your agent.
good,"Love the culture and management I worked with. However, the business model was very rigid and difficult to maintain. If you have A LOT of contacts who will open their door for you to explore their contacts, then you may be in good shape."
good,Great place to intern but was very difficult to keep up with if you are commuting. You can only use the computers in the office so you must be in the office to do work. Most days consist of meeting with clients and developing/presenting plans. You must find all of your own clients which can be difficult if you are young or not from the area. They mostly just want you to sell to your family. You don't get paid if you don't hit your benchmark. All sales are split with partners.
good,This job is based on your contacts and setting meetings. You msut be personable and build a contact listing with as many people as possible. Also the people must fit the economic profile of the contacts  you will be building. Keep that in mind.
good,"Loved this job, wish I had been able to continue working there. I was laid off due to situations out of my control but the company gave me a lot of freedom, responsibility and room for growth."
good,"A typical day day as an Investment Operations Assistant starts out inputting stock/wire trades and gathering the multiple deposits for the day.  All work is time sensitive and confidential.  There are days where millions in funds are delivered to up to 3 banks on the lunchbreak. This job was a great opportunity to meet people, as well as explore options to better my future through investments."
good,This is a company that is growing and going through a lot of change. Great place to work if you are on the right team. I would recommend this company.
good,Great culture and great place to work at especially if you are disciplined enough to build your own practice. It is a heavy sales job and starts off with mostly selling insurance. The job will enhance a lot of skills and form many others.
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a great company.  Typically work 8 hours with an unpaid hour lunch,  Monday through Friday. You get every weekend and holiday off!  Office culture is great, everyone is friendly."
good,"100 % commission selling life insurance is tough these days. Although you have the ability to do extensive financial planning, insurance products are their own so there is an inherent conflict because that’s what you ge to paid on."
good,"Great company, inspiring role models within, you are left to your own willpower and drive but there are a handful of tasks for new advisors that were very confusing and no one seemed to be able to help or give a clear answer."
good,"It was a privilege to work at Northwestern Mutual home office for the past 21 years.  I enjoyed my job fully and felt that my contribution through my work played a part in the success of the compensation department.  I thoroughly enjoyed being the ""go to"" person to resolve field issues and do history research to resolve problems and move the department process forward.  I studied the process of work flow and developed a time efficient and accuracy method of processing in the department.  I was asked by my previous manager to teach the others in the office the techniques for more efficiency in the department.  It is still used today."
good,Best part of being in the finanviall industry is all about the right company. Northwestern Mutual is a great company to start a sales career in. One of the best training programs I have ever attended.
good,"Great work/life balance opportunity"
good,If you like a sales job that’s 100% commission and sitting at a cubicle cold calling all day then you’ll like being a financial rep. That’s not how this job was presented to me.
good,"Working at NM has been a fruitful experience, but there is really not much variety within your job. Also, career advancement is minimal to none. Tough to move around or up in the office, you can expect to be doing the same job 5 years from now."
good,"Learned a lot about the financial and insurance industry."
good,"Came in out of college as an intern and went full time. They have you start by looking at who you could sell to (friend and family) first then train you on how to get referrals."
good,"Great location and work culture. It is a very challenging work, with long hours and lots of knowledge coming at you. You will spend a majority of your week at the office, but you have a great support system from the veteran advisors. However, management needs work."
good,Commission based career in the financial industry selling insurance products and financial planning packages. Can be tough if you don't have a good network of clients.
good,"As a whole, this organization is a good starting point for many. In my time with the company, I only met a handful of agents who had made a career of being a financial representative, but for the ones who found success at it, it was very lucrative. I think the longer you stay with this organization, the more focus and emphasis gets placed on investment work, but the company offers plenty of opportunity and resources to get licensed to sell insurance products and investment products. This is an excellent organization to join if you are strong at networking as many roles are sales-oriented and depend on you generating your own client leads."
good,If you can get referred well it is an unbelievable opportunity.  No salary makes it exceedingly difficult to succeed.  Must have a large number (300 minimum) of extremely warm referrals to call starting out.
good,Fast paced and overwhelming place with not enough hours. Leadership lacks at communication with the rest of the team. Not enough hours in a week’s worth of work.
good,"Northwestern Mutual is built on Life Insurance as a company which provides excellent risk management and principles for financial planning.  The management is supportive and driving toward productivity results using the Granum production system.  Overall, great culture and values driven to insurance sales productivity results."
good,"Great culture "
good,Great company with great management. Time consuming work that takes a strong backbone to persevere through. Great people just difficult and grueling work.
good,"Had good benefits and PTO, but salary was a little light. If you work downtown the commute can be a little rough in the cold. Wish the company had more modern technology."
good,"This company gave me the opportunity to move throughout various areas acquiring various skills while learning about many business functions.  The new skills acquired were put to good use as I advanced my career, built knowledge and relationships."
good,"Northwestern Mutual seems to be a great company to work for.  The issues I had, I believe were associated with the manager I had.  He sought me out and yet never truly valued me as an employee.  I worked very hard for him and did everything I was told and in turn was treated poorly."
good,Hardest part of the job is starting out.  You have to build your own book of business and you do that by contacting friends and family to talk about money and see if you can help them or sell them something.  This always felt awkward to me and I didn't like it.  Everyone there was very nice and wanted to help me succeed.  Not a lot of useful training
good,"Northwestern Mutual gives you exactly what you put into it."
good,You go into the office and get asked to put together a list specifically with a certain income range. after bringing in the list they ask you to start calling these people to talk about financial planning. It was a good experience to learn about financial planning but ultimately there was poor management.
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a great company. My overall experience there wasn't the best. It definitely feels very clique like. The turnaround is high because it is a difficult career, however, every one's experience is different. "
good,NM offers great benefits and good people to work with. The company has good advancement opportunities and can be a fast paced and competitive work environment at times.
good,It was great experience in a intern position. Management and the people I worked with were great. The compensation does start getting good until you have been 7-8 year deep in the business.
good,"Northwestern had no shortage of people willing to chat and get to know you, the culture is overall pretty relaxed for IT with an easy chance to get along with coworkers."
good,The layoffs and the way NM is changing is unsettling.  The company has entered a new era and many people who think NM is a company to come and retire is long gone.
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a reputable company with a well-known brand and strong financial backing. The financial representative role allows you to grow and run your own financial practice, helping your clients achieve their financial goals. The flexibility of the job requires someone who is a self-starter, disciplined, and highly motivated"
good,I enjoyed working with such talented people whom I learned a lot from during the course of my career. The facility is setup nicely for team collaboration and offers touch-down offices for commuters from other campus. I also enjoyed the flexibility of being able to work from home when needed.
good,Uncapped commission is attractive but no base pay or draw. Can be tough to get started. Have to have the right personality and be willing to get there early and stay late.
good,"A career at Northwestern Mutual is full of great people, challenge, and learning and growth on a weekly basis. If you are going to be a financial representative there is no better place to do it!"
good,"Was always able to talk to anyone. People were very easy to talk to. Management was not the best to talk to because they were never around. If I had any questions, I had to ask others that were around me for help or advice about something that I wanted to do."
good,"We combine our unsurpassed financial strength, solutions and expertise with time-tested principles, a comprehensive approach to planning and a financial representative’s long-term commitment to listen to, guide and encourage you."
good,"Great organization, great people!  A leading employer in Milwaukee delivering services to help others during all stages of their lives."
good,"Everyone's experience is different depending on their success. As an intern I received a $100 stipend and received commission based on policies produced. The office culture was fun and relaxing, but your pay check was based on number of policies signed, so to me it was a constant scramble to book meetings and try to have a prospect sign up for Life Insurance.  I learned a lot about the industry, but don't see it as a career because it is mainly sales oriented."
good,"If you've got what it takes and the network to sell to, this is an absolute dream job. So much money to be made. It takes a while to get started, but once you're rolling, you'll be rolling in it. The management was a dream that was trying to help everyone achieve what they were capable of."
good,"Great company to work for career advancement. Needs more leadership training or experienced leaders. "
good,"Everyone knows NM as a large name, serious employer. What may not be known is that even when the company is doing well, the positions are unstable, with little pay."
good,A typical day includes working with new representatives on how to work with clients and develop financial plans. You will learn the ins and outs of the financial services career. Management depends on your region and location. The hardest part of the job is having to reject clients due to underwriting. The most enjoyable thing was helping people reach their dreams through financial security.
good,"Great working culture. Insurance sales is based on who you know and how well you can hustle. Northwestern Mutual is a company is great. If you do well, they take very very good care of you."
good,NM is a great company to work for however I think that employees should always feel appreciated at all times when they work hard.
good,Expectations are extremely high but it can be very rewarding. This company is not for everyone. This job will make you think bigger but 100% commission has its pros and its cons.
good,"Great company to work for if you enjoy the sales process.  Great working environment and almost total control over daily schedule.  Eat what you kill mentality, completely commission based pay.  If you make a lot of sales,  you will make a lot of money.  If you do not make sales, you do not get paid. Early stages of career focus on life and disability insurance sales which can be a challenging market for a young college graduate."
good,"This job offers an amazing opportunity to gain hands-on experience in the financial services industry. There is unlimited potential to earn commission and no cap to possible earnings. It is a competitive sales environment that will push employees to be smarter, better, and more motivated than ever before."
good,be ready to call all of your friends and family trying to sell life insurance. zero leads are given to you. no benefits. management is nice and you will learn a lot but not for everyone
good,Certainly not everyone is capable of doing this line of work but seeing those that did well and made it a career was fun!  Lots of great experience and knowledge of the industry.  I think their core products are still great
good,"Worked as a freelancer, employees do receive great benefits, there is free lunch, the company takes part in a lot of community events, co-workers are very friendly."
good,"Come into work at 7:30 have meetings with mentors and go over problems during the week and plans for the week.  Training was once a week on Fridays.  Learned how to construct a sound financial plan for individual people to cater to their specific needs and goals.  Management was great and relaxed, but very professional."
good,"Hands on, real life financial practice with compensation. Excellent eye opening internship for students who think they are going to work in finance. I had always wanted to be a Financial Representative, but I learned with this internship that it wasn't for me. Valuable internship with valuable skills to be learned"
good,"This position offers an incredible opportunity if you're the right type of person, but certainly is not for everyone. Expect long hours and a lot of disappointment before you find success with this job."
good,"They trained me well, and I learned a lot from the company. It was a great company to work for. I sat down with clients and discussed their future financial goals."
good,"Although it is a demanding sales position right out of college, there are plenty of opportunities for success and growth.  There is a lot of turnover when I was there but I think they have figured that out since then."
good,"Starting my career in financial services at NMFN allowed me to truly embrace my entrepreneurial spirit. I learned what it took run a business and how much discipline you need to be successful when you are your own boss. Most importantly, I developed an unparalleled work ethic that pushed me to be successful in a ""eat what you kill"" career. "
good,"I learned a lot about how to conduct myself in an extremely professional environment and also learned that someone's age does not determine their professional ability. The financial planning field is not a field that I am passionate about, and therefore I am choosing to transition to another field."
good,"Northwestern Mutual Financial Network is a great environment to work, grow, advance and settle into as a career. With extensive training and great leadership, Northwestern Mutual is a great place to advance quickly and be compensated accordingly. This job is very hard-work, but with dedication and determination you have unlimited opportunities as well as a flexible schedule."
good,"Meet with individuals to consult, analyze and better"
good,It was a good experience. Preps you for the real world and gives you good life skills.
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a great company to work for. They really do care about all of their employees. I learned a lot about my self, and a lot more about being a successful recruiter."
good,I didn't excel at this job because I wasn't in the right mind frame to sell insurance all the time.
good,"The main reason I did not pursue a career here was due to income being based on 100% commission.  It was very challenging finding new prospects to try to sell insurance to at a young age.  "
good,"Must be very self motivated. Work as hard or as little as you want since your compensation is based off of your performance. Continued education for new employees. A welcoming, friendly work environment."
good,I was a licensed assistant to two representatives.  It was a wonderful learning experience.
good,As a financial representative you basically make your own schedule. You work when you want to and how much you want to. The all compensation part is a little stressful.
good,I spend my days on the phone or in front of people selling the idea of working with me then the idea of acting on my recommendations.  The hardest part of the job is seeing the 30 or more new recruits a year leave the business after 6 months.  I enjoyed the relationships I built working with my clients.
good,"Good place to work, you just have to get paired with the right office for your personality, and have a tough skin."
good,Working at Northwestern gave me more experience in a new field. 
good,"Nice people with a lot knowledge to share."
good,A typical day is calling on people you know to set appointments to meet and discuss their financial future.  I learned great phone skills and talk tracks as well as finding out what is most important to people.  Management is very helpful and will help you along the way.  The hardest part of the job is asking for the money needed to achieve goals.  the best part of the job is meeting with and helping people. 
good,Great internship possibility for anyone in college. Solid corporate culture.
good,The day's are very fast and I learned a lot about the insurance industry. Management is very attentive to the employees. One problem is that working outside of the corporate office/ or for a Managing Partner; new agents can not pay what people need to stay ahead of the economy.
good,Northwestern Mutual - Edwardsville has great people and a great culture. You get what you put into it. Income is limitless but it's on you to make your money.
good,Northwestern Mutual is a strong believer in giving back to the community.  They are a strong supporter of the LGBT Community. Awesome Company to work for.
good,"Management made sure to specify exactly what to do if you wanted to be successful in your internship. The hardest part of the job is the same for everyone your work with, so advice from your peers is very helpful."
good,"Work culture conducive to learning and growing your business. This is apparent all the way up to the corporate office in Milwaukee. For a financial advisor, it's tough to get started but one you do, it's a forward trajectory."
good,Overall a solid company to work with. Great mentorship opportunities. Northwestern Mutual could do a bit better with overall salaries; perhaps making it less commission based.
good,"Northwestern wants to see all employees succeed. Owning my own business and being partnered with Northwestern has been an amazing experience. My work/Life balance is lacking, no job is worth my families love and support."
good,"-The job itself is not hard and can be enjoyable. Management at times can be unrealistic with project timing and how they talk to their employees. "
good,"Northwestern Mutual, as a whole, is the absolute best financial services company in the world. I'm incredibly thankful for the skills I learned and the friends I made that will stay with me for the rest of my life."
good,"I enjoyed my time with LearnVest, owned by Northwestern Mutual. The position no longer exists. "
good,"Be prepared for a lot of meetings that take time away from actually doing your job. For women, it is a ""boy's club"" mentality and you are expected to do your job and keep your mouth shut. The reps will talk about their associates behind their back.  Very dog eat dog.  You work for your rep, NOT Northwestern and you will never be included in the company's parties or outings. If your rep doesn't do anything for you in the way of appreciation, gatherings, etc...., the company won't either, so you are on your own."
good,"The company does require a lot of sales, there is a great mentor setup to help newer reps adjust to the industry and guide them along the business cycle."
good,You're able to be your own boss. Create your own work schedule and build your own clients. Daily telephoning prospects to create meetings. Daily face to face meetings with prospects. Changing people's lives in a positive way. Work culture is fun!
good,"Had great hours and great training. Compensation for an intern is solely commission. The environment was great, we had great interns in the office. The job is great for networking."
good,"NML was a good place to work.  The tasks and opportunities were stacked in favor of producers.   Those that didn't, wouldn't rise.  The issue is, for a contractor, there was nothing there.  No expectations, no movement or plans for advancement, as a producer, you had to work for it all. "
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a great corporate citizen that is doing an excellent job investing in Milwaukee. However, while job security was once a staple of the company, this is no longer the case. Since the purchase of LearnVest in 2015, the vision of the company has become less clear. As a result, several layoffs have occurred and several key executives have left. While the company has an admirable goal of creating an exceptional client experience driven by financial planning, the ongoing layoffs leave employees wondering who's next and key work for driving an exceptional client experience is slow to get done. Northwestern Mutual is well aware that there is a lot of disruption occurring in the financial services industry and is trying to figure out how best to deal with it."
good,"I learned a lot but wasn't paid much to be an assistant. Being a representative is great; the company worships their representatives. Assistants are rarely recognized for their effort by the company in general, so you really need to work for a high grossing rep for your salary to compensate for the lack of recognition. That being said, I'm very glad I worked there. You will learn everything about personal finance."
good,"Northwestern Mutual is an amazing company that puts its clients interest first and foremost. The advisers receive phenomenal training upon joining the company as well as mentoring/training along the way. A typical day in the office consisted of meeting with my staff, making dials, and then meeting clients or potential clients in person or over the phone. The manager in our office was extremely knowledgeable and always went out of his way to ensure we were doing the right thing. The hardest part of the job was seeing how many new reps failed out of the business. More than 90% of new reps don't make it past the first  months, but I genuinely think that most of them don't want to put in the required effort. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing clients take action on their personal and financial goals and then see their growth throughout the years of working together."
good,This is a tough career but can be very rewarding. If you're willing to take on a commissioned position and bet on yourself to put in the long hours of work to get your business up and off the ground then this job is for you.
good,Great company background. Most days are spent in the office making calls and setting meetings. if you are not making calls then you are out on meetings. Hardest part of the Job is networking an finding a good client base to go off of. I enjoyed the freedom of being able to leave the office whenever to go on meetings.
good,Northwestern Mutual is a staple in the finance industry. This is a good company with a very flexible and tailored internship program. It is very hands on.
good,Typical sales role with atypical sales job. a lot of impact but you have to work really hard to earn what you want to earn. Overall i enjoyed my experience there.
good,"I worked as executive assistant to the Managing Director in recruiting for 3 yrs before taking on the roll of Associate Financial Representative which utilized my security and insurance licenses."
good,"Overall great place, but can depend on your manager. "
good,"Working at NML helped me develop sales skills,  and understanding the art of financial planning.  The company was very supportive and driven to develop new advisers for success.   Compensation is driven strictly on production alone,  no base salary."
good,Being an Intern for only a summer I feel as if there was so much pressure to sell the products. That being said I feel as if the training was more on how to sell rather than what we were selling.
good,"The hardest part of the job was prospecting with family and friends and finding time to study for all the tests. Series 6, 65 &7. Hard tests that need ample time to study but if you take time to study you can get behind on prospecting and appointments. It's a numbers game. The more people you meet with the higher the chances are of making a client. The first few years most typically are very lean. Be prepared to live on a tight budget. Or better yet, have a large cushion built up to fall back on until you're up and running. "
good,I was merely an intern at Northwestern Mutual. I learned a lot and took away important leadership skills. I eventually left the internship because the career was just not for me.
good,North western is a very good company to work with.  I would recommend it to others.  Currently its going to alot of change but I think change is good.
good,"Loved my position and the office.  Men to women ratio was very uneven. However, everyone who was employed were wonderful to work with.  Helping develop others was a great experience."
good,"A typical workday at Northwestern Mutual is to meet with potential clients and discuss financial situation and goals.  Along with meeting clients it is imperative that you acquire referrals and reach out to qualified suspects to try and set new appts (5/day).  I learned a lot about the financial services industry, its products and how the general public handles their own financial situations.  Colleagues are very helpful and it is common to work jointly early on in the career to make sure clients needs are being handled appropriately.  The hardest part of the job is cold calling and persuading potential clients to take time out of their day to sit down with you and discuss their financial situation.  The most enjoyable part about this job is when you are able to have open dialogue with potential clients about their situation, provide recommendations and build a financial plan that fits their needs. Furthermore, and most importantly to get the clients to take action on achieving financial security and providing a sense of relief in their minds that they are working on a systematic savings plan that will benefit them and their families for a lifetime."
good,"Great people. I was unable to generate the leads needed to provide for a family of 4.  "
good,"Still a great place to work, but recent management changes as part of an acquisition has really changed the culture....including dropping the fixed benefit pension and laying off employees for the first time ever."
good,Changing culture in the last year to hiring young employees and moving away from long term retention of employees. Drastic change in the 160 year culture at Northwestern Mutual.
good,"Northwestern is a great company that has a very solid reputation on the financial world."
good,"You get their early in the morning and proceed with a daily meeting about objectives, different techniques, and reiterations about your goals and objectives day to day. Work culture is very professional. Fully commissioned paid job."
good,Day by day you strive to be the hardest working version of yourself. Northwestern Mutual gives you all the tools to create a sound financial practice.
good,You are usually there early to make phone calls and then from there the rest of the day is filled with meetings. It is up to you to make meetings and find new clients. Their is little to no help getting them besides what you do.
good,"Always have someone to lean on when you can’t figure something out. Good support staff for when things are not so great.  The only thing I wish was available"
good,"They need to have a better set up plan for new hires. Being Sales, the training for 1 month is not long enough to help get new advisors on their feet. However, they give you the best tools to succeed. I just wished they had a training program for 1 year of job security to really get people started"
good,"Culture- great"
good,"There is a lot of change going on in the organization right now. This can be a good thing if it is managed appropriately......again, if it is managed appropriately."
good,I loved the people I worked with and made some good friends. The workload varied from heavy to at times slow. I had to quit because of the commute and my need to pursue another career.
good,Northtwestern Mutual was a good and fun place to work. I was there for just about 12 years and the culture was such that it was both challenging and good natured at the same time.
good,The work is interesting. Commission only compensation makes it difficult. Must be comfortable calling a lot of people to try and set enough appointments to survive.
good,Great mentors and interactive team members to make sure office runs smoothly. Great use of technology to stay organized and connected with other offices
good,High level of customer  and representative interaction on a daily basis. Various responsibilities that were both on and added later to job description upon being hired. It lacked definitive management and on location HR department that made it difficult to voice any concerns. Out of city supervisors that made it difficult to gauge my level of accomplishment on a day to day basis.
good,"Full Commission, you earn what you put in which has its positives and it's negatives. You rely on your own book of business or you will be cold calling. Training is intense especially if you are  not familiar with this industry. Focused more on Life Insurance rather than investments"
good,It was a great place to work with a wonderful culture. the management really does try to help you out throughout the entire process. The training is beyond anywhere else in the industry.
good,I had a great experience working with Northwestern Mutual. I learned a lot about sales and cold calling. One of the most important skill I acquired was learning to lead a meeting. I was able to listen in on my boss and here how a cold call should be handled. I tried my own pitch and worked on perfecting it so I can tailor it to any potential client.
good,"Just make sure you know exactly what you are signing up for before starting. They have a great training program and they do a good job at making everything seem amazing. Just be aware this is a commission only job - so make sure you are financially ready to start this career b/c you will be without income in the beginning. Plus, the sales cycle for most clients is 60-90+ days so it could be 5-6 months before anything substantial starts rolling in. Also, all fees and expenses are yours to pay. This is a business (your business) and you have to pay for everything. The longer you stay the more you pay. They do help a little in the beginning. "
good,really great experience with the company although it is extremely hard to get ahead they promise you alot but you have to put in alot of work overall it was a good learning experience
good,"Making cold-calls, prospecting, seeing clients. Learned how to build financial plans and relationships. Great workplace culture. Finding clients was the hardest part. Loved helping people and seeing them progress."
good,"Arrived to a great environment every morning at 7:30 am until 4:30 pm.  Never had to work overtime. I learned how to be a team player, and management had an open door policy.  The hardest part of my job was getting Reps to open emails and respond back before deadlines.  The most enjoyable part was working with great coworkers."
good,"Learned a lot, independent platform, must be self-motivated, no training is provided, a lot of pressure to sell to family and friends. I would not like to write a review. I would rather not be detailed in my review. I would just like to continue creating my profile without writing a review."
good,Its a Work Hard then play Hard type of place to work. Its the place where one would work hard Monday thru Friday and some Fridays becomes more relaxed than other.
good,A typical day at work is making 50 dials a day to set up meetings with prospects. The day also includes meeting with prospects and giving them a presentation on how to reach their goal of finding financial security.
good,"Honestly, if I could go in and just socialize that would be great. The financial world is not my cup of my tea, but the team at NWM always made it fun. I got close with most people within a year. We were like one big family."
good,"As a contractor, i was accepted as one of the employees. I was treated the great respect."
good,Good management team. Flexible with students. Family oriented business culture. Lots of opportunity for advancement. Very nice atmosphere. They do accommodate people with various disabilities to make work as efficient and comfortable as possible.
good,"I really enjoyed the internship program and learned a lot. Theres a big difference between an intern an d a full time employee meaning that as an intern you have more help and more teamwork. I enjoyed the experience, but couldn't see myself doing that for the rest of my life."
good,Treated people fairly.  They have a good training program for contractors. Their mentoring program is second to none.  My management team was supportive.
good,It is difficult to get hired on full time to the company but they have a good culture there and benefits are great as well included free lunch every day.  The pay isn't the best but could easily be obtained after putting in some time there
good,"I get to utilize my professional talents in an atmosphere that challenges me intellectually and helps the community at-large. At the end of the day, I leave work feeling fulfilled; like I made a real impact on the community and was appreciated by the company for my contribution."
good,"Northwestern Mutual was a nice place to work. The people there were great to work with! There is room for advancement, and the company has many perks and benefits."
good,Wonderful company to work for.  Great compensation and benefits.  The only downside is that the company being located downtown therefore affordable parking is hard to find.
good,Great environment and a great culture. Very hard business but if you just stick to what they say you will be successful. You must be self motivated. You will hear a million different ways to do things you just have to adopt what works for you.
good,"With the changing environment at Northwestern Mutual, there is a feeling of uncertainty about job security.  This is a difficult environment to work in and I am being proactive.  I have had multiple opportunities for career growth and development during the last nine years and with the lean processes implemented within the last year my job responsibilities have changed considerably."
good,"It was a great opportunity, but you have to be ready to embrace the learning culture in order to make it. If you don't like making phone calls to generate leads then this is not for you.  If you a hustle mentality and are willing to go the extra mile for about 2 years, then you'll do great."
good,"Great people doing great work to help clients identify and achieve their financial security goals. Proactive strategy, driving innovation to provide the experience people want and deserve."
good,"It's a very good job if you want to work for commission.  The company is very trustworthy and valued.  There is job security.  Co-workers are very valuable to provide support.  "
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a fantastic company. They have an excellent corporate structure and really value putting the customer first, which I feel is rare from a company this size a lot of times. As a company I really value their integrity. The only drawback I had while working there is that advisors with NM are only paid on sales commission. This probably works for some people but it takes 3 or 4 months to really get established and I had to leave because I didn't have the ability to wait that long before really making money."
good,"The opportunity is there and the benefits are wonderful.They take part in providing free lunch to all of their employees, connecting them with their own credit union, and they have their own health services on campus. The company culture is a bit old school and can get stuffy at times."
good,"it was a great place to work, great work environment, fortune 500 company, but in the end of the day commission sales just wasn't for me"
good,"If you are going to work in this industry, this is the company to do it with. They expect results, but they give you all of the necessary tools. It can take a great deal out of you if you aren't prepared for the endless phone calls and rejections."
good,Possibly the best career for certain individuals but very difficult to make it in the first few years. Great career but wasn't for me
good,"Though this was a temporary job until we moved from IL to AZ, I was able to pick up the responsibilities quickly and perform the job without any micro-managing. "
good,"Day to day I would input data for the company as well as complete any tasks asked of me by other coworkers. I was the assistant and basically did whatever was needed around the office. I would answer phones, file, make billing books, take notes during meetings, and run errands."
good,"My internship at Northwestern Mutual in Charlotte NC provided wonderful training and tools.  Productivity was entirely up to each individual financial advisor.  The more you prospected, networked, and dialed, the more meetings you would set which would ultimately result in more sales.  I was among the top 3 interns out of a class of 14 and I was aggressively recruited for a full time position. I acquired great experience from this role, but I want to transition to a role that is salary based instead of commission."
good,"A typical day for me included answering numerous emails and phone calls from both clients and representatives. I learned to manage my time well, as my day was constantly interrupted by client phone calls. The most challenging part of my job was keeping up with the constantly changing work environment, as staff members were not given a lot of warning. The most rewarding part of my job was being able to make a positive impact on the lives of clients who called out of desperation; they often thought they were out of options with their policies and I really enjoyed being able to find a solution for them and help ease their situation."
good,I enjoyed the 9 years that I worked there.  I got to know a lot of good life agents and like the Northwestern products.  Their hours were flexible and there was a lot of autonomy.
good,This is a great career path if you are the right age and have the correct natural market. If you are looking to sell the best insurance products this company will be great for you.
good,A typical day starts out posting and planning. Next is 40 phone calls to prospective clients. The rest of the day is meeting with people or trying to meet with people. Once in front of people it is understanding what they currently have in place and future goals and objectives they have. The second meeting with a individual is going over a financial planning analysis that we create for them. The third meeting is trying to sell them products to implement into their financial plan. Every time you meet with someone the goal is to get 3 new names and numbers of people to call on.
good,"*Commission based"
good,Major Fortune 500 Company. Great corporate culture in a fast paced environment. Work centers around daily phoning session to set up a weekly quota for meetings. Job is heavily expected to produce ongoing new clients while meeting continual education requirements which merit contractor to sell more complex financial products.
good,Excellent  if you can manage to set up 25 appointments a week and you are interested in different people.
good,I learned valuable communication skills.  A typical day of work consisted of multiple meetings and 40 to 50 phone calls.
good,It was a great bridge opertunity for me to get into a feild related to my major.
good,Always changing work environment with great management and services that are provided.
good,"I think this is a wonderful company to work for. They are a supportive team all along the way. They have teams dedicated to guiding you along the way. So much to learn, and if you are passionate about what you are doing, you will get it all with their learning program."
good,Great opportunity and would like to continue here unless I receive a offer I cannot refuse.
good,"It is a good career for whom is good at sales. Northwestern Mutual is a strong insurance and investment company to work for, but once again, you have to be really patient with that career to be able to succeed."
good,I really enjoyed this line of work as I could really make things happen on my own time. Not a whole lot of pressure to make things happen from upper management.
good,The agents are knowledgable and many of the people are friendly.
good,"- Prospecting potential clients"
good,"A typical day at Northwestern start early morning reviewing the appointments and meetings of the day, making sure everything is in order and organized. After that, I used to collect the folders for the prospect clients and started conducting the researchs, this was a fast pace environment and basically every job had a short deadline, but the co-workers were very helpful and team work was very important in order to meet the deadlines."
good,"A truly wonderful opportunity, the internship program provided me with unparalleled exposure to life lessons in the financial services industry. I was fortunate enough to have worked closely with some of the top financial representatives and advisors in the company. There was never a time during which I was alone in any challenge, and the mentorship with which I was provided encouraged me in more ways than one. "
good,Great place to Intern.  Learned a lot and made some great friends
good,Great company with great products. This company pushed me to understand the potential that one can accomplish with hard work.
good,"Typically, I start the day by answering emails and messages from clients, co-workers, home office and my employer. I prep all the cases for the following day with whatever was case noted from a previous meeting, followed by phoning for appointments to fill up my employers calendar. "
good,"In general, Northwestern Mutual is an excellent place to work. They provide you with all the tools and resources to be a successful financial representative. The management team is made up of industry professionals with good teaching and instructing skills. The hardest part of the job is learning the different financial products and building your cliental base. The most enjoyable part is the opportunity to meet and help clients plan for their future financial goals."
good,"Very challenging program. Focused on heavy training and mentoring, but did not shy away from exposing interns to the real world and creating a successful business. Great for those seeking an opportunity to grow their own business."
good,"Good internship, learned a lot. Called potential clients, set up meetings, meet with clients and present cases."
good,"There was a strong emphasis on integrity.  The management seemed like fair minded people.  I worked on a part-time basis in a regional office in Springfield, MA."
good,Overall I had a great experience working for this company. They offered a flexible work/life balance for a young college student. I recommend their internship.
good,"You will not find a better culture than Northwestern Mutual - Colorado Springs. Each Financial Representative owns their own business, so finding an appropriate team to work for is key. Your lifestyle will often match up with your employers which creates a wonderful place to work."
good,"The biggest thing I took away from this career was that personal fulfillment matters to me more than most things. I had an idea of that about myself, but I didn't realize just how much it mattered to me. To make such a difference in people's lives was something I lived for once I had a taste of it. I was invited to weddings of people I previously never knew. I was sent pictures of couple's babies who I started college funds for. It meant the world to be part of that for people from all walks of life."
good,"Great company, the business is not for everyone because of commission and difficulty of sales. But if you are going to 40+ hours into a company, make it this one"
good,As a financial company you would think they would have individuals starting out in a 100% commission career. That’s is the main fact of why there turn around is so high. Very hard to live and pay bills unless you are using your personal savings or other finances.
good,"it's up to you, but they are open to advancing you.  you can work for several different reps or just one.  the people are uplifting and it isn't cut throat because you can do as little or a much work as you want depending on who you work for.  was happy working there."
good,"This was my first job in the finance field and it was the determining factor for me to transition my career into finance. I enjoyed working here, but your success is largely depended upon who who know."
good,"It was difficult to get peers or clients to want to discuss additional insurance products however, it was very apparent why these products mattered in the long run. This was a career opportunity, but one for someone who is very self-driven and determined."
good,"Go to work in the morning, sit down, start working, talk to the boss about what we are doing for the day/week. then prep for the meetings coming up. Pepper in administrative work while putting out small fires that accumulate from doing 20+ meetings a week and having hundreds of clients that could reach out with random tasks (repeat weekly). Rarely a day that you come in with focus to finish a task and do not get derailed by other tasks, boss requests, coworkers, or other office bros. Work/Life was solid but taking time off was tough because the work accumulates and is waiting for you when you get back. Work ebbs and flows based on boss vacation and production at the time. Quiet and relaxing job when boss is on vacation (when you play catch up) but taxing and somewhat chaotic/unorganized when busy. Boss was cool and supportive for the most part, other coworkers were cool/fun or frustrating depending on mood they were in. Overall Job and boss/coworkers were good, but the grind is real and most of the time will be spent playing catch up or doing one off admin work. FYI there was basically no training so be prepared to learn most tasks yourself or with a call to home office."
good,"Work hours are created by you granting as much free time as needed. "
good,"Working at the Philadelphia branch office is very exciting and beneficial. The office culture is very inclusive and encourages all of it's members to participate in a friendly, work hard/ play hard atmosphere. However, the job is relatively harder than the ads make it seems. Most interns do not make much money due to the difficult nature of the job. Potential employees need to be comfortable with calling their friends and family and try to sell them insurance/ financial planning. It is much more difficult than advertised. However, you learn a lot of information, especially in the softer skills of business, such as how to network and talk to clients. They train their employees substantially, which makes the office a solid place to start a career."
good,"I worked by myself with little to no human contact. I never felt like I belonged.  I tried to have conversations with others but because I wasn't in an area with many people, we didn't get the opportunity to get to know one another."
good,"Overall good company to work for with great advancement opportunity in a number of areas.  Only thing that was lacking was extensive sales training for those who may have financial skills, but lack some of the sales-oriented background."
good,"All compensation is based on commission and bonuses so the stress level in the office was above average. The people who worked there are kind, encouraging, and always looking for ways to help each other night. Each week there were multiple staff bonding events, birthday emails, and free food."
good,"Good place to work right out of college "
good,"Great company. Your success falls upon who you know, as with anything in life. Great opportunity, great people. Take advantage of people around you that are successful and learn from them."
good,"Enjoyed the internship program, however at a young age it was hard to onboard clients who do not necessarily need the services. Great motivators and team culture."
good,I enjoy working at Northwestern Mutual. The company culture is great. The hardest part of the job is bringing in new clients because they are based off of referrals. If you don't have a large network of people do not pursue this job.
good,It is a nice peaceful working environment  . If someone wants to retire after working at one company then this the place. Benefits are good and they have an awesome free lunch.
good,"Like running your own business."
good,"This industry is exactly what you'd think, insurance, financials and planning. It's lucrative, competitive, difficult, exhilarating and thought provoking. Not for the faint of heart or for lazy people. Loved my time here and would recommend to anyone that wants a career in growth, development and sales. Most people fire themselves before a ""manager"" does. If you don't know how to grind and give up some of your life for success then this is not for you."
good,"The overall culture is very positive and the work day is dependent on your role. The movement toward a digital transformation and an agile mindset has created a plethora of opportunities to show off your technical chops. The management is quick paced and brings a demanding result driven atmosphere. "
good,"I worked with Northwestern Mutual as a college intern. It was very fun, provided a significant challenge, and forced you out of your comfort zone. They provided comprehensive tools to help advise client's financial goals."
good,"- It is a sales based industry but everyone in the office is very supportive and most work well together in meeting individual goals! "
good,"This job is not for everyone, you have to be willing to call on your family and friends to try and sell them insurance.  As an intern the full time reps jump on your leads so be prepared for that."
good,"I enjoyed the people and the job. However, holding a 100% commission job right out of college was not in my deck of cards at the time. If someone is in the right place financially I would recommend."
good,There is no way to be Financial Rep if you have no to little contacts. They did not tell us that we would have to pay twice the tax since we were considered self-employed.
good,It was a good place to work. I made a lot of friends their and continue to love the people. It is a difficult job and requires self motivation and good connections
good,"A typical day involves getting to work by 7:30 morning includes guided meetings and cold calling.  Lunch time and beyond is set aside for meetings, preparing docs, and more calling.  We had to manage and grow our own business.  100% commission job.  Helping people reach their personal and financial goals was my favorite part of the job."
good,While working at Northwestern the culture and people in the business were easy to get along with and were all great people. However the internship requires you to do a lot of cold calling and to call family members for sales.
good,Very welcoming company. Extremely customer driven. They stand by and uphold their company’s goals and mission by providing in depth personalized insurance plans to fits clients individual needs.
good,"Northwestern Mutual has one of the best cultures I have ever been a part of. While the start up is hard work, this job is perfect for those who have an entrepreneurial spirit and are self-starters."
good,"I enjoyed working at Northwestern Mutual.  I spent just over 4 years there.  The people and culture are great."
good,"The 3 decades that I have spent as a Financial Representative at Northwestern Mutual have taught me the value of taking personal responsibility for meeting goals and achieving timely results. Due to my organizational skills, I work best in a highly-structured organization."
good,"Although it wasn't quite the right fit for me, the skills I learned at Northwestern Mutual will stick with me throughout my professional, financial, and personal life."
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a great first experience into a career of corporate America.  It gives its interns the opportunity to learn the ins and outs of the insurance industry, and grow professionally as a career-driven employee."
good,"Since each financial advisor is an independent contractor what you are paid and benefits vary team to team. You could make much much more working for one advisor doing the same amount of work compared to another. Working for the agency is not desirable as agency employees are overworked and underpaid for what they do. There is a cap on what you can go to within a specific team or within the agency, great entry level starting point."
good,Everyone can do this job but it is not for everyone. You have to be motivated to make your own business and essentially you must really enjoy sales. This isn't the most analytical job but rather and sales job. You will be asked to call all your closest friends and family to help build your client base. If this makes you uncomfortable than this probably isn't the job for you. I think it's a good company with good intentions but it's just the nature of this business to have to stay on the phone and call asking for meetings.
good,I like the temp position once job was offered to me I had found something else.  I liked working there but was looking for something a little closers to bus rides.
good,"Very competitive internship. Gained great networking and business experience. The branch in Wellesley MA is a great place to work, with great people and management."
good,"A typical day at work involves calling 25-40 prospective clients to set meetings with them, attending a few all office meetings as well as any client meetings you have set for that day. The worst part of the job is getting references, you basically milk your friends and family for every contact that they know because it's against company policy to contact people you haven't been referred to. Your goal as a financial rep for a great insurance company is to save families when the worst happens. So from an ethics standpoint, the hundreds of people you bother with never ending phone calls are recompensed by the children who get to go to college because of you. Despite the good that you get the chance to do, an overwhelming majority of people will believe that you are a scam artist."
good,Hardest part of the job is work/home life balance. The most enjoyable part is working with the clients and providing long term solutions for their retirement.  I enjoy the long term relationships that evolve.
good,"NWM was a great place to gain experience. the people and other staff were nice and helpful. however, because you are mostly paid by your advisor, your compensation depends on what how well they do, and what they can afford to pay."
good,"Best part of the job is hearing people's stories"
good,"I really learned alot about the insurance industry working with NM.  I made great friends there that really made it a fun place to work. The management was laid back, and very easy and flexible to work with"
good,"Great internship opportunities, and a great job to have if you are well connected to people that have money and are responsible with spending it and saving for retirement."
good,I had a temporary position but enjoyed it very much. Learned a lot regarding the insurance industry. Co workers were great and very helpful.  I would recommend this office highly.
good,"Good opportunity for me if I was coming out of College.  Wrong Place at my current Career timetable.  Enjoyed the work, but needed more pay at the time of my life consistently."
good,Great Company to work for. The training program is one of the best in the nation and it truly prepares you for a career in the financial advisor industry.
good,It was decent. Insurance is a tough business. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone who isn't willing to work extremely hard or that doesn't want to push family and friends to buy insurance.
good,"Great Atmosphere, great people, difficult job, difficult income stability. If you want to spend more time focusing on building clients than actually helping people, this is the way to go. Took me two months to even get a customer due to training and lack of people willing to protect their lives and secure their loved ones financially."
good,"As the title said, this internship position allows you to test-drive a career as a financial advisor and gives you meaningful real world experience therein. Looks good on the resume, too. Hard to get compensated real well, though (purely commission-based), for the amount of work you put in."
good,"Relaxed, but busy.  Lots of paperwork but enjoyed working with different clients.  The home office provided excellent support.  All the employees are friendly and helpful."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Northwestern Mutual, because they care about their employees. They show this by offering free lunch everyday! I always looked forward to the amazing food that they would prepare for us everyday. It was definitely a perk of the job."
good,"At Northwestern Mutual, I experienced an environment where I could always ask for help no matter the circumstance. That is one of their core values is helping people within their company succeed to their fullest potential."
good,"- Amazing people "
good,"I respected this company a great deal, and enjoyed my short time working here. Employees were respectful, personable, and enjoyable to work with. Very professional atmosphere."
good,"If you are interested in financial planning and finance, Northwestern Mutual is a great place to start. If you are not looking to be a financial advisor, Northwestern Mutual may have limited options for career advancement and"
good,Call on close friends and family. Money is what you can make out of it. If you don't produce you don't earn. Sell a lot of Life insurance. That is the key to success.
good,"This is a great place to work to get started and learn the financial services industry."
good,"Large company, change does move slowly.  Rapid organization change in the last few years. The people that work at NM are the best part about working there."
good,"Northwestern Mutual provides the opportunity to control your own destination. You control your practice as an individual business, with complete flexibility. Must be prepared to hunt and work hard, but if done right can be extremely rewarding."
good,"it is a sales job, but you can make your own schedule, risk management focus. Must be disciplined in order to succeed. Decent culture, help each other out for the most part."
good,This job has allowed me to have a great work life balance. They are very good at selling you on the job. It has lots of great benefits but it can be along time before pay comes in.
good,"Generally a good place to work however culture has been strained lately by layoffs.  Still offers the famous free lunch and other amenities like credit union, health clinic and gym."
good,"An internship with Northwestern Mutual gives you a first hand look at what it is like to full time salesperson. It gives you a chance to try the position out and see if you fit the role. Overall, it was a good learning experience."
good,The people make everything in a company and at NM the people are great. The people at NM are currently undergoing a lot of change and as a result everyone is a bit concerned
good,NM is a good company to work for. Job work and life balanced is good. Benefits are good for an employee. I got to learn new thing technologies. Free lunch was of the benefits.
good,"I really enjoy the culture at Northwestern Mutual, It truly makes you feel at home. The support from mentors and senior leadership is world class.  Keep it up NWM"
good,"Your day starts whenever you choose to arrive, though the office culture typically stipulates 9:00 am. You get out what you put in, so in essence, if your in early and you're making phone calls and setting up appointments with potential clients it's bound to pay off. Compensation is commission based so it behooves you to put in the work."
good,"I am a Web/WAS admin in our Command Center. I handle monitoring, incident resolution, and problem investigation for our front end web servers as well as our websphere environment. I feel proud to work for a company that has such a great reputation for how it treats its employees."
good,"A typical work day includes preparation for the day, making a minimum of 40 calls to prospective clients, meeting new people each day, and creating financial plans. Employees will learn how to effectively manage their time and will learn all about finance. Management is helpful and encouraging. Many of the other advisors are approachable and want you to succeed. Depending on location, the culture in the workplace is that everyone wants to be as financially successful as possible, so coming in early and staying late is highly encouraged. The hardest part of the job is overcoming objections and earning referrals. The most enjoyable part of the job is having a positive impact on the lives of your clients, and helping people succeed financially."
good,"My day starts with standup and then into the meetings, offshore calls. Team work is highly values in the team,Also deliverables are set for each sprint and are achieved. Overall goal is planned ahead and are coordinated between multiple teams."
good,An enjoyable place to work where you get the opportunity to expand your skill sets in a friendly environment that welcomes fresh ideas whether you're a contractor or employee.
good,"I work in most visible project because it's NM website."
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a good place to work overall, especially in the struggling Milwaukee market. They have a great work/home balance, which is nice when you have a family. They encourage a diverse workforce and have a very positive impact on the local community. Other benefits include tuition re-reimbursement, adoption assistance and onsite healthcare."
good,"Great company to learn a lot about insurance and investment, enhance your sales and networking skills. Company is not responsible for making sure advisors pay the benefits they promised their assistants when signing the contract, which can lower its reputation and image."
good,"All Commission and while the rates are good, it is tough to get going. Need to rely on family and friends to get started, which can be awkward when starting up."
good,"NWM was a fun work environment. Although the work was somewhat difficult, the atmosphere kept the employees going. We also had various speakers come in to further motivate us."
good,"This is a decent company which exhibits average levels of advancement."
good,"The day begins with printing out company mail of the prior day's submissions and distributed to various financial reps and their associates. Submissions for input are given throughout the day ending at 4pm. I learned that flexibility is a key factor in working with people and satisfying the needs of the client. Working as a team is important because the desired goal, which is having a satisfied client, is achieved in an timely and professional manner. Having satisfied clients is the most enjoyable part of the job. The client's satisfaction will cause the people they know to want to do business with this company."
good,"Overall, working for Northwestern Mutual was great. Obviously as a Financial Representative it is a very time consuming job, but they train you well and treat you like a professional from the first day."
good,"Northwestern Mutual Life is a supportive and productive workplace that pushes for hard work, quality of life, accountability and teamwork. Managers and long time members take pride in professionalism and intentional training."
good,"Northwestern Mutuals internship program is definetly one of the best. They treat their interns with great respect and strive to push you to become great within the field. There are many skills that you acquire throughout the process such as marketing and sales tactics and a general run-down of the industry."
good,Great opportunity for anyone willing to put in the work.  Do the activity they recommend and you'll be successful.  Very ethical company with the highest quality products in the marketplace.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was achieving success and being recognized for it. This is a great company that prides themselves in being leaders of the industry.
good,During my short time at Northwestern Mutual I learned a great deal about the business and operations. I have gained much experience during my time and can see my own growth as a professional in the Financial Services Industry. Northwestern Mutual is insurance based financial advising which is a tough sell for someone that starts off with a warm market that on average is younger than 30 years old. The company does do well with continued educational meetings and motivational meetings. Lots of support from peers within the office.
good,"Typical day... (fluctuates as I make my own schedule)"
good,"Wonderful office environment and structure.  Absolute freedom in regards to your schedule and work/life balance.  Surrounded by experts in the field willing and eager to work with you to help you advance yourself in the marketplace.  Great support put in place in terms of growing your knowledge base, business, and financial support."
good,"Good job, but mainly dependent on the representative that you work for.  The Advisor I worked for really wanted me to progress and be a junior advisor.  You make what you are worth through sales.  The job is rewarding but can be a grind some days"
good,A great place to start learning about the financial industry. Very sales oriented culture and horizontal is difficult. Overall a great place to start out.
good,"My most recent position with Northwestern is rewarding and enjoyable. I report directly to a successful agent who actively challenges me and tries to get the best out of me on a daily basis. He is very receptive to my strengths, and is understanding and appreciative of my efforts and responsibilities. The office has a very laid-back culture with each agent free to run their own practice as they see fit. In particular, my agent is expanding his investment practice and will often defer to me on matters of operation and business execution. I am afforded the guidance to work toward our collective goal of a successful practice while also having the freedom to utilize my skills and expertise to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of my job functions."
good,"Demanding, yet rewarding. Top notch management. Hardest part is not knowing when you will be compensated."
good,Working at North Western Mutual  was a fun start as my freshmen  threw  the beginning of my senior year was ending. I really loved the work station.
good,"Northwestern was a great place to work and gain experience.  Downside, there were limited opportunities as far as moving up after a few years.  Overall a good experience."
good,"Work started early with a meeting with leadership to check on goals which we set the day before. always checking progress. Management was very helpful and always willing to work with you, same for co-workers. the hardest part of the job was reaching out to new clients and to keep filling your phone book with good prospective leads. most enjoyable part of the job was defiantly being able to help people secure their financial goals and future."
good,"Having gone through te training and seeing how the daily ins and outs of the company run, it s a great employer if you are able to save up to 6 months of you normal income or income you are use to living off of.  Hard work, but you benefit from it far beyond what you expect."
good,"Best insurance company to work for."
good,"Hunt, hunt, hunt!  Great company culture and excellent learning experience for any entrepreneur.  Performing the tasks that most people won't do in order to live the life that most can only dream about.  Survive and you will be rewarded each year with residual income.  One of the bests financial rep contracts in the business.  Win, Lose, or Draw you will emerge a better, smarter, and efficient business person."
good,Northwestern Mutual is one of the top companies in its industry. They care about their clients and their employees. The environment was enjoyable and there is room for growth if you have the drive and determination.
good,Definitely all work (hard) no play for a while. You are your own boss so you are wearing several hats at once unless you have the capital to hire staff immediately. Great culture and training but unless you have business management skills you can possibly implement important business running factors when its too late. Its a learn while gaining experience type of job yet you still need to meet certain quotas. So if your eggs aren't aligned properly it can be a bad experience but you will still learn a lot. If your eggs are aligned properly it will be an excellent rewarding experience.
good,This was a really hard internship and job but worth every moment. I was able to get my life insurance agent license. The hardest part was balancing school with work. 
good,"I really enjoyed my time with Northwestern Mutual. Typical day consists of phoning prospects or clients, preparing documents, and meeting with prospects or clients. Management and senior representatives are always willing to help and give advise on how to become a better representative. For myself the hardest part of the job was keeping up with having people to call and making cold calls when I was out of referred prospects. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I was helping clients attain financial security."
good,"A typical day at work begins at a 7AM meeting with my mentor, followed by a 7:30AM group meeting to analyze and discuss both individual and team numbers for the previous week. Once this was completed, time was set aside for all emails, creation of phoning lists for prospective leads, and meeting with my sales and marketing teams. The majority of my day is spent on client meetings, both discovery where we get to know the short, mid, and long term goals of the client, as well as providing recommendations there after. Two hours of phoning for prospective leads is set aside daily. The goal is 5 new appointments booked per day, and 25 appointments scheduled for the current week, and 11 for the following."
good,"You are your own boss. No salary, 100% commission."
good,"The best way to sum my time with Northwestern Mutual would be to compare it to a swim or track team. While everyone is one the same team, you have to run your race, and win by yourself."
good,"My experience with Northwestern Mutual was a very positive one. They have high standards and always put the client first. It does appear that the managing of offices isn't always the best. There was too much letting unauthorized people taking too much control, at least in my office, but all in all a good company to work for."
good,"Must provide 100 people contact/prospect list "
good,"Very hard, but if you succeed great opportunity. I've learned discipline and how you need to give your best effort every day. I made mistakes early and I am still dealing with them now."
good,Meaningful work for community as well as myself. Making sure that the financial security of families are taken care when the passing of a family member occurs is top priority.
good,You will be driven by others in the office to do your absolute best. Everyone is motivated to be their best via different challenges and bonuses based on performance.
good,Everyone has a purpose at the company and everyone is very supportive of each other. The work being done is to benefit the clients which is something to look for in a company that works with peoples finances.
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a great place to work. Unfortunately my family relocated out of state and I had to resign, otherwise I could have seen myself celebrating 20 years with the company one day. Highly recommend!"
good,You get rewarded for you work very fairly. If you work hard and set up a good foundation this will be a fantastic place to work. If you are not a self-starter I would not recommend the financial advisor role.
good,I was an intern so only was there 1 day a week and it was all commission which is terrible and  they dont give you a book of business so it's all cold calling.
good,"Running your own practice is awesome, until it's not. NM is still commission -based life insurance sales, though we love to say we're planning.  I do believe I've helped people and our planning philosophy and software is excellent, however, I'm not in the right market to utilize it mainly. Young clients just don't have money and wealth to effectively build a great practice, and you really need to sell Permanent Life Insurance to survive, which really isn't the best thing for everyone."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of cold calling and meeting with clients. I learned many valuable skills but, most importantly, I learned the importance of time management and effective communication."
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a great company for individuals who have an entrepreneurial mindset, looking to build their own business regarding the financial advising of an individual's monetary-sponsored assets. This is an experience that is valuable to anyone considering an interest in the financial advising field. I gained a lot of insight into the industry myself and would like to thank everyone at Northwestern Mutual for giving me the chance. Even though I'm now pursuing a different financial industry field, I give my gratitude to the friends I've made at Northwestern Mutual who was willing to help no matter the concern along the way."
good,Only compensated through people you personally bring to the firm and purchase products. Very hard to get started but can turn into a good career. Great company culture but no immediate compensation.
good,"During my internship I spent time with clients attaining referrals to establish meetings; worked with advisors developing comprehensive financial plans. The advisors at the office went out of their way to help the interns learn the business. My managing director offered much need wisdom about life and work culture. The hardest part of the job was getting in contact with potential clients. However, Northwestern Mutual is not a 9-5 job giving employees leverage on the amount of time spent in the office."
good,"I enjoyed meeting face to face with prospective clients about their financial goals.  I was supposed to be a part of the summer internship program, but played summer baseball and missed most of the on-site training.  It was difficult to start from scratch after not receiving the training that happened in the summer"
good,The only downfall is that it's commission only. The upside is there is no cap on how much you can make. It is all determined by your productivity. It's very numbers driven which can sometimes be stressful.
good,"good energy, good culture, everyone is very young, work hard play hard. but it is very sales and money driven. not a bad job but need certain mindset. need to sell things to get paid"
good,Strict productive workplace. Cubicle environment with multitude of tasks. Great amenities provided to employees. Daily phone calls including cold calls required to maintain position. Parking is provided by the company.
good,"I had a wonderful time learning the insurance business.  The mentors were incredible. "
good,The job never truly ends. You wake up around 6 in the morning and you are either dialing or meeting with clients til about 8 at night. The hours are flexible but you really need to grind away in the beginning.
good,Walk into the office and surrounded by a great group of individuals who are all motivated and like minded. Everyone is very positive and wants to help people.
good,"Overall, I think this is a great fortune 100 company. The experiences you receive here will help you with your career moving forward. I would still recommend this job the right person."
good,"A typical day at Northwestern mutual was relatively eventful. Every morning we would start the day with our morning meetings, discussing the business and what is necessary in order to succeed in it. Then we would go into our individual accountability meetings  to set goals and review whether or not we were meeting our goals. Finally, after those meetings it was time for us to go into the field, making calls and setting meetings."
good,Northwestern Mutual is an amazing company that helps guide and foster new individuals through and experienced ones through a new experience of financial advising. They work on a relationship based approach and look to put the clients needs before all else!
good,You begin each day making at least 30 phone calls trying to schedule appointments. Be prepared to call a lot. Next you will go on your appointments with higher level associates to help you learn the business.
good,Working at Northwestern Mutual was the highlight of my career and I will always be grateful for the mentoring that is provided and for the training/coaching.  The culture of the organization is one of inclusion and success.
good,"The Mendota Heights office is one of the best in the country for interns and in the past few years has been top 5 and best twice. Working at Northwestern Mutual will require you to sell Life Insurance to people in your immediate network. It seems like you are pushing it on your family at first and if you can get past calling 50 people a day, this career will be for you. The environment is all about professional development and many of the skills I learned were not about personal finance, but rather how to keep a schedule, communicate professionally and effectively, and how to be a self motivator to accomplish goals."
good,"It was a good experience working at North western mutual. Have good exposure to various latest technologies like sauce labs, Gitlab CI/CD integrations"
good,Northwestern <mutual tiene un buen producto pero la sucursal adonde trabaje tiene una cultura muy mala.
good,Northwestern Mutual is an amazing company. I would without a doubt recommend  people to work there. The culture and atmosphere at the office I was which was coral gables was amazing. The thing that was hard for me was the fact you had to collect names from friends and family in order to go out and sell. On top of that you had to go out with a senior advisor and split commission on everything in your first year. I drove around a lot and didn’t close anything in my first three months. If you have lots of money saved up then go for it because you can make a lot of money. If you don’t I would not advise you take this job.
good,"This job was very tough. It is 100% commission so if you are not making 50 dials a day, you will most likely not get paid. If there was salary plus commission it would be much better."
good,Leadership is energetic and fun. They work hard and play hard. Excellent attention to detail and care for clients and staff. Philanthropic opportunities are encouraged
good,"This first step to gaining a potential client is meeting with them in their home or over lunch. It is important to build rapport and make them feel cimfortable. The more relaxed they are, the easier it is to discuss business and see how the collaboration best fits. I enjoyed these meetings and like to think that clients and people I met with felt comfortable around myself."
good,"It was the push I needed, but did not suite me, it was a commission based job, but I learned a whole lot! The staff was very helpful and supported all of my decisions"
good,"Solid job. Make own schedule, and a good training program. Must be able to ask friends and family to give you their money. Only commission. Overall, solid job."
good,"There is so much to learn in the space of personal finance, with Northwestern Mutual they gave me a format to digest investment vehicles, budgeting, fund prioritizing, fund allocation, tax efficiency,  and that's only the surface. The bulk of the job included getting the largest number of contacts, referrals, and meetings. Which were my most and least enjoyable parts of the job."
good,"attend meetings, work on ICRM reports and upload documents on sharepoint, worked as part of team , Job was not hard it was something that i enjoyed doing."
good,"Nashville office really pursues comprehensive planning. Start with insurance then add in assets the more experienced you get and the more clients you bring on. "
good,"got along with everyone in the office right away, solid competitive nature amongst everyone. Learned a lot about life and health insurance through interactive workshops during the internship."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Northwestern mutual. When I left the culture was in the process of changing.  However, the company had many employees that had been in their positions for 15 plus years that were there to collect their check and go home.   Great place if you're one of those folks."
good,"Taught me a lot about the sales process and time management. After getting the Life and Health producer licences and a week of education about the position, they send you out to the wolves with a sales quota so it's up to you how well you perform and succeed."
good,"Being an advisor is a tough job but if you can stick it out you will be wildly successful"
good,good company. I liked the company a lot. Free lunch and friendly employees. Lots of training available even for the consultant. Management very open to talk to everybody
good,Great company to start at. Their internship program is top notch and really gives you the skills needed to be successful in any sales driven position.
good,Northwestern Mutual is a great place to work. They hired me to be a contract consultant and I believe would have moved forward with me if it was a position I wanted.
good,Excellent company to work at as a young professional. A Fortune 100 company that is a leader the financial services industry. Offering wide variety of services to help you achieve your financial goals.
good,Working at Northwestern Mutual took a great deal of learning and training.  We sold an array of insurance packages that targeted specific clients based on their incomes and retirement expectations.
good,It was an extremely informative internship. If you are passionate and have a drive for learning finance this might be the perfect internship to get started.
good,This is a great place to work with a lot of opportunity.  The training was exceptional and what I know now compared to when I started is literally night and day. I am very happy I wok here.
good,I only worked at NWM during my paid internship for about 10 months while I was in college. I learned how to manage my own book of business and build clientele from the ground up.
good,"Gaining great networking and business experience. Enhancing my knowledge of risk and monetary management. Develop my own market of potential clients, phone prospects for appointments, meet with them to analyze financial planning and recommend financial products and services based on their needs and goals, such as life insurance and investment products while providing ongoing client service beyond the sale."
good,"This internship was one where I learned a lot about myself as far as balancing work, school, and personal life.  With weekly meetings, we were able to start our days off with goals and keep each other on our toes with competitions."
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a well established, well respected company with over 150 years of history. A life insurance company in the beginning, they expanded to include financial advisory services in the 1920's and currently have over $138 Billion is assets."
good,"Analyzed financial information obtained from clients to determine strategies for meeting clients' financial objectives. Reviewed clients accounts and results regularly to determined whether life changes, economic developments or financial performance indicated a need for a plan revision. Implemented financial planning recommendations."
good,"Able to work in the office or at home"
good,Northwestern was an exciting atmosphere that gave individuals the chance to rise beyond expectations. I really enjoyed my time there and if I would have followed through with it I believe it could have been incredibly beneficial.
good,Opportunity to build your own schedule and create your own success based on the amount of effort put into it. Perfect learning opportunity and chance to connect with business professionals.
good,Great place for Business students to get adjusted to what the real world is like. very demanding but worth it if you can hang in there.  Can easily make 100k after graduation.
good,good internship that allowed me to succeed in business. They do hire you without mentioning the main job description. I do not like how the internship is not paid.
good,"Commission only, tough to start with a family. If you’re ok with being commission only from day 1 then this is a great career for you. Can make 200k per year working 3-5 years"
good,"Manage your time well, learn to deal with difficult clients and be able to move on with a positive attitude even after hearing the word 'no' countless times. Cold calling means quotas need to be hit at the end of each month"
good,"The typical day varies greatly since every agent's schedule is left completely up to themselves. Personally, I would make dials in the morning as I tried to get in touch with referrals and other contacts, followed by meetings in the afternoon, and finally bookkeeping matters before I went home. "
good,"I very much enjoyed my time during the internship with Northwestern Mutual. They are very transparent in their communication, help a young individual learn what the financial planning industry is all about, and make sure they get the most of their people. I would recommend this opportunity to anyone who wants to know what running your own business and the sales environment is all about."
good,Good if you have the proper network. Not so good if not. They show you the compensation of the highest earning reps to lure you in and make it seem easily obtainable.
good,"Great experience- just make sure you are willing to work hard and strongly believe in whole life- If you can do those 2 things, you will be successful"
good,Northwestern is a great company to work for! You must make sure you meet the quota in order to keep your contract. They offer tons of training and support!
good,Honestly not the worst company to work for if insurance sales is for you. The people working at the office are nice enough but  at the same time the interns were under supported.
good,"I learned alot as this was my first job out of college."
good,"Thanks to this opportunity I learn how to work a double screen, answer multi-phone lines among other things. I really liked this job and the way it run."
good,Great Management and training. The basic aspect of the job is to set as many meetings as possible and conduct business through insurance and investment portfolios.
good,"Well, even though it was demanding and stressful; they did a great job of communicating, honoring, and appreciating their employees while building teams."
good,"Just a short internship but I enjoyed the experience. Very corporate environment, but lovely people to work with. I learned a lot about investment data."
good,"I was a summer intern and it was a great look into the competitive market of financial planning. It is a very competitive market that allows you to work as much or as little as you want. The more people you know the better, because they are your clients. The culture is like no other. Very motivating and able to be compensated very well."
good,The training and mentorship program that comes with this job is beyond great! You learn a lot on how to maintain a schedule and work with others. Also it is an opportunity to push has person into a leader. It is a go and get it position as you have to seek out clients on your own. You learn on to deal with the rejection but also build great relationships with your clients.
good,"The environment is fast paced and it is a role in which having a very strong network helps. The position was a sales role and it was a very competitive environment, in a positive way."
good,"Commission based sales executive in the field of Financial Management is not for everyone. It provides a great way of stepping out of one's comfort zone, and the firm does an excellent job of providing all the training one needs. But your success is entirely up to you, which works for some and not for others. The workplace culture is excellent-it is built around collaborative camaraderie, with a dash of competitiveness. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping clients manage their finances in a way that benefited them over the long-term. The least enjoyable part of the job was finding those clients."
good,Very professional business environment. It really prepares you for life in the business world and what it's like to be a young professional. I really enjoyed the people and how supportive everyone was.
good,I was a college student and learned a lot about sales which I did not want to pursue but is a great skill to have! No matter what you will have to learn how to sell in life.
good,"You earn what you pay because most of the bonus is linked to the commission. If you work hard, you can get a really good paid. I like the job because my manager is super nice."
good,"I'm an intern, so I can't speak too well on any of the other positions besides mine, but I liked everyone I work with! The office management does a great job at encouraging everyone"
good,Best insurance company in the business. Loves the people and atmosphere. Loved the products they sold. They treated their clients really well. Advisors were well trained.
good,You get in what you put out it is definitely not the easiest of careers to start off in especially being a young collage grad. However it can be done just got to break through the learning curve to see the real success.
good,"Interning at NMFN provided opportunities to not only learn about the insurance industry, but to connect with people in various circles as well.  The role required serious self-examination to determine your goals."
good,"Competitive work environment"
good,NML offers a variety of mini-environments within its corporation and is a fun place to work that caters to the employees. You feel like part of a team at NML.
good,"• Built tremendous relationships with clients and made them feel comfortable doing business with me and Northwestern Mutual."
good,The people were all great and I liked to learn from them and all the training they had availble. They also had an accountability team and supervisor and weekly meetings to help you thrive and stay on target. Do not work there if you are afraid of phone calls and asking people you know to buy from you.
good,Overall good experience. They put a lot of stress on you and there are constantly new people coming and going. Not for everyone. Sales job but there are learning oppurtunities
good,"Customer service calls were the largest part of the workday; answering questions about insurance policies, claims, etc."
good,Good place to work for certain personalities. Competitive job and it is a very slow start trying to build up a clientele but it can be good in a long term career.
good,"Has a great training program for new financial representative, room for advancement, a professional culture.  A company that delivers their promise to their clients."
good,"The job is solely dependent on your attitude and how hard you're willing to work. If you're sociable and are relatively intelligent, you'll do well at pioneer"
good,"Typical day is anything you want it to be. You have all day to call client referrals to set meetings or to attend the meetings you already have scheduled. You get out what you put into this job. In the beginning you really have to hustle and work hard on educating yourself and getting comfortable in front of people to grow your business. But if this a career you want to do the possibilities and rewards are endless. It is a commission based job so you have push yourself to get the outcome you desire. The entire office is welcoming and the management is awesome. They really value their internship program here and there are so many people willing to help you succeed and push you to your limits if that is what you desire. The whole office is like a big family and always motivating you to keep moving up. The great thing in this internship and job is the freedom to choose your own schedule. You are technically your own boss and can come and go as you please, however the more you are in the office the more likely you are to be successful."
good,"The company gives its employees all the tools to be successful, and explains how to be successful.  Great training program.  "
good,"It was a great insurance company to work for.  Their reputation is impeccable and if your looking to sell life/disability insurance this is the place to be.  There are plenty of opportunities for advancement if you put the work in an pass the right tests!!"
good,"Great company to grow.."
good,The company pays well and will always make money for its policyowners. It truly depends on what department you're in and who your manager is as to your job satisfaction. Culture is that you what you're told -- very methodical (finance/actuary - Type A) in their thinking which breeds success.
good,"You have to grind in this position to build a practice for yourself. Within the first three years you'll feel overworked and underpaid but after that once you keep sustained activity, you'll feel overpaid for the work you do and create an enormous flexibility with your job."
good,They have a great training program with lots of quality continuing education.  They have a great group of managers and senior advisers to help guide younger individuals.
good,Working in the field is great if you have the right boss. Opportunities for pay increase and promotion are limited in the field dependent on the size and scope of the practice.
good,The office culture is really great. Management really wants to see you excel in your position and will often hold weekly or monthly meetings to see how you are doing in your position
good,"Great Culture, awesome people.  Very upbeat atmosphere. "
good,"Financial work is not something I want to do in my future, but it has not at all made my experience negative.  Great staff, great work environment, great place to advance career if finance is the career for you."
good,"If you are looking for the best sales training NorthWestern Mutual 100% provides top notch sales program."
good,"Was a fun and tough job; ran cost basisis analysis for client's portfolio holdings; would conduct financial and insurance anaysis with clients to fund retirement, etc.; ran reports showing how client's portfolio holdings fared against the S&P 500 index"
good,Productive work environment with a emphasis on creating a clientele and to fulfill the customers needs financially. Great company with great leaders. 8/10.
good,"I was a marketing consultant -- a SAS Programmer/Analyst "" embedded"" in the Marketing Department (as opposed to being in the IS Department). I was a contractor for 3 years."
good,"NM takes the employee into consideration most of the time.  Great opportunities to advance once you get hired, but that is the hard part.  Managers are held accountable to give you a review each year and create a career path that you are held accountable to follow."
good,"Worked as a student intern during college. Decent atmosphere, had to get licensed to sell insurance which isn't as hard as you think. I felt like they used me solely for my contacts."
good,This career as a financial planner is what you make it. This requires a lot of cold calling and networking. Selling life insurance or wealth management can be very hard. You will be required to get multiple license.
good,"This was a typical insurance and investment small office. The daily  office tasks, taking phone call, setting appointments, data entry, process the mail ."
good,"Great job, great people, just not for everyone. Can be tough if you don't put time and effort into it. Good job to be secure if you last your first couple years"
good,This is a good company to learn additional work skills. The job is demanding as you are in a commission based sales position. Northwestern Mutual believes in investing in the development of it's statutory employees.
good,"This is a typical commission only job, so you get what ever you put in. However, training is top notch. You get all the tools you need to be successful and you receive great support when needed. All you need to do is ask."
good,I interned here and learned a lot. Now I'm just interested in looking for a new job but I'm trying to fill up the miminum characters in order to start looking.
good,"Day to day, the job entailed seeing people and fighting to see people. If you did that day in and day you, you would be extremely successful at this career."
good,"I typically was working on the digital filling system, this included any important client information or insurance policies. The workplace environment was professional, yet created a friendly and fun place to work."
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a very challenging place to work. Being out of your comfort zone is a challenging, yet rewarding experience. The products NWM offers are excellent."
good,Working at Northwestern Mutual will teach you all sorts of skills that will be very useful to you in the work world. I learned to to become more comfortable in meetings and presenting to clients. it also helps you learn how to think fast and work hard for a better pay off.
good,Management was nice but not my ideal place to work. Insurance business is a difficult sell and being so young did not help your chances when selling to a older crowd
good,"Completely marketing yourself and building your own clients from scratch, extremely difficult but can be rewarding. Environment is positive and motivating and helps as much as they can."
good,"I was an intern at NM for 6 months and could not get into selling life and health insurance, there were a lot of people in the office I worked in who were very successful, but you had to be okay with selling life and health to people."
good,"Being a financial rep at Northwestern Mutual is a great job for several reasons. First, the company is trusted and established in the industry. Second, there is a good compensation rate for sales. That being said, the work is hard and is almost 100% sales. One must be comfortable with calling people on the phone, meeting with them, and selling them insurance."
good,It was a great experience. I was introduced to the day to day duties of a full time financial advisor. Northwestern Mutual requires an extensive trainign program for its interns it is usually a 40 hours on boarding.
good,"They have a good culture but push interns to the limit, if you want to stay you need to put in about twice as much work as another internship. Great experience, and development program."
good,Northwestern prepares you with a great training program to help you understand the financial services industry. They really help you understand how to make a sale.
good,Fair work/life balance is good and the technology the company uses is very good. brand new building will make it even better.
good,would start off the day by calling prospective clients. Experience was overall very challenging but also rewarding. You get to have a hands on experience as a life insurance agent.
good,"Over my past 6 years at Northwestern Mutual, I have had many different and evolving roles.  I learned to be flexible, to multitask, and the ins and outs of financial planning."
good,Worked here as an intern. Completely commission based except for a $100 stipend per week. Took over a month to actually make any money. Stressful and unpredictable. Lots of a phone calling and prospecting. You will be expected to call all of your family and friends.
good,"Good work environment that gives you the resources to succeed, however, that is only half of the puzzle. There is a heavy reliance on your own friends and family to get you off the ground."
good,Phone people from 9-10 and meet people from 10-5 talking about peoples current financial plans and what can be recommended to help them be financially secure. The hardest part was setting meetings with people that didn't know you as well and getting introductions to new potential clients.The most enjoyable part was making a difference in someones financial future.
good,You call people everyday and try to go to as many meetings as possible.  I learned how to communicate better and how to work with others in a different setting.  The management was very nice and helpful.  It was a fun job to have and I would recommend it to others.
good,"Cant beat the free lunch. Seems most departments are sympathetic to life outside of work. Great benefits. Only worked as an intern, but my coworkers were great and everyone I met was helpful."
good,"Northwestern Mutual actively works to promote financial security for their clients. As a financial representative, I saw many ways in which management was actively working to help me succeed. My only complaint was that I felt overcompensated, and my production would never be enough - even in light of my excellent record."
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a great company, with a great culture. I enjoy helping others plan for their future, while developing great relationships. I would recommend Northwestern Mutual as a great workplace."
good,"Good place, challenging, innovative, IT helps drive the business forward.  Overall a strong company with lots of opportunity and growth!  A place where they value the employees."
good,Great place to work. Can be a very rewarding career if you have the ability and the drive to do it. there are many opsticles that come with this line of work
good,Overall it is a good place to work at. They provide great mentorship so I was able to learn quickly. An opportunity to improve the experience involving clients interaction.
good,I enjoyed the internship simply because I was actually doing what the salary members were doing as opposed of running errands.
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a strong company with a core group of management that will continue to carry it as a AAA rated firm.  It allowed for collaboration between co-workers and held everyone to high standards.  I enjoyed the challenge of establishing a marketing platform for a business that doesn't typically focus on such marketing efforts, and seeing the firm's numbers increase as a result of this was a rewarding feeling."
good,It is a good place to work. Requires you to be focused and competitive. Nice people work there who support and help you. Management is strict yet helpful. Hard to call lots of people everyday.
good,"I found that Northwestern Mutual is a very honest company and do take very good care of their clients. However, I do not feel that they really take too much care about their employees unless you are the top 3 producers of the firm. At least where I am at in the Capital area.  I am not sure how it is at other firms but the atmosphere was great for the most part.  But the support from upper management seemed to be lacking.  Overall, I understand.  To rid the company of the lower producers to make room for more, but that shows in the high attrition rate. "
good,Incredible fun work environment. Independent schedule. Hardest part was picking up the phone when you are in a slump and no one is answering.
good,I only worked at northwester mutual life insurace company as an intern for a little less than 2 month. As an intern the working environment is very sit back and relax.
good,"As a Financial Representative at Northwestern Mutual I met with individuals, families, and businesses in the Sacramento area and helped them mitigate risk, accumulate wealth, and plan long term."
good,"Learn a lot about the life/health/accident insurance industry"
good,"NM is a very professional, respectable company.  They put the needs of their clients first and offer excellent customer service."
good,"A great company to work with, that provided mentors to guide you on your personal practice. However, personal network does matter to an extent in order to build your practice."
good,"Working for Northwestern Mutual taught me how enjoyable as well as difficult running your own business can be.  Learning from senior representatives on a daily basis was imperative.  By learning and implementing the same methods from my peers helped with learning how to figure out the needs of our clients.  "
good,"A typical day of work was always a productive day.  I was a Receptionist/Marketing Assistant and I answered and averaged at least 50 calls a day answering clients questions and transferring the calls to the agents office.  I typed business correspondence letters for the agents.  I produced and printed out life insurance illustrations. General office duties of filing, faxing and processing the incoming and outgoing mail."
good,"As long as you have a long line of family connections you will do well in this culture. The training is what you would expect from a corporate environment and the office culture is fun, easy going as long as you get your meetings in."
good,great people and culture here.  Self motivated and commission based job.  This job is meant for outgoing people that are not afraid to call people
good,"Very phone call intensive"
good,"In this business, an environment can make all the difference in how you approach your self-driven business. The culture is very friendly and fun yet very competitive. A great balance of everything and definitely a lot of mentoring and help along the way"
good,"Performed day-to-day operational procedures for an investment and insurance practice. Job duties included processing investment accounts, providing reviews and analysis, processing insurance applications, maintaining compliance standards, and communicating with clients on related investment and insurance services issues, changes and products.  It was a great environment to learn and sharpen business professional skills; also good experience in creating and foster client relationships.  Developed strong understanding and application of the Sales Cycle and various analysis strategies."
good,great college internship with potential to move forward with this opportunity
good,It was cool learning about insurance and the importance at achieving financial stability.  It was an excellent experience and I'm very glad that I chose to do an internship with them.
good,A typical workday started at 7 a.m. with training and continued into calling prospective clients.  I learned the importance of making the most of your time at work and how to work well with a team.  The hardest part of my time at Northwestern Mutual was setting and executing meetings with prospective clients.  But after a few weeks it became easy and definitely the most rewarding.
good,Learned how to generate my own leads. I was able to meet some very successful people and gain insight of how they chose their career paths.
good,Great people. Learned a lot. Built many life long business connections.
good,Sales-y broey culture and if you're not sales you don't matter.
good,"Everyone here is pleasant and due to the nature of work, they are there at their own will."
good,"I maintained confidentiality of bank records and client information, answered questions regarding billing statements, and input client information."
good,Great place to learn sales and marketing for anyone.  The most difficult part of the job was staying in front of enough qualified people each day.
good,"Answer phones"
good,had the opportunity to lean alot about insurance work and had the opportunity to meet successful people.
good,"This is the hard life, It is a difficult job that is very time consuming. If you are looking to go into Insurance/Personal Finance business then this is the place to be, There is no better place to work."
good,Great place to get real world hard work experience and make some good money for the summer
good,"Financiall planning , meet with client identify their objectives and create a solution for then."
good,Work was typical sales duties however the training involved for the job was top notch. It was an internship however by no means were you just grabbing coffee. I had to start my own business and there were no leads given to me. An excellent eye opener for anyone planning on going into a sales field.
good,"Throughout my typical day I call individuals and ask for meetings to explain the process Northwestern Mutual follows and more about the company. Each day varies with how many meetings I hold, but in each I get to know the individuals on a more personal level. Finding out about their future goals, I ask questions, which can be tough, about the steps they have taken toward the goals. "
good,My goal was to grow my financial practice daily. To gain referrals from current clients. Call those referrals to schedule meetings. During first meeting to gather in depth information and gain trust quickly. Then in second meeting make recommendations on how to solve their financial goals. Then implement and service those clients. This was a 100% commission based job that I did for almost 10 years.
good,It was a great opportunity to learn the insurance trade. They trained us well and were very supportive. We had mentors that assisted us and goals that motivated us to do better.
good,"• Receptionist Duties"
good,"I was able to improve my communication skills during my classroom presentations to students. Also, during weekly phone calls with my supervisor, I was able talk about any problems that I was having and was able to collaborate with my supervisor to improve and work on those problems, and come up with a solution. "
good,I thought this was a really good real life experience and very good learning opportunity.
good,Good work environment but little to no advancement opportunities
good,"Fantastic co-workers, new management will require time to become more real world and less idealistic, textbook in dealing with employees."
good,"Your experience in NWM depends on the team you are working for, it is a very competitive company and expects you to be the same."
good,Great place to work. Would work there again. Great exposure and learning experience.
good,"As an intern at Northwestern Mutual (NMFN), I was quickly immersed into the life that an insurance agent lives. Passing the producer's life and health insurance exam allowed me to sell life and disability insurance products to clients that I sought out on my own. The genius of NMFN's business model is that it provides the training and mentoring of financial representatives, but then allows each representative to run his or her own business. Even as a lowly intern, I was given relative free rain to build my clientele packet and to earn my living the entrepreneurial way. My schedule was filled on my own accord, except for bi-weekly training and mentoring meetings, and I was forced to monitor myself while on the job. The drawbacks to this internship stem from the fact that NMFN is run by entrepreneurs that conduct business under a common name. As a junior in college, I struggled to dedicate myself to the challenge that is creating one's own business. All in all, I would recommend this internship or career path to anyone who is prepared to self motivate and create a business from the ground up."
good,The college station branch is very professional and an encouraging environment. I learned a lot about life insurance and annuities.
good,Environment was fast paced and challenging. Assisted with level 1 phone support with field representative. Follow protocol to trouble to accomplished first call resolution. Hardest part of the job is to constant changes. Enjoyable part is the vast knowledge and the free lunches.
good,"Working help desk is tough but there training is the best training I have been through for a single company, to have there employees ready to go out the door. They also have tons of support to complete the task you have."
good,The goals for sales are very high. The company is great and the pension is amazing. Lots of time spent on phone sales for life insurance. Lots of cold calling involved.
good,"Very hard, time-requiring job that demands the most from you. You have to start from the ground up, calling your friends and family then continuing to network out from there."
good,"This company is great for anyone who is self driven and willing to put the work in to get the reward. Growth is easy if you are determined, and the environment is so encouraging."
good,This job can be difficult to navigate through on a daily basis. The continued support from the associates and management made the difficult times seem a little calmer.
good,"-A typical day at work was phoning prospective clients to meet for an opportunity to learn how NWM can add value to their personal, professional, and financial goals."
good,"Throughout my career, I had the opportunity to experience a variety of roles. Management and overall compensation is based on who you work with and their growth.  Culture is positive, supportive, and based on great values."
good,"good place to work, friendly people-friendly nature and welcoming coworkers."
good,"Great starting position for someone who is interested in becoming a personal financial advisor in college. It is a very hard position as well, very dependent upon your own success and the work that you are willing to put in."
good,Great self driven positions. Be ready to work hard to gain the clientele needed to make traction to start getting a stable income. Ability to make lots and lots of money if you work hard and stick with it.
good,Great company with superior products and service. They really take the time to get to know their clients to help secure their financial well being. Highly recommend to anyone who is entrepreneurial and hard working.
good,There is a lot of opportunity at this company. Managers and fellow advisors all root for your success and openly share their personal methods of success with you. There are plenty of training programs and seminars that will help you become a better advisor. You need to be a self-starter and be able to work without pay as you build your own book of business.
good,"It is a good place to work but can be difficult depending on your position. Any of the ""adviser"" roles are difficult as you have to build your own client base."
good,Its alright nothing that really gets you moving every morning as you have to make your own meetings and basically run your own company with no experience
good,Fantastic work culture. Extremely tough company to work for but the culture is great and has a family feel to it. Made many great friends there and everyone is very supportive.
good,I enjoyed working here and learning how to carry myself professionally. The mentors here also taught me a lot about myself and helped me with my confidence.
good,"Your day centers around meeting with clients, building a financial plan for them and networking.The job is mainly sales, but if you like talking to people and finances it is a great place to work."
good,A typical workday consists of phoning and meeting with clients. Very flexible hours. Joint work is advised and helps getting stuff done. Overall great company culture.
good,Would give it a pass as here to apply for new jobs instead of providing feedback for current client employer. May come back later when it's time to move on.
good,This was a strictly sales job.  I enjoyed working at the company and they had some great people on their team.  This job was just not for me.  I did not have the desire to go out and recruit sales from my friends and family which hurt my chances to be successful.
good,"For the Northwestern Mutual internship, you are given a lot of freedom for the amount of work that you want to put into it. From Monday-Friday, you have a daily training meeting from 8am to 9:30am and then after that, you are in complete control of your schedule."
good,The job allowed you to create your own schedule which was really nice. I would on average have 3 meetings a day with clients. I would be on the phone for about an hour a day on top of meetings
good,"Still working through growing pains of becoming a more digitally-driven, planning-centric CX company. Have lost some talent in the past few years because of the churn."
good,Provided good working conditions and encouragement in Innovation. Best team work and helps in improving the skills and enhances the working conditions with smart and easy way of work
good,I would be required to go into the office once a week and each of those days I established a list of people I would call and I would talk to them to see if they were interested in learning more about the company and the different types of plans we could offer them.
good,"I loved working for the company and loved what they stand for. It is hard to start out in the job though with kids as you may not make much income right away. If you are the breadwinner, make sure you have about 6 months of savings before jumping on the opportunity."
good,"Amazing work environment. Provides exemplary training in the financial field. Success in the career is what you make it. Potential to earn high income, but job is completely commission based. Advancement in the career depends completely on your work ethic, but there are opportunities available. Company culture is great. You get to work with awesome people who are very skilled in the profession."
good,Northwestern Mutual has a great work environment and allows you build upon your entrepreneurship skills with their internship program by putting you in charge of your own financial advising business.
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a great place to gain sales experience though the internship program. As an intern you make phone calls, attend meetings, and network to grow a client base. You also get to make your own hours, which is pretty sweet."
good,"Outstanding ideas at work campaign that provides public speaking growth. suggestion, collaboration, improvement suggestions, testing, implementing improvements."
good,"Great place to work with great people, typical day involved acquiring clients and setting meetings. "
good,Fulfilling but not for someone that is not comfortable selling to friends and family. Cut throat culture! Some guys are not very accepting. Hardest part of job was commission only pay structure.
good,NM is a great company to work for. They are a company that you can grow with and they have helped me grow professionally. The people there welcome you with open arms and are always willing to lend a helping hand.
good,"They will pay for your licenses and marketing material but you are running your own business so if you don't work, you don't eat.  This is a pure commission position."
good,"A great place to work as a full time employee,excellent benefits and paid time off. Friendly management team willing to train you on any interest you desire."
good,Leadership at this firm was really good and therefore resulted in happier employees that worked hard everyday to achieve the office's common goal. A great culture and a reflection of great leadership.
good,"Working with the company is a serious win if you are a competitive, sales oriented person. There are great opportunities for advancement, excellent training, and top notch team members."
good,You are your own boss so if you aren't self driven or if you need to have a person telling you what to do this is not the job for you. The company is great and so are the people.
good,Be prepared to make calls to people you know with the end goal of selling life insurance. Can make a good career out of it but it is hard to succeed unless you give 100%.
good,If you get hired as financial representative you should go in with the awareness that all of the work you put into it is what you get out. You have to have a lot of self-motivation and accountability as well as an organized schedule. You are basically your own entrepreneur which means no cap with how much you can earn as well as how much you can lose as well. Overall it is a good experience for creating skills for work life balance!
good,"This is a unique job in that you work directly for a Financial Representative. There is a major corporate structure for support, but the advantage of a mom & pop element because your employment is direct. This can also be a disadvantage. I was fortunate to have a positive relationship with each Advisor who employed me. I learned an enormous amount as I was hired with zero knowledge of the Financial Industry. Not only did I become FL 2-15 licensed, but I made sure that I learned every detail that I could through my Advisor, client interactions, Industry documents and presentations. Associate Financial Representative is a great job for those who have integrity, passion for people and attention to detail. The workplace culture has a strong family element. The job requires multi-tasking, self-motivation, high levels of responsibility and a keen sense of management. The role I had was particularly demanding as I supported one of the top 50 Advisors in the nation. While the job has reliable elements that must occur in order to be successful, the daily work has spontaneity and the benefits of change. The most challenging element is also the most enjoyable aspect of the job: working with clients. Customer Service is loaded with unpredictability and a high level of demand. This creates a challenge that not all people can manage. For me it is the most favorable element because I absolutely love people."
good,"It is a very tough job to do, but can be very rewarding if you are willing to work hard. The bosses work with you but mainly leave you alone and let you do your own thing."
good,"Typical day included a morning briefing, followed by phoning and meeting with clients. Your schedule is as flexible as you make it. Management was helpful and always available to give advice or help resolve an issue."
good,"During my time with Northwestern Mutual, I experienced a very competitive environment.  However, it was not competitive in the sense that everyone thinks they are better but in the sense that we all pushed each other to do more and be the best we could be."
good,"NM offers many training class sessions to help you as a new employee to get on board quickly. You get a great work/life balance here. You can easily network with other employees in and out of your own team. They have great benefits, organizations, and volunteering opportunities. Best thing I love about NM is their Annual Meeting in the summer!"
good,"Northwestern Mutual has been a great company to work for. The office that I work in is full of great people that support your goals and career advancement. The environment is very open and inviting to employees at all stages in their careers. I am always very busy as I help three financial advisors run and operate their businesses, but we have a team oriented atmosphere. We work together in order to achieve our goals."
good,"The best thing about this job is that it provides a great idea of what the actual career is about. The internship is almost identical to what the full time financial advisors do in a day, but it has a lot of development programs built in with it."
good,Hard work and lots of training if you are new in the career. Otherwise it has unlimited potential. This job allows you to control you own salary and your own schedule. It can be tough for unmotivated people.
good,"Very New to the position that I was in and overwhelmed at first. Working 5 days a week wasn't ideal for my nursing school schedule. Otherwise, an easy desk job."
good,"Great upper management that really wants to watch you succeed in the business. The benefits of the job reflect the amount of effort you put into the job. You have certain benchmarks to reach, but are free to work at the pace you want with your own leads."
good,"Loved my time at Northwestern Mutual. The office I was at really promoted mentorship and further education and was extremely supportive in all things. Northwestern has historically been known for their Life Insurance products, however they have been moving more and more into financial planning, which was a great surprise to me. However, at the end of the day this role is a sales job based on moving insurance. Compensation is great if you work hard. If you don't, you wont be around long because you only eat what you kill."
good,I had a great experience while working at Northwestern Mutual. I believe that my skill set can be used more efficiently in a different career.
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a brilliant firm that focuses on delivering premium comprehensive financial plans to meet their clients needs.  The day to day consists of developing a clientele that trust and respect your financial advice.  Management is always there to support you when you are struggling and they provide expertise in regards to products and services.  Fast-paced, fun, and friendly environment with coworkers constantly working and collaborating together.  At the beginning you are in start-up mode and building your book of business; the most difficult part of the job is earning enough in the first few years.  However if you do well and stick it out you can build a financial planning practice that will last a lifetime and provide financial stability in a constantly changing job market.  The best parts of the job were meeting new people every day and being able to control your own schedule.  It is not a job for everyone, but if you have the dedication, drive, and ambition to make it work, you may just find the perfect career."
good,"One of the top financial services companies a representative can work for. Comprehensive and ongoing training, and generous home office support make the job much easier."
good,"- Very good company to work with "
good,"While at Northwestern Mutual, I always felt supported by my coworkers and managers. The culture is great and very helpful and available to assist you when you need help."
good,"The internship was a great experience because of the hands on learning. After getting the proper certifications there is in depth class work. Then the learning is switched to calling, prospecting, and speaking with clients on the field."
good,"My typical day starts off with confirming appointments, rescheduling if needed, updating my employers and accommodating the staff. Once my employer's schedule is set for the day and he knows where he needs to be and what he needs to do, I move onto the administrative work. I fill out all the paperwork, handle all the underwriting, create illustrations, answer emails, and resolve any and all client problems. At the end of the day, I continue to fill up my employer's calendar; the busier he is, the better his business, the happier we both are. "
good,Sales based position with good atmosphere and great co-workers. Liked ability to impact clients living and help them equip themselves for retirement objectives.
good,"Overall, my experience at this company was great. The staff and coworkers are all made up of people who are very friendly and driven to make a difference."
good,Northwestern Mutual embodies what a great corporate culture can contribute to the daily work environment.  A very conservative company which provides for great work life balance and stability.
good,"I worked for a rep of Northwestern Mutual. I helped maintain his office and reps under him. He paid for benefits which were good. However due to the economy, I was let go. Co workers and Management was great to work with. I enjoyed working with them, our customers and any other field rep. I have learned a lot about the process of 401k, mutual funds and life insurance as well as any additional admin roles."
good,A typical day consisted of meeting and speaking with new possible clients and providing them and their families the best financial security.
good,"It's been a long time since I worked at NML, now NM. However it was a company I wouldn't have left had I not been aggressively recruited. Very solid company, good leadership and impressive financial skills abroad."
good,You work with a team and have full access to resources. Management is very helpful and provides valuable insight. A typical day is filled with whatever you want to do. You make your own schedule and get out what you put in.
good,Good solid managent and training. Professional geowth in the area of financial services
good,I learned how to be a better business analyst working closely with another business analyst and a project manager also with a review team on the document deliverables.
good,"It is a great opportunity. You have to rely heavily on your warm market though. Sales cycle requires patience. You can be very successful though. I recommend the job to hard-working, dedicated individuals."
good,"You start out as a Financial Representative and they help you build your own business through the company while subsidizing your licenses, series 6, 7, life insurance etc. Definitely a work hard, play hard, environment. If you trust their system, you will be successful. But your salary is entirely dependent on you."
good,Northwestern Mutual is an intellectually stimulating place. You need to be a self-motivator to find success. You have the opportunity for an income and freedom found almost no where else.
good,"Whether as an adviser, working on an adviser's team, or at the Home Office, the culture is very positive and collaborative. Some teams have a better balance of work and life than others. There are a lot of opportunities to be recognized for achievements, almost to an arrogant fault."
good,"I may have a bit of a biased opinion only because I came into the business at such a young age. The opportunity this career can bring is unlimited. However, you HAVE to be willing to put yourself in uncomfortable situations. The older you are, the easier it will be because you will have built up more legit connections to call on when you start."
good,"A career as a financial representative with Northwestern Mutual is  very challenging. As the owner of your financial practice, you are very much a business owner. In that, you need to live and breathe your business in order to ""make it."" That means the first three years of the career you are over worked and under paid as you build your book of business. While the opportunity did not work out for me, it was a great 18 months and I would not trade back my time for the incredible experience and education I learned."
good,"Great place to work and premier employer in the Milwaukee area. Plenty of room to grow your skill set and ample development opportunities all-around. Supportive managers and knowledgeable teams. If you’re not used to corporate politics, siloed disciplines and working with a large, risk-adverse enterprise, consider if you’re up to it before applying. Change takes time, and there’s plenty of it needed to continue to be competitive."
good,"Overall, Northwestern Mutual is an extremely established company in which an employee can rest assured will never go out of business. On top of that security, each employee is given a fair chance to prove themselves and given the right tools for success. The benefits are substantial, with many leadership opportunities as well as company perks like gym access, getaways, sales coaching, and more."
good,"I loved my time there. What became a deal breaker was the lack of leads. You have to go find your own clients. If you have the personality for it, go for it. It's a great place, with a great culture."
good,I enjoyed the new opportunities to learn at this company.  They were very open to sending me to training and it was a very worthwhile venture to obtain my insurance license for this opportunity.
good,"Working for Northwestern Mutual is a different kind of experience. As an independent financial representative, you work with the company but have full control over your own schedule. You make your own calls to clients, hire your own staff, are responsible for setting your own meetings. You meet with clients to discuss wholistic financial planning and can impact their lives. It is a great opportunity for people who are disciplined and hard working."
good,"Great experience and education. Company culture is very friendly and pleasing. There is a lot of self-drive necessary to become successful, but it is very positive. Only downside is that there is no base salary; i.e. 100% commission."
good,"To start with, the most amazing part of this company is it does not let you feel like you are a employee. It feels like a family. Work is good and great seniors to guide. You feel you are in safe hands."
good,"They say being a contractor is the way to get in the organization. I truly hope so because I love the company, job, and people. The only reason i would leave is when my contract is either up or because as a contractor I get no paid holidays, vacation, etc. That can be hard when you have a family to support. Overall flexibility is amazing and management is great."
good,Right place to work for some people. It is tough career but can be very rewarding and you can be very successful. You will be making a lot of calls and working hard.
good,"You need to have a self starter mentality along with a lot of patience.  You also need to know how to take no for an answer, because nothing is more annoying than a financial rep who doesn't know how to take no for an answer."
good,"A typical day began with a meeting with our supervisor to review goals for that week. After that, we would phone until we set up the required amount of meetings. "
good,The company tell it how it is.  They will not make up ideas about what the workplace is like.  It is essentially a Sales job and you have the the ability to help people achieve financial success as well as make good money for yourself.
good,"This is a strictly commission job, but it can be very rewarding. The training and leadership is second to none. They truly care about your future, and they will go out of their way to help you out. "
good,We all create our own work schedule that fits with what we are trying to accomplish per week. The day consists of meeting with clients and maintaining relationships with current clientele. There is continuous education essential to be a beneficial financial adviser. The management is committed and supportive to the team members associated with the organization. There is a team atmosphere at the office. The most difficult part about the job is traveling to meet clients that may not even show up. At the end of the day it is worth the chance to change a life.
good,This is a career for self starters. You have to be able to create your own business or failure is inevitable. Cold calling and creating a pipeline is a must.
good,"Good working environment, fully professional. Co-workers are great and very friendly. Will teach at entry level hand to hand. To start career, one of the good companies."
good,Commission based. Start selling insurance then you move to investments and long term care. Significant amounts of commissions. People in the organization are very willing to help you out.
good,Working for northwestern gave me the experience that i had been looking for. There internship helped me understand what i want to do and understood my needs and wants!
good,"Work/Life balance is based on you. Production based pay so your hard work will be noticed. New office is really cool, too."
good,"It was a good place to work, plenty of opportunity for advancement, good benefits and perks.  Co-workers were great, the work atmosphere was professional and supportive."
good,"Northwestern Mutual has been a great environment to grow in. Your mentors pay close attention to you and offer any sort of help they can. Everyone pushes you to step outside your comfort zone and work on 'getting comfortable being uncomfortable'. Not only is it a great career opportunity long term, it is also such a great place to kick start your business and personal growth. You're rewarded for all of your efforts and there is no cap on the amount of success you can have!"
good,"Great company with decent opportunities for advancement. I learned about types of insurance policies and underwriting guidelines."
good,This internship was very helpful to me as it pushed me far out of my comfort zone. I learned that you can't always stay in your comfort zone to advance in this world. My job consisted of calling friends and family and other referrals to try to set a meeting with them to discuss the products that the company offers.
good,"A typical day at NM starts at approx. 7am with the day stretching for as long as you wish it to be. You have complete control of your schedule; after all, you manage your own business. "
good,My co workers are phenomenal and love to help out in any way. There is an incredible opportunity to grow a business and impact those around you. I have learned my limitations and what I know and do not. The hardest part of the job is getting out of your own way.
good,It is a great work environment and you learn a lot about the financial services industry.
good,I had many good coworkers in the office and learned a lot from them.
good,was a great place to work but management had to retire so no longer in buissnes
good,This is a great company with amazing core values.  The job is very difficult with an extremely low retention rate.  Great management and overall company.
good,The training was top notch. Training was comprehensive and gave me confidence in my career.
good,My experience with Northwestern was great. All my co-workers were very friendly and always willing to help. I learned a lot about financial services especially life insurance. It taught me how to manage my time efficiently. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping families reach their financial goals by guiding them with some of Northwestern's products. The hardest part of the job was compensation. This job is all commission based which is hard because you don't have a steady paycheck. A typical day at work involves coming to the office at 7:45 am and phoning as many potential clients as possible. On days that you have appointments you leave the office to meet your clients and return to the office once you're done. Your day continues in this manner until about 5 pm unless you have late appointments which is very possible.
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a great company to work for. I liked that I was able to get out and meet different people. However, it is a tough market to get into now since the economy is down and people do not want to spend money on things they don't think they need."
good,"I have enjoyed my 14 years at Northwestern Mutual.  They believe in making sure, that not only are their clients happy, but that their employees are happy too."
good,Believing in what you do as a financial rep for your clients is key. My mentor as well as senior reps were extremely helpful and giving. The recruiter was abundantly helpful especially in critical thinking exercises.
good,"Great internship, amazing for those who want to own their own business. A lot of driven and ambitious co-workers who help and encourage anyone and everyone from the CEOs to the interns. Very great atmosphere. Tough and extensive interview process and very tough to get this internship but it is worth it."
good,"Sales job that is difficult but rewarding. Focuses on financial planning and investments for everyone of all ages. You had to facilitate and schedule the meeting of individuals and families to provide a needs-based advising. The job is rewarding by being impactful of the lives of others. However, the job is difficult due to the fact you have to solicit consumers to meet with you in order earn a commission based income. Full-time representative earn a salary to supplement their income but otherwise you are paid by commission."
good,"A typical day consists of checking emails & prioritizing client needs. I learned how to handle the many moving parts associated with financial planning and the value of investment services."
good,Amazing place to work as an intern. I was lucky enough to intern for them while I was in college and had an incredible time with my mentor. The pay was very good and the commission splits were the same as a full time employee. I was able to easily learn the ropes and be able to go out on my own after a couple months of training. The culture was great and everyone was always looking out for one another or competing to be the best philanthropist in the office. It felt like a small family even though I was barely in the office during the week since I was splitting the work time with school.
good,Taking this position requires getting up every day to talk to new potential clients. Be prepared to be turned down 90% of the time. It can be very rewarding once you figure out your selling strategy.
good,"Northwestern Mutual was  great place to learn how to sell effectively. Moreover, you had to be self motivated and earn your own money rather than sit back and let salary come to you."
good,Overall the company has a good corporate culture. There are mentor programs and development sessions that focus on your growth. For those whose passion is advising people on their financial health this is a good company to pursue your career in.
good,In office calling and setting up meeting.  Reviewing curent meetings and discussing options with future and curent clients. Meeting new people is the most injoyable.
good,Fun place to work at. You can make as much many as you want but you have to know people and work hard to grow your network. Insurance is one of the hardest things to sell but if youre good at it then you can make a boatload of money.
good,"The employers at Northwestern Mutual are kind, gracious, understanding, and give room for advancement. Fast-paced, great learning environment, and focused on community service and customer care. Overall, great place to work if you enjoy administrative type tasks and a focus on organization and problem solving."
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a great company, especially for a salesperson. I'm not in for a career in sales, so it wasn't a fit for me, but they are a great company nevertheless"
good,You'll get some insurance certifications and real world experience. If you produce enough you can get investment licenses. If you don't mind working sales and all commission lots of money to be made but it takes quite a while.
good,All about activity. Make sure you are seeing as many people as possible. Follow the guidelines and you will succeed. Do not rely on family and friends to help you start because if they are not interested in buying then it can cause relationships to be tested.
good,The employees and management are some of the nicest people I've worked with. The work environment is very playful and energetic. The workload was very manageable during the week even with classes going on at the same time. A typical day would include calling at least ten people every day to schedule a meeting for a fact finder. Some days I would have a prospecting meeting to meet one person then get referred to other potential clients. Some days would include having a fact finder meeting where my mentor and I would sit down with a potential client and talk about individual financial plans. The hardest part of the job is calling people every day and having the motivation to do so. Getting rejections and clients cancelling at the last moment can get frustrating at times. On the other hand the most enjoyable part was knowing that I had made a positive impact on multiple individual's financial goals.
good,It's a great company gained a lot of information. The perks of the Job were the freedom and awesome atmosphere ! The opportunities and possibilities are great ! It can be a really tough job to maintain because of it being 100% commission and you having to work with your natural market. Great workplace experience with amazing people.
good,"Is a solid place to work, decent pay, great culture. Learned how to work with clients and how technology can benefit them."
good,NW Mutual in Fort Lauderdale has a great environment with a good team in the office.  Growing in the company is dependent on your willingness to work and put in the time and effort.  The ceiling is unlimited in you can be successful.
good,"I worked at Northwestern Mutual for an internship during college.  The best part about this internship is getting real, hands-on experience with people while digging in to their financials.  The hardest part of the job was the training and support.  Since this business runs off of commission, the employees working with the interns had to balance our training with their own clients."
good,I was glad to have had the opportunity I did with NM.  They are good people who want to help others succeed in helping others.  I learned alot about the financial industry while obtaining 6 and 63 series licensure.  We are our own bosses who must develop self-dicipline and responsibility in order to become successful entrapranuers.
good,"come in from 7am leave at 7pm"
good,Great work life balance with control over your money and time. Best career for the right person. It’s like starring your own business under the umbrella of a 160 year old Fortune 500 company.
good,"Always people around you willing to motivate you to achieve your goals. Also, many of the peers are highly qualified successful individuals looking to make a difference."
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a great company with great people. They will train you from day one and you have a support network of people to support you every step of the way. They encourage and celebrate hard work and will reward you for it as well. The work is challenging and not for everyone, you have to be very determined."
good,"Company is great, management is great. You get out what you put in. Allows for a flexible schedule if you are efficient. There are plenty of opportunities to learn and grow"
good,"if you enjoy interacting with people, northwestern might be perfect for you. Compensation is almost rentirely commission based, if you have an ideal network of family/friends you can do well, but you also need to sell to your family and friends"
good,I learned that saving for your retirement is important for a youngster like me. Hardest part of the job was being in the office all day. If you have headphones and your favorite tunes the day flys by.
good,I learned a lot about sales at this internship that prepared me for my future sales and how the corporate world works.  If you put in enough work you are able to accomplish great things at this company.
good,"Was a very educational and motivating place to work. Leadership was very open and encouraging. The training process was the best I have ever been through. Left this company with nothing but good feelings to have been a part of it,"
good,"Being a financial representative is definitely not one of the easiest jobs out there.  Each day brings a new set of challenges to deal with, however everyone there is willing to give you advice and help you succeed in any way they can."
good,"A typical day at work would start by meetings with team leaders with how the previous day was and what changes need to happen to improve today. I learned to prioritizing goals such as daily, weekly, monthly and annually. This process made me very efficient and productive. My co-workers were very supportive, I loved working with them as they helped my job worthwhile. The management staff were there for us if we had any problems or a pat on the back when a good job was done."
good,"I worked at Northwestern Mutual for three years. I started off as an intern and then full time responsibilities started. I enjoyed my job here very much, however, felt it was time for a change."
good,contacting individuals that i could help financially and be their financial advisor
good,"Great insurance but the rest is limited. Commission only,good training, good systems, slow tech and limited investment choices."
good,"NM as a company is great. Good products and services. The office culture is interesting... fun, but really inappropriate for a professional office setting. Management are poor communicators and expect a lot for little compensation. There's no employee handbook or set policies and expectations are not really voiced, so they can let you go at any time for little reason. Lots of turn around. They do offer benefits but not the best."
good,"I've been with Northwestern Mutual for a few years, I've learned that the Financial Advisor career is not the right fit for me but I am very glad that I gave it a shot. This role is for the type of person who knows they can build a clientele on their own and who is deeply passionate about doing that. I will always be a client and have built some great friendships throughout my time with them."
good,"Once you are hired there is almost no interaction from the management team as they immediately move on to the next recruit as soon as you sign the contract. "
good,"If you have a rock star network and prospect list.  Great place to work."
good,"Great place to work, but not for longer than 1 year. The environment, culture and people are great, but the compensation and benefits are so low. It is hard to sustain."
good,"Insurance is like swimming with sharks, Hard to tell when one of your friends will bite you."
good,I had to self teach myself all the roles that this job required I enjoy the people I worked with the hardest part of the job was having to work without support
good,"I worked as an assistant to financial planners and insurance salespeople. I would do whatever work was available, filling out paperwork, filing, doing whatever others didn't have the time to do. I would recommend the company to anyone wanting to break into insurance, marketing, or IT work."
good,LOVE my job but there is no room for growth. We restructured our team not long ago and what I was thought to believe was my career path no longer seems to be an option and conversations are not on the same path.
good,Northwestern Mutual is a great company for the client but tough for the adviser to get off to a great start. Nothing but very high quality people that work there.
good,"Great company, great product. Working at Northwestern Mutual separates you form any other insurance company in the world. People who work here have to be committed to creating your own practice and clientele. If your young and you want to experience investments and high pace financial analysis I don't recommend starting your career full time with them. They pay you on commission and they tell you that by the 5th year you'll start seeing results. Your young, and your interested in finances, go learn and then assess if you want to begin a career in Financial Planning."
good,"Sold Contacted clients and potential clients."
good,"As a college agent, I experienced true management skills of a business, managing my own business, selling to a wide array of different clients and importance of production. The skills I learned here have launched my entire sales career."
good,A typical day was very demanding. Working in the application input department it was very difficult to find my role and where I fit as an employee. I was pushed around and not rally lifted up in times I needed to be. They focused more on what I was doing wrong which was not a bother to me at all until it became an everyday thing.
good,"I did financial planning for clients with the Northwestern Mutual protocol. Would schedule meetings individually, or joint work, depending on the day or week."
good,"My typical day is meetings in the morning, phoning in the mid morning, lunch, and meetings the rest of the day. "
good,"I learned a lot working for this company. It is a fast paced work environment. Great teamwork, and felt welcome to ask questions or for help. Learned skills that continue to help in my future."
good,Very positive and energetic coworkers who are always willing to help out. The job is commission based so strong sales and communication skills are a must.
good,"Very encouraging people will help you achieve your goals if you are willing to work for them. Lots of great people and a good career, especially for someone interested in sales or finance."
good,"I was fresh out of college and the pressure of a sales position with was too much for me. I panicked because I wasn't making any money and my bonuses were running dry."
good,"Great culture, team-focused mentality. Educated clients on the benefits of supplementing their investments with life, disability, and long-term care insurance."
good,Everyone that works there is very friendly and I was able to learn a lot from the Financial Advisor I work for. Would recommend for people interested in the Financial services industry.
good,"It's such a great company, with tons of talent and diversity. Also a lot of opportunity to cross train. The managers truly want you to succeed in the role that you obtain."
good,"Although the company has been around  for over 100 years, the people at Northwestern Mutual are constantly finding new ways to innovate and be the best they can be for their clients."
good,This really is the best investment/advisor/insurance company to work for or work with. They are the best company out there and are consistently beating all the others.
good,Northwestern Mutual is a great company that takes holistic financial planning to an unmatched level. Great environment and experience! The most enjoyable part is seeing how our work makes an impact on our client's lives.

good,Overall a great place to work with Great people. Hard to get started but great overall career outlook. Great compensation package and great opportunity to help people.
good,"Excellent company to work for. Best training in the industry. Collaborative environment, willing to help each other. Advancement is possible with high pay."
good,Northwestern Mutual is an excellent place to work. They treat you like family and require you to work hard but its worth it. The most enjoyable part of the job is finishing tasks.
good,"'"
good,"One of the best office environments ever worked in . Management treats their employees the same as the clients - as if each individual is most valued client. Very collaborative, excellent training. You can't be shy and must be able to get on the phone to set / close appointments. Sales personality will thrive here."
good,"One of my favorite places to work, I learned a lot and felt the most encouragement towards the continuing of education and athleticism. Northwestern Mutual was also a very good equal opportunity employer culturally with few diversity issues. Compliance was handled very professionally and eloquently at all times."
good,"A typical day consisted of dialing people trying to set up meetings with possible prospects or meeting with prospects with our joint work partner. I learned how to manage my time while within a professional setting. The workplace culture is lively, while making sure we were producing and achieving our daily activity."
good,"Wonderful workplace culture, the people in the office are amazing and so friendly. The hardest part of the day was cold calling random individuals and prospecting to your contacts. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work on your own schedule and interact with people all day long. You must be very personable and sociable. It's nice to inform people about their finances and help people understand the importance of saving!"
good,NWM is a great place to work and a good place to start a career. I went through the internship program and it opened a lot of doors for me. I would recommend this firm.
good,"Enjoy being part of a great team who are committed to helping clients with financial planning needs. NM helps with insurance needs as well as investments, retirement planning and helps clients build a strategy to be in a better financial position."
good,Learned how to do things on the job straight out of college.  It was an experience like none other.  I would recommend my position to anyone looking to learn more about finance.
good,I had an overall good experience.  Good work culture and management who develops.   The hardest part of the job is the time that it takes to on board a candidate.
good,"Great job that requires you to work an existing network or build a network. Great for folks that like flexibility, like working out of coffee shops and like helping people make the best financial choices for themselves and their families."
good,"Northwestern Mutual is on of the most reputable insurance companies in the nation."
good,Driven by good values and filled with the best of the best financial representatives! The leadership did an excellent job at modeling good practices and developing future leaders.
good,"I started at Northwestern Mutual as an intern and then became a full-time financial representative, they really help you in preparing for required certifications."
good,Calling for financial planning for individuals. Hard work is key to being successful. I enjoy controlling my own practice and striving to be better every day.
good,A typical day was calling all the people we could and prospecting and gaining new potential leads. We would then set up times to meet with them for lunch or whatever they wanted and try to build a plan to sell.
good,Great company and great products.Excellent training and up to date technology.  Highly recommended company with moral and ethics.  Two thumbs up.  Very happy.
good,The workplace culture was very professional and every employee takes pride in what the company represents. Upper management was very helpful with assisting the interns and new employees on how to build their own book of business.
good,This company gives interns and full time employees alike the same opportunity to develop and grow a good book of business within the insurance industry. They helped me learn about the many different aspects involved in the financial services industry. I really enjoyed my time with them!

good,"Working at Northwestern Mutual was a very great learning experience. I was able to meat with clients on a daily basis and assess their goals personally, professionally, and financially.

I am grateful for the opportunity to work there and hope that I will be able to use my experiences and knowledge that I have gained from Northwestern in my future endeavors and career.  "
good,"Management doesn't micro manage"
good,"There is very little room for advancement, unless you work for an individual insurance producer. Once you work on the staff side of the business, you have very little room for advancement, sue to the limited staff positions. The culture is a positive motivator, which is why most people don't leave their positions. If you are looking for advancement, you need to work at the home office in Milwaukee, not a branch office. Salaries start off low and don't increase more than 3% on everage."
good,"Great Culture, business professional, dial people and go on appointments, build client relationships, manage your own schedule."
good,Northwestern has an outstanding reputation and thier products back it up.
good,"-Pretty conservative company, but they have a very successful history of managing their assets and providing for their clients."
good,Working as an intern in the financial services arena allowed for me to grow professionally. Northwestern Mutual always backed their employees and stressed the importance of growing as an individual and pushing for continued education.
good,Learned a lot about the stock market and investing for the future.
good,I really enjoyed the experiences and information that I learned a lot from.
good,A typical work day includes tracking and following cases that are in underwriting. Assure that all of the New Finacial Representatives are supported. My co-workers are involved in the entire process of assuring we provide outstanding customer service and assistance. The hardest part of the job is knowing someone dont see the value in making sure their families are protected with Life Insurance. The most enjoyable is seeing how a New Financial Representative becomes successful throughout the years.
good,-Gained extensive knowledge of financial planning
good,"As a financial representative intern, I was trained and mentored by industry veterans who know what it takes to succeed. I learned how to run a business from one of the most respected companies around.

good,Company and atmosphere was great.  Training on all aspects was incredible.   Sales career was a challenge due to income.  You needed to be incredible at sales to survive.
good,"This job was also in the Grand Rapids office of Northwestern Mutual. In this position, I worked directly for an individual Financial Representative, and not for the company itself.  With the investment and insurance licenses I hold, I was able to do work with the Financial Reps clients and process any of their request or needs. This allowed the  the representative to have more freedom in his business, and did not always need to be in the office to process client needs."
good,"A great group of employees that I worked with for about 15 years. I loved working with the new Financial Representatives and College Interns. In the Financial Field things are always changing, so you are always learning new things, and are required to continue your education."
good,"This is a good company to work for, the people here are willing to help you if you put in the work. The products that the company has to offer are far more competitive than any other life insurance company."
good,Only decided to move because of the compensation style was only commission based. It was a great work environment and kept me entertained. They provide all necessary resources.
good,"Being contracted for Northwestern Mutual is a demanding yet rewarding career opportunity."
good,It was difficult because you needed to use your own network in order to make the sale.
good,"This is a great company, but requires a specific type of individual.  I enjoyed my time at Northwestern Mutual and I am still a client using their products to this day!"
good,A normal work day was extremely busy. I dealt with everyday bookkeeping duties along with supervising employees and working one on one with new financial representatives. I also answered emails and phone calls throughout the day as well as continuous face to face interactions.
good,-Develop communication skills through connecting with clients and prospect
good,Great company to work for. Excellent resources and training available.
good,"This was great to work for, however because the files were confidential was unable to work some days from home which was not convenient after having a newborn. I lived in Vallejo and the office was in the citicorp center in San Francisco. At the time my next step was to study to be a financial advisor."
good,Overall the job was fun but also very challenging when trying to build up clients and sell the product at a young age. Connections are very vital in a business like this one.
good,"You are you're own boss. Don't expect handouts. You work for your keep. There is no salary. Full commission. If you have the market, it is a great place to be."
good,"If you like to control your own destiny AND you're not afraid to work for it, this is an excellent place to work."
good,"Learned how to manage my own business operations on a day to day basis. Most enjoyable helping people achieve there goals. Hardest part was finding people to meet. Great culture, everybody was very supportive and held each other accountable."
good,This company has great office space. It is staffed with great people and the coffee machine is very helpful to get through most days. They also are always planning events as a company because they are often working independently.
good,"Excellent training in consulting and negotiating skills.  Must be excellent self-starter and disciplined in daily execution of sales efforts."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet with clients and have a positive and significant impact on their financial lives.  I learned that this is a career that needs to be started at a younger age and with less family responsibility.  The earning potential is outstanding, if you can survive the building your client base phase.  The culture is terrific and very welcoming. The hardest part of this career is being able to reconcile the emotions of rejection, extreme high and lows and be able to build the discipline to make calls, make calls, make calls."
good,"The most enjoyable part about the job, was being able to satisfy the customer and representatives. I learned how to cut checks globally, typical day is filing, answering phones, responding to emails, cutting checks and utilizing my skills."
good,"I was an unpaid intern. It was a comfortable environment with a friendly, cooperative, knowledgable staff that were very willing to share their expertise with me."
good,"The work and vision of this company is second-to-none in my opinion, very steep earning potential making it hard to get off to a fast start. Thats all."
good,"This job is not easy - but it is an excellent opportunity. Regardless if you succeed or fail you will be better educated, know what it takes to succeed in this field, and learn more about yourself than you will at any other job. The management and other Financial Advisors and their teams are friendly, supportive, and everyone wants to see you succeed."
good,"My average work day at Northwestern Mutual was from 6 AM to 7 PM, including most Saturdays. My position was based on full commission with little knowledge of the service I was selling. My position also provided only three weeks of training. After training I mainly focused on building my clientele from the ground up. If I didn't have any clientele, I didn't receive income. There was hardly any management or guidance throughout the work day. I was mostly on my own with no set schedule. Low income, straight commission and no set working hours were the hardest part of the job. Companionship and teamwork with my co-workers was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Learned a lot during my internship not just on the ins and outs of the Financial Services industry, but how to conduct yourself as a professional."
good,"Some departments are great to work in, and others are not depending on the management. The workplace culture is ok depending on what department you are in.  Some of the leaders within the company are down to earth and approachable."
good,Great place if you are a self-starter and require little direction. work life balance can be difficult if you have a family. Do not take Financial Representative role unless you have at least 6 months of income in the bank to support yourself while you get your business up in rolling. High turnover rate in representatives is not due to company or products but usually personal situations. (financial hardship/lack of work ethic.
good,The Northwestern Mutual internship program was truly a great experience. The whole recruiting team and team of Financial Advisors at the Monroeville office were very helpful and supportive. They really give you a solid foundation to be successful and it's in your hands where you want to take it from there. I loved the flexibility of the work schedule and the opportunity to meet many individuals. It's very rewarding knowing you're helping someone achieve financial stability and security.
good,"Working at the General Agent's office was a delight and challenging. Selling life insurance, mutual funds, etc. In this industry, It was exciting during the height of the stock market.  It was unfortunate that with our swinging market, the industry had to change.  "
good,No screaming no yelling - quietest place I have worked at.  Nicely organized but too many hoops to jump thru to get things done.
good,If you don't have a large natural market here as in you did not go to high school and college here I would consider another avenue. its a great company with a lot of training however if you cant put a list of 200-500 names together of people you know locally i would keep looking.
good,"Northwestern Mutual can help you obtain financial security through life insurance , disability insurance, investment management and other financial services."
good,"Great career opportunity if you have about a year of living expenses saved up when you start and you know a lot of people willing to do business with you.  Great company and great reputation, but to stay there you have to be a top performer or you will be shown the door.  The learning experience is excellent as well."
good,Northwestern Mutual is a great place to work that demands the highest commitment of work from a person as an individual.  As a company it makes you dig deeper then you normally would as an individual.  
good,"Management meetings, phone calling potential clients to set meetings, meet potential clients and use consultative hollistic approach to financial planning for new and existing clients"
good,"Overall, I love working for Northwestern Mutual. The company has high standards and an excellent track record for excellence in the field. On an average day I spend 1 hour in internal development meetings, 1.5 hours on the phone with existing/prospective clients, and the remainder of my day in the field at client meetings. The development team is excellent there is constant coaching and accountability. The other representatives are supportive and the culture is extrememly collaborative. The most enjoyable part of the job is having a direct on the community through financial planning and establishing relationships with clients."
good,I arrived early to phone prospects in small businesses before
good,"The company has a Good Culture for both employees and clients."
good,"The people were very nice and helpful. However, I quickly realized that I did not enjoy the position.  It was much more about meeting with people, sometimes at their homes, and about selling."
good,Typical day included going to meet with people to learn about their current financial position.  Needed to call people every day to set more meetings.  Hopefully meeting someone who you could help improve their situation.
good,"Owning your own business is like riding a lion, others see you are riding a lion, you are wondering how did you end up sitting on a lion?"
good,There is always a very welcoming feeling around the staff members at NM. I have learned so much by working there as it was my first job. I would recommend this job to anyone looking in the career field.
good,"Great place to work, very positive environment. Work hard play hard mentality. If you work hard, you can advance your career quite quickly. As a financial advisor there is tremendous growth opportunity, as any other type of staff member, there is much more limited opportunities."
good,"There is a lot of training and mentoring to help you become comfortable and effective in the role. You learn how to go from gathering prospects, reaching out to them, setting up meetings, and helping them find the products and services that will help them the most. It is a fun environment and everyone wants to see you do well, as long as you get your work done, it's a fun place to be. You get to meet and network with a number of people, from clients to those that you work with."
good,You will have to rely on friends and family to kick start your career.  Endless potential.  Ability to work for yourself.  They foster an environment of success.
good,You must be seriously motivated to grow your own business. You are solely responsible for prospecting and continuing to provide your own leads. You are on your own but this can be amazing for the right person
good,"Great flexible job work as an intern along with other financial advisors. Attended weekly meeting with team. also made calls and meetings weekly with other interns,."
good,"Great corporate benefits, great company to work for. The leadership in the corporate office is very focused and supportive. They provide the opportunity to build and create your position, but there is not much chance for advancement if you do not live in Milwaukee."
good,"This career is lucrative for those with a great network of people. If you are going into this without a great pre-existing network, this may be more of a cold-calling and difficult position. However, the training is thorough and definitely teaches you the process of financial planning."
good,"Good benefits , training , resources , etc . Enjoyed my job and time at northwestern mutual as well as learning many new things. I would work there again."
good,"My management and training was a bit lacking due to the changes the company was experiencing.  Overall great group of people, strong ethics and company to work for."
good,I would recommend this job to anyone in their hometown. Otherwise it is a VERY difficult industry to get a foot in the door. Underpaid to start but can become very successful with a lot of hard work and dedication.  Work/Home balance is difficult.
good,"My typical day working at Northwestern Mutual was to cold call potential clients and sell them life, health or accident insurance. Once a week there was a required training session for interns where we were focused on how to expand client lists and be a better financial adviser."
good,In the role you maintain your own financial advisory practice with a need to generate your own clientele. The states life insurance exam is reimbursed.
good,Great company to work for if you can maintain the activity and get in front of the right type of people. Discipline is the key to achieving and maintaining success.
good,This was a good first internship for sure and would recommend to people to do so. It is very cutthroat for sure but if you can make it in the business its great.
good,You have to be very self-motivated and ready to work every day. It's somewhat cut-throat but can be very rewarding at the same time. Don't be afraid to pick up the phone!
good,"Great training program. Management wants everyone to succeed. Very good back office support. Tim Barnhart is an exceptional resource for anyone looking to get into the insurance industry in the Syracuse, NY area."
good,"Great company to work for with focus on clients, prospective clients, community and their employees.  They are family oriented with a number of events throughout the year to encourage personal and professional development."
good,Located in Pittsburgh. I am an intern there now. There is not much growing in the company for me once i graduate. Good learning experience though and very helpful.
good,"First thing every morning I meet with my Financial Representative and discussed customer service issues, underwritten status, and all open cases.  Discussed upcoming appointments.  There I process applications, followed up on the status.  Answered telephones, provided customer service, and prepare all customer correspondences.  I  was responsible for all incoming and outgoing mail for the representative.  I meet with clients and complete applications or open new accounts when needed.  Calculated cost basis for clients and with preparing and process mutual fund trade request for clients.  Balanced portfolios when requested."
good,I have nothing to say about this company except: LEAN MANAGEMENT DOES NOT WORK FOR PEOPLE.  You can't expect to give exceptional customer service when you are a robot.
good,"I would start off my day with a development meeting or a mentoring meeting. Then block off an hour and a half to call prospects to schedule a face to face meeting. I would then go see anywhere between 3 to 5 people daily to help create financial security for them. Utilizing my finance background and training I would educate the prospects, get to know their goals and where they stand currently, go back to my team and create a detailed financial plan for them. At the second meeting the prospect would then decide whether they would like to implement any of the insurance and investment recommendations and become a Northwestern Mutual client. I enjoyed creating my own schedule, but also didn't like the uncertainty that came with it."
good,Internship experience was great.  Learned more about selling than any college class can teach.  Be careful though as when you are young Northwestern will love you to bring in customers that they will take over when you leave.
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a great company full of high quality, helpful, intelligent, responsive, kind people. The company provides a professional yet nurturing environment to facilitate the ability to provide a very high level of service to clients."
good,Great Company to work for. Very select in their hiring process. Great way to start a business.
good,Great place to work. Sales it tough though an especially on all commission. If you have no problem with all commission jump right in.
good,"A typical day at work would include staff meetings in the mornings in order to determine your goals and startegies for the upcoming day and week. Followed by prospecting for new clients and setting up meetings in order to help prospective people with their needs. Meeting with clients and delivering proposed plans."
good,"Northwestern is a great company. They have some of the best life and investment products on the market. Their system for selling these products is very hard to do, but if you can do it, you will make a ton of money."
good,Running your own financial practice. a 24hr job. Management and Co-worker are professional. Hardest part of the job is being on your own. Most rewarding part is helping protect families.
good,Great environment to grow among driven individuals. Clear impact on those you work with. Learn sales experience as well as basic investment/ insurance knowledge in classroom setting.
good,The compensation is good if you are e constantly closing deals. 100 per week is just about enough to cover your gas costs and tolls but not a sufficient amount to pay interns.
good,Good experience overall. I felt the management was very supportive of the young reps within the company. I takes hard work and the right individual to endure the beginning phases of this business and opportunity.
good,"difficult work. have to call on people you know. Once you have gone through your friends and family you will need to use them for more prospects. Great job if you have people who are willing to sit down and trust your judgement. Otherwise, you will be spending the majority of your time prospecting and convincing people you have their best interest at heart. 200 phone calls per week minimum, with some cold calling."
good,"Challenging work.  A great place to start your career, or finish up if you don't need a big income.  The corporate culture is professional and very positive."
good,"I liked the easy commute, good atmosphere, busy office setting, fair hours. Thoroughly enjoyed my position, good balance, fair management, different cultures. Most enjoyable part of my job was working in center city and working with the various agents"
good,"This job taught me a lot in the field of job culture. Advisors were willing to help and had many tips on how to succeed not only within the company, but they helped you develop skills that will help in any future employment."
good,I moved to NM when I wanted to get out of a sales role with the previous positions.  They were willing to work with me to obtain the additional licensing needed to move into their open position
good,You will need financial help to make it in the first few years in this business. If you make it through the rough beginning you will be amazed at your success.
good,"I learned how to be independent, manage individuals and research. This company fostered individual and professional growth. The management is supportive and encouraging. It is a great work environment. "
good,This was a pleasant place to work. Everyone got along well. It was an independent work environment. Free parking. Good work/life balance. Each associate worked for a specific representative. But we also worked together to help each other.
good,Excellent place to work.  Very professional co-workers and atmospher.  Management very helpful.  Loved working here.  Unfortunately position was temporary.  I would recommend anyone working here.
good,"Typical day included several meetings with potential clients as welkl as office administration. On Site gym, and management was very knowledgeable as well as having been promoted internally,"
good,If you enjoy networking and helping people in a meaningful way then this job is for you! You will get to meet and touch many different lives. As well as work alongside other intelligent minds in a fast pace sales environment.
good,"Call on potential clients to set meeting."
good,"Was a great internship and learning experience to begin learning the financial services industry.  The training program was fantastic when it came to phone calls and sitting down in meetings.  The other representatives were very helpful when I had questions and they were always willing to help the customer.  The hardest part of the job was balancing the training, working, and getting used to the business world.  While the most enjoyable part was the amazing culture of the people in the office, managers, and other representatives while also learning a lot in my first real work experience."
good,"Rated top 5 internships in the nation. As an intern you have hands on experience as a financial Representative at the company, selling insurance. Hard work, good start."
good,"Contact me directly for more feedback!  I'm happy to provide additional information, but it would take too long to list it all here.  Feel free to contact me."
good,I enjoyed working at Northwestern Mutual for 15 years and learned so much. I've had the opportunity to work with several executives for the company. Each position was fast-paced and had many responsibilities to go with it.
good,a typical day at work we would login and check the calendar on whose assigned what for the day. I learned all about security access management. The location of building is nice and People at work are relaxed. Hardest part of job is trying to manage being on phones and getting timed tasks done. Which i think they should give overtime. I enjoy the free lunch here at work
good,NWM is an insurance and investment company that is a leader in the industry. The office and management staff are very nice and helpful. The atmosphere is relaxed.
good,"Northwestern Mutual is an amazing company for the right person - the selection process is lengthy, but only to ensure it is a mutual fit on both ends. This career is not for everyone, but they do a good job of ensuring its good for both sides."
good,"Project lifecycle and outcomes are rapidly moving from traditional Waterfall to Agile/Scrum.  Many great opportunities to learn, grow, and take on new and exciting opportunities exist as a result."
good,Very collaborative work place. Worked in a fast paced environment. Had to adopt an agile mindset as how work is being done is maturing. Good work/life balance.
good,"Great company to  work for, Management should be structured  differently. Proper training would help make the company operate in a better manner. Overall nice place to work,"
good,"Its a great company to work for. "
good,"You are your own boss. You decided how many hours you work per week as long as you make your quota. Very relaxed environment, a lot of calling and meeting clients."
good,The environment is friendly and everyone is well versed on the nature of the business. Truly appreciate my time working in this office and learning something new everyday.
good,"I enjoyed the position. Agent I worked directly with was generous in his understanding of being a single parent with a then small child. Learned about whole life insurance when previous background was universal & variable life, mutual funds & annuities"
good,Great opportunity to make a lot of tips but is extremely fast paced and longer hours as well as being outdoors year-round.
good,"You basically run your own schedule. With the exception of a Monday and Thursday morning meeting from 7:30 to 8:30 there are really no times you HAVE to be at the office. You run your own hours and practice. The top leadership is hard to get hold of and you have to schedule time to meet with him at least 3 days in advance. Your immediate supervisors are almost always available, and just about any of the advisors are always willing to lend a helping hand."
good,"Very structured...a lot of training and motivation from peers and management."
good,"In the last 3 years NM has started to follow the path of every other company out there and implement LEAN into this mutual company.  I don't believe this is the right path for this company.  Customers don't care about metrics; they just want good quality answers to their questions. I fear that things will get worse before it gets better. "
good,"Very hard job to do, but can be very rewarding. Not always a reliable source of income. Not the best environment for someone who doesn't have discipline to work everyday."
good,"Northwestern Mutual is the high end Life insurance provider and as an agent I had extensive training on product line and how to determine proper product placement for each client. Very fast pace schedule required to ensure your income continued to climb as least through the first 5 years as an agent."
good,"Training is excellent. Work environment is excellent. Surrounded by great motivated and encouraging coworkers and mentors. However, you are judged on activity which is generated by phone calls. No cold calls. But your entire business is referral based. So, if your not generating a phone list.. you're not generating high activity. You only get paid when you sign clients. So know how to budget your money. if you need or are looking for a weekly pay check.. you're not going to get it here. Expect once a month pay."
good,The culture of the company is very friendly and upbeat. The management team keeps employees informed and involved which is very important.
good,"Complete autonomy, commission based sales that allow for unlimited success.  Work environment was very positive and upbeat, with a sharing mentality."
good,"A day at Northwestern is more accurately described as day and a night at northwestern. The hours are very much what you make them as this a comission driven job. In order to be successful you must put in alot of time developing a market to do buisness with.  Majority of the time is spent finding clients, reaching to potential clients and seeing existing clients. The night is reserved for client correspondence and all the paperwork that comes wiht being a financial planner. Northwestern Has an amazing sales school which teaches you how to be successful not only as a financial planner but simply as a business owner. There's a sense of accountablity that is learned from the culture at Northwestern and it travels into your daily activity in the business. The people at northwestern are self motivated , driven and hard working people. They are very creative at their apporach on helping others. The downside to the job is Northwestern is what you make it. If you use your time wisely and see as many people as possible everyday you will not make money. Conversely the best part of the job is if you use your time wisely and see many people you will make endless amounts.  Also the job makes you feel that you are really helping people plan for the future every day you sit down with someone ."
good,This in an excellent place to work. It is a supportive environment that supports continuing education and advancement.
good,"Made a lot of phone calls. "
good,"A typical day at work invovled calling potential clients, setting appointments and seeing both prospective clients and actual clients."
good,"The company is top-notch and can't be beat. The career is a tough one. There are great highs when you meet with clients and can visibly see the improvement in their finances over the time that you have helped them. There are also tough lows with common rejection. The part that makes the rejection hard is that this job is 100% commission driven. Sometimes the rejection can sting a little worse because of that. If you are married, make sure your spouse is 100% on board. Common work stress can leak into your relationship with the commission part if they aren't comfortable with the idea."
good,"NM has a wonderful working environment. Even though the company is huge, you never feel lost in the crowd. Everyone feels like they are on the same team."
good,"You will be challenged, but it is worth! The experience from working for Northwestern Mutual will be with me the rest of my professional career, it is a great place to learn about financial services."
good,"they will require you to solicit your friends and family, and if you leave they will continue to pursue them. The management team is very friendly and supportive and makes the job seem great. If you do not like sales, you will not like this job."
good,"My time at Northwestern mutual laid the framework for my sales career which I have built upon extensively ever since.  I learned sales tactics including negotiation maneuvers, objection handling, and effective closing strategies as well as much better time management.  My time at Northwestern Mutual was incredibly impactful but I will admit I did not get everything out of the internship that I could have.  I had to juggle the internship with 15 credit hours that semester and ended up focusing more on my academics than my internship.  The aspect of the job that challenged me the most was actually the prospecting, something I find remarkably simple and easy to do now.  The issue I was running into was that I didn't have as many people in my network making enough money to utilize the services offered by Northwestern at the time and my contacts with the means to secure some of our services were already well situated, a symptom of their financial responibility.  I would consider getting back into insurance after a couple of years, once colleagues in my network start making more money.  This internship was very much a sales bootcamp where I learned what does and doesn't work and I have been exponentially more prepared for the rest of my professional life as a result. If you have the opportunity to take part, I wholeheartedly recommend it."
good,Really loved it their. everyone wants to see you succeed. It is a hard field to be successful in so you need to be willing to commit fully to your job to be successful.
good,Love working here. Amazing team and I have learned so much. They are the reason I have advanced so far in my financial services career. I owe them a lot.
good,"They are very energetic workers, and love to work and make the best out of  every situation. Keep a very upbeat and positive attitude towards every client."
good,"Great training, outstanding prospecting skills.  Difficult to get started with 100% commission from day one.  Best practice is to have about 6 months of income saved to get through the pains of building the business."
good,The culture was amazing.  I was the first person the clients would see and they were absolutely wonderful. I learned alot about the company and the specifics of Life Insurance.
good,"It's the first large company I've worked for where a majority (if not all) are Christians, which is refreshing! "
good,Great Benefits. Great Internship. Great Company. Management is alright. Some clients are amazing. I made a lot of calls. You have to be a motivated individual.
good,I always hold this position in high regards. This was the best job I've ever had and this is where i grew the most in my career. The only issue I had was that it's a commission only position and my practice hit a rough patch at a time when I absolutely needed money. Would go back in a heart beat if I could.
good,"On a daily basis, I would respond to policy request via email, phone and written correspondence. I would also assist with filing and clerical duties as well."
good,"Loved my experience but they do not do much for the new hires except train them on how to be a Northwestern Employee. You must have strong ties to financial stable adults or have no problems with cold calling anybody in order to create your leads and client list. There are no boundaries to a market, you must simply figure out who you want to pitch to, and go do it. Strictly commission during my time, which I do not prefer."
good,"Overall, a fantastic place to work! Amazing product line, a staff of high moral integrity in nearly all offices. A feeling of comfort when it comes to the idea that these individual will be holding themselves to the highest standards when it come to managing clients assets and designs for true comprehensive financial planning."
good,My views are private and confidential as is required by my licensing. As most people in the industry know Northwestern is a conservative and trusted company.
good,"I loved working with all the people, the management understood family and work life balance. the hardest part of my job was delivering bad renewals, however , resolving the bad renewal with creative ways of switching up the benefits to make the renewal more cost effective for the employer and the employee was the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,Everyone is very friendly and helpful around the office. This workspace is more about what you make of your time at the office. You are in control of how much you want to work and earn.
good,I have loved my time at KFG. The office culture is a wonderful atmosphere to work in and I will miss my team greatly. I am only changing jobs because I am getting married/relocating.
good,It's hard to get everything done.  Not enough time in the day and gets extremely stressful when you have to rely on people to act in order to get paid.  100% commission is rough but it is a good percentage though.
good,I learned through my office that this career is  hard one to start. But this company and office that I worked for were the best people. I learned the value of a sound financial plan and that I will always be appreciative of the MD there taking a chance on me right out of college.
good,Enjoy who I work for as a company and my direct manager.  No micro-managing and enjoy the flexibility.  Very supportive and understanding when it comes to work/life balance.
good,Meetings were not too long and the content and technology in the office was superb. The amenities for lunch and breakfast were free and that helped save money for employees. There were always good training courses.
good,"Overall great company.  Fast paced, competitive and somewhat stressful, but positives far out weigh negatives.  I only left because I was recruited by my former employer and manager to help build a new department and was a great opportunity."
good,The training is unparalleled. It is a great place to work! must be a self starter! I would not trade my experience for anything. I would recommend working here if you have the mental capacity to be self motivated each and every day
good,"Great place to work but only have a 75 % retention rate as it is 100 % commission and you have to bring your own warm market so you are essentially selling to your friends and family and you get referrals from them. While it seems easy, calling your warm market is very difficult since you know them already and money is a very sensitive subject."
good,Really good opportunity but it was not the right fit for me and not the right timing. I enjoyed all the knowledge I gained and it really helped me transition into my next role.
good,"In order to be an agent for Northwestern Mutual, you must meet quotas. You are a 1099 employee so most of the expenses fall on you, but the support within the business is second to none. Everyday you learn from upper management and those around you."
good,Great place to work as long as you are ok with being a contractor. Pay varies but solid over all from contraxt company with experience. Great management
good,"It is a very stressful but very rewarding internship. The management is amazing and they want to see you succeed. They will push you out of your comfort zone and make you work hard, but you will be rewarded. Good compensation for the amount of work put in."
good,"The job is hard but if you do your best to hit Granum numbers you will be successful.  Everyone is there to support you in your journey, but in the end it is all on you to get the job done."
good,"good at learming at workplace"
good,"There is no 'typical day'.  Everyday is different, depending on what comes in the door.  Management does not hover, they let you set your own rules, as long as the work gets done.  The hardest part is dealing with so many different Financial Reps and their personalities. Most enjoyable part, helping Reps reach their goas."
good,Love working at Northwestern Mutual.  People working there are highly ethical as well as super smart.  It is a mission driven organization that truly cares about clients and the community.
good,Great place to work but a lot of hard work especially in the first year cause compensation is commission based. The training is fantastic as well. They are there with you all the way to make sure you succeed
good,"A typical day at work would include data entry as a secretary, answering the phones at the desk, and organizing data into appropriate files. I learned how to successfully enter data for a professional company and also learned several computer skills. The workplace culture was a typical business place with cells and different corporate offices. The hardest part of the job was getting used to the speed and accuracy of the data entry process. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people who were benefiting from my work in their workplace. I enjoyed seeing my efforts being used in their work daily."
good,"Its a tough business to start out in. But if you stick your head down and do the activity it will workout for you. the one downfall is, is that its strictly commission."
good,Very difficult for a college student to sell complicated financial products to older friends and family. Would recommend but must have a very strong and young network in your area.
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a top class company. Not only are the reps well trained and managed, they have far and away the best products on the market. The culture of the company is amazing and everyone is happy to help the younger reps in any way that they can. The downfall for new reps is that if they don't have a good network going in to the company, it is very hard to build one. It is crucial that people close to you will use your services or it will be very hard to survive. Those that have high net worth friends typically fare better because they are able to pull good paychecks while building their outside networks and don't have to worry about not making money."
good,"The management, and just the culture itself was awesome.  It is just really hard to make it if you don't have a natural market.  The entire job boils down to being great on the phone, and prospecting.  If you can do those two things, you can make a great career and be compensated so well that you never have to think about money.  All you have to do is make it through the first 3 years.  Once you're over that hump, it is smooth sailing.  Great company, just not the right fit for me."
good,Northwestern Mutual is a great company to work for. Getting in front of thousands of people and showing them the type of work you do is a rush. Showing these people recommendations that can assist them in their financial situations is astounding.
good,I worked as an intern at this company and learned a ton from many different successful people.  They had great selling training and people with years of experience that also helped my development as a professional.  Great company overall.
good,"An awesome company with excellent training and mentors.A typical day at Northwestern Mutual would require a weekly meeting in the morning, time set aside for phoning leads, and also time meeting with clients. I loved all of my coworkers and I had the luxury of being under the tutelage of some great mentors."
good,Great Company! NML has been around for over 155 years.This Company and Fidelity Investments are excellent companies to work for!
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a great company to be backed by.  They have an excellent training program. If you like to work hard, can handle rejection, and be your own boss then i recommend you try it out."
good,"The above three words express all that I feel about Nymex Capitol."
good,"The job is as fulfilling as one makes it. The company has a great reputation, but, sometimes, lacks the support that would have been highly valuable. They are also, somewhat, limited in their offerings."
good,Northwestern Mutual has been an amazing company to work for. They have amazing benefits for their employees and treat everyone with the utmost respect. I sad to leave but wanted to pursue something different.
good,It was a great experience for someone starting their business. You have a lot of ability to grow if you put in the time. You get in what you put out if you aren't willing to work this isn't the job for you.
good,Early Morning starts and you don't get done until late in the evening. The schedule is yours to make. Typically new reps work very long hours because they are just trying to meet with anyone and any time. Older reps work normal shorter hours on the days they work. Co-workers and managers are very encouraging and help push you to great achievement but success ultimately comes down to your willingness to pay the price. Best part of my job was meeting new people and just talking to anyone and everyone. I did not enjoy the process of selling people stuff because it can be emotionally taxing to constantly be selling people stuff that they don't even want to talk about let alone buy.
good,"•	Worked collectively with clients to identify their financial security needs (Life Insurance, Disability Insurance, and Long Term Care Planning)."
good,"You wake up, go into the office for training and then attempt to hold five meetings day and build a network from scratch. Incredibly rewarding but the grind can wear you down fast if you aren't built for it."
good,"At that time Marketing department was pretty new, typical day on the phone, via email or in meetings. Hardest part was the politics in moving up in the company, a lot of tenured individuals so advancement is something you have to build towards."
good,"A great company to work for, they have great products and the training is top notch.  Everyone is very willing to help.  Learned a lot about financial planning and how to deal with people as well as run a business."
good,A very rewarding internship where I received my NYS life accident and health license. I learned good first hand sales experience from knowledgeable financial representatives. Who were always willing to help when meeting new clients and working on the best solutions for those clients. Would call and prospect Clients and help try to gear and Insurance and financial security strategy for various different people. With varying different financial situations
good,Planning is everything for the future of our loved ones. Knowing everything can change in the blink of an eye. I truly enjoyed making the difference in someones life when it can unfortunately be affected with the loss of a family provider.
good,"I worked closely as an executive assistant to a financial representative for 19 years. Together we worked hard to achieve many company awards as well as personal goals.  I learned to be diplomatic and tactful with professionals and business owners at all levels, while maintaining strict compliance practices.  I built trusting relationships with our clients by providing them with excellent customer service.  "
good,Fun working at this company. environment is nice and people are very supportive.
good,"A typical day at Northwestern Mutual consisted of getting into the office by about 7:30am to prep your day.  By 9:00am, you are on the phones calling prospects and referrals to book meetings, until about 10:30 or 11:00am.  From then on, you are out seeing clients and prospects.  Whether it be initial meetings or closing meetings, you are out and about at lunches, at people's work, or at their home, educating them and motivating them to take action on a variety of insurance and investment products."
good,"Flexibility to pursue many different career paths.  The network at Northwestern Mutual provides exposure to many different areas of financial planning.  If you find something that is of interest to you, there's a career path available to follow."
good,"Northwestern Mutual has a great work environment.  There is a great work/life balance, and management is easy to get along with."
good,"Great company with great people, am industry that is needed, but is tough to work in. Not for everyone, but for the right person this can be an amazing career."
good,"Amazing training program in initial 4 weeks, with continued learning over next 11 months. Many benchmarks created monthly and annually to keep new reps challenged and determined to create good habits for success. However, very challenging right out of college without an established demeanor or market."
good,"As an intern at Northwestern Mutual, you become a licensed agent to sell life insurance. It is a wonderful start for college level students to gain serious knowledge of financial services. With access to many successful older representatives who have become licensed in many other areas of financial services to better serve clients, the cap on learning simply does not exist."
good,Northwestern Mutual is a great company. They will give you all the support you need to help you succeed and they are up front about the effort and how hard it is. It is up to you and how you conduct your business if you apply what they teach you. Sure commission jobs can be stressful it may take 3 months for a successful foundation but the rewards down the road can be great. High risk = high reward.
good,"NM is a fantastic company.  There are so many opportunities for advancement as long as you're willing to work extremely hard.  Senior level coworkers are encouraging, and have a work hard play hard mentality."
good,"Great place to work for driven individuals who think big picture long term and committed for long haul. Friendly staff, tons of potential for your career, endless potential."
good,A great place to work as a financial representative if you have a good personal market to reach out to. It is a tough self starting job that takes a lot of time and effort in the early stages to get off the ground. It is the type of job that has the potential for incredible success through hard work and (some) luck as it pertains to your market. Overall a great experience in terms of learning the importance of having an independent work ethic. Being successful is almost entirely up to the employee as there is not a lot of structure as to how to govern your work style.
good,The best of the best in the industry. Gold Standard for both life insurance and financial planning. I would not work for another organization within the industry.
good,"It is a great career but if you don't know a lot of people or you aren't in a postition to have months where you aren't making a lot of money then I would suggest another career. The workplace culture is amazing, the people there are nice and are willing to help you succeed. The hardest part of the job is calling people to try to convince them to have a financial planning meeting with you. The most enjoyable part of the job is the familial atmosphere among the employees."
good,"Great company to work for! They have a supportive team to work for and with. Interns make $100 a week and the commission that the intern can earn. The willingness to grow, develop, and to work hard is on the intern. This internship program is challenging but will develop very valuable skills. The amount of opportunity is limitless, even for interns!"
good,"Fast-paced, encouraging and hard-working environment. There is no base salary, but if you persistently put in hard work, you can succeed. Achieving that level of success is extremely rewarding."
good,"Lots of work but great experience, learned a lot and met some great people, would recommend for anyone going into sales or curious about the world of innsurance and financial planning."
good,"The business model provides the ability to create our own schedule and generate as much personal revenue. The training that the internship provided was phenomenal. Hands-on and provides you the soft skills to go out and perform. Again, this is a commission-based internship so your compensation is completely in your control. its just a matter of the individual being all in or not."
good,Great team environment. Very well supported and encouraged to succeed. Put on a course for success. This job is great for someone who can work independently and be consistent with their work.
good,I'm aware there is high turnover in that industry. Please provide new methods of mentoring new Representatives. Different ways of guiding individuals so they don't waste their time.
good,Personally the job didn't work out for me because it just didn't fit me right.  I enjoyed all of the people and the culture of the company.  North Western Mutual is a great company and if you put in the work it will pay off.
good,Although their is a lot of work involved on most of the team. Northwestern Mutual provides you with the opportunity for advancement and personal development. You will be putting in some hard work at time. There are time during the year where it's busier than others. i.e. Tax season. Job Security. lol
good,I worked for a very motivating and encouraging Financial Adviser. My supervisor and staff were very helpful and always willing to help. Northwestern mutual was a fast-pace work environment that always kept you on your toes. You continued to learn every day and were pushed to be the best employee you could.
good,"Phenomenal company with some of, if not, the best insurance products on the market.  You will work extremely hard your first several years but if you have what it takes will be extremely happy with the end result.  Its a people business.  Make sure you're able to effectively interact with multiple personality types and don't quit on a bad day.  You will have them.  It is a phenomenal feeling to impact peoples lives financially.  Also, if you want to take off early on friday or not come in at all, you can do whatever you want.  your success is ultimately up to you.  Phenomenal company to work for."
good,"The opportunity to build your own business with such a strong sponsor is a privilege. It can be tough calling on friends from high school you have not spoken to in 5 years, but the phone call can lead to more opportunities."
good,Northwestern gives you world class training. They expect world class performance.  Great leadership that supports you very well from both a resource and mindset standpoint.
good,NM is a wonderful company and the culture there is one of support and growth. The potential for growth is only as limited as one's willingness to work.
good,"- 30 minutes team minutes"
good,"Northwestern Mutual has a strong focus on technology to support the customer - recently transitioning manual and analog processes to technology driven solutions.  Some might perceive this as a lag in technology due to the lack of resources, financial or managerial support - rather it is due to the ability of satellite offices to continue to provide focused attention to the customer while keeping up with the rapid change in technology and how to utilize it effectively to grow their business.  This means there is a lot of opportunity.  Every employee has an opportunity to participate in solutions and be heard.   You are accountable to continue to educate yourself with (for example) changes in technology and the company provides multiple opportunities to do that.  Northwestern Mutual is involved with and cares about the community and there are many ways to get involved.  Overall Northwestern Mutual is a very solid company and a great place to work."
good,This job was simply instrumental in my development personally and professionally. The opportunity to make tremendous money while helping others can't be matched by any other similar company.
good,"Great overall company with open door policy from mentors and upper management. Like most sales positions, you get out what you put in. Company willing to pay for licences and training."
good,"I loved NML. Would definitely recommend this company/position FOR THE RIGHT PERSON. Make sure you have a strong network of people to call or you will be fighting an uphill battle. Best for career changers. If you are new to sales, they will teach you how to close deals but it takes time and lots of practice to become fully autonomous. The job can be disheartening as only 10% of your contacts will become a client on average so you must prospect relentlessly. They have a mandatory mentorship program which helps a lot."
good,"Good place to work once you have connections in the industry, great people, great management, and great support. Anyone who wants to work here should be prepared"
good,"I cannot say one bad thing about this company.  They care for their representatives, their staff, and each and every client the are able to help and the ones that they cannot."

good,This position helped push me as a person and move past my self-expectations. It allowed me to understand more about financial planning for the future and the importance of insurance.
good,At this time I don't care to share any experience. I will say that the culture of the company is revolving.  The company is very flexible and will work with your needs. There is always room for growth and opportunities for advancement.  They offer tons of classes and peers to work with you to reach the career goal you are looking for
good,This is one of the best companies I have ever worked for and I would still be working there if it wasn't for my own weaknesses.  They have a great support system and the products are the best in the industry.  You can see for yourself by the third party ratings.
good,"The environment was immediately very welcoming, and I did not at all feel like the was any aggressive competition. If anything the competition helped the productivity of the workers. The office was in a good area so there was much to do when on said break"
good,"Processing calls"
good,"The Dallas office is friendly and helpful.  "
good,Great co-workers and wonderful workplace culture. Hardest part of the job was doing the same tasks every day. The management was great - I never felt micromanaged.
good,"It's a difficult role.  B2C was not for me, but it is a great position for someone who can, financially, afford to invest about one year of time in order to create a large client base."
good,"If you already know you want to be a financial advisor this is the job for you. If not, you are basically bringing in your family members to try and sell them insurance."
good,"There was a great opportunity to learn as well as to advance to a insurance agent."
good,Must be interested in Finances and love sales. If you want an opportunity to create your own schedule and income this can be a great opportunity as long as you have the time and flexibility to build your own book of business.
good,"If you want to work at Northwestern Mutual, it can be a very fulfilling experience. The team is there to help you as much as possible, but be aware that nothing will be handed to you. You must be passionate about what you do, and be ready to never truly be off the job. The biggest thing is to always be able to put yourself out there and meet new people to expand your market."
good,I loved this company. I really felt that my co workers want to see new employees succeed. The managers are very friendly and willing to help when needed.
good,This was a wonderful internship opportunity that i'm happy I got to take part in. You get to dive head first into what its like being a financial advisor and running your own practice.
good,"typical work day is full of accomplishment, Cli, and client focus. Results driven, and looking to give the client the best possible client experience."
good,Wonderful mentors that were always willing to go out of their way to help you. Lots of learning on the job of the financial services industry. Best thing I learned how to do is complete the full sales process from contacting prospects to closing deals.
good,Love the company and mission behind what we do. It is a great opportunity for a driven individual Work harder now for a lifetime of perks your peers won't receive.
good,insurance sales and more insurance sales. the lines of business are essentially unlimited in this job. but the looming insurance quota makes it tough.
good,"Northwestern Mutual allows you to be your own boss and take your career into your own hands. I was empowered by management and more senior representatives. Everyone was willing to go out of there way to provide advice, guidance, or join you on meetings. Great place to learn."
good,"This employer provides an excellent place to work. Employees are truly shown their value through outstanding managerial support, and incredible benefits."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of calling on clients, setting up meetings to review their policies. There was training three times a week to go over language training and product training. The workplace culture was lively and a fun atmosphere to be a part of. The hardest part of the job was the research and preparation it took to get prospects to meet and discuss their personal financial situation. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to help people choose what was thought to be the best thing for them, financially wise."
good,"Very engaging, fast paced and exciting place to work.  The new work spaces are awesome.  It a perfect job for those who are just graduating college.  Great internship program."
good,"Weekly meetings with upper management (3), prospecting, and cold-calling are required.  You can make as much as you want if you are willing to work hard.  70+ hours a week at least."
good,Great experience that gave me some great connections in the field of insurance. It gave me a sense of what I wanted if I was to get into the sales field.
good,"Fantastic place to work. I was an intern here and the amount of support here is unmatched. Management truly cared and was wiling to go above and beyond to help you succeed. I would have loved to have made a career with this company. Unfortunately, being a financial advisor was just not for me."
good,"Work was busy and varied"
good,"It was very hard to get hired, but every NM reps proud to be with the company because of the reputation and products for the clients. In NM White Plains, we hang out every month for ""Happy Hour"". It feels like a family, where everyone share not only work problems but also each individual's personal issue. "
good,Through my job as an Administrative Assistant at Northwestern Mutual I have become refined my skills to communicate and problem solve as situations occur within the workplace. I have also learned to think on my feet as situations arise quickly. I have also developed skills that enable me to be both a leader and a trustworthy team player
good,"Work/Life balance is great. You are surrounded by great people. Was challenging because the commissions were so up and down. However, I really believe in this company and what they stand for."
good,"Overall, I can say that the work environment was very fulfilling.  All of my coworkers were very encouraging and supportive which made it a great place to work at."
good,"Terrific company that you can potentially make alot of money with, however it isnt for everyone. Must be able to pass your life accident and health test and get your license. The job has alot of freedom however requires you to have a good grasp on your work/life schedule."
good,Great Company to work for. Everyone is very helpful and wants to help you work towards achieving your goals. There is also top notch training that prepares you for your position.
good,"An amazing opportunity for those who want to work hard and work somewhat independently. This job requires considerable time to ramp up to the position of self reliance. intially there is much traing and oversight as their should be. In a years time I was at the top of my class with lives and premium, but the hours put in were well over forty hours a week."
good,"I learned more in my time at Northwestern Mutual than I believed possible, The speakers I had the privilege of learning and absorbing knowledge from have taught me lessons that will carry me throughout my career."
good,"The company is fantastic and the San Antonio office in particular is incredible. All coworkers are there to help and the boss of the office is a great leader. Helps anyway he can while also ensuring you are on the right track. The position itself is quite difficult and mentally taxing. It's not for everyone, just for people that are highly motivated."
good,"My experience at Northwestern Mutual has been incredible. A typical day starts at 7:30 and ends around 6:00 or 7:00. The first several hours are spent in the office at production or training meetings and contacting clients as well as prospective clients. The rest of the day is spent working with clients, pitching financial planning ideas, posting your activity for the day, and planning for the following day."
good,"In the time that I have worked here, I have enjoyed the environment as well as the employee interaction. Management has always been available and eager to help, I've learned a lot from them. The hardest part of the job would be keeping up with the quick pace. This is an all around good place to grow."
good,"Typical day at work"
good,Everything about this company is amazing if you can stick it out long enough to push past the gruesome 100% commision struggles during your first few years.
good,The opportunity is great but this business is extremely tough.  Very good place to work with high compensation for your production.
good,very difficult job to get up and running. but top tier training and a great support team will hope you along the way. they show you how easy being a financial rep can truly be but only if you develop daily habits and stick to them
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a phenomenal company which I am proud to hang my license with.  The company is conservative with a fantastic culture of doing the right thing for the client and growing the company through referrals from agents within the company."
good,"Northwestern Mutual is an easy going company, you are able to make your own hours and more or less be your own boss. However, it does require a good deal of work to be successful and if you do not produce you will be let go, as with everywhere."
good,"This is a job where you get out what you put in. If you are dedicated and disciplined, you can be very successful. Training was very quick and effective and the group of people were always positive and supportive. I gained experience in a corporate environment but also in running my own business. I developed personal skills in communication, self presentation, finance, and teamwork."
good,"The people I worked with were professional and exceptional in every way.  Everyone was intelligent, helpful and easy to work with.  Northwestern Mutual is a phenomenal company with good products and reputable personnel.  Compliance is very strict. On the down side, there have been so many changes with company software and apps that it was becoming increasingly difficult to feel competent with clients with a nearly constant learning curve for all of the upgrading.  These were major changes that would require quite extensive training.  In the last few years, it has been constant change in several areas. I rolled with the punches and got it done.  Other than that, it was a very pleasant place to work and I found it very easy to go in with a smile on my face (and leave that way, too)!"
good,"Although the pace is fast and the hours are long, Northwestern Mutual provides a friendly environment, always available mentor-ship and great leadership!"
good,Good people with a great working environment.  Northwestern offers opportunities and a great team to work with in Roseville.
good,perfect place to wok wonderful environment and plenty of room for advancement...valued employees and management..lovely place to retire from
good,"My job was summed up by meeting with families and talking about life and disability insurance. I would call the family and set up a time for a sit down meeting. At this first meeting we would sit down talk about what is important to them, and what things they already have in place. Then, the next meeting we would go over my recommendation that what best suite the family and the cost. Once the agreed to the pricing we would fill out a application and send it to underwriting. Finally, once that was approved I would deliver the policy to the now client. "
good,Northwestern Mutual does not need a review from me. Northwestern Mutual is one of the best companies in the industry and is a great place to build a financial services career.  The training they give you is top notch and it explains why every other insurance company wants to you to work with them if you have been trained at Northwestern Mutual.
good,"Working for Northwestern gave me an opportunity to learn how to challenge myself, think outside the box and define my skills to better prepare me for opportunities in the Insurance profession as well as those that require drive and an eagerness to learn.  A typical day was centered around ensuring that I was growing my book of business, making phone calls to schedule appointments, meeting people and learing to overcome objections.  My co-workers were very instrumental in helping me achieve the success I was looking to achieve, however, the hardest part of my job was to grow a natural market through referrals.  Overcoming challenges to ensure I was properly managing a client's file was the most satisfying part of my job."
good,"Great money, be your own boss, the people here are very friendly and the job is with a very prestigious company."
good,Weekly meetings lasted about one hour.  The financial advisors and financial representatives who ran the meetings were very successful.  My peers and leaders provided great information for me to have a successful business.  I enjoyed that whatever effort I put into my work that I was experiencing entrepreneurship and value.
good,"•	4-5 Client meetings daily"
good,"I thoroughly enjoy working at this company.  There are great opportunities to grow and earn commission.  The office culture here is fantastic, laid-back, work hard, but still have flexible time."
good,It is really beneficially for me to lean about life insurance and improve my Admin skills
good,"Excellent company overall!  Working at Northwestern Mutual (The Bender Financial Group) allowed me to gain a lot of experience in all fields of Finance, especially in investing and Retirement planning.  Everyone was very helpful which created a family like atmosphere.  Management was very helpful and flexible, which helped me build great managerial skills. "
good,"Strengthened the ability to phone for appointments and build instant credability with prospects & clients.  The office was filled with industry specialists that consistantly answered questions and offered their resources when preparing financial plans/recommendations."
good,"Make your own schedule"
good,Great supportive place to work and learn the fundamentals of running your own practice.  Holistic approach to establishing financial security through various products offered by Northwestern Mutual.
good,"Typical day at work involved doing follow up emails or phone calls to get prospects. I learned how to get someone on the Yes-train through systematically guided phrases and questions. Management is great, daily manager was a sweet person who was very helpful, while the boss gave a lot of room to take ownership of the project. Co workers were very helpful and supportive; they did not hesitate to share resources. Hardest part of the job would be getting No as an answer for multiple times in a row. The most enjoyable part of the job will be being given great autonomy to run the project and design our timeline."
good,"Professionally greeting all who come through the door or on the phone. Manage in-house front of office media screen by creating wmv from PPT presentations. Manage marketing materials and inventory of the same. Opening and managing sensitive mail and courier services. Order and manage office supplies. Annuity application input. "
good,"•	Internship"
good,Excellent sales experience at a young age is a wonderful building block for young college grads. 
good,"While this career has so many challenges, the rewards are beyond the financial compensation."
good,"Northwestern Mutual is an awesome experience and has taught me a key set of disciplines that can be applied in any job. Tracking numbers, setting goals, and being held accountable to what you say you're going to do is what the financial reps have to handle."
good,"Financial Representative,"
good,No two days are ever alike in this position. I have to stay very focused and organized in order to help run this business seeing how the financial rep I assist is a very optional person.
good,"I do not have too much information since I only did an internship, but the company was great to work for and I learned a lot to help me with my own future finances."
good,"Excellent company for the right person! As a recruiter I was not seasoned in my job, but the encouragment from my manager and coworkers was amazing! GREAT company!!!"
good,Great work environment. Strong encouragement from peers. Learned very much about insurance and investments. Mostly enjoyed being able to communicate with individuals about the ins and outs of financial products.
good,"Toss you to the wolves. I personally liked it because I was an entrepeneur. The work was tough and they help you along the way. Getting the lisences were the hardest part next to getting broke family members and friends to buy life insurance. Getting referrals is extremely difficult. Don't believe the hype, take the program for what it is."
good,"Fun with good management, there is a good training program. good start up place."
good,Working at Northwestern Mutual was a great experience and the kills I learned will help me in my career. The position was temporary but I hope to return permanently in the future.
good,Love the no drama atmosphere here. Everyone is very friendly and respectful.  Low stress and flexible work environment. Lots of appreciation and recognition.
good,"Fun and a cooperate feel ."
good,"If you an opportunity with this company, take it. The people are great as is the culture. It will open many doors for you. The work is challenging but the payoff is huge."
good,"NM is a large company with an family-oriented Midwest culture. Employees are encouraged to move around inside the organization to get experience in other areas. I was pretty challenged as an intern, and they made me part of the team."
good,"Northwestern Mutual has been around since the 19th century and continues to be one of the top companies in the financial services industry.  Whether you want to run a practice of your own, have a joint practice with another adviser, or serve in a supporting role, there are plenty of ways to make a great career with Northwestern Mutual.  There is an underlying mindset for everyone that is associated with Northwestern Mutual, and that is ""The client comes first.""  I believe that is why Northwestern has been able to thrive for so long."
good,"-Typical day of work was going into the office and leaving both on your own time, holding yourself accountable for doing the daily amount of work required"
good,Being a part of NWM you have the chance to be a part of something bigger. I love to hear the stories of how the company went out of their way to help their clients. My superiors were great as they gave humble advise and pushed us to grow continually.
good,I worked as an intern with Northwestern Mutual for a year. It was a great experience! I gained valuable knowledge about the financial planning industry.
good,Hard working atmosphere that emphasized the importance of team building as well as enjoying the work place. Work ethic and mission is what drives the people at Northwestern
good,"Loved the flexible hours, on-going coaching was a plus, I liked meeting new potential clients and helping current ones. The work environment is super professional and I felt welcomed."
good,"My college financial internship position at Northwestern Mutual was a great experience. I learned what it takes to operate successfully as a financial representative. This part-time experience was a great fit for my schedule as a full-time university student. Management was always willing to help me succeed and I was placed with a great mentor. Throughout the internship, I struggled to build my client base organically without having access to leads.  I enjoyed getting to know the company culture and helping clients reach their financial goals."
good,"A typical day at work involved meeting with clients, phone calls, scheduling, and other facets of running a business.  I learned a lot about sales as well as how to properly plan for clients and their needs.  Management was great, always allowed for bonuses and other compensation incentives.  Workplace culture was great, you can have a lot of different people from different backgrounds just absolutely crushing it and you feed off of that energy.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with rejection as well as prospecting.  Getting new people to call is the number one driver of this business. "
good,Not a bad place to work. This was something i did however many years ago so it is not the most relevant to my job history but people looking at getting into the financial industry this is a solid choice.
good,"I love my work although my manager is building his business and that leaves me working less than part-time.  Northwestern Mutual is an outstanding company with traditional values, catering to older clients, (visiting their homes for policy updates, etc..  I value my role but I am accustomed to working 40+ hours with benefits.  Independent agents work at the many locations and eventually build a great clientele.  I have been honored to be part of such a great company."
good,"If you're a hard worker that does not shy away from potentially failing, you will do very well here. The trainings are very efficient and in depth. The mentorship programs help to keep you motivated and there is a high level of autonomy."
good,"Best product out there for life insurance!  If I could do it again, I would try to sell only 65 life instead of 90 life to a younger crowd and maybe have been more serious about getting my 6, 63, & 7 series tests passed sooner to offer more products.  I would NOT have done it at the young age I was for a career not knowing many people that made much money (came from a retail environment before).  Straight commission makes it hard, but I still have my policies 19 years later and only 24 more left to pay on my 65L.  Happy with the cash value building up, but make sure you don't overinsure in case of job loss, etc.  Management was great.  Setting your own schedule was great.  Hardest thing is to make sales for people that don't want to talk about something they don't think they need until it is too late."
good,"Enjoyed working at Northwestern Mutual, just wasn't sure if it was for me. I am not very knowledgeable when it comes to insurance so it made it tough to sell to people close to me."
good,"The people at Northwerstern Mutual are great. The material can be hard at times but with the correct attitude, working hard and being passionate it can be a great place for a great career."
good,"Everyone was very kind and welcoming.I could not ask for a better team ranging from the director to the custodial team, even the IT support team. Never did I feel like I was not wanted or appreciated. It truly felt like a family working there. I think for me the most difficult part was having to attend to the many different work ethics of each individual financial representative. When I found myself frustrated or overwhelmed I had alongside someone dealing with the same amount of stress/workload, which reminded me that I was able to accomplish any task and that I was not alone. Our needs were always met whether it be a computer breaking down or running out of snacks in the office snack drawer. In conclusion, I would have to say having ""family lunch"" as we called it was my favorite along with the monthly birthday lunch provided by the director of the office. She was the best of the best!"
good,Great place to work if you have the friend group or connections to build a market for yourself. Being on 100% Commission can be very hard but very rewarding too.
good,The company is a well positioned and well managed company with a leadership team that cares about the little guy. The area manager once hired me in high school to do manual labor and joined me in the hot Texas sun because he wanted to pitch in on his own task.
good,"Autonomy, flexible hours and high degree of pay. Great coaches and great mentors. Online Company website has great resources to practice, learn and educate yourself."
good,"Northwestern Mutual allows you to keep your own entrepreneurial-like schedule.  A typical day involves phoning, scheduling, and meeting with clients.  The firm really focuses on development to help people grow their practice."
good,Amazing culture and values. Great experience!! I learned how to interact with clients and build relationships. A typical day at work would be making phone calls and seeing people.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Northwestern Mutual.  I learned a lot about insurance, the insurance marketplace and how to develop a business.  Overall, I would recommend."
good,Working under a large corporate umbrella like NWM is great - but you also get the benefit of working for an independent agent as your direct supervisor/boss.
good,Learned how to manage my time and work with clients one-on-one. The most enjoyable part of the day was working with other advisors and learning tips to help me in the future.
good,Learn a lot and work with some great people. Flexible hours and you get compensated for the amount of work and effort that you put in. For people that aren't afraid to make cold calls.
good,I had a great experience at Northwestern but I just realized insurance was not what I wanted to do. The work place and leaders in the building are there to help you succeed.
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a great company. You pretty much run your own business and work as much or as little as you want as long as you are producing. In the beginning it requires a ton of hard work, but once you get in a grove and know what you are doing your business can run itself. A lot of the people who have been there a while are great at what they do. It is stressful in the beginning but if you're successful it is a really rewarding job."
good,"Unbelievable work experience. It was an incredible place to work, with amazing people alongside of me. They were very motivational and helpful all of the time."
good,"Great co-workers; heavy sales focus (which I didn't enjoy, but some do); good benefits; great training program; supportive and competitive environment"
good,Wonderful office full of kind helpful people. Foosball table in case you need a stress free break. Plenty of smart driven people to learn from. Would recommend Norwalk's office to anyone.
good,Very good at allowing us to grow within the company as well as employees. Good pay and good culture to challenge us and gave us great training on how to be successful.
good,"The culture of the company was laid back but competitive at the same time. Management made you want to work hard and grow your practice, and if you didn't put in the work you had little chance to succeed. This culture was one that I thrived in because I am very competitive and always want to out work the person sitting next to me. The reason I left, was because the Internship took up too much time from school and it became difficult run a club sport, do my school work, and  do the internship as well."
good,The position of Financial Representative is commission based. The work involved early on needs to be focused on networking and meeting as many potential clients as you can. If you don't fill up your pipeline enough or aren't seeing the right type of people your income will suffer.
good,"Great company and leadership, Takes a lot of conviction to diligently get in front of people and show them the process. There are a lot of people willing to help get you where you need to be"
good,Before starting in this industry I would tell anyone that is contemplating on working as a representative to be aware of the fact that this is a compensation job in which you have to be wary of low income through long stretches of low production.
good,40 dials everyday. Keep 4-5 meetings a day. Set 5 meetings a day for the following week. Meeting with clients and addressing their financial needs by taking them through our process.
good,"Currently week 4 as a financial representative for NWM. My first 3 weeks I've provided my office with double digit points, remarkable as an intern."
good,"A very competitive career to be in, however, once you develop a network of people to work with, the possibilities are endless. If you have a job for a few years and develop a network it would be easier for you to grow you business."
good,"The veteran reps are always willing to lend advice and help to the new / incoming reps. You get out of the career 10x what you put in, if you are willing to work hard."
good,"At Goodwin, Wright the message is all about work ethic which is a great focus for the office culture to be centered around. During my time there, I picked up many vital habits that not only helped in my working profession, but in life as well."
good,"This is a commission based position and requires a certain social personality, sales technique, and persistence to excel. This can be very luctrative to those that put in the work."
good,"One of the few places in my career that I enjoyed going to work every day.  The managers had high work standards but at the same time fun to work for.  I could organise my workload, without being micromanaged.  I could always rely on a team member when needed help.  Most importantly it was an environment where I was appreciated for my input and valued for the contribution I made to the firm."
good,"A typical day would consist of working with leaders, training, interviewing and coaching the sales force (financial advisors). I worked closely with the managing directors, managing partner, director of training and the leaders to maintain alignment and deliver support and resources to the sales force. I learned that building trust is about following through, leading by example and genuinely caring about your team. The hardest part of the job is the relentless dedication to clear communication and expectations. When communication breaks down or expectations are not clear its creates uncertainty. Unfortunately, as a leader you must deliver difficult or challenging feedback; I learned as long as the truth is told in a nice manner, you followed through on your word and you truly care about your people, you can maintain respect. My leadership roles have been enjoyable because I've watched people grow personally and professionally. I've had the pleasure of building teams and watching them come together to hit high goals."
good,It's what you make of it. It can be fun and positive if you work hard. If you slack off you will make no money and be miserable. The management and advisers are great.
good,"Leaving for personal reasons, couldn't speak highly enough about my experience with them. Lots of mentoring, one on one help, plenty of support from co-workers, teamwork based atmosphere. Loved the trainings and learned a lot."
good,"It is an exciting experience to know that the work you do for Northwestern matters in peoples lives. My whole life I was so used to doing academic work and to get introduced into the financial services industry through Northwestern Mutual was a great opportunity because the work I did mattered. Even those who did not buy defensive investment products from me, they will remember the Northwestern Mutual name and hopefully remember the positive experience they had working with me."
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a great place to work with great people and a competitive workplace environment. As an intern, you must work but good things will happen if you put in the time."
good,"Meeting new clients, helping them achieve financial goals, and putting a plan in place are all very rewarding in this internship. Hard work and self motivation are a must!"
good,"Great company to work for. Friendly staff and home office is always there to assist you. Every year we have annual meeting up in Milwaukee, its a great learning opportunity and it's also tons of fun."
good,The people that I worked with were very fun but they also did their work very efficiently. When ever I has a question I could ask many people with out hesitation and they would always help and guide me in the right direction.
good,Northwestern Mutual culture is extremely warm and welcoming. They provide world class training to help their representatives perform to the best of their abilities.
good,If you have insurance needs or investment needs go to Northwestern Mutual to meet your needs. The financial advisers and their staff are very knowledgeable.
good,"This is the review of a former employee who didn't quite make it.  It's the chance of a lifetime.  The training, resources, technology, mentoring, work culture. . . all of it is nigh unbeatable.  I was working nine to ten hour days with a smile on my face.  They give you the best possible chance to succeed on your own terms.  I didn't make it because I wasn't successful at getting my natural market to take action.  That is the key.  All the work is for nothing if you don't get your people to move forward with their financial goals."
good,"I discovered that Northwestern Mutual has a great work environment, the reps and staff were terrific and the products they offer are excellent.   My tenure there was short but I enjoyed learning about the company."
good,Northwestern really allows you to learn a lot about what you like in the financial services industry and makes sure to provide you with all the tools you may need.
good,"Working at Northwestern Mutual was a total gift because though I moved on in career, my co-workers were the hardest things to leave behind. Our managing partners were all top notch and made sure to know all employees by name and maintain an open-door-policy feel."
good,"Is a sales and commission job as a financial representative. You are not at a desk all day. Job involves meeting clients and traveling to them. Hardest part is working hard every day pushing yourself. Pay is commission, so if you are not selling you won't have a job for long.  You get to set your schedule mostly."
good,"NM is a great place to work!  The benefit package is top notch.  There is an onsite health care facility, workout facility and free lunches everyday.  The employees are engaged and extremely talented."
good,"Northwestern is a Challenging, rewarding, and fun place to start or transition your career.  The training curriculum is strong and support system is awsome."
good,Working at Northwestern Mutual was a new experience they do a great job training and allowing you to manage yourself without having to be watched over. Overall good expierence
good,"From the firing process, to the benefits, to the day to day experiences, NM works to drive home employee engagement.  As a whole the company makes decisions that are the right thing to do.  They provide numerous educational and training opportunities that are the foundation of their employee improvement process.  "
good,Amazing work environment and great people to work with and I would highly recommend to anyone looking at this company.
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a great company, no doubt about it.  Although I don't work there anymore I still keep in touch with all my old co-workers and I still hold insurance with them, which should tell you something.  I worked there as a full-time financial rep for a year, and I enjoyed my time.  The training and support is great, but this is a commission only job, which is my only caveat and reason for leaving."
good,"Amazing workplace. Great work/life balance and culture within the office. Leadership team leads by example and is experienced from within. Flexibility within your schedule as a staff member but more so as an financial representative. Access to unlimited resources, top training and continuing education. Many opportunities for growth as long as your individual business is thriving and growing. By the far the best career experience I have had thus far. The most challenging, but even more rewarding career."
good,"You basically create your own business within an excellent and well established company. The sales skills you learn, and the great training that they offer, gives you invaluable experience and knowledge that will forever be useful for the rest of your career."
good,"We dial from 9am to 10:30am. After that our time is dedicated to appointments that we have booked for that day. A day at work is very smooth with a comfortable environment. I have learned to manage my time and how to build a holistic financial plan for someone. The management was very helpful and was always there when needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work with all different types of people, but the hardest was actually setting those appointments with those people."
good,"Typical day was 9-5."
good,"Treats employees well and provides industry leading benefits. It is a huge local employers that pays high wages and provides daily free lunch to all employees.  However, the corporate structure is ridged."
good,"I was an intern with Northwestern Mutual. They are the best insurance company in the Nation. They really cared about how I was doing, and the relationships I was making with my clients. Compensation was good, but based off commission. But, they train you and make sure you are ready to sell insurance products."
good,"I love this company, just in a money crunch and can't  fathom not being able to not know when I will be financially secure. Everything else is amazing."
good,"A typical day at work includes administrative work before hours, phoning until 10am, and client meetings for the rest of the day.  I learned how Northwestern does their comprehensive financial planning as well as insurance sales.  Everyone at the company is great to work with and it feels like a family environment even at the agency level.  The hardest part of the job is networking and finding new clients.  Building up a book of business is incredibly difficult unless you have a large network that trusts you from the beginning. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to help people reach their financial goals on a daily basis."
good,You'll either sink or swim fairly quickly.  You will also know if this is for you within the first two months.  Great experience for learning how to cold-call and introduction to sales.
good,"My typical day at work was making phone calls, setting meetings, going to meetings, and go over my work done throughout that day. "
good,"The skills learned at Northwestern Mutual are invaluable and will help and professional in their chosen career. I learned multiple Microsoft Office platforms, sales skills, client relations, money management, asset allocations, time management."
good,"Enjoyed learning new technologies. Clients always accepted new ideas and gave freedom to developers."
good,"Its a fast paced learning curve to any new comers but there is a good amount of incentive to get commissions."
good,Northwestern Mutual is a great job and has a great work life balance.  It is just a little difficult to have no base pay.  You are full commission and its an all or  none thing.
good,"You as business owner are in charge of your own production. Management is very helpful in the start up which is nice however, the pay the first couple months is frustrating due to the commission only pay style."
good,"A typical day at Northwestern Mutual is systematic and flexible at the same time. Financial representatives have the freedom to adjust and dictate their daily schedules, but are held accountable for their activity. Everyday is a learning experience whether it's the insurance aspects regarding risk management, insight on the investment market, or even new perspective on other peoples' incentives and motives. Management at Northwestern Mutual is exceedingly competent. They are friendly, approachable, and have vast knowledge concerning new and old problems alike. The hardest part of this job is trying to illustrate the long term importance (or even the importance at all) of this process to people who do not have that foresight. Prospects and clients who don't show up for meetings, call back, or respond in a timely manner is also somewhat frustrating. For me personally, the most enjoyable features of this career is the support system of coworkers and the more technical responsibilities of planning. Even if you're having a bad day, there is always someone willing to talk and laugh. This moment of distraction provides the opportunity to reevaluate the situation and approach the problem from a different angle. My favorite activities regarding this career are running the financial planning software for clients, since I am more technically oriented. This includes inputing numbers and assumptions in the Personal Planning Analysis and customizing insurance illustrations."
good,Northwestern Mutual is a great place to have a career with life long friendships.
good,Excellent work environment and the best training I've ever received. Everyone there really tried to help in every way possible. To start any business from the ground up it takes a long time. Unfortunately I couldn't sustain the roller coaster ride and had to take a step back but left with an open door for the future.
good,"This was a great experience and first taste of sales, both the benefits as well as the potential downfalls of being in a competitive sales environment.  Learned the ins and outs of the financial services industry from one of the highest rated companies in the business."
good,"Northwestern Mutual is one of the strongest companies in the country and they also have a very strong internship program. Learned so many things that will help and stay with me for the rest of my life. "
good,"The people are great, the job is tough. Everyone at NWM truly believes in themselves and the products they sell."
good,"Manages a team of Financial Representatives who serviced a client base of more than 8,000."
good,"I enjoy working there, learned a lot as an intern. However, I don't see a lot of growth within the Chicago office, hence I quit."
good,This is a great place for the right person.  it is difficult to start out but if you can establish your client base the compensation can be amazing.
good,"It was a challenging workplace with a great potential to advance.  The values of the company are amazing. Day to day I would call potential clients, go on meetings and help make financial plans.  The job is all commission."
good,"Administrative Assistant"
good,"Not for everyone, it is long hours up front and a fight to stay in the career, but it is 100% worth trying and a rewarding opportunity regardless of how long you are there."
good,"Northwestern Mutual is an amazing company with a great heart and a perfect mission ""to enrich the lives of those we serve"". The value of constant mentoring and the easily approachable leadership team have made working for the company a wonderful experience that I feel is few and far between in Corporate America. My co-workers and I work together to achieve the agency's recruiting goal and strive to help each other grow through constant coaching.The hardest part of the job is the long hours, but that is said with a grain of salt because the work is so enjoyable. The best part of the job is most definitely the work culture."
good,Northwestern mutual is a great company with a solid track record. This was a sales role which required many hours of cold calling and meeting with prospective clients.
good,"I worked with CFPs/ JDs and Wealth Managment Advisors in the strategic development of client portfolios, focusing on retention and growth through strong servicing. As a team we actively collaborated in the strategic management of a portfolio of 900+ affluent / high net worth clients. My job was servicing of existing and prospective customers, including special accounts; contacted clients to address renewal of optimal investments as well as pending file/account issues. I learn how to manage an office, work under pressure of different management styles. The hardest part was having to learn all the procedures fast and not make any mistakes, but this was also the most enjoyably part of my job."
good,I learned more about being a professional in the summer internship program than I have in the rest of my work-related experience.
good,"Great company to work for, outstanding business culture and core values throughout the entire company which shows in its customer reviews. Best thing learned while employed is talking to people as if they are human, they might not fully understand at first your intent, but doing what is right for that individual is what it is all about. The best part about the job is getting your clients to start thinking strategically with their finacial planning and witnessing that ahh ha moment when they realize what they are capable of doing."
good,"Great company with unlimited opportunities. The culture, people and career are excellent. I enjoyed being able to meet with multiplle people a day to help them accomplish financial security. The only downside of the career was the slow start-up and 100% commision based."
good,"You will succeed here if you have uncommon drive and great connections.   It is a flexible job but you must put in a lot of effort or you will not make much money. Good culture and good opportunity, but I must stress that the vast majority of people are not suited for this job. It's a numbers game just to get to the point that some good luck will push you through to success. It can be extremely stressful if you are the only moneymaker in the household."
good,"you get out what you put in. 100% commission based. If you don't work, you don't get paid. Must be motivated self starter. Must make LOTS of calls all day every day."
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a phenomenal place to launch your career. The products are world-class, as well as the training program and leadership team. I highly recommend seizing the opportunity to work here if you are given the chance."
good,"this company stands for many values that I personally believe in. Not only did I grow in my career and grow professionally, but I also grew personally. In addition, the company culture is truly unbeatable."
good,Being a college intern gives you so many opportunities to advance and succeed at Northwestern. It can lead to a full time offer to be a financial representative. There’s training and mentorships to help you advance
good,"This is a job where you are physically running your very own financial practice. That being said, if you do not have a strong work ethic it will be hard for you to advance and make any money."
good,"Loved the work that was being done, felt impactful but at the end of the day I just didn't do enough to make it work full time here. With it being fully commission, it was tough for me financially with not selling much."
good,Very professional co-workers and just an overall great environment to report to daily.  A real pleasure working with all the individuals at this location.
good,"The environment in our area is very fun. I'm excited to go to work each day. The management staff is awesome, approachable, and treat you like the adult that you are."
good,"This is a great opportunity for someone who is looking for more than your typical 9-5 , employee experience. If you’ve got a curiosity about being your own boss and are a life-long learner who wants to go places and see things a regular job won’t allow you should check this opportunity out. If you like to help people and want to positively impact your community and your fellow man and make good money do it!"
good,Its a friendly work environment that is both competitive and comfortable with a strong work/life balance. They offer tremendous products and services for financial security.
good,"It's a great place to work, the environment is very relaxed and the management is good. The hardest part of the job is building up your book of business. If you are ok with cold calling, and reaching out to friends, family, neighbors, and people you barley knew in high school, then you will do great at this job. You have to be pretty outgoing, and enjoy developing relationships if you want to succeed in this industry."
good,"I was screened, interviewed and accepted as a intern to work for Northwestern Mutual beginning in August. This internship was voted as the #4 internship in the United States in 2017 and #10 in 2018 by Vault."
good,The different advisors I worked for were flexible with my schedule since I had kids.  I learned a lot from the different conferences I went to and enjoyed working with other associates
good,"We in the IAM team worked on SSO and MFA implementations following SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework) methodologies. Working on incidents, Change Management, Implementations and Integrations with vendor based and home grown applications creating centralised access policies are my typical responsibilities."
good,"This Top 10 nationally ranked internship program required a two-week training program to provide necessary business skills to be a successful intern, as well as preparation for state insurance licensing exams. Important skills acquired during this program include: language, marketing, client building, finance, phoning, prospecting, and presenting. All the skills learned were focused towards being a more successful business individual, but more specifically, a successful salesperson."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time at Northwestern Mutual and only left due to a necessary relocation.  The career advancement possibilities are amazing if you are willing to study and take advantage of them.
good,"Superior firm to other risk management providers. Excellent in every category possible: training, management, resources, etc. Hardest part: getting off the ground due the nature of the work and commission only payment"
good,"The Newport Network office provides excellent training for interns and career changers. Process, workflow and expectations are addressed upfront as well as continuous follow up with production and support to help realize company requirements and the reps financial goals."
good,"I learned about financial planning and build up investment portfolio for clients. The working culture is good, everyone is very willing to help you and train you. They have good training program."
good,"I worked as a College Financial Planner or ""intern"" for Northwestern Mutual, but this was nothing like your typical internship. Northwestern Mutual allows their College Financial Planners to go out and advise families and individuals just like most financial advisers. However, they are still required to become certified to sell the products they work with and are advised closely by experienced advisers. I learned more from working at Northwestern Mutual than anywhere else and it truly pushed me to become a better person and professional. Great people to work with and a supportive environment to work in."
good,It is a great place to work and I love the people here! I have my own work space even as an Intern and I was always treated with respect. The culture at Northwestern Mutual is always been so amazing.
good,"Free lunch, up-to-date equipment/computers, excellent managers!  Nice co-workers to work with that are respectful and helpful.  It's always a team effort."
good,The Golden Rule applies and those working at NM are very conscientious of the philosophies and goes out of their way to ensure clients and fellow team members are treated incredibly well.
good,"As an Intern at Northwestern Mutual I learned a lot with real work experience. Northwestern Mutual provided plenty of training to help me become a successful Financial Adviser. At the beginning of my internship I did a lot of calling and setting up meetings, but as the internship progressed I went through several different real job experiences to help me get the feel of what being a Financial Adviser is really like. Overall it was a great experience and I enjoyed it."
good,Hard place to work but worth the benefits. Managing director is great and everyone is generally very nice and hard working. Easy to control your own salary.
good,"Taught me a lot about the sales process and time management. After getting the Life and Health producer licenses and a week of education about the position, they send you out to the wolves with a sales quota so it's up to you how well you perform and succeed."
good,Working here was very different from my previous jobs . we learned a lot about how to have meetings with potential clients and how to help them with financial planning.
good,"It was a great experience, every where you turn is great people and all the knowledge you need to succeed is right down the hall way. it just wasn't the best fir for me living off of commission only."
good,"The environment is really nice, great colleagues and experience. A lot of training, information to study and learn, the leadership is really welcoming."
good,"This is an exciting and important time to be a part of Northwestern Mutual. We're strong, innovative and growing; we want you to grow with us. People are the power behind Northwestern Mutual, and diversity makes that power even greater. We are committed to providing a diverse, inclusive environment where all of us can realize our individual potential."
good,"The drive and care that is in the culture of this company is incredible. I enjoyed being a part of it but at the end of the day, the work just was not for me. I was very sad to leave but it was an incredible experience and I highly recommend it. They definitely help prepare you to succeed."
good,You control your future in this business. If you have a strong desire to succeed it is possible with this company. You make your schedule and can work from home.
good,"NML cares about its employees. It is a great place to develop and grow a career. NML is a bit of a slower pace work environment; however, so if you plan to work here for an extended period of time and then leave to a faster pace company, be prepared. Vice vera; if you come from a fast pace work enviorment, you will learn to be patient and take more time for yourself. Try not to get frustrated with that if your expectations are different."
good,used off site systems to gather info.
good,Workplace culture is non-competitive. Everyone willing to help. Friendly environment. Enjoyed my role immensely. Worked with little to no supervision but supervisor always available for questions. Hardest part of the job was managing FR expectations and tracking down paperwork for operations functions. Most enjoyable part of the job was the MP. Very friendly and takes care of his employee's well-beings.
good,"I was an intern and it certainly felt like they used the interns to bring in business for the full time reps once we left, but it was a good learning experience and they internship managers helped me secure the job I have today. Great Internship for a new business professional."
good,It is a lot of hard work but the longer you are there the less work it becomes. The people are the best part of working here. I enjoy coming to work with my co-workers.
good,"The work is time consuming, but very rewarding.  Everyone was very supportive and wanted to help push you.  Overall,  Working at NM was a great experience."
good,"The biggest item learned in a career at Northwestern Mutual is human nature.  You will know what people are going to do/say before it ever comes out of their mouth.  "
good,Great way to get going in a financial planning industry. Culture is amazing! Very hard to get going if you are not used to prospecting and managing a work/life balance.
good,"I worked for over a year for a financial representative at Northwestern Mutual. Everything about the job was fair and I enjoyed the work. Management was supportive and helped me learn the skills I needed to succeed. The culture was very friendly and inviting. The hardest part of my job was that it was difficult for me to advance without becoming a financial representative myself. Since I didn't want to take the risk of a commission-only job, I felt stuck in my advancement and so I decided to move on after I finished my college degree."
good,"Working for Northwestern Mutual was as rewarding as it was challenging. The perfect payoff! I benefited from knowing the ins and outs of insurance policy as a whole, whether it be what was most necessary for me at what time or what will pay me back the most in the long run when the time comes. I received amazing leadership that made networking easy and enjoyable, and was able to realize the value I was making in others' lives."
good,"You build your own business, yes.  You control your activity and who you meet with, and how many, yes.  But I've never worked somewhere like this where there was so much support.  It seems that everyone wants you to be successful and is willing to help any way they can, even other advisors.  It's always all about the people, yes, and every firm will probably vary.  I worked in Raleigh, NC.  Yet, the Northwestern Mutual way is a needs-based approached to clients, helping people today, who will help you make a great living tomorrow.  It is not transactional.  It is focused on planning, not necessarily selling, though that is the core of it as far as income."
good,It was a challenge at first but even though you do face the difficulties of phoning potential clients and starting your own financial practice I worked with so many great people who were willing to help me with my development while I was apart of this program. Great culture and a great learning opportunity.
good,"Working for Northwestern Mutual was a real treat, the staff was amazing and the reps there were very helpful while I was conducting my work. Overall an encouraging and helpful work environment."
good,Northwestern Mutual is one of the best companies to work for on the planet. It has great benefits for everyone and also has great career opportunities. The culture and the work environment are so great.
good,"During my internship at Northwestern Mutual over the spring 2017 semester, I was able to build a network and interact with clients and other students on a daily basis. Working closely under the recruiting director, I was able to be her right hand while representing and advertising the company. I enjoyed working in a professional setting and feeling like I was part of the team and not just an intern. I loved that I was included in both work and out of office activities. Everybody was friendly and willing to help when it was needed. I was given tasks that full time employees perform and I loved the challenge."
good,"If you want to call yourself a financial advisor, expect to really earn it.  They don't give you clients.  You have to find your own.  While it isn't easy, it's rewarding."
good,"I learned how to interact with potential clients and how to properly assist them with their financial needs. The hardest part for me was getting people to sit down with me and talk about their financials. The most enjoyable part of this job was working with your own schedule. Whenever I had time, that's when I worked. I didn't have a set schedule everyday."
good,Good place to work.  I was in the Spring College Intern Training Program so I was not able to devote as much time and effort to the position had it been my full time job. Good experience.
good,"The Managers suck with their adherence to the policy and creating policy of their own. But they are good with being consistent in certain job duties such as motivating employees."
good,"Definitely a company for you to grow as a person as well as a business-minded individual."
good,"Great benefits, friendly people, wonderful staff, enjoying working in a business causal environment. Access to the health clinic for employees and credit union."
good,"Was there for a spring internship. Training is great, learned a lot. HR department is motivating. Mentors spend time to enhance skills. Everyone is calm and fun to work with."
good,This was a fantastic internship that properly prepared their interns to start their own financial consulting business. The great management team and support is what made this internship so supportive and successful.
good,"This company is in Milwaukee and has a very nice job culture. Loved to work there. "
good,"The company culture of serving others cannot be beaten. This is also backed by the highest rated insurance company with  multitude of products to fit anyone's need. They treat others with respect and get to know them on a personal level to build a lifelong relationship. Also, the autonomy of your work week allows work-life balance."
good,"I loved my time at Northwestern Mutual. The people there truly were, and still are, like family to me. I felt so comfortable there from day one. I highly recommend this place to people with strong Administrative Professional skills who like a good challenge and a big splash of fun on a regular basis."
good,"The people that I had the pleasure of working with at Northwestern Mutual Insurance and Finance company were some of the most genuine, hard working, down to earth and really intelligent people I have met."
good,"-Great coworkers"
good,It is a great bank to work in they have stayed in the competition and proving themselves.the management there is good and returns most of its profit to the investors.
good,"Working here offers a lot of independence and flexibility. You are constantly surrounded by like-minded people who are always willing to help you out. Everyone is very transparent, and no one is trying to step over someone else."
good,Flexibility scheduling outside of occasional set training meetings allowed for freedom and work flow unmatched by most any profession. Time management techniques were heavily utilized with this experience.  Team management was incorporated into finalizing sales.  Leaving proficiency in their work up to me to insure correctness in recommendations made.
good,"Northwestern Mutual is an incredible company.  Great environment, great culture, great team work. "
good,"The Northwestern Mutual, Buffalo Office encouraged an environment that was supportive of every intern's hopes and aspirations along with challenging them to reach outside of their comfort zones in order to grow as professionals managing their own businesses under Northwestern Mutual."
good,"Very strong company financially and culturally.  We do things the right way, always in the clients best-interests."
good,"The McTigue Financial Group, part of Northwestern Mutual, is an excellent work environment where I consistently feel valued and inspired to maintain a level of excellence."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Northwestern Mutual. Great working environment with tools available for a successful and prosperous career.
good,Excellent company with a sales driven atmosphere. If you are passionate about people and helping them bridge the gap (on a financial level) then this may be the company for you.
good,"Great place to work due to welcoming office environment. However, sales isn't for everyone and pay is almost 100% commission. Everyone in the office is willing to help you and they all hold business ethics at the highest standard."
good,Excellent place of employment for all levels. Everyone is so friendly and knowledgeable. Management treats you like one of their own and does not care about your title.
good,The people are what make this company.  If your looking for a place to start as a financial representative in a supportive and family friendly environment this is it
good,"The objective of the job was to assist people with their financial planning needs by taking them through a series of questions and matching a product or idea as a solution. In order to advance it required constantly meeting good people to share your ideas. "
good,"Great place to work. Entrepreneurial, fast-pace, supportive environment. Must be a hard worker! It is not an easy career."
good,A career with Northwestern Mutual can be extreemly rewarding for the right person
good,learned a lot about the business and ways to improve business.
good,"My daily tasks were answering phone calls, seating clients, watering plants twice a week, cleaning dishes at the end of the day, and light dusting once a week."
good,Very Good - Commission based position. Very difficult to make any sort of steady income
good,"As a Contracting Coordinator, I was able to take charge of my position and find new and more efficient ways to do things. I learned how to look for problems and come up and implement solutions. The management staff was very supportive and made a point to meet individually with each employee to check in and help in any way they could."
good,"Overall it was a great opportunity to better my skills in the insurance field as well as marketing myself as a person to others.  The internship extended from May of 2013 to August of 2013.  During this time frame I was focused on selling Life Insurance and other products to possible clients in the Richmond, VA area."
good,It was a very challenging internship that took a lot of hard work and effort but at the end of the day I am better for going through the financial representative internship process.
good,I would make phone calls in the morning. Then go out and meet with the clients for the day. Come back to the office and do paperwork.
good,You are choose your own hours.They have very flexible management as well. You have no salary cap you can make as much as you want as long as you work hard.
good,"Northwestern Mutual is not for the lazy. It is a typical sales company with a great commission system. Anyone can be successful...but they have to know people and be extremely social (sales personality types)."
good,"A typical day for me at Northwestern Mutual was meeting with clients discussing their goals and dreams and taking a deep look into their financial position and giving them recommendations on how to achieve their goals and dream. "
good,"Referal based leads is the only thing that makes it difficult to succeed here. Very professional work environment. Excellent training program, great support."
good,"Great management, great people to work with and for. Top priority in job is prospecting new clients and building your own financial planning business.  Great co workers and the independence is great."
good,"-A typical day consists of me making phone calls to 10-15 people to try to set up meetings for lunch, dinner, coffee, etc, so I could discuss with them their financial goals and to see if they were in the market to become one of my clients."
good,Enjoyed the co-workers and the opportunity for success based on your performance.
good,"Answering phones, daily office tasks, also recruiting was a big part of my position.  I would search websites such as Indeed, Monster, etc looking for potential employees."
good,"Northwestern is an excellent place to be, but you will only be happy there if you are in to sales. They will give you all the training and help develop all the skills you need in order to be successful, but no matter what they say, a the end of the day, you're an insurance salesman. They do not provide you any leads, and it is referral based only. Great people, great support, they will do anything for you to help you be successful."
good,"Once i first interviewed for this job i knew it was a good fit, everyone is extremely nice, smart and always willing to help. this is a great company to help learn and grow personally and individually. after working here the last year and a half i have learned alot about the industry and the people in it. Northwestern Mutual is and always has been a customer first company. i have never worked for a company who treat their employees with such respect before it was a great thing to have."
good,"Its a great plave to work if you are self motivated and hard working. the compensation is very attractive and I think its one of the Last great opportunities out there. If you take it seriously and work hard, you can achieve Financial Security for you and your family and live the life you always wanted to. But you will only get out what you put into it."
good,"Northwestern Mutual is a great company. There are many opportunities from admin assistant to Financial Representative. If you are a motivated, self-starter and care about relationships, this is a great career."
good,Northwestern Mutual Grand Blanc is a excellent place to work. Everyone that works in the office is extremely nice and willing to help. The management style is lax and knowledgeable.
good,"NMFN is a high volume financial firm here in Dallas, recruiting for this top agency has been a great opportunitity and challenge for me. The environment here is very encouraging, everyone working really hard to achieve very high goals set for themselves, while still having a healthy bit of competition. I have thoroughly enjoyed working with the internship program here, helping college students find the best fit for their internship needs. In addition to recruiting on college campuses, I also had the responsibility to hire full time candidates as well."
good,-Training activities from 7-9am
good,Management is very supportive and aids in your success. Great mentorship program.
good,I am currently a student working as a sales intern at NW Mutual. The training and individual attention has been great to develop my personal skills. I expect that this experience will equip me for a promising future.
good,"I enjoyed every second while employed at Northwestern Mutual. The training was world class, the support was second to none and the opportunity to make a decent living was more than a possibility. Starting the intern program directly after graduating was great. I got real world experience in a professional setting and I learned alot about what it takes to manage time effectively, market my skills and abilities all while helping others to achieve their financial goals as well. If you are looking for a GREAT place to work, then give Northwestern a try."
good,"This is the BEST company for the right person. You have to be willing to work hard and put in the work. No one I knew had a financial plan until NM entered my life, and I've been able to help so many people. If you're the type of person that works hard, wants to make a difference, and doesn't want to hit a ceiling, then this is the best place for you to be."
good,The internship program challenges students in the area of life insurance sales and financial planning. There is a lot of knowledge to be absorbed and management is very helpful.
good,Call clients to check in and see how they are doing while also calling new prospects. While doing that you want to make sure during the first meeting that you explain the services very detailed and make sure the client understands what they are meeting you for
good,A great culture environment. Work - life balance. Excellent benefits and management. A business to professionally grow. Employees support for improvement and innovation. The most enjoyable part of the job is team work.
good,"To begin your employment at Northwestern Mutual, the pay will be minimal because it is predominantly commission-based.  As a long-term career, I believe that it is a fantastic place to work. Your clients pay you yearly, so once you build that base, your income is residual. It takes a few years, but if you are patient, you can earn a fantastic income. Short-term, it is difficult; long-term, it is one of the best corporations you can work for."
good,The people at Northwestern Mutual are great to be around and they become more than just coworkers. I run my own business practice with the help of others at the office. I learned how to contact people and become comfortable talking on the phone. The best part of the job is the flexibility in my hours and availability.
good,"I was a student pursing my bachelor's degree and applied to Northwestern Mutual's internship and I couldn't have asked for a better first experience. They reimburse you for your study tools and licensing test. The culture is super fun and spearheaded by motivated individuals who will offer you help and mentorship in order for you to succeed. Though, compensation is through commission and to truly be successful in this line of work you have to be dedicated and willing to put in work for the first 5 years."

The hardest part of this job is pushing your comfort zone and if you find yourself comfortable in the job you may need to be working harder."

good,"Working for NML was a great experience. I actually learned more about securities, life insurance policies, 401K, and money management in my short time there.  The hardest part of my job trying to decipher the intent of the sales person. Making sure they were being compliant but also verifying that they are being honest and not persuading the client to choose a certain product.

good,"The recruiter role has been a huge growth opportunity for me both personally and professionally. It has required me to get out of my comfort zone to meet other professionals in the community. It is also a very rewarding career in that I help people decide if Northwestern Mutual's career path is the right opportunity for them. If not, that's OK.

Also interns were assigned a mentor who help coaching meeting once per week.
good,"NWM is a classy organization. Commission based, you get what you put into it.. The problem is finding out what agents need to do. Being an agent is like running your own business: there are no work hours, just hours to work. At the beginning, agents are living and breathing the company sales process until they hit their stride. For some, this may take a few years depending how they apply the leads process and control Seminars. The knowledge aspect of Company training is normally implemented in degrees and some agents graduate faster than others. The marketing and selling is dependent on the person. Management, I have noticed, with my time spent at New York Life is hit or miss depending on the manager (as with most places) and the fit. Usually turnover is very HIGH,  we should expect to see maybe 3 or 4 people stick with it in a training class of about 30 or so. This career is tough for the every day person, but if the right skill set is applied, agents find satisfaction and reward."

Every team have their own goals and objectives of the day. we all meet during the lunch time, Free lunch sometimes multi cuisine. it's like family get together where we talk about our jobs sometimes about family. Hardest part- So far I haven't felt anything like that. Jobs are equally distributed. Each and everyone respect and at the same time value your contribution to the company.
