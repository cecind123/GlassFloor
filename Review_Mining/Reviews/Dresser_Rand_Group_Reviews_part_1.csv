rating,review
bad,They hire you then they lay you off before you can get in enough time for even unemployment. They may pay well but they do not treat people well......
bad,They lay off often. The pay isnt very good for what work you do. pretty quiet and boring. Not much oppertunity for advancement. Wouldnt get a job there again.
bad,"I didn't add anything to my skills working over there, very bad management and some group hires people from certain part of the world over any others, bad technical experience and they don't share or listen for any new or good ideas the new employee can bring, they take a lot of time off consider them working from home but actually no one work from home they just get online send some emails just to show that they are working and then they disappear. "
bad,was a nice place to work till the company went public in 2006 now its not co workers are great management is not they lost the respect of employes bye there actions of treating people
bad,"The GM at Olean manages by coercion, threats and intimidation;"
bad,I only spent few months in this company due to the negative environment in the finance department. There is a high turn over rate and employees are extremely unhappy there.
bad,The design department is very small.  You won't learn much.  I would advise you to go out to the panel shop and try to learn as much as possible about how they do their job because it will help make you a better designer.  After you get those skills then get the heck out of there.
bad,"Terrible company that allows its HR department to act without integrity and one of it's VP,s to be totally unethical and allows people to be victimised within the workplace"
bad,"co-workers were friendly"
bad,"This place seems great in the beginning but the longer you stay you will eventually see this place is a complete mess full of phony individuals from the managers all the way down. When I was there I wondered sometimes...Does anybody here besides the engineering group actually work. Everyday it seems like people would come to work to play the blame game and try there best to get out of doing there own job. It also seemed like we had meetings just to figure out when the next meeting was. It's just a lot of idiotic individuals running that place into the ground."
bad,"Good pay, poor managment, and no job security and company in financial stress constantly due to being behind the market"
bad,Dresser-Rand could be a better Company to work for. If they offered Employees a Health plan or Permanent Positions and this is why I am searching for a New Job.
bad,"i am not entilted to make a judgment, make one for your self."
bad,"100 years +  and all it takes is one foreign company to come in and close it down. Siemens do not care about employees, it`s all about getting rid of the Union and moving the company to a right to work state."
bad,I don't work directly for Dresser Rand I work for a contract company call Ohio Security Services. My view is that you cant get ahead in this company. They don't have many job sites in the area
bad,"Depending upon the department you work in, Dresser-Rand can be a great company to work for.  However, overall, they have no appreciation of the efforts put forward by their personnel and there is little to no work life balance.  Imagine being reprimanded for taking vacation days that you had rightfully earned, and were approved in advance and when you return, you are reprimanded for taking time off.....yep that's how it works in Field Services.  Don't expect a life....Accounting on the other hand was fine if you don't mind working 12 or 16 hour days at times.  Little opportunity for advancement."
bad,"Accounting department is ok if you love working 12 to 16 hours a day at times.  Heaven forbid if you are sick or there is bad weather., so you had better plan on showing up even if it takes you 3 hours to drive in a blizzard.  Benefits ok.  No room for advancement.  No work life balance."
bad,"Long and inefficient procedures that makes the work difficult and stressful to meet due dates. Very conservative company, poor management with lack of judgement. Good work ambient with good persons coworkers."
bad,"Assisting the whole SCM Team.  "
bad,"The workers wasn't trustworthy.  I would just do my job and only my job;  sweep, mop,  windows,  vacuum.  Most days the cleaning would be done because I did it the day before so there wasn't much I did clean."
bad,"A typical day consists of providing quotations For "
bad,"The New Equipment management is terrible! The VPs are unfair and there is no room for growth with this company! They would rather hire a competitor than actually help their own reports advance. The sales guy and the engineers lack motivation and morale, because they lack respect for their bosses (VP), which is reasonable since the VP is a back stabbed and will throw his entire team under the bus. He's a natural born salesman, in other words - he's great at lying in your face and covering his back. There's no loyalty in this company and you can tell once you're reeled in."
bad,"Lack of leadership, little room to grow but ok for long jobs on compressors and plant work but all in all you get hat you put in the company has recently been purchased by siemens"
bad,"Not sure how this company keeps going. Management doesn't care about employees' work issues, there is little to no training and no appreciation. They just want you to work and not complain. There is no job security. The pay and benefits are good but that doesn't compensate for the dysfunctional atmosphere."
bad,"This job is one of the better jobs in the area and it's sad.  The work environment is like being back in grade school.  There are grown men spreading rumors about others. "
bad,"Worked with some very nice people, however, nearly impossible deadlines which required a lot of working at home late into the night and on weekends.  I did not feel that the pay compensated for the demands on my personal time."
bad,Good hours and pay. Team work and fair play is non existent. Every man or woman for himself... Work here with caution. Favorites get promotions not qualifications or work performance.
bad,"Most of my time is spent making sales calls on customers, then following up and help them plan out project work. The most satisfying part of my job has always been providing a winning solution then delivering it safely and on time."
bad,"Interesting work, good pay but I watched folks over the years disappear at lunch with no explanation until it happened to me.  Make sure you have something to fall back on if you work there."
bad,This company has a huge turnaround for ALL workers. Much internal bickering. Safety Issues. I would not recomment this company for any positions advertised.
bad,The work was not hard but the job required management with communication through out departments to allow the work flow to work as a team. the demand was high and not much was accomplished without a forceful rush of priorities due to lack of communication between departments. stress levels are very high and employees don't trust each other. I learned the life is too short to not make our environment matter where you work.
bad,"worked third shift for eight months company and management were fair, and working conditions were good . Safety conscious, osha training required. union shop, fair representation. Need ability to read and document measurements."
good,"It's a good place to work but they bring you in as contractors and never let you know when and if you'll ever be hired in full time. And if you aren't buddies with the management you might as well kiss the job goodbye, they pick favorites big time. Also it seems like everyone in there is a manager of some sort. Too many chiefs and not enough Indians."
good,"Poor field leadership at best, customers are covered by good warranty (saving grace for the customer) usually after three or four tries field crew manages to get it half right. It is wonder they make a profit."
good,"Dresser Rand is a good place to work, co workers are very good. I did not care for the management style. I got the opportunity to learn many new and relevant skills."
good,This company was okay to work for but the added stress of constant job layoffs seemingly every year made it a difficult place to work.  I do value Dresser Rand as it is one of a very few large employers to the local area.
good,"Management can't seem to get it together, never knowing how to make things flow or understand what the product is and how it's to be made.  they have a lot of talent  on the production floor but have no idea how to use it. Most Managers and Supervisors are in a Power hungry state of mind which causes them to lose focus on the big picture."
good,Great place to work for the most part. Top heavy on management which constantly changing so you never really know what is going on.
good,"First started to work as a Production Specialist:"
good,"Nepotism rules. Pay is low, hours long. I had the best boss of my career and one of the worst at the same facility. Company teaches well, but is not the least bit loyal to their employees without certain surnames."
good,"great company very proud of there history and product they manufacture, union culture low account ability for each union employee supervisors are fair and helpful  to those they see actually work and try"
good,"Run a cnc machine that makes gaskets."
good,Dresser-Rand is adopting an ownership culture since being acquired by Siemens.  There is a lot of loyalty from the employees and the people are dedicated.
good,"Not a company to be recommended, however, will keep your bills paid."
good,"The people were great for the most part. The work could be a bit mundane at times and there was a serious lack of organization at the higher levels of management. Unless you were in with the good ol boys, there was not a lot of long term stability."
good,"Decent hourly wage"
good,The management was very young and inexperienced in this field. The company however was not a bad place to work. It was very easy for personnel with unsafe work practices to manipulate the Service Manager.
good,"Overall a satisfactory company to work for.  However it is very demanding and there is no balance between work and your regular life.  Depending upon the area in which you work, you are required to work overtime and be available at all hours of the day.  Lack of appreciation of employees."
good,"I enjoyed my job, the management was terrible.  On a daily basis, my supervisor would contradict herself, and expect we would read minds.  Playing favorites, poor communication, unwillingness to accept the views of others....all characteristics of poor personnel supervision.  HR was no better.  Was let go without warning and given the reason of ""lack of skill set"".  I'd say 95% OTD to clients was proof that my skill set was just fine.  "
good,I was only there a short time and shortly after I left everyone I was hired with were let go. They were brought back as contract employees with no benefits so that they could be hired or released as the business fluctuated.
good,I would go in and clean the office and shop. The management was decent to work with. The hardest part of the job was trying to get all the work done in a 8 hour day.
good,"260 employees were laid off Sept 2006, many were in the 50 and 60 year old range and were hoping to work out the careers until retirement, sadly this did not happen."
good,"The work-life balance was the worst part.  Lots of time in the office and out of the office.  However, the exposure to various types of situations was invaluable."
good,"- Beaucoup de déplacements européens"
good,"Good work environment, Very political environment not a lot of room for advancement. Management is lacking in knowledge what to be friends with everyone instead of manageing."
good,Our shop was bought from dresser so they could get into the gas turbine industry.  They have no clue on how this business works or how to stay successful at it. Management and sales both lied and failed to bring work into the shop or properly manage the work we did have and we lost customers left and right.  Good company with great benefits if you work at a factory service shop and not an acquisition.
good,If you are a full time employee you have got it made.If you are a temp employee you are treated like a throw away rag by the full time employees.The management is smart and on top of things.The pay is good at all levels.
good,"Sur certains postes , il ne forment pas assez les apprentis ne les laissent pas apprendre , il font plutot de petites taches inintéressantes"
good,You work plenty hours and you make good money he travel you get to see the world.  You benefit a whole lot working with dresser but in the same breath you lose a whole lot when you're working with dresser
good,"Training was provided in every aspect of the equipment to be repaired. I personally was trained in Centrifugal compressors, Reciprocating Compressor, and Steam Turbines. Other training included Dresser Jets, and Axial flow compressors."
good,"Managing 20-25 people each day in various departments requires the ability to work with a variety of people and their different mindsets. The work day is stressful, when you take in account the different jobs that require your attention."
good,"Explored materials that have greater chemical resistance than the current state of the art"
good,Loved working there - sorry to have been laid off but due to downturn in economy last in was the first to go. It was a shame but that's life in the US
good,"* Management mostly left me alone, checked in every other week or so"
good,Plenty of opportunities for early career progression.  As well as horizontal movement later on in this ISO 9001 proprietary/engineer to order manufacturer.
good,Overall interesting place to work.  Great people to work with that help you with new tasks.  Spend a lot of time on computer.  Gained great exposure to the oil and gas industry.
good,I liked the company during the 5 years I was there. They worked with my schedule. Had good benefits.
good,"Dresser provided the opportunity to work on a daily basis with Production, Quality and Processes Innovation Groups, I am thankful to have that exposure and training in, seeing how actions and decisions ripple through an organization, and can have either positive or negative consequences. My skill set is now by far more complete and my strategic overview more comprehensive than when I first arrived."
good,"Nice to work on, if you like to work in a Corporation with small business management, salaries aren't even close to some competitors. Depending on your locations, the benefits will differ."
good,It starts early and is a lot of work day. Lots of learning and skill development.
good,"some management problems, work flow could be more effecient"
good,"Dresser has a friendly atmosphere, my co-workers enjoyed a good joke as much as teaching and helping people to do the best job they could. Management seems a little out of touch with who does the most work and only knows how each department is producing, not by individual. That was the hardest part of the job for me, being the highest producing BOM planner, but still was laid off when the workload decreased."
good,I only worked there for a short time as a temp but it was very enjoyable. A laid back place with lots of friendly faces and numerous people willing to help you out. Co-workers are wonderful.
good,"general employees are great, upper management is bad, back stabbing management, the work was good,, the amount of work was overloaded for my position ,"
good,"Good place to work for the area. Hours are good; start times range from 7-9. The people are great, it is a real team work atmosphere. There is a lot of knowledge to be shared here, with many employees working here over 30 years."
good,Great place to work if you enjoy the office environment. Work pace is moderate to slow depending on position. Culture is relatively relaxed and friendly.
good,"I was transferred to LNGo team, great team to work with very enthusiastic, motivated, leaders were always optimistics, greatful of the job perform"
good,"Learned various mechanical skills and machine work practices"
good,"Stressfree working environment, may be i was a GET."
good,"The location I worked at closed and is no longer there. Dresser-Rand, Siemens is great for someone that is looking to climb the corporate ladder and willing to move around."
good,Lots of good work experince to obtain. Decent work enviroment and conditions. The work load itself is quite sparatic. Overall one of tnhe better jons i have held
good,"This job was very simple just assigning parts to work orders and restocking shelves.  There was some working on computer ensuring stock levels were at the level to ensure parts were sufficient for the demands."
good,"I supporting the Safety Manager, Sales and Marketing Manager along with the Quality Control Manager.  The most beneficial is learning the safety and procedures when working for an Oil & Gas Company.  It also improved my knowledge of domestic and international clients which help me a lot when i started working for the Investment Banking.  I also managed outlook calendars, set up travel and expenses.  What I most enjoyed about Dresser-Rand is the employees were nice and helpful."
good,I found that interning with Dresser-Rand at the Wellsville branch greatly helped my understanding of how a professional engineering team works. I was able to build upon my knowledge gained in school and apply my own expertise to an assigned project.
good,Started out as a good place to work. They treated you like family. Today you are just a number. The people I worked on the floor worked well together to get the best product out to the customer. 
good,It is a sales job. Nothing really special or exciting. A role lacking creativity. the Inside Sales Position at Dresser-rand is what it is. The pay is good for the area (Southern Tier of New York). There is advancement but it's more an advancement of pay than responsibility or evolution of your role at the job.
good,"Overall a good place to work for. If you like to work a lot of overtime, you can get it at D-R. Organization is decent. Service center is large enough to handle most jobs brought in for service. Co-workers were the best group of guys to work with. the management did their job well. Benefits are higher level. Pay rate is good. the hardest parts of the job was the long hours and the lack of a social life outside of work. The best part of working there was the people who work there. come for the pay, stay for the people."
good,"I was brought in to help and make a turn around this shop . Inside of a year the turn around was made . the the treatment change with the new forman, due to the fact that i was done running the shop for him with I was doing with past two forman"
good,"Great compressor assembly learning environment, all employees willing to teach. Each day varied according to the job required and shortfalls on previous shift accomplishments. Management used old style techniques and could use some update for new employees but it seemed to work for the currently employed union workers."
good,I was only at Dresser-Rand for 3 months to help with a project. I enjoyed working with the employees there that I met. I would take another project there absolutely.
good,Because Dresser-Rand was acquired by Siemens in the last 5 years there was still a considerable amount of transition happening so there were big announcements of change every quarter. With all the changes happening it could be a stressful environment but people are very nice.
good,challenging work environment due to highly demanding specs when dealing with oilfield operations. Specifically Hibernia platform compressor maintenance.
good,"Some of the benefits, especially the vacation time is good.  There are sometimes unreasonable expectations put on the office staff and the pressure to perform is intense."
good,"I like the work and what I learned about turbines and the assembly of them. Dresser-Rand helped me go back to school and earn my Bachelors Degree and they haven't used my knowledge and training after investing money into me. I feel that a company should hire within if they are going to invest in there employees, not hire friends or off the street when they got valuable employees to advance."
good,Good job. Lots of Training/ on the Job experience to aquire.
good,I like working for dresser rand but the company does not listen to employees. Employees are not seen as equals to each other.  There is terrible planning and when product comes in it is seen as a rush and employee is expected to rush and work overtime with little to no notice... very poor training program as well
good,I worked here for a few months and had an overall great experience. The people in the office were great and management seemed to care about their employees.
good,Doing my internship with DresserRand was fun and an interesting experience where I learned a lot. Everyone was supportive and available to answer my questions and give me information.
good,"dresser-rand is an exciting work place with good employee's. I've learn much about my job and life skills, while working there. it can be a stressful place to work, but no job is perfect"
good,"Prior to the purchase by Siemens, DR was a sales orientated organization. DR put the value of sales and the client clearly in front. Coupled with excellent engineering, they defined a client focused engineered-to-order American manufacturing company."
good,"My time at Dresser-Rand was limited to a year as an intern, but I truly enjoyed my experience learning from a well-developed team dedicated to serving its customers."
good,"Werkzaamheden: Het ondersteunen van de customer service manager (CSM) door middel van het aanmaken en bijhouden van werkmappen.; Het uitvoeren van kleinschalige projecten met bijbehorende klantcontact.  "
good,I was a regrouter for this company. It was traveling construction that involved demolition and reconstruction of large concrete foundations in gas plants.
good,"good place to work with good benefit package , just depends on the oil and gas business for 90% of work. Worked 10 hr days I personally worked over 2700 hours. Got along with the Management team and worked close with my M.E.'s, to put out the best product possible to our customers. Really enjoyed operating my turret lathe and making the parts that came to my load center."
good,"Ambiente de trabajo agradable, personal comprometido y motivado. Normalmente es muy bien dado el trabajo en equipo con todo el personal. "
good,"Interesting industry"
good,No complaints. Very stable and solid industrial employer.
good,"Work was very fast paced and exciting."
good,"work is technical but enjoyable,but sometimes very challenging."
good,machinist
good,"Like any facility there are some changes that could be made to help improve moral. Management isn't always the best "
good,"Good company to work for. I got my first full time job after I had completed my co-op's with them. I liked the workplace culture. Very helpful senior engineers, and we used to play basketball after work which created a better atmosphere among us."
good,The work I did there was wonderful. I learned so much while I was there that I can take with me anywhere. Unfortunately it come to a point that management and a buy out left room for many layoffs.
good,Great people in all areas of Dresser Rand.  Good management to work for.  Sometime to meet deadline work a bit harder.   Project has a tight timeline and exceptions to complete on time.
good,Dresser Rand was a company that was preparing to be sold. During my time the head office refused andy investment in people and equipment to grow the business.
good,"Went through a lot of Managers."
good,Typical work day is not bad. Usually have opportunities for new and challenging work. Top level management can be very detached and have unrealistic expectations but there are a lot of supportive and helpful people that work here. The hardest part of the job is that management can be very demanding. The most enjoyable is that the work often remains challenging.
good,"all about the money . not much about the employee. all of the overtime you want to work. to many employer employee click."
good,"A Typical Day at work is reviewing my current opportunities and prioritizing them based on probability. Then i focus on identifying the strengths and weaknesses for me on these projects so i can work on eliminating the weaknesses and making stronger, my strengths. "
good,"I worked in NAVY submarines for thermo structural"
good,"Not a bad company to work for. "
good,Management is well liked.  Policies change all the time and work load increases and responsibilities with no pay increase.
good,"A typical day at work was met with inspection of parts using numerous types of NDT. PT mostly but used MT, UT, and VT also. Management left some to be desired. Co-workers are friendly and competative. The hardest part was looking for very small indications in large parts. Best part was the enviorment, the safety, and the ability to use many different types of NDT."
good,aprendi  desenvolver varias atividades pude contribuir com meus colegas de trabalhos passando conhecimento da mesma forma pude aprender muito com eles a direção e gerencia são bons profissionais  sobre a empresa a mesma e agradável de se trabalhar com segurança e qualidade e segurança.
good,"Daily safety inspections and report to management,"
good,On time Fast paced and flawless work is expected
good,It paid the bills. never worked so close to home for decent money. Managers didn't know manufacturing but did run a good scam to make themselves look good.
good,"A typical day at the office starts with logging on to the computer and loading all the programs I need to start the day. While they load my team and I look at the work load and divide the jobs. I work in the aftermarket part of my group and as so I get almost every part of a steam turbine from small parts like hardware to shafts and cases. I create 3D models and up to date drawings of the steam turbines which allows our supply chain to place orders with vendors, as many of the vendors require a model in order to create our parts. I also go out to the shop and help handle any difficulties that our operators have. These can consist of miss-machined parts to out dated drawing errors. Our team also helps correct these errors and get the part moving through our shop. The hardest part of my job would be time. Out of the whole day my list of work never seems to slow, even in tough economic times like today. So when time is the issue I try to prioritize my work and get what I can out the door before it is late. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the history. The turbines I help maintain were made as early as 1906 to today. So when digging through to find what improvements to the machines have been made has made it a challenge but one that makes it interesting. Finally the management, this is the one part that is hard to describe. On one hand I love working with my bosses and they have helped me succeed through the years. But on the other hand the constant layoffs have me concerned for my family and I don't know how long my position will last due to our location and small work"
good,"Dresser-Rand is a good place to work, nice environment, friendly co-workers. I would recommend it to friends and peers."
good,Dresser-Rand has been a rewarding place to work.  There is a never-ending ability to learn something new every day.  They are also quite good at developing their employees for those that wish to further their careers in the company.
good,"Everyone I worked with was very personable, and willing to help each other out."
good,"low growth potential"
good,"Overall responsible for Control Panel design , Assembly and Testing .  Leading a team of Engineers and Contractors . Responsible for On time delivery , Quality and Cost of the product."
good,"i am currently handling a man power of gas compressor plant field. such as maintenance,shift,safety etc. this is to typical too handle but i have gain more knowledge from here and its to good for me to gain knowledge. my next step is to change job to improve myself, i have to gain knowldge from offhore this is my aim to success in offshore job."
good,"The team on the shop floor is excellent, great group of people. Shop moral was wonderful. The management needs some work, and did get better and things were moving in an upwards direction over the year that I was there. They are expanding which comes with some growing pains. But overall and excellent company, treated fairly and lots of OT to work throughout the year. They were excellent when it came to time off and sick days. The shop people all worked together to cover someone who was off etc."
good,"Was a good company to work for, but since I have no personal knowledge of conditions since it was purchased by Siemens AG I do not feel that I am in a position to comment."
good,"worked on steam turbines grinding and painting bearing cases, hanging steam lines, good clean and climate controlled facility. management was not the best."
good,started out as a good place to work but lost my job to overseas markets. lots of games played with Union. Most supervisors don't have machining background so hard to get answers. Seen parts set on machines for days waiting for engineering approval or disapproval.
good,"Work environment was pleasant, with experienced employees willing to work in a team environment employees.  We produced many new units and parts for many legacy products and were well versed in adapting to changes.  Management was supportive of new ideas and encouraged process change when improvement could be achieved."
good,I was generally awarded the opportunity to work overtime.  The vacation time that was provided was more than most companies.  It is not a difficult place to work if you apply yourself.  You must be willing to learn in order to advance yourself.
good,"Valoración muy positiva de mi experiencia laboral y personal en la empresa"
good,"Good company to work and lots of benefits easy going people and management.Learnbed alot typicka dat at work is funmost enjoybale day every day and no workfrom homes untill emergency. most peoepl travel ,implementation partners are there to execute the jobs."
good,"For someone who has never been employed by Dresser-Rand, all their locations are usually viewed as stable, long-term employment positions with great benefits. In my experience, most of that is true. This is the place that your grandfather retired from or your uncles or father have worked at for decades. They have competitive salaries, and great benefits. However, the world has changed the way businesses operate and DR is no exception. Unfortunately, it's not as stable as it used to be. Seniority rules and the employees that have managed to stay there for decades will continue to be there. The rest are subject to headcount reductions stemming from a variety of things such as changing markets and industry demands. Lay-offs are nothing new for manufacturing industries, however in my opinion the industry/competitor pressures in the global economy force these cuts deeper than the occasional production headcount adjustments."
good,"Had the freedom and trust to develop cutting-edge unique products for domestic and export use."
good,Co-Workers are great. The hardest part of my job is all the overtime but with out we wouldn't succeed our goals. A typical day is very busy always something to do.
good,Good company to grow and enjoy working. Company give more importence to values and ethics. Working here is a good pleasure.
good,"Why perform internal support, no recognition of the work done and had excessive pressure."
good,It was fun  working with staffs. Enjoyed the work. Convenient time for work. It was a stress less work place. Everybody was cooperative. Enjoyed all five years.
good,A typical day of work included changing tools and machining parts to order dimensions. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the other operators. That would leave broken tools for me to fix. as well as leaving drills broken off in the part for me to get out.
good,Over all a nice work environment.  Ability to work from home a lot of the time if the need arises.  New management has made some changes that are unpleasant.  But I guess that is to be expected.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was a constant learning environment. I never had to search for something to do, each day brought new challenges and opportunities. I left knowing I had become a better person because of my experiences."
good,The most enjoyable aspect of any job is being part of a talented team that works together to achieve a common goal. I had the pleasure of experiencing this during my time at Dresser Rand.
good,It is a very good company to work with. Learning is very steep. Work life balance if difficult. Lots of responsibilities.
good,"Not a bad company to work for. Company always seems to be in a battle with the union, but if you give a honest days work then those issues don't usually effect you. 9 year employee and I enjoyed my time there"
good,"Full day busy"
good,I loved working for Dresser Rand and would like to go back there now that I have completed my B.A.
good,"great people to work with, fun co-workers. if you stay busy, the days fly bye. learned necessary skills to further myself with my next job. the manager were very laid back. the hardest part of the job was the constant changes being made by customers and constantly updating drawings. the most enjoyable part of the job were the holiday competions"
good,Great place to work. Faced paced environment with focus on safety and Quality. If you like to work hard and provide product that makes a difference then it's the place for you.
good,Dresser-Rand offers a great working environment because of the people that work there. Advancement and training opportunities vary by department and manager.
good,"We design solutions that leverage the best in emerging technology along with proven innovative products, to provide richer experiences for our customers, partners, and employees. Good place to work!"
good,"Prior to the Siemens acquisition, Dresser-Rand was a dynamic full speed ahead company.  Post acquisition, the company has experienced a sever downturn in global business and has been dismantled into the Siemens structure."
good,Work was performed all over the world. Professional organization with great people. Benefits were excellent and management was by far the best I had been around.
good,I enjoyed working at Dresser-Rand. The guys were helpful and the supervisors were as well. I learned a lot from the older guys who had been there for awhile.
good,This was a great place to work. They continuously strived to be competitive and create the best workplace environment possible. Safety and recognition programs for the employees were ongoing.
good,"nice work"
good,"Job Description and Scope:"
good,well balanced good company. The rating should tell all. I wish I were still able to utilize being employed with the company. Had to relocate. Has everything you need with a good salary to support a healthy lifestyle.
good,Enjoyed the job and the people. Challenging every day. Not monotonous. Able to work with many different departments and department supervisors. Managers are young but improving.
good,"Good working culture"
good,Great Place to work. Good working environment. People are friendly and they love teaching you new things.
good,company had excellent compensation and benefits and work atmosphher was indeed pleasant.  Lack of confidence in business stability was uncertain.  Ultimately lead to layoff due to employment cut backs
