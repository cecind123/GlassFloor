bad,"In the past I had experienced bad treatment. At one time my director ordered to give me a warning for my refusal to write down software development procedures. But, I was given the job title of an IT help desk technician at the time. The question to be asked is that it is correct to ask somebody at such a position to do this work?"

I am a certified automobile technician looking his way in to all new technology. Been working for manufactori.e. for 8years know,which gave me more skill (machine operator,assembler,warehouse organisation personal,shipper or receiver,computerize machinery and more). I am always smile and carry a good sense of humor with me at my work place to my friends and family.Looking a stable positon in your company, where i can perform my professional skill and behavior."
bad,"Tienen infinidad de problemas en administracion, malos salarios, pocas prestaciones, turnos orribles, un ambiente laboral pesimo."
bad,Company cares more about appearance than being a company that cares for its employees. If they can promote a female or a non white for a job. They dont care if you are more qualified and have seniority.
bad,"yabancı firmaya baglı oldugu icin gayet duzgun bir firma."
bad,"Ethically distasteful. This company is trying to apply a plaster to a gaping wound. The managing directors may as well be the four horsemen (or women) of the apocalypse. Contributes to, along with the fashion industry, an environmental and ecological catastrophe. Not to mention cheap human labour, although they may see it as contributing to their economy. But really it's exploitation of cheap labour. Fashion is the 2nd highest polluter of the world to oil. Spreadsheets from fashion brands of animal species around the world are disturbing. No wonder there is animal extinction. If you can live with yourself it's an okay company."
bad,"They moved to Mexico for cheaper labor , no matter how smart you are or how hard you work we as Americans can not com-peat with cheap labor ."
bad,"Stay far away from this place! The manager and sales rep like to bully the person in this position. Apparently this has been going on for a few years now and everyone in the office is well aware of it and has said they could not and would not work for these two individuals. I approached them for training and my job was threatened after a mere two weeks of being hired. Before I lost my job, these two individuals had a meeting with me and ripped me a new one, saying I was at fault for not succeeding and I would not be doing the job I was hired to do because I ""had no integrity."" The sales rep is a psycho control freak as well - she will email you 800 things to do and wants them all yesterday - no joke! Stay away!"
bad,Mala experiència en esta multinacional. Te dan dos manuales y te dejan a la deriva. La gente está demasiado estresada para ayudarte. Acabe con mi autoestima a cero. Espero que aprendan de los errores y acojan bien a los nuevos trabajadores
bad,"If you have a family and work in production don't plan on seeing them much. Management is awful to work for, don't know how this place still operates."
bad,Some employees are required to work 6 different positions while other employees domt have to. According to the new gps where not paid any different then those who only rotate between three different positions. HR person  changes every year and health insurance premiums go up every year.
bad,"This company is spinning its wheels. They like to say that they are moving forward with innovation, but their actions don't reflect that. They don't invest in their machines, they don't invest in their people. The Senior Management surround themselves with know nothings who don't challenge their archaic ways to run a company. They show no value to the employees and they do not hire from within the company."
bad,"They expected you to learn your job to fast..There trianing program is the worse I ever seen..fork truck traffic is a accident waiting to happen in the plant they make you drive to fast to keep up with your job.There Plant Manager made a comment at a meeting that 9 out 10 new employes don't make it...now I know why..Iam one of the nine...I have worked for demanding Companies all my life and excelled, but never one like Avery..."
bad,"The job itself isn’t that bad and pretty easy but the environment is horrible. The leadership is the worst I’ve ever seen, they are completely clueless and continue to promote incompetence. Going above and beyond or excelling does nothing but get more thrown on you. No room to advance unless you’re buddies with leaders or brown nosing leadership."
bad,"Processos quase nada automatizados que dependem muito de pessoas, empresa extremamente política."
bad,La falta de liderazgo causo un declive en las operacionmes de la empresa.
bad,"After working 27 hours straight fixing major issues to get the facility back up and running I tried to go home, but another line went down and I was told that if I went home I would be considered ""not dedicated"" and would forfeit my yearly raise."
bad,Avery dennison is an okay company to work for. You have 2 different management styles within a single organization. Priority is given for overseas operation.
bad,"I was there 3 years working freelance, trying to get on full time."
bad,Plant Manager either not paying attention or she just doesn’t care.  Operations Manager micro manages and is way to inexperienced and immature to hold the position he has.
bad,"management no communication , excellent pay compared to area businesses and location , company outsourcing lot of proceses eliminating positions"
bad,"They prefer to move all of their jobs out of the USA. Not good for long term employment. They come in, start downsizing and moving the machines, laying people off, and next thing you know, they will decide to move everything."
bad,"did not care about employees, sales team was not easy to work with"
bad,"color matters,room for no advansement,looking for but kissers"
bad,Huge production company with huge work  and low salary. Long time working and never get  sick days or sick leave. Even you sick you will not get sick leave
bad,Quite a bit of politics involved with this position. Constantly moving jobs offshore to save $$ with little regard for people or performance.  Good Luck.
bad,"A pesar de ser un trabajo que aporta mucho valor a mi experiencia, y en el que siento que mi experiencia anterior puede representar un valor añadido a la resolución del mismo, la falta de organización y procesos concretos dificulta la realización. "
bad,"Chaotic environment..."
bad,"33 1/2 years ago i started at Avery Dennison and wages , benefits were outstanding. It was managed by people who came up from the ranks and knew having everyone involved including the employees opinions were very important. A lot of teams help build the company, now it is management take it or leave it. Hope it changes back to the older days."
bad,"If you do something outstanding or come up with a good idea, Someone else will get credit for it."
bad,Work day not bad if you are on a off shift daylight hours to many checks not enough indians. Old school drinking buddy hunting camp racists types. Management for the most part looks out for themselves. Workplace culture very bad to much buddy buddy going on. Most enjoyable part was working with different groups of people on projects.
bad,Empresa com bons benefícios e salário de acordo com o mercado. Porém a gerência muito centralizadora.
bad,"If you want to work and be treated as a slave. Then this company is for you. Low pay, forget about a pay raise, if your in the club you will do okay. If not then start looking for another job. Your best will not even be close. Treated like a child and whatever you thought you should be doing is wrong."
bad,"Wenig Investment in Innovation und Mitarbeiter,"
bad,"Management is disengaged. Severe lack of leadership. Uneven and excessively heavy work loads. Consistant lack of training. Lack of advancement opportunities. Dedicated, talented and hard working employees are held in their positions for doing a great job rather than being promoted because team managers are not willing to allow them to move up the ladder to prosper in new positions. Hiring someone new to replace someone that has been promoted would mean that management would be required to train and provide leadership to said new employee. The customer service department at Avery Dennison is by far the worst work environment that I have ever been a part of in my more than 20 years in the work force."
bad,"Avery is a corporate company, when hired, they were more family oriented, no it's all about the dollar."
bad,"Avery Dennison is known to be one of the better paying companies in the area however it does come at a price. Pour management creats a very stressful and unhappy working environment. When starting your position they offer you NO training and tell you it is on you to do what you need to be able to do your job properly. The managers themselves do not know how to do your job and depend on you soley to make them look good. There are people there who perform pourly but are excused from their bad performances because the manager does not know how to do the job thus needs that person to continue so they do not have to deal with it or learn for themselves. In some departments the workload is heavy and you are expected to put in the many hours, sometime 13 - 14 hour days without any extra compensation. The CEO of Avery announced openly to the company that if anyone was in need of morale then they should get a dog."
bad,Times have changed. Avery was once a very rewarding company to work for that valued and rewarded their employee's very well. This no longer seems to be a focus.
bad,"Changing management, hire and fire like typical US companies. Goog for starters to sniff into international companies. If you are not fired after 3years go. Because they suck you out"
bad,Typisch amerikaisches Betriebsklima auf europäisch abgewandelt.
bad,"Annotated shipping orders to department of loading location and time of arrival of transportation. "
bad,"The more you do there, the more you get leaned on. Terribly lazy workforce who don't take care of one another. Clueless leadership. Solid pay, not great. You're at a disadvantage if you're not buddies with everyone."
bad,"It is mostly a fast paced factory environment . After awhile you become a robot . It's a mind-numbing job that stifles your creativity ."
bad,"No dejan crecer profesionalmente con el manejo de la información, cuidan su puesto de trabajo con el miedo de que los quieras bajar, en pocas palabras falta de apoyo y egoísmo en el crecimiento laboral."
bad,repair all manufacturing equipment. various injection molding equipment and all associated equipment that pertains to production.
bad,Administrçao pessima sistema de etica nao funciona funcionario nao respeita o proximo
bad,"- Unmotivated work culture "
bad,"This is a global company that doesn't value work life balance.  It is constant high stress and lack of consideration for individuals.  Constant restructuring every 4-6 months has created a cut-throat environment.  A typical day is more than 12 hours, and every weekend involved more work.  If you are right out of college and looking for experience with a global company, then this might work for you.  If you desire work life balance, want to make a difference and be appreciated for your work contributions then look elsewhere."
bad,Avery Dennison has multiple facility. Some are new but the one I was at was an old facility not well maintained. Highly dangerous business. Managements push is to ship it if it sticks. They don't care about correcting problems that have been brought up. They don't feel the need to develop their employees. Easier to blame them for issues. Expects their office employees to work excessively long hours and travel at a moments notice. No appreciation for work/life balance.
bad,I was given opportunity 2 years ago. I got to travel to North Carolina and assisted in transporting new equipment to Orangeburg location. Performed multiple PM work and improvements on coating related machinery.
bad,"management difficult to communicate with and untrustworthy, coworker cut throat and competitive many changes with new management ,very humid and uncomfortable in summer"
bad,"The work was easy.. I caught on very quickly. I learn to box, stack palletes and also operate the machine. I worked hard and we also did a lot of team work to reach our goals each week and kept the work area clean."
bad,es una buena empresa para laborar por el buen trato asía la gente
bad,OK place to work. Was employed for 29 1/2 years. Good benefits.Learned a lot about dealing with customers. Worked with a lot of good people over a long period of time.
bad,In storming stage due to the reorg. Senior management is new and bringing in lot of changes which has caused turbulence and is affecting productivity and stability of teams.
bad,"Was a temporary with a promise to be hired on after 6 months. When I was not hired on, was told to hold off. Waited 9 months only to be told a hiring freeze was on. When I got tired of waiting for them to hire me permanently, I found another job. I gave my 2 weeks notice and they told me my services were no longer needed."
bad,It's an old company struggling to get lean. Unfortunately it does not have top down support so no true lean implementation here.
bad,"Company boasts work-life balance. It doesn’t happen at the manufacturing plants. As far as job-specific training, there is none. You’re on your own. However, they will make sure you are safe. They show you how to use a fire extinguisher at least once/year. They will pump you up at interviews with bonus talk, but in reality, we rarely made 100% bonus while employed there. Plant leadership changes every 2-3 years. Each plant manager has his own short-term focus. It takes away from any long term thought out goals."
bad,Currently there is another change. If you like changes and can move thru layoffs and unknown clear structures than this will suit you. Most of the business is moved to off shore. Management does not share the vision well and each quarter there are job cuts.
bad,Business needs are put above the wellbeing of employees. Too much structure and not enough flexibility. Managers are all about business to the detriment of the concern for employees.
bad,"The job and people on production floor are great. Management changes frequently and are out of touch with the needs and concerns of workers. They tell you that home life is important but really don't have any compassion when you are working overtime during the week as well as mandatory weekend work. There is also favoritism for certain workers and double standards. Poor communication from Management down to production floor. Games are also played when receiving merit reviews, seems like you always just miss something so you don't get the correct pay bump you deserve."
bad,They business is closing down and shipping overseas so it pretty much explains itself. Very good friendly people to work with. It isn't a hard job to do and it is pretty much explanatory work.
bad,"I have enjoyed working for Avery Dennison, however, the constant organizational changes and shrinking corporate structure makes everyone's job precarious."
bad,"I worked at this company for 27 years. 6am-6pm."
bad,I enjoy most of my co-workers working as a team but unfortunately the the benefits are horrible for health insurance.  The  summers are extremely hot.
bad,"There is no long term thinking or focus on development of people or capabilities.  Everyone is using all their energy to hit the monthly goal, which leaves no one working on strategy or people management."
bad,Really enjoyed interacting with everyone in every individual department. Also enjoyed the customer interaction as needed. The hardest part of my day was finding color matches from the Pantone book to the Avery Custom Colors
bad,"Worked several weeks on the graveyard shift and became used to it."
bad,Best company in NE Ohio.  Professional environment in every department BUT tax.
bad,"Picking orders from the warehouse daily. I learned that how hard you try to make your numbers, it doesn't matter without the help of your teammates."
bad,aucun avis à donner sur l'entreprise ou les conditions de travail.
bad,picked orders on a daily basis for office supply stores.picked orders with a handheld computer.incentives when orders were pick under time allowed and 100% accurate.great safety program.
bad,The job it self is very good and great workers. The upper management is not realistic or supportive to shop floor management. You are not paid O.T. and there is not training programs for the work force to improve the skill levels
bad,"A day at Avery was like any other factoy, punch in do your work and be very safe and go home."
good,Poor management and the threat of closure is always on your mind. No room left for advancement.Order picking is very fast paced. You constantly move and you have a standard to obtain on a daily basis.
good,"Had multiple recommendations to be moved from temp to perm position by managers, sales reps, coworkers and customers after a year temping was not offered or considered for a perm position with 7+ positive recommendations."
good,"Clock in, find out where I am working and hope I don't get stuck with a lazy teammate.  Not sure where our management received their training but if ""Dumba**"" were a job title, this place if full of them."
good,typical day working from the time you get there from the rime you leave.There is no time for nothing else hard work and you have to have good time management and fast.
good,Overall decent company to work for. Wasn't long term they just cycle through temps. Would not recommend them to anyone other then a younger crowd that does not plan on staying long.
good,"One of regional branch of the company, but management of this branch was local which has ruined all the culture of a multinational company. Lot of learning regarding PLCs , DCS, Inverters, Electrical and mechanical maintenance."
good,"E aprendizaje dentro de la empresa es muy bueno porque se aplican muchas herramientas de ingenieria, desafortunadamente no hay promosion para el personal y los salarios son bajos."
good,I stayed to myself. I only went to work.I would say it is like any other job. Everybody has their own personality. You have some that has been their for a long time and does not like change.
good,Great place to work  great experience potential for growth if you get hired into any position
good,There  is a lot of turn over within all Avery facilities due to poor management . There is a lot of negativity I could say but Id rather not. Avery is a place where someone else's experiences should not be taken....base your opinions. It may be a place where you enjoy working and it may not.
good,This Job can be a regular job for employers. As all the warehouse jobs you know it could be accurate. General laborers and office workers and those seeking fast employment opportunities can be the people working when you go to work in this place.
good,Worked in an open are with cubicle that did not come above the computer screen which created far too many distractions.  everyone not held accountable to the same set of rules.
good,"I get in run reports and change what needs to be changed in the system. Place order and go for a 10am meeting. assist customers on the phone, liaise with dispatch and production as well as supply chain. Respond to emails. Log complaints. I learnt how to manage my time and to be organised. I am not particularly fond of management. I really get along with my co-workers and they really do make everyday exciting. The hardest part of my job would be dealing with my manager and irate customers. It can be really satisfying to help a customer that is desperate."
good,A typical night at work is plain as any other manufacturing job.I realized that working all alone in a loud environment can destroy ones social life. The management is judgmental and impatient. They'll fire anyone without a second opinion.
good,I was brought in to increase the level of accounting and MIS skills at the accounting.  Management team made decisions based on true knowledge and some bias.  Co-workers were helpful and wanted to succeed.  The hardest part of the job was being accepted by the management team as an outsider.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the finance & MIS dept and all of the manufacturing workers.  Educating the employees was great.
good,"A typical day at work may consist of: learning new things because of the fast pace and always changing nature of work loads that pass threw our department. Management, on a regular basis does a good job of keeping their employees focused on the task at hand and accomplishing customer needs within our means. The interaction with co-workers gives us the opportunity to come together and bounce ideas and knowledge off of one another to come up with the best solutions to the problems that we may face as a department as a whole. The challenge within the work place is communicating effectively with other departments within our local and external branches to get goals accomplished in a timely manner for our customers. It is safe to say that the knowledge of production versus demand isn't as precise as we all would like it to be. The most gratification that I receive from working with this company is the interaction with quality employees and the wisdom and knowledge that they provide on a daily basis."
good,"A typical day was boring and uneventful, 90% of the floor was male and they liked my ideas of how to make our work areas safer."
good,Good company poor management a lot of employees have been in place for 15+ years a lot of old ways set in place. A lot of unnecessary stress to achieve goals without proper tools.
good,"I learnt about working in a professional environment, in a situation where deadlines were extremely important and would directly affect customers."
good,"Empresa no ramo de Adesivos, fluxo diário de matérias muito bom. Dando o seu dia de trabalho muito ativo."
good,"Avery has very good benefits (401k, etc) but the management at Vancive Medical is absolutely horrible.  No appreciation for hard work and job security is poor. I was let go from my job during development of a flagship product in which I was leading successfully, due to another group not meeting milestones."
good,"During payroll time"
good,"Lot to learn as a fresher."
good,"avery was one of the best jobs i could ask for .I learn so much when i was their learn how to run all kind of machine,the management was great .There were really nothing hard about avery.I enjoyed hard work and the people."
good,Avery was once a great place to work. They seem to lost their focus on the company Founder Avery Core Values.
good,Depending on position will make the difference in culture.  Some positions are very stressful and will consume your personal life.  Others you will be able to do as you please.  No recognition for the work you go above and beyond on but most of this is due to poor management.
good,Working here is a very fast paced environment that requires great attention to detail and flexibility in schedule. Overall this is a good experience and company to improve upon already developed skills.
good,"Difficult to move up, AD brings people from usually supply chain into higher rolls in many other departments, so it is hard to move up even if you have a lot of experience - especially if it is not Avery Dennison experience."
good,Development was a good area to work.  Company is big on Six Sigma.  Company direction in some areas lacked.  Leadership issues in some areas.  Flexible work environment.
good,"Varied duties never bored. Good safety program's. Good compensation for area. Mostly friendly people. Microwave for heating lunches, grill for cooking out in summer."
good,"It was a good place to work at work wise work wasn't hard. Management sucked. Maintenance manager never had your back. Benefits were ok not the best, you did get yearly raises though."
good,Good place to work if it's on roll position. It's 5 day working but have to work on the week offs as well as and when required but people take advantage of it to give work on Saturday and Sunday though they can easily integrate the work on week days..
good,Steady and good paying job with good support of benefits off every weekend set schedule also get paid on every holiday . But the only problem was  lack of leadership .
good,"Great Energy, Workers care about their customers.  Resources are unlimited.  Various focused groups like having creative, innovations, market research, PR teams and sales all help to elevate the partnerships AD encourages us to make are great.  Pay is average maybe on low side for base, there is a cap on commissions.  Little advancement for most people within company.  Titles just keep changing but job stays the same."
good,Kept me busy. Twenty minutes lunches. No benefits to speak of. Leaving work at a regular time. Enjoyed working by myself.
good,"Instellen van machine voor product,zelf onderhoud doen aan machine,ombouwen naar juiste producttype. Eveneens magazijnier,de lijnen aanvullen met juiste types materiaal,pickorder."
good,"J'arrivais le matin à 7h30 et je finissais à 16h30. Je commence par regarder les préparations à effectuer. Je prends les commandes clients, je vais sur ORACLE pour pouvoir obtenir le code client ( afin de pouvoir éditer une étiquette d'identification ), j'en profite pour voir si il n'y a pas d’extension de garantie ( si tel est les cas je fais une copie de l'extension afin de la donner a la personne dédiée au contrat et garantie client ). J'imprime le document servant a respecter la procédure de préparation ( selon la norme ISO ) et je fait une copie de la commande client."
good,"Maintain staffing and production of work force, providing necessary tools and information needed  for high production environment."
good,"Minimal work life balance, poor execution of internal processes and toxic culture.  Benefits are excellent and there are definitely smart people working at the company."
good,"An engineer with higher education in business managment domain too. Having 05 years cummulative exposure of contract manufacturing (Shaan Technologies) and RBIS (Avery Dennison) sectors. Expertise encompassing Production,Distribution, Customer services,planning, and Supply Chain. Also as ELS had conducted number of trainings locally (at both companies). Have conducted these trainings & workshops Corporate Organizations.Completed MBA in Supply Chain Management & hold B.E in industrial Engineering & Management. Possesses the practical exposure of quality and supply chain drivers with successful implementation of numerous projects."
good,"While my tenure was brief, Avery is a good company to work for depending on the role and division. Being such a large company you have all the typical pros and cons you would expect ."
good,"My stay with Avery Dennison was very limited.  It came at a stressful time when the location was looking to relocate out of the country and I was looking to move out of state."
good,Avery Dennison was a good company to work for.  They are a market leader in their field and the Cleveland area is a great area to work in at Avery because of the many facilities there.
good,"Avery Dennison is a large global company with many opportunities to learn and grow.  However, the size of the company does present a high level of job instability."
good,It was a seasonal job dealing with school binders.  I learned how to work at a fast-pace job.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with some of the supervisors and knowing that the job was temporary so it wasn't no job security at all.
good,"Travelling is must and its fun, Good learning platform, The most enjoyable part of the job is you get to explore many new things and everyday is a learning experince"
good,"I have spent 3 years in the company, it is a good company to work with as the working atmosphere is lively & people get good exposure."
good,"Escaso apoyo en cuanto a crecimiento y desarrollo de talento, el ambiente tiene algunas deficiencias las cuales provienen desde los niveles gerenciales."
good,Avery Dennison is a great place for someone joining the workforce right after school. The people at this company are great to work with.
good,Buena empresa que desafortunadamente permite que las decisiones en lo referente a desarrollo de los empleados quede exclusivamente en manos de los gerentes de área sin tomar en consideración las evaluaciones 360 que podrían evidenciar manejos injustos.
good,Worked here right after high school in a warehouse running machines producing rolls of vinyl. It was a very demanding job and had to meet a quota everyday. Some of the co workers I still considerd some of my great friends today. 2nd place team in our softball league.
good,A typical day at work was going into the office and not knowing what the day was going to be like because of a coworker.  I did learn a lot about the shipping business.
good,"Its a good company with very good workers, but the constantly changing management at the Painesville plant has been causing some problems. Overall it was a good place to work but with policies changing to contradict earlier ones and over complicating some processes is making it harder to maintain the productivity they strive for. Since the management changes they have been cycling employees more frequently causing there to be less well trained employees and their lack of official training practices makes it hard to have everyone up to speed."
good,"Flexible working hours, you can create something impactful, colleagues are helpful and collaborative, promote internal candidates."
good,Work place is good but management sucks. they can throw u out of the company anytime they need. It is not good and job security is not at  all there. They give u mental torture until u leave the company
good,"Boa empresa para se trabalhar, mas não tem muitas chances de crescimento."
good,not a bad place to work but i worked there for almost 2 years as a temp. and all they do is use you and throw you to the curb they will lead you on .  and job placement is unfair.
good,When I first came to Avery Dennison I enjoyed coming to work there it was a lot of people that worked there now since they closed down the manufacturing part it's just not a joy to come to work now on the warehouse side it's only less than a 50 employee that work on the second shift
good,Inefficient Management. Many Junior and mid level staff are leaving the company. Lack of training. They do not train their interns and expect them to understand everything.
good,"Avery is a place where you to explore multiple dimensions of the field you work in, as responsibilities are often blended. The management challenges you and allows you to grow fast. The culture and balance of life has improved tremendously over the last few years, but still has ways to go."
good,"My position was working with merchant distribution and end users on a variety of pressure sensitive products."
good,"Most of the daily activities with my team were great. We covered for each other and cross trained."
good,"Has been a good experience working in a manufacturing company and learning different aspects of Pricing & Costing. Also involved in forecasting, budgeting, reporting & analysis. Working on Outlook, Flash and Monthly Business Reviews."
good,"Starten PC, Überprüfung der zur Produktion freigegebenen Aufträge vom Vortag, Einplanen der neu eingetroffenen Aufträge  zum Kundenwunschtermin unter Berücksichtigung der Kapazität und Rüstzeiten, Nachplanen der Lagerergänzungs-Aufträge."
good,Great for advancement and work/life balance. Co-workers are the best in the business!
good,"How to deal with customers internally & externally"
good,Your average companny to work for with above average pay for the area average benefits co- workers your average Joe fast paced work
good,No longer located in Torrance CA. Company moved completely.
good,"Empresa estable y con buen ambiente laboral,pros el personal de RH no te toma en cuenta y además que es personal prepotente"
good,Sehr angenehmes Arbeitsklima und abwechslungsreiche Tätigkeiten mit ausreichend eigenem Spielraum
good,"Work life balance is average to above average."
good,Es una buena empresa para laboral aunque no hay muchas oportunidades para crecer
good,"Orders are on  very strict times, little area to make mistakes without big retaliations. Overtime is very needing which can be desired by some but expect to work a lot of overtime."
good,"8 hour work day."
good,solider Amerikanisches Unternehmen welches eigentlich zu empfehlen ist
good,Most Companies do the above due to pressure from China and US competitor's...all use temporary work force then tell there permanent employees they will be training their replacements Both the temp and perms compete and company's benefit...
good,"工作資訊不透明，不公開"
good,"International virksomhed, god kultur, spændende marked."
good,Avery Dennison is a good place to work with caring emplyees that go the extra effort to complete their job task on time and with 100 percent accuracy.
good,"worked here for 25 years and when I left I didn't even get a good bye from my manager"
good,"This Job could have been better, it was fast pace, people were ok. I don't recall having a problem with the people nor the workers at this job. I can say that the management team could improve."
good,Avery Dennison is a good company to work for. I have enjoyed learning a lot from some good people there in two different facilities from two different divisions.
good,"Avery has been a nice place to work overall. Many people spend their entire careers with Avery and are very happy with it. The only issue that I have with it, is for some people who try to excel, it can be tough to climb the ladder. You will be mostly held in the same regards as all of your other peers, who may not put the same effort into their job."
good,"Avery was a laid back job overall.  Avery Dennsion has been closed since 2004.  The company moved to Mexico.  This job was just temporary for me until I found a better job.  But overall, it was a good job."
good,check pallets make sure the product is placed on the pallet correct pull orders take them to the correct lane for shipping and pull another order and repeat the process
good,"Empresa llena de retos, lo que facilitate el aprendizaje"
good,"Good enterprise with a lot of challenges, you need to work hard, the people is not soft."
good,Had good experience working with a very technical team and supportive managers. The role involved working with several cross functional teams. Constructive feedback is appreciated.
good,"Factory work binders, and other miscellaneous materials Avery Denison sales/sold when still located inside the United States of America. Same balance every day."

I enjoy the promptness of the job and the ability to learn at an excessive rate. Learning the job is tedious but if you have the willingness to learn and to work hard you will be successful. The culture can be better but that takes time and both sides, workers and management, willing to be humble and to listen to one another so that the company can be successful.

good,"Avery can be a great place to work if its leadership team finds itself and gets back on track with the understanding that valuing its people is the first and foremost priority in business.  It's the people who build the value into the product and the company and they need to bee understood, treated with respect and developed as the most important business partners.  People do make mistakes and these can be the most valuable learning lessons especially when a mentor can turn them into a valuable teaching aspect - the adage goes, ""if you can't teach, you can't lead.""  Avery, Quakertown lacks the ability to teach at the highest levels and sees Operations mostly as a spreadsheet exercise with little to offer in developing its talent.  Its all about what you bring to the table versus what can we help you to fill the table with.  Too much highly skilled talent has left the organization build a sustainable, healthy, growing environment."

I learned that in management you have to be aware of your surroundings and not afraid of getting your hand dirty. My co-workers are a team of determined individuals who seperate play time from hard work. That's one major thing that we as a team have in common.

The people I worked with are easily the high point of the job. Different people from all over the world. Different color, race, religion, and genders. The hardest part was keeping up.

My value was two-fold.  First, I knew the Avery businesses.  Second, I was available and anxious to help them.  I spent 5 years back at Avery.
