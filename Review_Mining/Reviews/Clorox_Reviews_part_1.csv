rating,review
bad,Good workers aren't appreciated and they allow other workers to get drunk and do drugs on their breaks... Worst job ever!!! They show favoritism and the pay is horrible and they don't allow you to move up!!!
bad,Horrible ghetto underpaid place to work. I do not recommend this place to anyone. There is no room for growth and u have to sign in and out just to use the restroom
bad,Worst place to work for .... lowest paying warehouse job in Illinois as far as general labor goes .... dont look to make anything unless you can drive a forklift. Managers very disrespectful and unprofessional.
bad,Overall R&D is very cliquish and promote like minded people; management afraid to have an opinion; the directors and vps lack trust and throw blame on their subordinates.
bad,"NOT ENOUGH MONEY, don't pay enough, not enough team leadership , they need to up their pay rate , they don't pay enough but want you to bust your behind"
bad,I’ve been here 24 years.  Haven’t had a raise in 17 years!! Management at the Aberdeen plant paints a pretty picture but that’s just get you in the door so they can really stick it to you!! Don’t waist your time!!!
bad,"I've been working in factories for 20 years. When I say this is the worst place I've ever bern in that's bad. This is a multi-million dollar company who does not value their employees. They want you to work an 8 hour day in a fast paced hot warehouse with one 30 min break. Now manual labor is manual labor, they want you to value working there, yet they don't even value you or the time you put in. When I say that I mean, my time and my labor that I'm giving you is worth more than 9.00 an hour. If you want your employees to stay. Then start valuing the time and effort they give you. I'm not gonna work all day long as fast as I can work, believe me I'm fast, for you to pay me a lousy 54.00 at the end of the day that's what you make each day before taxes. This place is literally a sweat shop. I don't even want to give them 2.00 for a gallon of bleach anymore."
bad,"they gave us a raise and took it back down, unacceptable! you don't change the pay rate to go down only up! I do not recommend, and I would not go back. 4 years never one raise or benefit!"
bad,This is a good ole boy environment it really depends on who you know and how long they have been working there. No support very cut throat job. No perks and lots of overtime.
bad,There's a lot of favoritism.  Not given a chance to learn and grow. Come to work just to be sent home is very frustrating. I have a family to see about not working 2-3 days a week on so low pay you can't take care of yourself.
bad,"Absolute ghetto culture. From the permanent employees, including  management, to the temp. workers who do not undergo drug or criminal background checks, who live NOT to work."
bad,I disliked the lack of job advancement. Line leaders were poor communicators also. I didnt like the fact that we were given only one break. That was only for lunch. You were required to sign a sign out she to go to the restroom.
bad,"the company was not the best company at all in reality it was the worst company that i have worked for. pay rate was not acceptable, supervisors complained about bathroom breaks and lunch breaks"
bad,"on a typical day of work we would have to build several pallets "
bad,Very hot environment. Lots of heavy boxes .no air-conditioning. One half you break not a friendly environment the pay was too low on way to move up in company
bad,Worst job I ever had it was very bad pay we worked very hard for little pay it was like slave work very cold in the winter in the inside very bad supervisors
bad,"As a DSP, you encounter plenty of Negative Nancys and Debbie Downers which make it tough and busy on certain days. There are days you have to pick up their slack. Despite having conversations with this minority group, it's difficult to turn them into Positive Pattys. Accountability is the issue here and being too lenient with the individuals will only cause a ripple effect on the good staff. How can we avoid having t…"
bad,"mala remuneración, bajo nivel intelectual,no aprendí nada nuevo , no había reuniones como en molinos rio  de la plata,y nunca conocí a nadie de la dirección y la gerencia"
bad,"rude shift leaders, they talk to you any kind of way. I do not tolorate any kind of disrespect."
bad,At this company they were all about productivity to them you were just a worker without a future.
bad,"Unless you are family or are related to someone, there are no opportunities.  Some employees are required to work hard, while others stand around and talk."
bad,If it wasn't from all the back stabbing and the way you are treated by the Managment it would be a Good job. Upper Management from the Plant Manager who walks around and expects you to Bow down to him to the way he Bullies other Managers when they cower in fear for making him look like the Selfish Person he is. The work environment is Toxic.
bad,"I worked in IT, open office environment, loud and cold."
bad,During my time roughly 1/3 of my group left the company.  It is cut throat at review time as there is a forced fit to the curve.  Only a few at the top get decent raises.  My manager only looked out for their self.  There are better companies who offer more pay in the Bay Area.
bad,There is a lot of non communicated expectation and impossible to know what they expect. You find out about new projects from system and not manager. Most projects are 6 months late when assigned to you.
bad,"Line leaders take job too serious and management doesn't.leaders talk to you disrespectful and get you fired for no reason or explanation, especially that  racist white mf on 2nd shift and cj ugly  niece with the moustache .most places give you a grace period but be 1 minute late there and it's over.defenitely not a place to look for a career out of."
bad,Nothing good to say about this company. Your paid 8.00 a hour to slave for nothing then you only get 1 break. And that only 30 minut and thats in the morning
bad,The job is okay they just don't explain nothing to you they just basically put you to work without telling you anything in but it's a great place to work I guess
bad,"Terrible workplace,"
bad,Was it production lead ran the production line made sure the workers performed and did their job accordingly and troubleshooted any problems that we had
bad,Working hard place where you had to move at fast pace mangers were on you if not working multi-work not doing one thing having to get things out quickly
bad,salir a ruta con el vendedor. llevar el control de venta diaria.
bad,a day at work was pretty ok. work went smoothly as expected. i would definitely recommend others give Clorox a chance. there was experiences i never seen before working here.
bad,"good for a temporary job, working in a warehouse, dealing with boxes, packaging, wrapping in plastic wrap, lifting, carrying, tossing, continuous cycle"
bad,"They look down on the good workers and praise the lazy workers. They believe that whatever they wanted to do was ok, didn't really care too much about how the workers feel. Didn't appreciate the hard work and dedication I put in."
bad,Too much gossiping. Best option is to stay to yourself. Fast paced. Can get easily laid off due to attendance. Disorganized. Easy work. No smoking on premises. And make sure u bring your own lunch.
bad,"The Clorox Company. el trabajo consta con varios sectores los cuales aprendí y recorrí cuatro d ellos cada sector a su vez tiene sector individual de  area. Buen trato laboral. Lo mal retribuido es la falta de constancia laboral ya que no trabajamos mes completo aunque el contrato se realizo por 6 meses, paran los sectores semanalmente afectando directamente al empleado eventual .Lo que mas me gusto fue aprender trabajo manufacturing, y las capacitaciones dadas de control de calidad , seguridad y producción.  En tanto a la remuneración no es específica debido a los días no trabajados dictaminados por la empresa. Un mes se puede cobrar $1800 y otro $12000. Debido a la inestabilidad de la empresa y la falta de compromiso con los empleados.Trabajamos para la consultor Manpower quien tampoco se compromete en asegurar mes completo de trabajo"
bad,Lot of responsibilities but limited time.  Too many meetings.
bad,While I was a candidate at clorox warehouse I found myself unhappy. The work was stressful and very unorganized. The things I learned at clorox were how to unloaded and load off a conveyor belt. My co-workers was very nice and helpful and was easy to get alone with. The hardest part of the job was driving to work from a 10 mile drive and getting sent home daily because there wasn't any work for my station to do. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning how to load and unload off the conveyor belt at a certain time speed.
bad,long hrs.
bad,"Work life balance, really depends on your manager.  Not consistent throughout the department.  A lot of decisions are made by people who do not work directly with you.  Compensation is below average but decent."
bad,"Not a good work place for people first job needs a little work, had the worst experience there will never return."
bad,"Even though minimum wage jobs are for people with minimum skills as some who never worked in a warehouse I would not reccommed working in a warehouse. The co-workers make it seems as if its high school way to much drama. Some of the management is nice, but others take advantage of their authority."
bad,Clorox recently acquired Nutranext and it is clear that they only love Clorox people.  They talk about how good the CEO is and how well they treat your people but if you are part of an acquisition that is NOT the case.  The Managers have no experience in managing people during this kind of acquisition.  The transition is very difficult.  Lots of sleepless nights and thankless days at work.
bad,"Poor management, no heat or air. Restroom were always nasty. Forklift never work properly at anytime. And weekend shift never get overtime. It was just not a good place to work."
bad,This company isn't organized at all. That's all I can say. No one cares about injury sighting. Higher power would get jealous if one of the co pack employees would get racked up. So they'll fire us.
bad,"I worked at the Forest Park plant and within a week of working there it became very apparent that it was a very cliquey and stuck-up work environment that DOES NOT TRAIN NEWCOMERS PROPERLY. This is the reason I was let go after 60 out of my 90 day probationary period. Crew leads are responsible for properly training you on your zone from day 1 until your 90 days are up and you become a full employee of Clorox. My crew lead made little to no effort to train me and quiz me on machines and knowledge of the line. I asked several times to be trained on more equipment, eager to learn and to help out more, but I was just replied to with a ""we'll see"" or ""maybe"". Turns out all the other temp-to-hires already knew their whole lines already, yet I only knew my zone."
bad,It's not one of the best places to work but if you need something fast it's ag guaranteed job but the hardest part of the job is standing in the heat for that long it's a lot of drama there sothe Lee's you talk the Less you talk to people the better
bad,"The work wasn't bad, once the got the flow of things.  On the other hand some management was very petite and unfair.  They made things seem more harder than it was."
bad,Clorox is an okay job it's just isn't enough to support  yourself financially. The work environment  is fast paced the line leaders are cool this would be a good job for teenagers
bad,"Load and unload trucks with forklifts, pallet jacks, or cherry pickers with Clorox products. Conducted inventory control. Managed and reviewed customer orders/requests and manually enter data of orders."
bad,Overall the work is easy but management is hard to get along with they talk to you like your in kindergarten no respect for people.the only good thing about working for Clorox is you get free things every Friday wipes glad  garbage bags detergent storage bags charcoal.  
bad,The pay is terrible for some people. They pay you $8.75 an hr to lift heavy bags and boxes for long periods of time with 1 30 min break for the entire time that you are there. The warehouse is very nasty inside of the bathrooms and the majority of line leads and bosses there on the floor with you are very demanding and disrespectful and they tend to argue with the other employees often sending them home for absolutely nothing.
bad,12 hour shift work is very hard on the body and your mind.  It's not for everyone. I found I had anxiety all the time and physically getting sick. The pay was good but my health and wellbeing is more important so I quit.
good,Extremely heavy and hectic workload i.e. 14-16 hr workdays.
good,This was a transitional role for me until I accepted a positon in my area of expertise.  Long days in extreme temps.  Temps are of poor quality and rude.
good,Lack of diversity in the workplace. Only hired friends and relatives to get the company referral fee. No training offered or in place for incoming hires.
good,Line Leads should get paid way more money..Pay is not enough to manage over 13 to 15 employees..The over staff are nice and pleasant ppl to work with..The jobb is easy but it's lots of wear and tear on your body..With less pay you gets no benefits..
good,"aprendi mas sobre el campo de mercadeo , y atender al publico..."
good,"Empresa responsable con sus trabajadores"
good,"The EDI Team was a strange culture.  The team lead was allowed to literally terrorize the staff.  She took enjoyment in making other people feel stupid rather than promoting a positive  learning environment.  She wanted me to learn by making mistakes but at the same time she would highlight to management whenever I made an error.  "
good,"Have to be at work 2:45-3:00 latest. Go to main floor , Starts off with 5 min Exercise/ Stretching. We have line leads , so they pick 9-12 people to be on the line they lead. UnPacker clorox products load them to a conveyor, open cardboard boxes , then the products from on the conveyor gets take out and into maybe what they gonna be sold out the stores into bigger boxes and then onto the pallets."
good,"Wasn't really satisfied , they didn't have any source of real work.       But    for the.    Most     part.  I worked as long as I could.    With   being.  Unsatisfied"
good,No es una empresa que se preocupe  por la seguridad de sus empleados tanto que no dan equipo de seguridad personal
good,its just a job if you work with the temp service.If you work for the actual company then it may be a little better .Buts it okay if u just want a job
good,great company to work for   good co worker  i love that job i was always on time  love the over time   doing my job and other
good,"desafortunadamente alli el ambiente laboral no era muy bueno .ya que la gente  no le enseñaba ha uno nada cuando empece alli,fue muy dificil pero con la ayuda de dios pude salir adelante y con un poco de tropiesos pude terminar mi labor en esta empresa.aprendi buenos conocimientos en elementos de seguridad,y muchas cosas mas.los compañeros no todos eran malos pero alli se dificultaba trabajar en ese ambiente,la parte mas dificil fue la convivencia alli.lo que mas me gusto fue como se manejaban los equipos para procesar los productos del aseo para el hojar,como las maquinas y demas cosas que estan en esta empresa."
good,This job was pretty routine basic and simple. Same thing everyday nothing hard about it.
good,Don’t ever work there. Horrible experience and way to low wages for back breaking work. Either you work morning shift and are to tired to live your life or you work night shift and miss the whole day
good,"Its ok job if you just getting into the warehouse field. They could give more ,for as money and benefits. You only  get one break its 30 minutes. You can't  walk outside  the gate on break. This job you have to work as a team. Also you have to be able to hold your own."
good,this would be a ok job for a single person with no kids or a wife I would work here now because all it would do is maybe pay rent I have a family now so if you single then this would fit you
good,"Ship and Receive Freight"
good,Just do your job right. Come in on time to start your job right. Stay to yourself & keep on working. Make sure you're doing your job right so no one can say anything wrong ..
good,"Not really worried about both sides of the story if there is a disagreement or issue. Management will go with the person they favorite in the company, They seem to not being worried or concerned about the truth."
good,Great place to get good cash and to help maintain bills but wouldn't recommend to stay long. Mostly kids and pple have attitude like they have no life at all
good,No job security at all. Complain if u clocked in 5 mins early. Always got sent home cuz u didn't get picked would drive to work for them to say we only need 45 people to night
good,"Good co-workers but the management is not fair with temporary employees.  They are treated with no consideration.  Even is you perform your job correctly, they will not recognize it because you are not consider part of the company.  Great co-workers, beautiful people with great values."
good,The environment is lacking in safety procedures and is putting employees at risk of being exposed to unsafe conditions. Most challenging part of the job was knowing that there was no room for advancement.
good,Clorox was a very difficult place to work the time lines were very difficult to keep. They were not staffed properly and tools for jab at hand not provided.
good,"Good company."
good,"Re-organization and position requirements exceed position salaries and levels.Goal setting is determined by what other positions feel a person should be doing, not by what the position requirements are. Internal job postings are mostly pre-determined as to who they assign."
good,stock rotate stock as needed and worked my way up to small scale manager. liked hours of operation and different people i got to work with
good,We mustbe ready at all times- including fingerprints & background check
good,"El almacén de productos terminados requiere de una vigilancia permanente, los que trabajamos en lugar sabemos que no cuanta con el suficiente resguardo para la mercadería en ella pernocta."
good,"Awesome work life balance. "
good,"A typical day was preparing for the shift, getting the orders together for the shift and passing out of the nights work. I learned more about people and more ways to manage."
good,Decent company to work for. Not terribly concerned about their employees. The company's bottom line was always at the forefront of their business. Employees were good honest workers.
good,"8 to 9 hr days.  Payroll and human resource G/L reconciliations and analyzed (26 G/L Accounts).  Bi-weekly Payroll reconciliations."
good,"It is a traditional company with more than 100 years of history.  To advance in this company, one needs to be in the ""in group"" with the few senior managers."
good,"Great to Company to work for , They are very motivated in the safety and well being of all their employee's. Management is always involved and encouraging employees to work through their Skill Level Blocks to better them self's in their own personal achievements to gain advancement within the company."
good,"Un día típico en mi puesto es una reunión de coordinación con demand planner ."
good,It was a ok company the benefits. The bad was the management team some of them were not professional with the way they handle situations.
good,Very busy environment. In the workplace it is a must that you are very attentive because everything is moving at a great amount of speed. While I worked there I moved up pretty fast from working on the line to becoming a forklift driver. I learned how to separate the materials and place them in their correct place. I enjoyed riding the forklift and learning more about the different materials that we had in the warehouse.
good,"A wonderful experience in some areas, need improvement in People Management."
good,It is an okay place. The hours were very convenient for me. The most enjoyable part of the job was it was work that always had to be done. I like to keep working and staying busy.
good,"Trabajo sin posibilidad de quedar efectivo, es una fabrica internacional, reconocida en todo el mundo, con un ambiente de trabajo digno!"
good,"I feel that clorox has the potential of being a great company overall but there's lack of communication, unfairness/favoritism, and unprofessionalism."
good,My review at the Clorox warehouse other than the hours the job was great we used to receive free products from the company the pay was OK and I learhow to operate the electric pallet jack in my time there great place
good,"The Clorox Company has a nice work-life balance and fun atmosphere, but where it falls short is it's management and compensation.  Salaries are below average to average, and managers' focus are on profits and margins, rather than support for their employees. It has the potential to improve, but falls short of many other bay-area companies willing to offer higher salaries and better support."
good,Loved working for the company till they promoted me to a desk where four other women had failed. Management turned the other check and let me fail.
good,Es una empresa en la cual podrás realizar tus labores en forma sencilla y esta se acomoda de acuerdo a tus horarios simepre y cuando relalices y desempeñes el trabajo encargado.
good,"Learning, as a core motivator and teaching others, as a incentive."
good,"Diariamente me ocupo del análisis de los clientes asignados de canal mayorista y supermercados, realizo la aplicación y control de las cobranzas y verifico los descuentos realizados por el cliente a fin de descartar desvíos y reclamo facturas impagas o saldos mal descontados Tengo reuniones con la fuerza de ventas  para tratar los saldos y minimizar lo máximo posible los importe que impactan en los Informes de Incobrabilidad que se reportan a distintas gerencias."
good,"en la manera en la que hicieron el recorte de personal no se vale porque sentí que rendia al 100 y se reflejaba en mi trabajo y evidencias...."
good,"Typical day @ work consist of bottling PINE SOL, checking product for defects and getting out as much product as possible. The hardest part is troubleshooting the equipment when you have issues but the enjoyable part is learning while you trouble shoot the problem"
good,It was a normal interview. Dress nice and show up before interview time have resume with you. References and work history will be asked just be organized and ready to answer any questions
good,I like the job they pay ok but i think my work ethic is to fast past for the company and i would like to stay but looking for a bigger and better opportunity to provide for my family.
good,the work place was all out of order. the people in there did what they wanted to do. The pay was to low and they had no kind of organization in the building.
good,I was testing filters in pilot plant for waters. All I did was working with chemicals and helping other workers when needed. I have nothing else to say but I was filling in for someone.
good,"Learned about Project management and working in different Clorox company site in Latin America. Typical day at work is very hard, because you have to do many things at the same time. Excellent benefits program. The hardest part of the job the Family Balance and traveling time(commute)."
good,"They are fine - not great, not terrible.  Pay is terrible but work/life balance is great.  Overall, you won't get to make decisions because the org is so hierarchical."
good,"This model is the replacement for, and continues the tradition of the EOS 5000/88, marketed in January 1995 and the EOS 3000/88, marketed in March 1999, which were very popular because of their affordability, small size, light weight, ease of operation, and silent operation. It is intended mainly for the East European and Asian markets."
good,The manager were fun to work but yet real unorganized. Sometimes I literally had to make sure one manager knew the other gave me different orders from what the other gave me.
good,It was good working here. I am moving since im looking for some better opportunities. Nice people to work with. Lot of free Clorox products for the employees to take home everyday
good,Sometimes it was very stressful for the pay is not worth it and the lead sometimes have nasty attitudes and they want to work you to death and sometime the hours where less
good,The work is fairly simple but it can become a bit overwhelming if you cant keep up with the pace . Every job has its pros and cons but the productivity is good
good,Empresa multinacional con gran trayectoria que ofrece desarrollo personal
good,"Clorox is a good company to work for. The employ the work life balance atmosphere, and they have competitive compensation. Overall, Clorox is a good company to work for."
good,It was so long ago I cannot fairly give them a review based on the work environment of today.  Workload was more balanced and supported one Sales Director.
good,I never really wanted to work in fast food but it paid the bills so you do what you need to. The only issue was the owner had 2 different locations and the one in the better neighborhood got the better treatment and the newer things making it harder for us to have all we needed to operate properly. The coworkers were fine though
good,Clorox is a very productive work place. very organize and fast paste place. some days are slow and some are non stop consistent work. The adverge days would consist of lifting 45 pounds for 9-10 hours a day
good,"The day always starts off good at Clorox. There are lots of people with different backgrounds and ages who are there to help anyone that just started the job. The thing that i loved most about this job was that they always had things for you to do. I learned that Clorox does not only ship clorox products but others as well, and that taught me once again uu cant judge a book my its cover.  At this job i also learned more about my personality as well as my future. Because the job had many people  that i got to meet and grew alone with them, I had a better understanding of what life is really about."
good,"Lots of boxes and maintaining of the machines as they would jam for silly reasons. Dry environment, repetitive work environment with a laid back atmosphere"
good,"Worked as a team member. Ran machinery, assembly, and fork truck. There was only one other women on the shift that I worked at so I missed getting to talk to someone that had the same interests as I did. I had a hard time sleeping during the day because I had  sons at home at that time. The lack of sleep really got the best of me."
good,"Working for this company was a total disaster the pay wasnt was not equal to the work, workers didnt want to complete their jobs, supervisors didnt enforce the wrong doing throughout the company. Even though, I had that my working experience their wasnt the best. Not necessarily saying how i worked because I always got the job done, worked hard and never complained. It was time for something bigger and better due to my work ethic."
good,"Clorox is trying to get into healthcare and doing well,  but lacks leadership and experience to get there.  They don't have a sales incentive program that is truly incentivizing and they lack a sales culture."
good,"Work life balance is emphasized, but sometimes at the expense of getting the job done.  Promotions often feel political and it's hard to feel like this is a long term place if you're not of the Clorox mold.  Also, our pay isn't very competitive for the Bay Area."
good,Clorox is a great place to work.  The people that work there are colleagues but also friends.  It's like one great big family.
good,"What I enjoyed initially about working at Clorox was the feeling of having a job where people were trusted and treated as adults who were all there for a common purpose.  "
good,It was very fast and moving and it was not stop moving.  It was a temporary job through a temporary agency.
good,"muy movido"
good,this job description was includes tagging product boxing product and making boxes for product a typical day you can do one or al three things in one. this job tired your body out and also made  very sore which is the worst part about it other than that its fun
good,"I acquired the necessary skills with my tenure at clorox, I learned to do my job effciently and effectively. The hardest part about the job was lack of communication."
good,"I promote Infection Prevention with new and improved commercial Clorox Ready To Use products. Lots of window time as I cover two states. Working with Distributors to deliver the orders can be a challenge at times because everybody has their own set of priorities. Building relationships across Acute Care, Long Term Care and Surgery Centers is rewarding"
good,"Monitoring chemical processing system and producing high strength bleach. Connecting and disconnecting chemical cars, rebuilding pumps, testing product quality and teaching emergency response classes. Great co-workers and management, team environment. Hardest part of job was the smell of bleach, most enjoyable was learning different systems and products."
good,Un lugar un poco estancado en cuanto a automatización de procesos todo es muy manual
good,"From a temporary perspective the company was good for it was. It's factory work, lots of repetition, long nights, long days. The hardest part would be the shift work going back and forth between nights and days. The people are good though, tough but good."
good,"Clorox is a very stable and profitable company, they care about their employees. Unfortunately Management, depending on the dept, is not so great. The culture is good however it depends on the dept."
good,Clorox is a great place for learning to handle high volumes of work at a far pace. However the room for advancement seems pretty slim. Looking to further my career elsewhere
good,"the job didn't pay enough to me yes it was at your own pace it was not worth the work , the people are great in there but the work is not especially getting paid only 8.25"
good,"It's an ok place to work. I moved while I was working there so the commute turned into a hassle for me. 82 miles 1 way. Not their fault."
good,I have great days at work. I learned to be more helpful.  I like working with people my co workers are great the mangement is great
good,"Reuniones convincentes..la comisión establecida era 350 mas mi sueldo 750.00 ... así llegue al 120 xcto...no pagaban mas...no festejaba el día del vendedor ni la madre ni navidad (no cena ni tarjeta).aveces eran muy duros para llamar la atención ..   ponían en duda mi palabra a pesar que les demostraba un buen trabajo,trabajaba mas de mi horario establecido para apoyar en la cuota,lo cual no tuve ningún problema en apoyarlos siempre que era necesario los apoyaba....pedí un aumento en mi comisión ,hicieron caso a omiso. Presente mi carta de renuncia."
good,"Clorox Company is a fast-paced environment and a great place for career growth and development.  I have learned a lot from Clorox Clorox because of their great training program in place.  As for the management, I have never before seen a company that cares so little for its employees.  My Co-workers were the great, we may have our differences sometimes, but in the end we were able to get things done."
good,Me gusta trabajar en equipo y de la mano de mis jefes
good,I work at this job as temporarily from a agency. I have been working there for one year in a half. It just was a two years contract but it was nice at
good,As a forklift operator I followed all of osha safety rules while transporting pallets through out the warehouse. I brought all the materials need to run the production line and also wrapped finish pallets and staged them
good,"Company is a bloated beast, kept afloat by inertia and brand equity, with a weird, somewhat passive-aggressive culture of sycophancy as the sole key to advancement."
good,A typical day at Clorox was very hot and fast paced. I honestly learned how to work and concentrate at a fast pace without getting frustrated. The management team did their job very well and made sure everything was completed on time. I enjoyed my coworkers. We made sure we were always on point. There was nothing really hard about the job. The most enjoyable part was actually gaining more information about the forklift and learning new task as well.
good,overall working in the warehouse was great. I enjoyed working with my hands and completing all tasks in a timely fashion.
good,"I Work a full day Monday-Friday, and I am a admin to 36 sales people in and out of the field "
good,Clorox is a good and quick job to further your career and a great opportunity to better your life .it gives you a sense of responsibility to want to do more things
good,"Great company. The give-a-ways are awesome. The experience I received was great. The only problem I have with Clorox is that they waited 7 months to tell me I was not where I needed to be with my position. That information would have been helpful at my 90 day mark not at 7 months. I was never coached by manager. So if you don't want to be coached or receive valuable information from your manager this is the perfect position. The new manager is okay. Shes young and does not have management experience. She enjoys treating you like a 3 year old also. But other than that, if you just stay in the position for a year, try to deal with the stuff that comes at you, you will be golden and move up."
good,"Clorox es una empresa que te valora mucho como persona, te cuida y te evalúa por resultados. Hay un gran ambiente para trabajar."
good,muy buena empresa y te da facilidad para poder crecer profesionalmente en el mundo de las ventas
good,to be honest i dont have much to say about the job other than we worked everyday with long hours for low pay in a heated enviroment .  benefits were good tho
good,You have your good days and your bad days at work. The co-workers were nice some a bit more nosy. The bosses i think were to linear on line leaders...
good,Many activities are outsourced so you're involved in more problem resolution activities and projects.  This is not a flat organization.  There are many levels of review and approval.
good,"As an intern, it is a good place to learn depending on your project. The campus is excellent. It has state of the art research and development facilities. Great atmosphere."
good,"Buen lugar para trabajar, buena coordinación entre las áreas"

good,"working in the warehouse field is something i really truly like doing because its a learning experience for me and all the experience i have learned has been worth it.and the most enjoyable day is commucating with all of my co,workers."
good,"Improper training, favoritism, new hires are treated poorly, cliquey work atmosphere. Young team leads lookong to hook up with new temps. See female temps getting let go because of unwanted  advancements and being retilated againt."
good,Use forkift or palletjack for order selecting. putting thing in the warehouse away. RF scanning
good,Stay on my feet for the full 9-10hrs. For the first 4-5 hours you're kind or comfortable with standing but after a while you get tired & drowsy. if the task they assign you to Is boring you will suffer
good,"se trabaja en equipo para cumplir los objetivos, se mantiene el orden y limpieza permanente, al principio note poca capacitacion pero se compensaba con la ayuda de los demas operarios,tengo buenos recuerdos en general"
good,"hours are there 12hr shifts "
good,Exelente calidad de trabajo y cuidado del personal de trabajo.
good,Its hard to get on permnant they pay is low  the hours get cut on a regular the pay is not worth the time too many broken rules no leardership within the company
good,Keyed hundreds of invoices daily at work. Met new friends in the shipping and freight department.
good,"Comedor en planta gratis , cafeteria "
good,"Typically start at 7:30 am (M-F) unless there are important issues on that particular day - periodic late night or weekend need to supervise/assist in an emergency spill clean-up or first aid incident"
good,Management needs to do a better jobs at looking in on low level workers and ensuring they are actually working. Too much meetings.
good,"The typical day at work is steady and fast pace."
good,"If you are a Process operator, it will be a new experiance for you to learn something new, to build your resume."
good,I work thru a temp service called flexible staffing. And I must say working at Clorox is a very good experience for me. I like the physical work of unloading trailers. But I wish flexible staffing paid more for the work that has to be done
good,"Excellent place to work, unfortunately some of the leaders in specific HR areas where detailed knowledge is required are absent. Great work environment"
good,Great place to work where safety was always number 1 priorty. Where money was no object when it came to keeping machinery running up to standard . We did not have supervisors so a lot of decisions was was made workers in the team.which made you feel like you had more ownership.
good,"Morning team meetings, where you learned what concerns needed to be addressed.  Management at the time did not believe in quality issues only process issues.  That attitude made it hard to keep integrity and quality in the forefront."
good,"Es una Cía que valora al colaborador, en lo que respecta a RRHH, el ambiente laboral es muy bueno."
good,"A typical day for me would start with a team meeting and then we would separate and work with our individual project teams which can include people from other departments. "
good,A very fast and steady word place with a very excellent group of co workers. Very strict and no tolerance for any disruption. A very nice and clean break room and all around a clean and healthy work place.
good,"as long as you can enjoy continental shifts, The Clorox Company is a great place to work. Unlike some companies I have worked for, at Clorox your fellow employees are very welcoming and kind as long as they see you are there to work."
good,"Perduré poco tiempo en el puesto de trabajo."
good,The company was not a good place to work. They treat the employees like they are not humans and they talk to the employees any kind of way.
good,This job was ok. It was a huge factory and required a lot of work sometimes but most of the co workers were team players. I learned how to work a conveyor belt and palletize different products. The management was ok but could've been better. The hardest part of the job was meeting the dead line for different products to be packed and ready to be shipped out to the distributer. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning how different machines worked and how to operate them.
good,Puesto de trabajo muy tranquilo y unos compañeros muy agradables
good,"A typical day of work at the clorox company is like a daily routine. i clock in and immediately go to work. I learned how to build boxes, pack them and ship them out. All of my co-workers and fun to be around and they make the day go by faster. The hardest part of the job is standing the full 8 hours with one 30 minute break. The most enjoyable part is knowing all the work is done and going home."
good,"the place was a good job to work at and paid good to begin with. like how the company is ran,"
good,"Great to move up"
good,Company needs to be more organized with respect to delegating duties and responsibilities to contractors.
good,"Aprendí mucho a sacar provecho del tiempo y a ser responsable con mis actividades, el ambiente laboral un poco pesado ya que las 8 horas laborales se cumplían de pie en un solo lugar en el punto de venta y esto generaba un poco de cansancio."
good,very good pay and they did fun stuff like wonderland when I was there
good,"clorox is and good career job if you can handle the strong chemicals, from the bleach products. working at clorox I learned more about management than any previous company I've work for in the past, the hardest task at clorox is adjusting to the chemical, the employees are nice and the most enjoyable asset at the company is the weekend off for family time."
good,"Ambiente grato pero un poco desorganizado"
good,"Clorox es una empresa muy buena para trabajar ya que hay gente humilde y profesional de la cual aprendes."
good,My typical day at work starts at around 6:30am and ends around 4:30 or 5pm. I first check out the forklift so if I need product down I can reach it. Log on to my scan gun and begin pulling orders. While working here I learned how to operate a Raymond swing reach turret truck. The most enjoyable part of my job is loading the trucks.
good,Great environment for the warehouse field nice balance work pace and tempo steady and constant production numbers. Reliable and hard working team members.
good,En Clorox aprendí el significado de equipo de trabajo. Planeación y estrategia de Ventas. Lanzamiento de Nuevos productos. El mejor equipo de trabajo!
good,overall good place to work with good culture and hard working co workers. some ability to move up in the organization. employees with long tenure and summer hours that close at 12:30 on Fridays
good,"Lack of training, lack of tools for progress.  Company did not keep the lines of communication flowing across the board."
good,"Enjoyed learning from my co-workers"
good,"Clorox was a good company to work for pay and benefit wise, but the hours and schedule were long and confusing at times.  While working at Clorox I was on a 12 hour, rotating night shift which did not line up with having small children for me personally.  "
good,"Clorox is a respectable employer, the company follows good career matrix to grow talent within. However, I felt that the culture is aggressive and the more aggressive you are the better you will fair."
good,"I think that at the time I worked for Clorox there was confusion and inconsistency in the direction of HR.  I worked at the Hidden Valley Ranch plant in IL.  I had hoped to utilize my HR skills to improve the performance and work culture at the plant but was unsuccessful due to the unethical and poor leader of the plant.  Unfortunately I was unable to transfer to the corporate headquarters in Oakland, CA (my hometown) when I needed to go home to help with the care for my father who was suffering from terminal cancer."
good,en estos tipos de trabajo lo bueno es que uno conoce gente y aprende a ser tolerante y empatía con los demás. Pero en tanto el trabajo es un poco agotador  ya que la mercadería es pesada.
good,"Excellent place to learn the ropes for the CPG world.  Lots of great business leaders to work with and learn from.  Teams can be collaborative.  However, the company regularly cuts bottom 20%, meaning at times it can be cut throat."
good,Fasted Past Working On Assembly Line Packaging Things Into A Box Sometimes Palletizing Items To Be Wrapped And Packaged. Sometimes Got To Take Home Damaged Goods At The End Of The Week.

good,En esta empresa tuve la oportunidad de aprender los parámetros de calidad con las cuales debe contar un producto terminado .
good,Great company to work for. Good life work balance overall.Pay folks fairly for the work they do. Long term projects and job security.
good,"Clorox is constantly working on being a better place to work.  It is the most diverse company I have come across. Work life balance is strongly encouraged but I suspect at higher levels this may not be the case. "
good,"Great pay and benefits once you go permanent with the company. But, you can be released just as quick as being hired. Being consistent with attendance can bring a promotion sooner than later."
good,"bueno aprendia a usar todas las maquinas de la fabrica ,la parte mas dificil era estar en el depocito y lo qe mas me gusto fue la experiencia de cada puesto."
good,"Overall in dealing with all of the jobs I have had, the workplace environment was not that bad. I consider it as a usually job because with every job you have to work. I learned a lot of skills not just only work skills but skills with dealing with other people and their emotions on the job. The hardest part of the job is to basically not work because time will go by slow and you dread to be there. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to get the work done in a timely fashion."
good,muy buen trabajo aprendi a no mezclar lo personal con lo laboral y a tolerar
good,This was a place of business where people could come to relax eat good dance listen to great music an meet new people one my favorite places to be

good,"Wish I could return to work,but company I was with lost the contract."
good,Empresa aún en crecimiento
good,"Learned several different databases, employee safety is a priority. Easy management styles. Clear directions and expectations. Teamwork and support from everyone"
good,"American Tobacco Campus office is beautiful.  Cubes are not cubes but circular tables divided into 3 or 4 ""desks"" which makes it easy to collaborate or difficult to concentrate, depending on your preference. "
good,"My overall view is due to my lack of alignment to recent leadership changes and direction.  They have a good benefits package, very dynamic and overall a good company.   They are seeking young talent, a great place to start a career at."
good,Great brands.  Solid management.  Good benefits.  A very corporate-like environment.  Work/life balance is a plus.  Co-workers are great partners.  Progression within functions is slow.
good,it's a nice place to work and they give great hours but the pay not matching the work. Like the pay was $8.25 the start but it was fast paced work. So I believe we should've got paid more.
good,Clorox is a nice place to work. It like every other company it has it positives and negatives. The culture is very laid back. I feel people are not help responsible for their mishaps.
good,No existe una jerarquia marcada donde un simple colaborador sin jefatura puede con tranquilidad conversar con un Manager sin temor a no ser escuchado.El colaborador es el activo mas importante de la compania por lo que se enfocan mucho en el crecimiento de ellos asi como de los Managers para que puedan dar a sus equipos soporte y feedback y coaching adecuados.
good,It's fairly easy you're doing the same thing all day. It can get really hot at times. You have to reach a certain goal by the end of your shift. It's very diverse.
good,"Unload trucks with empty bottles onto an assembly line. Must keep the line tight so as not stop machinery. Fast paced. I learned how the bottles are filled with chemicals, sprayer tops and labels added automatically and then the completed product is boxed. I liked keeping the spray trigger container full."
good,The management team is supportive and willing to listen to your needs.  Co-workers are generally fun and closely tied.  .
good,Well for the most part its laid back fun. unlike most places that are stern and straight forward i was able to be myself. I was given the chance to catch up even when behind.
good,It is actually a great company to work for ive been with the CEO of the company from another EXEL site he is a wonderful leader.
good,"Shipping & Receiving, loading trucks, operating palletizer and assembly lines,driving forklifts, handling pallet-jack and misc. equipment was due for busy day every day.  I learned to work efficiently and effectively.  I became a supervisor responsible for the Military Matrix Crew of six and management was very supportive of this endeavor.  The hardest part of the job was working in the warehouse during summer months as the heat was almost unbearable.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the diversity of people (employees)."
good,Decent place to work. Benefits are being scaled back though
good,people were very friendly
good,"Clorox has a good benefits package, very dynamic and overall a good company. They are seeking young talent, a great place to start a career."
good,Un lugar de trabajo donde se puede aprender mucho y donde se valora el aporte que uno pueda aportar
good,"buen sueldo , grato ambiente de trabajo, zonas de trabajo por distritos mejor planificacion"
good,La carga laboral era grande pero el grato ambiente laboral hacia que une se identifique con la empresa y haga propias sus metas y logros
good,"I had the pleasure of designing what I was going to do in my job. As an Executive Assistant there wasn't quite enough work available to keep me busy so I was allowed to take on additional duties that I wanted which included Safety Committee, Ergonomics Specialist, some facilities duties, and lead for one of the charitable organizations employees volunteered to volunteer at to complete their 8 hours of volunteer time yearly."
good,"Clorox is an outstanding company to work for. I highly recommend working for the Clorox company. They value all of their employees, have great benefits and good pay."
good,Muy buen clima de trabajo.mucha prudensia.compañerismo.limpio.agradable.seguro.
good,"Clorox is clean, organized and safe work place. Levels achievement can be difficult to achieve . Teamwork concept is top-rated. I loved driving my forklift in shipping and receiving."
good,"I have worked for the Clorox Company for quite a few years and overall it has been a favorable experience.  There are some internal things that I feel are somewhat discriminatory on an ethical basis, even though they may be legal. e.g. Some employees are allowed to tele-work and some are not, even when they are in the same pay grade.  I have seen internal politics on advancement where people are promoted based on who they know. Although I could never prove that, it's pretty obvious.  Other than that it's really a pretty decent place to work."
good,I loved it but i had to relocate back to columbus to better my self. Management was good at first in till they hired and fired.
good,Clorox was an excellent company to be employed. My duties were to assist fellow employees with the daily operations of shipping/receiving as well as special projects of shipments to various plants.Great people and excellent benefits.
good,"company very much into developing employees to high skill levels through high performance team building, Departmental average years of service over 20 no disrepect tolerated from management or associates. Good company to retire from. Hardest part of job was coordinating training schedule into daily operations."
good,una buena empresa para aprendizaje se trabaja con varias marcas a nivel de mercados y da excelente formacion
good,Provided great advancement and opportunities to grown and development
good,Great place to work. The company pushes teamwork and makes a big effort to balance family and work. I learned to perfect my professionalism working with great team members and managers.
good,cheesy bloated not sure how thy stsy in business with such a huge rd staff who does nothing but go to conferences and offsites and power point slides constantly.
good,This was a good career choice for me as it was fast paced and allowed me to make decisions and operate with efficiency while creating an atmosphere that enhanced the work experience of my VP as well as the entire team.
good,A typrical day working at clorox  was at a slow pace but it moved pretty fast on some days the co-workers was easy to work with and we all worked as a team
good,"Clorox was a great place to work , its a fast paced production job , also very close to home . Worked 12 hour days with alot of product give a ways. no regrets...thx"
good,"The days started early, 5:30am and ended around 3:30pm. While working at Clorox I learn useful management skills. I also learn a lot about the daily operation of a manufacturing plant as well as project management. The people who work at Clorox are somewhat happy. The pay is very good so employees believe the stress is worth the money. The easiest part of the job is that there are instructions how how to perform every task so there is little guess work. On the other hand there we constant changes so it was very difficult to stablize."
good,Clorox is one of the heaviest users of analytics in the CPG industry and leverages data to drive business success.  They recruit from the top business schools in the world and value a very multicultural work environment.
good,"the long hours.....no stability...hours always changing..... dont get a life.....beneifts horrinle...never again,.. glad i found another job thats less stressful"
good,"Clorox is known as a good place to become a middle manager. Managers are, in part, graded by how well they prepare others for promotion. There are a lot of different levels in the Clorox hierarchy and that might frustrate some people."
good,Great opportunities to work with the best people on the best consumer brands. The company allows for a good work life balance. The General Offices are located in one of the best geographic areas in the US.
good,"This is a great company to work for, the culture is a little stuffy in upper management.  Excellent benefits and pension plan when I was there.  A lot of opportunity to grow."
good,worked here before the purchase from Clorox. It was a family run company and pretty much everyone got along as a team. Hustle and bustle was good and days filled with work
good,Working in PMO with IT and the other groups was a rewarding experience. The Clorox PM's and Clorox Program Managers were bright and a pleasure to work with.
good,"It is a very important brand and big company in the US, but for Latin america it has been struggling with market position vs local brands and they are not developing right marketing, so it has become a small and mediocre company to work in"
good,Working here has been ok the only reason I left was your where being cut but the pay was nice and people friendly really a good all around place to work
good,Typical day at work includes trouble shooting issues. Installing new versions of Middleware technologies. Automation. Its great working experience with clorox.
good,"my experience for the most part was a good one. after working at this facility for several years, it was like one big family. the benefits were all very competitive, and the schedule was semi malleable. frequent changing of supervisors made room for major frustrations."
good,It was an awesome experience working for Clorox. If you are in a phase of a life where you want to work for a company that makes you not work so much but gives the perfect life balance then Clorox is the way to go.
good,The culture at Clorox is great. They also invest a lot in their employees. I received training both in a classroom and hands-on and received certifications that have helped boost my career outside of Clorox. The people I worked with while there were dedicated and professional and I am still in contact with many of them to this day.
good,I enjoy the culture at Clorox. The IT department is innovative and progressive.  They have a good work/home balance environment and most people are willing to help.
good,The company had great hours and was great with the benefits it offered and the company was great with advancement and the supervisors were good at what they did.
good,I was there for only a short time but while I was there it was fun good co-workers decent hours good management learned to drive a fork lift and received a few gifts while there
good,"Great overall company that had put the right people in the right places to succeed. The only draw back was it is located in the Bay Area, which means housing was very expensive and the schools are not very good."
good,"The company culture varies depending on which group you work for. The environment is fast paced in grades 22-23 and some 24, but it depends on the group you work in.  They do have a great compensation package. Some departments allow you to work from home 1 - 3 day a week."
good,it was a good experience overall.  this was so long ago. Not sure what it is like today but the company still exists and not sure what their products are today.
good,"good fun company, very competive. But great pay and great bennifits. Loved working there and hated to leave but had to due to my family relocating. would work here again"
good,I really enjoyed my years at Clorox.  The company does a great job of staying balanced and respecting the people.  Great culture and a good group of high achievers.
good,Es una empresa seria y brinda los beneficios por ley y consta con un ambiente limpio
good,"good job, current management is too power happy. Expects too much from employees. Equipment constantly breaks, and gets bandaided together. management expects perfect production numbers, but will never approve neccesary updates or permanant fixes on equipment."
good,"Great place to work if you don't have a life, but I love to work in a warehouse setting that keep you busy, you can learn a lot from working at Clorox"
good,"Flexible hours, with the option to work from home at least one day a week. It can be hard to get promoted if you don't network internally."
good,At the Clorox company they pride on safety overall and that's something that I really admire. The work itself is not hard and the breaks are spread out so that you don't drain yourself before the shift is over. Management provides a nice environment that enjoyable which also make the team effort that much more pleasant.
good,"It is a company with a very good environment, good relationships between colleagues. It is a company very challenging because it is always innovating."
good,"Got trained on different machines, cool place to work..temp jobs don't last long. Pay could be higher, learned slot working here..will be on your feet allfay"
good,It was a fast job you had 2 move real fast and keep up. Good personality up there but they really do care about you up i liked the job.
good,Conforme con el paso del contrato de la empresa muy buena. Y cordial .
good,"	 Has 9 Years of experience in SAP BW/BI, SAP HANA along with SAP BO ABAP/4 programming and BW on HANA, as a Technical Architecture & Team Lead."
good,My shift began at 5. We had a brief team meeting to let us know where we stood and what we had for production that day. We then selected our fork lifts and began the days/nights work. Management kept us motivated throughout the shift. my co-workers were an awesome help when i needed them. There was nothing hard about this job at all! The most enjoyable part about this job was knowing i was being productive by my LMS score status. That kept me self motivated.
good,"es una empresa con mucho trabajo en equipo responsabilidad, un ambiente laboral agradable con muchos beneficios tanto social como económicos, en mi jornada trabajo se realiza mantenimientos preventivos y correctivos a las maquinas de la parte de producción, se generan ordenes de trabajo entre otras, aprendí a ser líder de una maquina  a reforzar mis conocimientos en electricidad, instrumentación, mecánica,electromecánica, y de automatización, me gusto mucho el ambiente laboral, y una cosa muy importante es que aprendí hacer las cosas con orden y responsabilidad."
good,A typical day at work was busy knowledgeable great teamwork hard part of the day was leaving to go home joyful time of the day was getting my quota.
good,"Good company to growth in your career with good people, good compensation and benefits."
good,I worked on Data Center migrations project for Clorox. The team is driven by a very highly motivated leadership which acknowledges the skills one brings to the table. At the same time it is a fun place to work as the work culture promotes integrity and work life balance.
good,"Good solid company; good work environment."
good,A typical day at work is getting there on time and getting to my station getting started with whatever my assignment is that day. I loved my job working with others and standing and moving around most of the day. I learned to work a production line to perfection.
good,great in general
good,Working at Clorox was a great experience for me. Working as a lead supervisor i learned that you have to have alot of patience dealing with the employees..the people are great co workers to work with.
good,"nice raises, skilled co-workers, HR was a nightmare that seemed they were only out to get you and take things away (benifits decreased and attendance policy was crazy and the main HR lady would flat out refuse to talk to employees and put you off on other HR people), they tried to do dinners for safety but food usually was sub par, management seemed to be headed in a good direction, there was a ton of things to learn in the plant but rarely received training(it is all or self learning from documentation). I only left to move when my fiance got a new job out of state."
good,What I enjoyed most about this job were my coworker's. We always came together as a team whenever anyone needed help. I also operated new forklift and running a line.
good,"I enjoyed working at Clorox.  They treated me well.  They have great products and brands.  They also take employee well-being very seriously.  The company is good at keeping you located where you want to live, and is getting better about promotional opportunities from outside the corporate offices."
good,"Great culture, competent management, work life balance. Not too much room for advancement given the size but you get exposed to all areas of the business so it's a great learning experience."
good,"Safety first, attendance second! Great opportunity and benefits!  It's easy work if you can learn how to supervise and operate a machine.    They are very strict on safety, attendance, and policy."
good,"My time at Clorox has been mixed. There is a lot to like, but a lot of those same things have related cons. For example, there are plenty of opportunities for promotions and higher level roles, the flip side of that is that there are a lot of layers. Similarly the work-life balance is great, but the flip side is that it is a much slower paced environment that I'm used to."
good,"Overall, Clorox is a good place to work. Great people, good atmosphere at work, Finance function works hard to foster team spirit. Can be difficult to progress in your career if you start off in a lower-visibility position."
good,"Worked at a sturdy pace with likeable  people ."
good,I held progressive leadership positions with both companies.  They are well-managed and completely transparent environments.  Best practices are shared and all leaders share information for the good of the company.
good,"Amazing atmosphere, ongoing training and support."
good,"My first job was at The Clorox Company, and they do great job of teaching you how to transition from college to a work environment. A typical day deals with a lot of meetings, phone calls, and some lab time. Most managers are strong people developers who truly want you to succeed. Coworkers are friendly and the work environment promotes collaboration allowing you to talk to anyone at any level at any time. The hardest part of the job is that when you're in a position you have to stay in that position for about 2 years before they will rotate you. Most enjoyable part of the job is how rewarding it is to see the products you've worked on in stores."
good,"aprendi a manejar porcentajes de espacios,manejo de inventarios,en cuanto a la jefe excelente ser humano se preocupa por sus empleados,compañerismo dentro de la empresa."
good,"This place is great. The people are great and the work is abundant. The change process is slow and bringing materials to market takes a lot but this is something the company is aware of and working on. If you don't go in at a decision making position, it could be hard to get your ideas heard without meeting upon meeting upon meeting..."
good,"En la organización como actividad se realizaba la evaluación  final de actividad , en la cual se premiaba a los funcionarios mas destacados ."
good,"Provide direction to team of 30 customer support analysts;  Interact with customers, sales team, cross functional team members"
good,Clorox is a results oriented company but provides work life balance for their employees. In general the company treats employees fairly. There are opportunities for growth and responsibility through mid-level manager roles.
good,"Enjoyed working here, it is a company with strong values and that cares for their people."
good,"I managed 7 executives calanders. My morning would start off with a quick checking with the director, sorting through emails, responding to those that were urgent. Booking travel, expense reporting, heavy scheduling, booking of conference rooms, ordering meals and supplies. Tracking legal documents for the team. Maintaining tracker forms. Research when needed. I learned allot around creative marketing, product placement in stores. My manager was great, I felt very comfortable with him to be candid, and vise versa. My co-workers were also a pleasure to work with. The hardest part of the job was loosing my manager when he got promoted. The change was hard for me, however learned how to accept and to expect change in the work place. The most enjoyable part of the job was sitting in on creative meetings and providing input on design aspects of our products."
good,"teamwork, comunication, employees helping one another,I learned something new every day, professional co workers and management also."
good,La cultura del trabajo es muy enfocada a resultados. Te da un muy buen equilibrio entre la vida personal y profesional. Asimismo el ambiente laboral es muy agradable.
good,"1) es trabajo que por mi formación profesional, fue siempre complaciente estar en dicha empresa."
good,This company was a fun place to work. I got to work from home on friday. It has bias hiring practices that were to hire all interns from Ohio and Michigan state universities and several small groups that were predominantly from india. They did not hire very many people locally and it is hard to convert from a contractor to a permanent employee unless you are an intern.
good,"I'm not sure if I would enjoy working in a manufacturing facility for the rest of my life, but if I was going to, I would want to do it with this company. The pay and benefits are great, the workers are friendly, and the management is solid. I really enjoyed my internship there and would strongly consider working there if I was offered a job."
good,"Great room for advancement and growth, training program does not exist so they hire mostly people with experience."
good,The people that work at the Clorox company are very nice. I formed bonds there that I won't be able to forget. They were great with work/life balance which made it easy for me to attend any school or sports related event. I learned a lot about retail businesses and the accounts receivable side which they trained me for. It was overall a great experience working for the Clorox company and will never forget it.
good,"Cuando ingresas te dan un pequeño recorrido por la empresa,"
good,"A typical work day would consist of working until your team's work is completed. Work loads vary upon the customer demand. Each employee must productively maintain an average  rating throughout the workday. There is some individual, but mostly team oriented."
good,It was a nice environment great people lots of over time all out great place the time i got off was great because i still had enough time to pick the kids up from school and help them with home work

good,Excelente ambiente de trabajo es una empresa joven con oportunidad de desarrollo profesional que esta capacitada para ser la mejor empresa en artículos de limpieza
good,I learned the different how Clorox is ship out. Overall it was a great experience I wouldn’t want to work there again. But it’s a great job to for someone.
good,It was a decent job for monetary purposes. No room for advancement and a long commute from me. Not a good job for people with respiratory ailments and no insurance.
good,"la empresa es muy buena  "
good,Great place to work because of people and atmosphere. There is plenty of opportunity to gain diverse experience in a variety of roles. Would recommend.
good,"Mi primer trabajo me formo en muchos aspectos, desarrollar presupuestos, lanzamientos de nuevos productos, analisis de mercado, trabajar con varios departamentos, etc."
good,"I enjoyed working for the company. The work environment was fantastic. All the employees were very helpful, kind and offered help when needed."

Other days I operate various machines like molding machines, sealing, and recently began training on forklifts. Basic warehouse duties"
good,Having never worked in a factory before I was really nervous about being able to keep up with the physically demanding job. But I can honestly say that while there I learned the power of team work and how to push myself and challenged myself every day there and I enjoyed all of it!
good,I loved this job & would probably still be working there if it had not closed due to economic strain.

good,"El trabajo no es pesado sino de cuidado, tuve la oportunidad de crecer laboral mente pero des afortunadamente el aumento depende de ¨palanca¨ y no de actitudes esto se presta para que no exista un ambiente agradable sino tenso , la parte mas difícil del trabajo es convivir con las personas que no conocen el trabajo pero que son recomendadas por los jefes y ganan mas y tienen ventajas que no tienen las personas antiguas. Lo que agradezco del trabajo es que aprendí sobre mantenimiento autónomo, y a crecer como líder."
good,"I worked for Clorox for over 3 and a half years until the Plant Closed. I love my job, co-workers, and environment. I still miss the people and job every day."
good,In my opinion Clorox Warehouse would be a great starter job and for those who have difficulty getting a job. The work is consistant and the supervisors try their best to accomadate you the best way they can. A usual work day is an 8 hour shift but some saturdays you can receive overtime.

good,"Clorox was a great company.  The only down side to packaging associate was the work hours.  There are two 12 hour shifts and due to a high employee turn over rate, we were forced to work mandatory overtime.
