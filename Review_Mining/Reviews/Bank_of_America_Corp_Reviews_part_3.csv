While I do feel that there is job security; however, job security doesn’t necessarily mean that your current job function will always be around.  If a position were to no longer exist Bank of America does really well with placing you into a new position.  The down side to this is that you are starting over again and with starting over again your proven track record doesn’t always transfer to your new role which leaves a lot of employees feeling as if they are not getting anywhere career wise.  This doesn’t only apply to the removal of a position, it also applies to changing lines of business within the company.  Over all I am pleased with all the company has offered me over the years."

good,Very relaxed environment. Worked in clerical as office assistant. I prepared packages for personnel that were being laid off nationally. I learned to work time-conscious and well with a team because the packages had to be sent off at a certain time frame.
good,Bank of America started me off at the bottom of the totem pole. At first I was upset but as time went on I quickly advanced. I started off as a 20 hr Teller and ended up a Personal Banker full time. I gained knowledge and growth here and it was a good job until it wasn't.
good,Good money and benefits just high stress and lack of management  I was able to have surgery and pick right back up but it was held against me in advancing

good,"Great stable place to work at and excellent benefits. I was able to move up in credit card department and grow with the company, great commission. Managers are divers and kind."

good,"In my personal experience, my branch did not get a lot of traffic - so most of the day I was at my desk making outbound recorded sales and service calls with the intention of setting appointments.  The sales goals are very high but if you perform well you are compensated well.  Don't work here unless you love sales."

good,"I worked part time at night, and I absolutely loved working here. The management was great and the atmosphere was amazing."

good,"Worked for this employer over 10 years only to be sent a FEDEX package thanking me for my service and outlining the terms of my severance package. The lay off came 2 mos after being relocated 3000 miles from my family. I was upset, but that's business. I'd thought that devoting that much of time to a company, would have at least afforded me more. Great company if youre young, older experienced reps beware."

Walking customer through borrower's portal where daily information can be obtained to determine if a decision was made on their file."

Some of the managers that I worked with over the years was great to work with, I am about working. And It's not about me personally. But at the end The manager was very unprofessional. And co worker was excellent. The Hardest part was not taken anything personal, it is about the business. The enjoyable part of that job was leading my team to succeed In our goals in making sure that every deposit went out for that day."
good,Bank of America is a great place to work however the only draw back is high employee turnovers.  Experience will var base on department and manager.

good,At BOA I worked in the payment processing dept and I had a blast!! It was climate controlled and we were allowed to have small radios of ipods. I ran a machine and was one of their top operators.
good,"Bank of America as an employer is wonderful, they really treat their employees well.  I had a claims analyst position, which consisted of taking calls from angry people all day long who were disputing charges on their cards.  Not all of the calls were bad, and several of the calls I would end with a smile on my face or laughing.  It was those rough calls though that would out shadow the good.  I would have a customer yelling at me for thirty minutes about something like a fee on their card that they were disputing. I'd explain to the customer, that is something that would be handled with customer service since it is not a merchant charge. They would proceed to yell more and insist on not being transferred.  You can't escalate a call until a customer requests a manager, so sometimes it would be 45 minutes of talking in circles and explaining you can't assist before they either give up or request a supervisor. It was emotionally damaging."
good,"A typical day at work included a lot of paper work and reading. I learned how to work as a team, even though some days were challenging ( I was pregnant at the time).

good,"I really enjoyed my two years working with BOA! We, employees, were always treated with respect and dignity. The managers weren't quite as professional as they should.What i hated the most was that they fired people for little to no reason at all, Always on a Thursday, We would call it TERMINATION THURSDAY and if you made it through the day you had a job for another week."
good,I loved working for bank of america. The benefits are great! The only thing to keep in mind is that you have to sell so if you are not good at selling do not work here. Depending on where you work at you may have to deal with micromanaging.
good,"Fast paced environment, wiring funds and maintaining customer accounts. Worked with a lot of great people; that became amazing friends.  Management had some issues, but was good/fair for the most part. It was the perfect job for me & I loved the people I worked with."
good,"great experience"
good,I must state that BOA taught me exceptional customer service skills.  The hardest part was when the call center closed laying off hundreds of people.  Hundreds  of people trying to be re-employed with minimal local options.  A very sad day.

good,"Held opening duites"
good,"-Like any company, always striving to improve. New changes and restructuring."

good,The work environment kept me busy which was good. I learned different aspects of mortgage documents and how they were viewed by the bank. My co-workers were very helpful and knowledgeable about their jobs.

good,Respond to escalated emails where the homeowner’s loan modification has not been implemented. I was able to answer the most emails on my team. I trained associates that were new to the team. I also performed a second level review for associates that answered emails to ensure they were answered correctly. I also assigned escalated  emails to associates that were helping answer emails.
good,"Giving appropriate solutions to all the technical problems (software & basic Hardware) of the employees working in Bank of America.

In my experience they praise and promote people who meet above characteristics and are the ones that management supports. This is not a place for a woman who is beginning a family.

good,"I worked in a call center for Bank of America. As far as call-centers go, the Retirement and Benefits Contact Center is probably one of the better ones.

They gave me 15 days of PTO, Health insurance, an HSA and Dental and vision coverage."
good,"I would come in early at say hi to my fellow associates, send out cews, check emails, look to see if any training needed to be done or if any meetings, take back to back calls, Always knew no question would be looked upon as stupid."

good,"One of the best palaces to work.  However, it all depends on your position, location and managers.

In the end they realized the truth and the staff was cleaned up, I moved up and the work was completed saving the company millions of dollars in CPU cycles.

Management has spend countless hours working to provide all possible resources for their advisors. While the PMD program is difficult and not everyone will succeed, they work to help you every step of the way. There are still many things they could work on in their larger offices, providing more frequent meetings to check the progress of new advisors and see what resources they might need and how to get them.

good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them.

good,"Working at BOA was an excellent experience, it allowed me to embark  on uncharted territory that I enjoyed,  I found myself wonting to learn every aspect  of my job and go beyond my personal set of goals to become an excellent employee. Being employed with BOA also allowed me to work with so many different people from different walks of life, who always displayed unity and excellent work ethics.   I also had the opportunity to work with an excellent group of managers who allowed you to grow and learn with out having to second guess your career choice."
good,"I enjoyed going to work in the Signature Card department and working well with my co-workers, learning how to process customers signatures and determine if it was correct/incorrect, also communication with management went well for me, being a team player was a very important part of the job, once the process was learned it wasn't as hard to get the job done."

good,"O dia típico era bastante rotineiro, aprendi a trabalhar com uma agenda pré estabelecida pela gerência para que minimizássemos as possibilidades de erros. A integração com os colégas de trabalho era uma partes mais agradáveis do trabalho principalmente em se falando de cooperação."
good,"Job was as very challenging.   I enjoyed it because I spoke with clients from all over the United States.  Everyday was a learning experience.  "
good,"My time at Bank of America was great! It helped mold my communication skills and learn a lot about mortgage, so that when I buy a house of my own, I will know what to do and what not to do. The management was great! I built a relationship with them and we became like a family there. The hardest part of the job was the hours. I wasn't able to be with my kids after school and actually be a Mother to them. The most enjoyable part was actually talking to the homeowners. I loved helping them figure out ways to save their home. Just being a part of a solution was really warming to me."
good,"I learned a lot of my customer skills here. I learned to listen to the customer to hear what it is they need and to see how better we can help them. I learned a lot from the management by asking questions, seeing where I can advance in my job skills."

good,"I would revise loans to see if the numbers, and application was correct, if so then i would process the loan a step higher for the process to continue. If the everything wasn't correct i would not approve of it, and send the application back down. Management were very helpful in matters that a person needed guidance. My co-workers were very helpful, and respectful. The hardest part of the job was when loans came in frequently and needed to be done in a certain amount of time, but I would always get the task done. I enjoyed everything about the job. no complaints."
good,"productive and accuracy was 100% always,enjoyed the work and trained lot of people on process"

good,"Even though the bank was huge and employed many people, our manager made us feel important and every once in awhile the bank would treat us to food and snacks which would keep morale up.  All of my co workers were courteous and looked out for one another.  The hardest part of the job was getting the paperwork completed quickly and accurately but we were also allowed to listen to music."
good,"On a typical day, while the lobby is open, tellers are obligated to not only wait on customers who enter the lobby and drive-thru, of course, but also to answer the telephone. The telephone constantly rings and sometimes we can help the person on the phone by providing information regarding their deposits, their account balance, and a plethora of other questions or concerns the phone client may have. However, at times we must refer the client to another employee in the bank such as a loan officer; customer service who handles account problems, stop payments, opening accounts, etc; the mortgage lender; or another employee to help the customer."

good,I really enjoyed working at Suntrust Bank. When I left BOA I went to Suntrust for temporary position. I was responsible for two jobs and it a great leanring experience for me. I was able to multi task between two jobs. I felt like a permanent employee there and met great people. Actually one of the employees we still keep in contact with one another. The hardest part of the job was knowing it was going to end one day. Management was great and there were times when I was working for one manager and then transfer to another because of the work load.
good,"Overall a good area to work, however little room for advancement.  Recognition in the form of food and parties not monetarily."
good,Every moment of the work was enjoyable and loved to work at there.learned many things in and out of the process.about Banking every thing how the money capital get rotated mostly customer service.
good,"My overall experience with boa was satisfactory. I enjoyed the different projects that we were given because it allowed me to broaden my knowledge on different aspects of mortgage. All of our work projects were production based, so daily quotas had to be met which was good for me because it enabled me to create better time managing developmental skills. I learned the basics of thorough documentation/verification loan reviewing to dictate what type of help a borrower qualifies for. My position was to thoroughly check customer documents for underwriter submission and to ensure that  all of the information  and documentation needed from IIN letters were uploaded in the system databases iportal,urban,stewart,homesaver,etc) for crm. Once document requirements are met, all documentation was updated in LMA and submitted to underwriter. If requirements were not met, crm had to be tasked for phone calls and other missing documents . All records were then uploaded into homesaver. "
good,"It may seem strange that i gave an overall rating of 5 stars, but that is simply because that's more of a subjective rating for me, as, I was a contractor, technically employed and paid by Randstad. For me, this meant little job security, little room for advancement, and no benefits that permanent people get, such as Paid Time Off or vacation.  Still, in spite of all of this, I liked most of my coworkers and managers, and I was being compensated a great deal more than any of my fellow students."
good,"Strong focus on Sales, Customer Service and Operations.  Must be driven and proactive."

good,"Good, stable place to work. They have awesome benefits, and are huge on a work/life balance."
good,"Bank of America as a whole is one of the best companies to work for. The numerous perks (discounts on travel and computers, friends and family plans, work from home office, etc) they give to associates is hard to find at other companies. Individual teams/departments, unless you take advantage of the company perks, don't run the same way. There is too much re-org or not enough re-org, depending on what line of business you are in."
good,"learned a lot with Bank of America , A typical US based company with a lot of focus on risk and data security. Everything is automated and what ever is not they ask you to automate it ..lol !"
good,I worked from the ground floor up from a teller to Assistant VP of Premier banking and investment services. Education and training were paid for and I was able to get an MBA while working there. Benefits were great and corporate mission was all about high quality products and services for their clients.
good,"I liked working the hours, very flexible atmosphere for associates.  Typical day at work would be being aware what your daily job tasks would be, and follow through and being away of any changes. I prefer funding consumer loans, most of job functions at the bank included consumer loan support; auditing loan signed loan packages, preparing each loan to be boarded on the system."
good,The atmosphere is very welcoming and warm. Everyone in the office is very approachable. Everyone is always willing to teach/learn new things and willing to answer several questions. We get constant training on updates or new material. The benefits are great for the most part. The hardest part of the job is that it is contingent on the mortgage industry so if the market declines your job becomes unstable. The managers make the best of every situation and definitely make working at the office enjoyable and fun. They make every experience an enjoyable one and always protect their employees.

good,"A typical day involved meetings in the morning to get the day started and projected goals for that day and where we as a team need to be but close of business. The meat of the day was business as usual; phone calls to customers, collections, programs, or messages. The end of the day was either a floor meeting or individual team meetings to discuss the next days objectives. While at Bank of America I learned how to make and receive calls, manage accounts, create spread sheets, manage finances and create programs to help costumers out of their financial hardships. Locate or skip-trace customers who went off grid and become part of a team. Management was available when need. Direct management changed every month as did the teams so associates did not become complacent in their duties. Co-workers made the day at Bank of America. Their to lend a helping hand if needed and next to me on the phones going through the same situations and conversations as I was. The hardest part of the job was continuing to calls card holders knowing they can not make the payments and hoping their situation has changed. The most enjoyable part of the job was hitting goal. Each member on the team received payout and morale was through the roof."

During my time working at the processing center, I’ve obtained various knowledge of the back end processing of tax payments. My immediate supervisor was very helpful, and always reassured no question was a dumb question; if you need help just ask. That type of management gave me the reassurance that I didn’t’ have to be fearful of losing my job if a simple mistake was made. My coworkers were also very helpful and attentive to my training needs. The hardest part of the job was meeting the daily processing quota; you never know when your machine may jam and cause a delay in processing. The most enjoyable part of the job was the work environment. There was never a frown in sight; everyone I’d work with always had a positive attitude and outlook on their daily work load."

good,A good management is very important in order for the business to be successful. At BOA management was not really professional and there was a lot of favoritism taking place. I have been looking for a better and professional job so I make difference in my life and learn about different companies.
good,dealing with language barriers was the biggest challenge however great company to work for.
good,"The best thing about working there was the people I worked with. I enjoyed going to work every day. The supervisors where the best and always were interested in helping everyone achieve the highest efficiency and productivity possible. The benefits were excellent, the health package was very good. The worst part was their decision to close my department and send it out of state and lay-off 17 people. I loved the hours I worked, the shift. The work was interesting and I got some satisfaction from doing a good days work. My pay was satisfactory, the benefits good."
good,it was great working there. now i am moving to india so i have to leave it.

good,Managers in charge actually listened to workers. management made great choices.
good,"A typical day would be handling various projects under my financial adviser. I learned about the culture, values, and the system of the investment services industry. The other co-workers were very helpful in educating me about equities and the investment industry. The hardest part of my job was handling programs that I was unfamiliar with. The most enjoyable part of my job would be working in the investment industry and the atmosphere associated with it."
good,"sitting the entire time as you work,with breaks every 2 hours..learned how y to check things in a fast but correct way.hardest part was sitting one way for 9 hours,with breaks of course.most enjoyable part was the great payckecks"

good,Working for Bank of America was a overall good experience.
good,Working at Bank of America is very fun and my teamates are fantastic.A typiocal day at work is very demanding and unpredictable. So you must be on your best game everyday. My daily work day is around 10 to 11 hrs per day so the long hours is not an obstacle to me. I really enjoy my work. My only concern my company is the unstable of job security.
good,"The company and the benefits were great during my time there. The only minor complaint is how management handled changed and the transparency therein. Job security, training and advancement are also areas that need fleshing out/development in the learning department that I was in."
good,Day starting with counting cash drawers and opening computers. greeting clients and handling all their transactions in a accurate and expedient amd frendly manner.
good,"I thought I would retire as a banker, but the present economy dictates otherwise. I wish it was different, but it is what it is. I'm trying to accomplish other things right now. Hopefully, I can use what I've learned over the years in the bank somewhere else. If you hire me, you will not regret it."
good,Manage underwriters for loan modifications. Pull up daily caseload and assign loans accordingly. Review previous days production and coach associates to highs and lows. Hardest part of the job is too find enought tasks for the day.

good,being able to have some lead way with the departmental policies
good,Good place to work for previously. Culture has changed since Financial Crisis.

good,A typical day at work would be first shift hours where I handle cash and deposits mainly throughout the day.  I learned more about the financial institution as a whole and had the opportunity to work with generally a team based environment.  The most challenging part about the job would have to be when you are the only bank teller on the counter side and there is a line out to the doors because there would be no other bank tellers available (due to call outs or lunch breaks).  I mostly enjoyed the interaction with the clients that come through the doors.  I enjoy working with people and my team because although it becomes routine it is more of a comfortable and enjoyable scenario I appreciated thanks to the great team and clients I had the experience to work with.
good,Enjoy working but it can be challenging if you are not quick adapter to changes.  If you adapt quickly it is a great company.  It is pay for performance and who you know

good,"good place to work, nice benefits and bonus, definitely need to hire more people."
good,"Like any other call center, they only care about stats like handle time and surveys. If you have good handle time and surveys they'll give you insensitives, if you're not naturally gifted they'll provide little help to aid you. Then call it a day hope you magically get better."
good,Good job if they would've not located I would have still been there. It was a great company to work for the benefits was great and I love the role I was in..
good,I enjoyed working at Bank of America. I got base pay as well as incentive checks and bonuses. I was able to work 4 ten hour days to provide me with a three-day weekend..
good,"Like most big banks, enjoyment and advancement are dependent on branch and local leadership. As a whole, however, Bank of America provides great benefits and competitive pay."
good,Working in the branches was very stressful and competitive.  The hardest part of the job was the unreachable goals.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers.
good,i was the overseer for 3 shifts for a sub contract company that was cleaning the atm rooms. I literally built the company from the ground up for the owner. Was very hectic.
good,I worked there for 7 years and I really enjoyed my time there. The people and management were like a family and always willing to help. Never had anything bad say in my department.
good,"If you’re a lifer, this may not be the place for you as business needs changes every so often.  If you’re a go getter, you will move places being at the right place right time.  Started as call center associate and moved up quickly as an analyst in two years time."
good,Great access to tools and support to aid in career growth.  Wonderful benefits and great work/life balance.  Real team work and collaboration.  Best use of talent and opportunity for growth.

I help with deposits , checking accounts , credit cards and assisting the client in general with any questions or anything they may need for the account ."

good,"Great learning experience with some great people"
good,My time at Bank of America was great. They're good to their employees & customers. Not many banks or companies invest so much in their employees. It was stressful & customers were difficult at times but you always had support . For anyone who is thinking of working at BofA my advice would be. Ignore what you hear & make the most of your opportunity.
good,"I worked for Merrill Lynch : fast paced, little training, can be rewarding if you are part of a successful team. Not for everyone. CAs need to be licensed to get revenue share."

good,I worked for MLCC and was part of the middle management team there. It was a great opportunity to join numerous project teams where we built out new products and marketing strategies. Many chances to prove yourself and be noticed for promotions.
good,"We are rewarded with catered meals, certificates,recognition and points to purchase gift cards, house hold products..TV ECT and monthly bonuses for meeting goals... Overall this is a great company to work for but you must pull your weight just like any place else. I feel as though certain groups of people of are promoted just because of their race and also their sucking up to management. If this works for you so be it, I'm currently finishing my master's degree at the expense of the bank they have tuition reimbursement, which I think everyone should take advantage of. Overall it's a wonderful place to work just...STAY IN YOUR OWN LANE. You'll be fine. Excuse the grammar I'm typing fast and didn't proof read this lol."
good,BOA is a great environment to work in. The employees are friendly and easy to work with and management is professional. I would recommend BOA to anyone wanting to work in banking

good,"In 20 years, I gained vast experience in banking and corporate operations.

good,I loved working at Bank of America. The pay is good compared to other big banks and you also have the opportunity for additional Bonuses based on your performance.
good,"Great company to work for. You meet and establish great relationships with people."
good,BOA is a wonderful employer for the most part. They train you well enough to preform your day to day but the fact that customer surveys are so heavily weighted can be quite daunting and make for a very stressful work environment. If the survey goal was not as outrageous as it was i would still be there and be happy.
good,Entering securities orders & soliciting new clients. learned how to interact with many different types of people. Enjoyed learning from some of the best sales men in our business.
good,"There are so many different groups that are involved in many different aspects of finance that gives you some flexibility in what type of work you want to be involved in. There is a lot of opportunity for ambitious movers and shakers, but there are also opportunities for those who just want to do their jobs well. NY-based jobs have typical NY culture of overworking."
good,"I have been working for BOA almost ten years.From teller to Personal banker, to relationship manager to my current roll as a AVP small business consultant.The only one thing i am not happy is  not get paid well as compare to they hire some one from out side BOA."
good,"see resume to review skills and experience needed to perform audit supervisor role and responsibilities at Bank of America."
good,BofA takes great care of their employees! Pay & benefits were above average & training/advancement opportunities were stellar. Management was a bit tight towards the end. I felt like I couldn't be productive because we were told we had to use the most recent checklists & note files every 24 hours (even if there were no changes). Checklists were updated several times a week so there was a lot of unproductive repetition.
good,Management was focused on putting the best foot forward in every situation which resulted in a culture where regardless of title one was able to succeed. They promoted from within and provided junior bankers ample opportunity to excel and learn.
good,"Loved working there. Volunteering. Perks. I found some of the people in leadership positions to be dishonest and insecure, which made it difficult for me. I came with talent and bright ideas to help to aid the many folk who were Lossing their he's, and the insecurity of others continue yes to stall me.  Nevertheless, higher management knew my capabilities and came to my aid when necessary. I loved the experience. Helping. I received many awards T include nomination for the President Barack Obama presidents volunteer appreciation award."

good,Bank of America is an amazing company to work for. Teaches you so much knowledge. The bad side is it can be highly stressful. I’ve noticed many workers develop health problems from the high stress rates this job role can bring. Understaffed so it causes its workers to be overworked and overwhelmed. Front line jobs with Bank of America is rewarding and the company will invest their money into your growth. AMAZING pay and benefits.
good,"I worked remotely, 2 days out of the week I would drive to work.  Working from home was great, quiet, was able to concentrate and be proactive with my assignments.  What I liked about driving to work was to seeing my co-workers, going on luncheons together. Learn new things at meetings.  Coaching was top priority for me because I like to be provided with feedback on how I am doing as far as production.  I had like 4 managers in less than a year and each came with different perspectives as how we as a team and individually was producing."
good,days are very fast paced and full of government regulations during my 17 years I have learned so many things. The culture is very diverse. The hardest part of the job is the ever changing regulatory compliance changes but the people are the best
good,"Good place to start your career up until mid level mgmt, opportunity to work on new technologies. Need to have more interaction among mgmt and employees. Good job security"

good,I ran a machine that sorted the money and strapped it for the federal reserved. My manager was very happy with my work. I learned and trained in other area's of the company when I finished my job.
good,This was just a temp job. I enjoyed working for them. I did however need full time hours and could only get part time at my location. I was able to pick up hours at other locations. They have amazing benefits and help pay childcare!
good,"Most enjoyable part is all about moving loans forward through closing, make  sue that customer/client is happy with customer delight, hardest part is conditions to be clear and has to wait for a long time o be clear and satisfied to be able to proceed."
good,"The bank is focused on growing responsibly.  Excellent leadership.  Emphasis on technology to drive transformation.Keen focus on managing risk, team work and moral values."

good,I worked in the Pre-foreclosure Department at Bank of America. It was a new environment as I was handling a different side of the title process. I worked as a Contractor for Bank of America and did not receive time off or benefits. Management was very fair and the work environment was good. My contract expired and I had to seek employment elsewhere.
good,"I was a teleworker and made sure I was at my desk ready to go every day. I had 47 years of experience so was considered a good representative to have participating in projects for my division.  I led numerous risk related projects, many self identified audit remediations and conversion activity for various trust platform upgrades.  Management was very appreciative of my contributions and partners in all of the divisions and business lines I worked with were happy to have me participate.  I was organized, documented all deliverables, provided punctual reportouts that were clear and understandable.  All deliverables were met on time and most ahead of their projected due dates.  The hardest part of the job was stopping at the end of th day and forcing myself to not participate in calls on my day off.  The best part was knowing that the work I produced made a difference and the people I assisted with whatever the request was were always happy"
good,I also enjoyed working at Merrill Lynch where I met some really great people to work for.  The team was very professional and a great place to demonstrate your skills to others on the team.

The vacation policy is generous and the employee reviews are fair. Feedback is not only provided by managers but associates are encouraged to use their voice as well."
good,Learned a lot about foreclosures and title searching. The job environment was very laid back due to the hours I worked (12 am- 9am). The most enjoyable part of the job were the hours.
good,Collaboration and networking is key to working at Bank of America. The hardest part of my job is not being promoted. The most enjoyable part of the job is growing in knowledge and working with exceptional people.
good,Aprendí mucho. Tiene muy buenos beneficios. Ha sido un buena experiencia.
good,"This job is not for everyone. Unless you have a lot of patience and tolerance for people nonsense and over the phone, you won't want to do this job. People can lose perspective of themselves and appropriate behavior behind a phone, and you'll have to deal with that throughout the day with little support from SCA's (the position responsible for helping you if you need help...)"
good,The culture was very much uniform and consistent throughout the company.  Everyone is treated equal and training is required to fulfill necessary requirements.
good,"Bank of America provided a healthy and well equipped work environment. They provided incentives, rewards, healthy work hours, great leaders, and great benefits."

good,"Empresa agradável de trabalhar, ambiente bem estruturado."
good,They were a part time job when I needed it.  I wish they had room for growth in St. Michaels.  I have loved to stay there longer and make a career out of it.  Plus a few years later they left St. Michaels.
good,"This job was by far one of the most simplest work experiences that i have ever had. When i first started we were extremely understaffed, but once management got that taken care of it was nothing short of a breeze. The hardest part was dealing with the incompetence of the ""managers"" and other unnecessary high level positions that were there. If you can problem solve and manage to empathize with upset people you will be fine."
good,I enjoyed working as a contracted employee at Bank of America. I would love to be a permanent employee there. The people were nice to work with and the company kept me informed of company status in the market. There are many benefits offered with options for volunteer time.

It was really hard at a time the firm had a tarnished reputation coming from its legacy acquisitions-Countrywide.

I learned a lot about credits and debits, cash handling, accounts receivable and accounts payable. The bank was located at a Spanish culture atmosphere in Barrio Logan close to downtown San Diego. I enjoyed helping people and educated them in the usage of new technologies that Bank of America provide for their customers. I liked that is was pretty busy most of the times by lunch hour. We used to referred a lot of new customers from the shipyards. I used to referred to everyone direct deposits, checking account establish and credit cards."

good,"Banking you start working hard and fast as soon as you hit the door, until you clock out. Management don't tolerate excuses for not being accurate and proficient in your work. The hardest part of the job is balancing and be careful not to take in any counterfeit currency. Everything is timed in banking. The most enjoyable part was waiting on my precious customers. I had the chance to brighten someone's day everyday."
good,You learn a lot but sometimes could not find the right people to help you get matters resolved for customers or your daily tasks. There was no room for advancement.

A typical day at work was just helping customers maintenance their accounts. My managers were always horrible except my latest one, who was an incredibly genuine and lovable person.

good,"Working at Bank of America had many benefits, including a decent work and life balance, health benefits, and opportunities to move forward within the community."
good,The pay did not compensate for the workload but the benefits were exceptional. Management was great but the layoffs caused uncertainty with job security.
good,"A typical day working for this company is normal rapid business, with customers , flowing the lines with general transactions. it was alot of fun working there as well. the more the tellers and management reach their quota in referral and sales, the more of gift cards and bonuses we receive. everyone work very well together, just life a team should.   and we spend time together as a family, doing fun activities events."
good,"A typical day at work is standing behind the teller booth, greeting customers, and taking care of their needs.

good,"Recent changes in the industry and how the changes impact the company and how the company is responding to the changes has created a situation where morale is withering away as positions and teams are assimilated, eliminated, or outsourced.

good,I worked at Bank of America (BAC) on the contract basis for  1 1/2 years in two different departments. It was a very positive environment and they have a good work life balance.
good,"This is a great job for the right person. There is a large amount of training and resources at your disposal. The main challenge in this environment is the competition....you are fighting tooth and nail to bring in clients with assets. You are also competing with 10,000 other Merrill Lynch financial advisors as well as a similar number from Morgan Stanley, UBS, Credit Suisse, etc. If you are able to be successful in this role, you can enjoy a very nice life, but it is very difficult to win clients as a new financial advisor when many of the qualified clients have had relationships with their existing financial advisors for a number of years."
good,I was constantly being trained on products to keep product knowledge up to day. They are also very spirit oriented. The hardest part about the job was that most calls had irate customers. You are dealing with their money so it is hard to bring the tension down.

good,"A typical day at Bank of America was usually engaging and fun with various type of customers requiring different support. I have learned how to develop a strong communication and active listening skills. Something that i learned from my management is to not only strive for excellence but to strive to be of value. There was nothing in my prior position that i found overly difficult, but if i must expand on it i would say it was making sure that at the end of the day cash box were balanced.

I've ""sold cash"" (Balance transfers, ACH, and cash advances, and other banking products) as well as collected cash (managing multi-million dollar portfolios) which gave me a lot of insight on how to advise others as well as manage my own finances. Working at the bank gave me experience and knowledge that will help me in many careers and also in my life. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the people that I could not help because of reasons beyond my control.

I responded to emails from CRM and managed inventory by way of spreadsheets and systems. Handled escalated loans with urgency. I learned that you have to learn how to trust others to help you, learn how to delegate and that its ok to ask for help. Management was great at assisting you to reach your career goals. Co workers went out of their way  to make the environment feel like home and a family. We had a lot of outing's. The hardest part of the job again is knowing when to ask for help. You can get so accustom to working alone that you loose sight that you have a team there to support you. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that you helped a customer keep their home sometimes in the last hour or even after being bank owned, you some how manage to work it out at the end."

I had great managers who took the time to help me improve and were strict on our goals. I really enjoyed the mood and vibe of each branch and enjoyed talking to higher ups.

good,"A typical day at work is medium pace, competitive, and knowledge of investigation of fraud issues and debit card disputes. I learned that transitioning my thought pattern to detect fraud, you have to think like a fraudster. Management is great, they set the right expectations and follow through with rewards to the team and individuals. They celebrate the employees and make sure that all work stays at work and at the end of the day, we go home only to spend quality time with family and not work.

I spoke to my client daily and it was nice getting to know them not only on a professional level but to know a little about them personally.  I enjoyed the people I worked with.

good,"Merrill Lynch was an outstanding place to work for a long period. Sadly, the years leading to the global financial crisis were a period where ML was unable to match the returns of many of its competitors and the management team took out-sized risks to attempt to produce these returns.

There was no favoritism, the culture was great. I left in 2010 so I am sure much has changed since then. Otherwise sales goals as in any bank are agressive though a great place to work"

I’ve been reviewing the investor guidelines as well as the state guidelines to determine if the borrower has been charged impermissible fees. During my eight hours, I spend my time investigating borrowers loans to determine of any harm was done. I would read notes, look for documentation, etc. to see if any harm was done to the borrowers. Anything that I find I will notate and continue on to the next step. If there is a case that I am stuck on, I can always turn to my manager. If for some reason the manager is not available, I can ask the PC (Proficiency Coach) for help as well. My peers that I am surrounded by we work GREAT together. If for some reason I am not understanding a file or can’t answer a simple question, I can always turn to them. In all honesty, I don’t struggle at work because I know that if I need a second opinion, I always have someone to turn to which makes my day go by easier. The individuals that are a part of my team are very unique people. They have taught me how to dig deeper, go for what you believe in and just be yourself.

Hardest part of the job is when deposits are beyond my limits and needing a supervisor override when we have a line of clients waiting.

You don't need any job experience to be hired but you need a great deal of experience to move up in the company. In a company that always striving for excellence for the most part collectors and customer service reps are micro managed at will. The culture is pretty competitive especially because of the incentive program. Charge off days were the hardest days, for example 2 days of 5am to 8pm etc."

This company is closed to my heart as it was my foundation to my career life. Every member that I worked with has taught me some thing or the other.

The most enjoyable part was those callers who would actually give me a challenge and make my day a little more interesting.
good,"Overall it was a great place to work. The compensation was in the low range at first but through my 8 years there, it progressively increased. The stability level was low. Management changed much of the time, many lay offs several times a year. People employees needed to (scurry) to find another job within in time before the previous team was completely dispersed within the company. Work life balance was ideal."

I enjoy watching my clients grow and eventually retire.

Worked at a timely pace to ensure I completed my daily follow escalations quota ensuring I am within the internal quality guidelines. All my calls and emails were monitored and reviewed for quality audit guidelines. We had a weekly meeting with management to pick random files closed and review the call or email with manager. Also went over any questions or concerns with work or job. I would say my day break down  is  on the phones maybe 40% of the day 10% answering internal questions from customer service and 50% researching for documents or contacting different county , attorneys or 3rd parties as needed to resolve complaint."
good,"A vibrant workplace where there is a focus on the staff.  "

Networking is highly ecourgaged. As exected due to the recent layoffs the morale of the associates is very low.

good,"A typical day at work consists of resolving customer concerns about their account balances, requirements, and additional services the bank offers.  Each call has its own challenge because some calls may require complex research while others may just require an explanation of how the customer may avoid fees on the account.  On a daily basis, I learn more about the different products that are offered to our customers and that the banking industry is constantly changing.  Management makes it easier to understand how the bank operates by providing constant training.  One of the hardest parts of the job is explaining to the customers how their accounts and the bank works in a way that will make them happy.  One of the things I enjoy most is resolving the customers concern in a timely manner that does not cause them any frustration."

I did not converse with many associates on a personal level due to my work load and schedule.  Often I was told by various associates that they would not want my job or the responsibilities it entailed; however, I thrived on the constant pressure and rather enjoyed the fast paced atmosphere.  This allowed me to develope my multitasking capabilities into an art form.  The most difficult part of my position were the amount of hours required per week averaging between 70 and 90 hours, peaking during holidays and generally included weekends.  "
good,The teller position was fun and it opened me up to have very good conversations with some of the customers. One thing I did not like was the referral goals we had to meet weekly and I'm pretty sure they have gotten harder.

good,"Bank of America is a great place to work, Pay is good, hours are good, most of the management is great. Back to back calls and no time in between though, you have to be willing to sit all day and tend to the clients needs as best and empathetic as possible."

Management believes in promoting within and I was very fortunate to have a great management team help me obtain goals and higher position with the company.  When the bank merged with Bank of America, the company looked at eliminating duplicate positions and my age and years of service offered me a lucrative retirement package that I accepted."

If you like a very competitive culture and full transparency along with accountability, then its the company for you. Job mobility within the bank is a new focus so many opportunities for career growth,"

good,Great place to work and meet new customers.  My fellow Employees were great to work with and management was awesome.  I loved the responsibility that came with the job.  Made me feel that what I was doing was important.
good,i enjoyed being a teller for bank of america. it was a great environment  where i learned to work quickly and efficiently. i learned how to sell products while looking for my customers need through simple conversation. Management was great there employee reviews were definitely helpful and made it easier to become better employees.
good,"Top notch organization as far as professionalism, services, pay and benefits and a feeling of self-worth. Times have changed as far as how one is reviewed as client surveys carry much weight.  Heavy emphasis placed on client satisfaction scores and meeting SLA's which at times you have no control over."
good,"Company is numbers driven. You must always complete your work and make your numbers.  If you complete your work with minimal errors and make your numbers, BofA is a good place to work."
good,"Good management with a focus on high standards but retaining a nice culture and fairly decent work-life balance creating a pleasant atmosphere. Unlike in many other banks, there is no toxic environment, worked with decent people and seem to reward success. The organisation is quite large with a structure that can help you grow."
good,It can be rewarding when you help people learn how to do things differently like make a payment through mobile and seeing their face light up when they see that they don't have to wait in lines all the time.
good,"Daily routine was to help clients exceed their financial goals through the process of educating them on the suite of products and services available from Bank of America, and assisting them in the selection of said products for their portfolios."
good,BOA is a powerhouse in its industry! it was my first major corporate job and i was a  bit scared but the BOA staff were king and friendly it was such a great experience.
good,Love the culture and the work environment.  I’m addi to the volunteer program they sponsor so many events at times is hard to decide your hours. 1 of the best companies I’ve worked for.
good,I think that the security is not always safe the job is fun relaxing but you see a lot of things that may not always be to good. I try to keep a good working relationship with co workers but can go off the topics and subjects once in a while.
good,Bofa was good to work for. Just need better management and there will be less of a turn over when it comes to employees. Other then that the company is great.
good,It is a culture where numbers speak but keeping ethical. easily work anywhere as the company provides high tech mobility solutions for staffs to be able to work anywhere as long as they are connected. great place to work.
good,Bank of America is all for supporting their associates. When I was in school I would get reimbursed for my tuition and when my daughter was younger I would get child care reimbursement as well.
good,"I enjoy working at Bank of America very much.  Management was extremely helpful.  The  friendship with co-worker was wonderful."
good,I was a Teller and worked my way up to a Relationship Banker.  The Company is a great learning experience in the professional world.  The company really  challenges you to push harder to go beyond your expectations and to manage risk.  You also have to have a passion for helping and talking to people.  I enjoyed that I was able to genuinely help people improve their financial lives in simple ways such as showing different app features they could use at their convenience.  I would say the only thing is the sales pressure.  Sometimes you get caught up at how many numbers you need to meet that it is tempting to product push rather than deepen.
good,"a regular day at work would start with early morning calls with application teams , discussing projects at hand , status of deliverables due. constant meetings with updates from each team ending with daily status report to managers. "

good,Very much enjoyed my time there. Learned a great deal about managing client relationships and recruiting new clients. Certainly would recommend Merrill Lynch as a great place to work.
good,"I enjoyed my years at Bank of America, I was promoted within to several different departments. If I hadn't been laid of after 10 years of service I would still be there. I saw it as a career that I enjoyed doing"
good,So far I have been with the company for a little over a year. Communication needs to be fixed. Great place to work but hard to go up the ladder. i applied to several positions with relationship banker and manager roles which I feel as though I am highly qualified and I got rejected with not enough reason as to why.
good,"They take care of their employees with medical, family and community. Benefits are amazing so is the time off. Down side is difficult to move up, there are layoffs. Even with layoffs they help you so much. Still a great place to work."
good,There are plenty of opportunities to advance. If you are great at the job there is no question you can move up the corporate ladder without being stuck in one position.
good,"I would still be there but they layoff all the time, mortgage department is not a priority in Jacksonville, Charlotte and Tampa is where you want to be."
good,There were always ways to advance and tailor your service to be yourself. I highly recommend this if in between school and work. The representatives I talked to went above and beyond with helping us understand our role and backup us up.

good,"Review daily reports with team and management"
good,"Bank of America was good to me.  It was stressful sometimes, but I felt that I was paid fairly.  I would still be with Bank of America, except they sole their centers where I live and there in not one close by."
good,"Overall BOA is a great company with lots of room to grow. The people are friendly, but they could use a few methods to strengthen relationship amongst their employees."
good,"Working at Bank of America was very exiting there was a lot of changes and learning on a daily basics, I particularly was working as a back office associate in charge of reviewing complain for unrecognized  transactions on the customers debit cards, after researching for the customer a claim had to be initiated and follow thru with Visa and or the client in order to reach the solution to the case."

good,"I was a contracted member of the FSR Team that provided Financial Reporting remediation services to the SEC Reporting Team in Charlotte. While my engagement lasted only 8 months, it was both successful and rewarding. Success in the fact that I had met and/or exceeded all of my required Deliverables for the SEC Team. Rewarding in the fact that it was a true pleasure working with each Team member. A very dedicated, friendly Team that always portrayed professional demeanor. I was saddened by the abrupt ending of my contract. It was up for extension, but I had successfully completed my contracted tasks. I believe that management was trying to find alternative roles for me, but none were readily available at the time. I would have jumped at the opportunity if available."
good,The company provides extensive training for new hires and existing employees.  It also has very good benefits. The management team is great to work with. The work can be stressful but the staff and management help by being available to assist with questions and issues and provide updates on policies and procedures.

Possess extensive product knowledge and exceptional customer service while utilizing multiple screens and various computer systems simultaneously to fulfill client requests/needs."
good,The company is great. Great pay and great benefits. But my immediate manager was not a good manager. He did not provide the help I needed. The moral in our office was low

good,The culture is really collaborative. Management has your back. The center is busy and social. It is a good balance of professional and friendly. Many great people.
good,Working for BOA was a great opportunity to network and learn more about the banking industry.  Depending on what branch you work at is huge to the likely hood of succeeding.  Slow branches are easy to hone in on your skills.  Large busy branches throw you into the fire and will likely cause you to have 6 months penalties added onto your record for mistakes.
good,Bank of America is a great and diverse company to work for. There is always something new to learn and share with clients. It is a very customer friendly environment.
good,"Definitely a job that gives you exposure to different sides of mortgages and allows you to understand the market.  "

We were responsible for the maintenance of a legacy desktop product, and had the opportunity to rebuild it with new technology, supported by the infrastructure.  During that time, we performed an enormous amount of proof of concept research and mock testing, affording us the opportunity to learn newer technology.  The hardest part of the job is actually the drive to Plano.  The most enjoyable part is working with a team with a focused objective."

good,"I advanced through the Bank having started as an Admin. Assistant. My last role was a management role during a very intense and stressful time as Dodd-Frank reg changes were in full force. The pressure on my manager of course rolled down and in order to get work done, it required well over the 40 hour normal work week. I was compensated for that through the year-end incentive but some might say, not enough. "
good,Bank of America is one of the best employers I've had the opportunity to work with. The work culture is very inclusive. The management team is very fair and engaging.
good,Great Place to Work and Great People. Very professional. The call center had a lot of morale lifting events. Bosses are genuine and really promote your growth. However; too many layoffs

good,"Very busy branch, on going all day long. Lot to learn with very helpful management. Wonderful workplace culture and enjoyable at times. Sometimes some customers face hard to heal with but with the help of my manager if was not as bad. Loved my co-workers and miss the place dearly."
good,"Requesting the client for documents required to qualify according to guidelines. Requesting documents from third party vendors. Viewing the documents for accuracy, within acceptable dates, preparing for underwriter approval, then to closing. Handling many files in different stages to stay with in compliance. Managing the day by prioritizing process of the file to complete before expiration dates. The hardest part of the job is to have to ask for more documentation if something expired, or tell client they do not qualify according to the documentation provided.

good,"A wonderful company with core values that reach far beyond the walls of business. Promotes work/life balance for all employees. Great leadership training, preparation and design."

These points really make the bank an AMAZING place to work, and it is easy to be proud of the culture and the bank."
good,"A great job ,especially the teller position. We got to meet a lot of customers daily, helping them with there everyday needs such as , transactions and money issues. the worst part of the job is the amount of traffic that is there. the greatest thing is helping customers for a better way of banking. and getting there transactions done for them fast and efficiently. the management there at bank of america could be a little bit more flexible with the work you did or the help you needed. but overall an average job."

good,"Bank of America Merrill Lynch is an exciting, competitive and fast pace place to work. There are lots of opportunities to learn and grow if you have what it takes to compete. Competing means being a team player when ever asked (overtime, mentoring, special projects, weekends, new training). These are all things that will help your career but it you have conflicting responsibilities outside of work its difficult to compete and difficult to maintain balance. You get support with getting licensed and learn a lot of new products and processes as you go however the pay doesn't increase with the new responsibilities. Most people start out in one job work time in title and move up within the first two years. The pay is pretty low in comparison to many others for the job I worked but the benefits are amazing!"

We were able to refund a certain amount using our best judgment and take into consideration the length and approximate monthly income the customer had in their account but under any other circumstance refunds were not acceptable. Management would vary upon the person, some would be kind and willing to help and take escalated calls if needed. While others would redirect you back to the caller. Direct team managers would need to meet a quota per month, if they considered someone in the team is overriding overdraft fees to much they would be called out in front of everyone. Otherwise it was overall interesting experience, team managers were strict because not only would they receive a bonus so would the team member's.

Coming into work daily was fun as I had great relationships with colleagues and manager who were highly professional and optimistic. Toughest experience was the unexpected undertaking of five more responsibilities under my plate in addition to providing effective back-up support on three separate areas when three of my colleagues were laid off during the acquisition phase in 2009. Best experience about it was being able to develop my skill sets beyond the realms of my key functions and proving how highly adaptable and committed I was in helping understand the demands of the business that I served.

Here it is 3 weeks before that 18 month mark and we have yet to hear about the extension whether it is a no go or if it was approved. Which has delayed me looking for a job.

I learned to be an exceptional listener and sympathize with our customer. I was efficient most of the time in getting the customer to calm down to assist appropriately with removal of fees and correcting the situation when was in my power to do so. I learned to tactfully deliver sometimes difficult news to the customer at the same time reassuring the customer of what I could assist with. I filed fraud claims and read disclosures word for word verbatim. I learned first call resolutions, however there were times when the customers had to be connected to the appropriate lines of businesses to handle their unique cases. I learned patience and the most enjoyable by far is giving and helping others and doing so in a timely manner. The hardest part of the job was when customers claims were denied and more information had to be researched, in some cases claims were prolonged up to 6 months depending on the situation or case and they continuously called for a resolution.

I've had several managers and co-workers throughout the years and feel if going get tough, tough get going, we have each other’s back and there if someone needs help or is out.  The hardest part of a job like this is, you’re always wondering about layoffs, three years in a row we have been threatened with the possibility of being laid off.

In the call center environment things were changing quickly but we were always notified in advance. Because this is such a huge company the bank was able to offer lots of groups to help associates with mentorship and outlets to express their abilities.

I have learned a lot working at Bank of America and had many opportunities to train doing different tasks. Hardest part of the job would be not having all things required to file an amended proof of claim and spend time researching to complete the task.  I think the most enjoyable part of the job is that we are helping the customers during their bankruptcy.
good,"I love what I did at the bank, great people, great environment"

In the other hand it was always good hour with bank of america."
good,"Worked on the computer all day but the co workers made it fun. I learned the systems very quickly. I was recognized often from my supervisor as well as my co workers for team work as well as my productivity.. The only thing I would say was ""hard"" is the many changes in procedures.

good,"I would say that Bank of America was a great place to work for, the Management team was very professional and certainly helped with developing my career. "
good,"Its a great company to work for, there is a lot of growth in the bank, however the draw back is that you need to be their for 1 year before you are able to transfer out. On top of that, you may not have any write ups. IF you do you need to wait. Not getting w write up is difficult due to all the regulations they have to abide by law. Which leads me to say that its the hardest part of the job is to follow the regulations. The most enjoyable part is the management and leads. They treat you like family, if you need to leave for a period of time due to family or medical issues, they take care of you. I've seen people be gone for months to half a year and come back and get to work. "

The management is a bit messy at times but when everyone works together everyone is happy. My co-workers are very Helpful, Friendly, Responsible, Respectful, Leaders, we definitely work as a team. The hardest part of the job is not been able to help a costumer who is refusing our help by not answering our calls and letters. The most enjoyable part of the job is making a costumer happy. By offering a program solution that will lower their monthly payments to meet costumer's needs and secured costumer doesn't fall off the program down the line, the interest rate will remain the same, no past due monthly fees, flexible due date, also account will not be reported to the credit beau. The best reward of the day is to hear the costumer being happy and saying thank you. You were a great help to me. It is an awesome feeling."

I always learn new ways to deal with certain types of customers. not everyone is joyful and not everyone is angry. I take it one customer at a time, and teach myself to judge what type of mood a person can be in depending on the tone of voice. Although I do interact with a few employees we are mostly trying to manage our high volume work load.

I enjoy customer service because I truly enjoy helping people."

good,I loved working for this company! The leadership is fantastic! Bank of America truely cares about developing their associates to be the best they can be! I learned so much there! It can be very fast paced and challenging but I enjoyed that. I had to move to an area where there are no banking centers and unforunately could no longer be with Bank of America. I strongly recommend taking a position if you are driven to exceed expectations and are looking for a career in banking. Lots of room to grow and many different areas to branch into! Great Company!
good,"I was recruited to Merrill Lynch from Paine Webber in 1989. The amount of support from the home office was beyond compare. I learned quite an amount during the training in Princeton, New Jersey. The co-workers in Rochester were more autonomous than co-workers at Paine Webber in Rochester. However, there was more a feeling of being part of a team at Paine Webber. The culture in the Rochester office was cold in comparison. This was probably not the case in New York at Merrill Headquarters. Merrill Management was top notch. The hardest part of the job was the unfriendly atmosphere in my office. The most enjoyable part of the job were the rewards for a job well done. Merrill Lynch spared no expense to provide trips, gifts, and remuneration for being a good producer at the company. I have always regretted leaving Merrill Lynch. It was the best firm on the street, and the largest during my tenure there. I might have looked to make a change and try a career move inside the firm to a salaried job and outside of Rochester. The industry has changed since I left, and many firms are no longer in existence. However, Merrill Lynch is to my knowledge, still the top investment firm on wall street. I am very fortunate to have worked for such a great corporation."
good,I enjoyed working for Bank of America. Their really was no hard part to the job. We all worked together for many years as a team. Each day we accomplished many daily reports and always worked on the weekly reports. Management was excellent. I was always supported whether it was a business issue or personal. I miss working their very much so. We processed many different state taxes and due to e-filing our type of business is no longer necessary. Which is the reason for down sizing and eventual closing of the department.

good,Excellent workplace with knowledgeable and fair managers. Ability to move up is great! I've Gained alot of knowledge and LEadership qualities from work there. the hardest part of the job is the lack of staff we are able to have.  It enables us flexibility in case of emergencies. The most enjoyable part of the Job is the people i get to meet and the lessons I obtain from working here.

good,..working at this company is a professional experience and great working environment.

Learning and exceuting correctly the first time around with sensitive issues and new dealings is of major importance. Although the job is a serious and detail oriented position the enegry with the team is high level and very spirited. The most complex part of the job is managing different personalities all with different needs on a professional level.

good,"It was a pleasant working atmosphere, everyone was very nice and did not make the data entry boring."
good,"Worked at BofA for 6 months and would have continued if they allowed my transfer to go through. That was probably the only bad experience I had at BofA was trying to get my transfer. They gave me a lot of excuses why I couldn't transfer when I was only going to be transitioning states not job levels. Co workers are great though and my branch manager was the best. She was very understanding and caring. All of the managers (both assistant and branch) seemed to take a real interest in my life and job level. I think you can move up within BofA, my branch manager started as a teller 6 years before. They have good benefits packages, but as a PT it can be expensive. Generally the customers are very friendly but with some of the new changes BofA was implementing many of them were upset and took it out on me. One thing as a Teller is that you are the face so everyone blames you or yells at you even if its not your fault. Lunch breaks are good and BofA offers a lot of employee services (credit cards, loans, etc) and they have great perks and discounts. One of the other problems was the referral goals they had. Its a little demanding especially if your in a banking center where its the same customers repeatedly. You can see your numbers go down if you aren't really aggressive which is really hard. Overall I think BofA is a great company to work for."
good,I loved working for Bank of America. They are a great company to work for. We were rewarded for our accomplishments and hard work. If we had a problem we always knew where to go to for support. Also made alot of great friends that I keep in contact with even though our call center had to close
good,"If you are very good at assisting clients in a high volume call center where at any given momment changes could be made, then this is the place for you.

good,"Merryll lynch was a great company to grow up in my profesional area as well as person, I always had a great relationship with all peoples. The managers were very profesionals and always encouraged me to take advantage of courses to improve my aknowledge as Administrative Assistant and any other opportunities available. The most I liked was that every year I had my evaluation as employee and I was compensated with bonuses for the well job done. They always motivated me and included me in projects and special events."

I learned all facets of the banking industry which included me being able to access classes online to increase my job knowledge. It was a constant learning process. The culture was great. MOST managers worked very well with the employees to further their advancement within the company. I got sick and had to leave my job. I am much better now and I would LOVE the opportunity to work for this fine organization in the future. Kudos to the management team for making this job a most memorable experience."

You do so by means of filing claims, contacting merchants to verify the situation as fraud or non-fraud, and explaining measures of preventative action to the customer. The job environment is constantly changing and updating to make interactions run smoother on both the customer and associate end. This job position taught me to adapt to the environment as business needs change. The managers at the location are very responsive to your needs and quick to handle escalations. Also there is always a team lead available if the managers are otherwise engaged. My peers of this department were informative and supportive of our class as we made the transition from training to the floor.  The hardest part of this position was having to explain to a customer who entrusts you with their financial well being why a claim has been denied. However, I did learn that the more you interact with the customers the easier it becomes to convey the reasons a claim may be denied and look in to the options of re-evaluation if necessary. The most enjoyable part of the job is the environment. The benefits and hours are a major plus but it goes beyond that. Hard work is definitely rewarded! The company takes time regularly to recognize an employee that goes above and beyond what is requested of them and they make you feel appreciated as an associate. The only reason"

Financial Advising can be cut throat and stressful, but being able to offer people the financial help and educate them on investments makes the job worth it.

Managers also encourage employees to learn their jobs thoroughly, and tend to teach more than what is expected because the company is known for promoting and hiring internally.

A few of the main traits that are very important to have while working at BOA are excellent customer service skills and willing to work as a team."

I thought that the management was far. The workplace culture was very fun to be around. The hardest part of the job was to make sure that you changed the account number when you put in a check for a customer in a different account. The reason was that the tray you have to work out of had several different accounts in it. I thought that the times the company provided lunch or rewards were the most enjoyable time because they were thanking you for the job you had done.

good,"I worked for Merrill Edge in a call center as a Financial Solutions Advisor in Jacksonville, Florida. Overall, it was a great place to get Series 7 licensed and gain experience in financial services. It is tough to get into management, there is a year-long class, you have to pass the Series 9 & 10 from FINRA and then you get the privilege of being put on the waiting list of management ready candidates to be interviewed. Keep in mind that all of this is to be done on your own spare time. You will still need to meet you numbers for your team goals. You also have to keep track of every account that you open for compensation as their tracking system does not work well. I would suggest taking an advanced class for Microsoft Excel before going to work at Merrill Edge. In addition, the variable compensation plan will change often, whether you agree with it or not. Your salary will stay the same but the variable compensation plan will change due to “business need.” "
