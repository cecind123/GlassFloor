good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,There are way too many managers. They always have atleast 3 managers on staff. So someone was always breathing down your neck. You never got a raise unless you were able to pass a computerized test.
bad,"Management give job only one day 5hours. I feel this is not fair. How many time I asked to increase job hours, it doesn't work. I am disability and can't find another job. I have had hard time in my life."
bad,I hated working there. They made me feel stupid. I'm epileptic and they treated me like scum. I will never work there or even eat there. There is hair in the food and the management sucks bc they make fun of you. Do not work for them. They are stuck up and hate treating you fairly.
bad,The management was not supported enough with the employees. The pay was low and the workload was high.  They would decrease your hours each week which made it rough to even want to work there.  You can't live on 8 hours a week.  The supervisors were yell at you and they were not professional at all. Don't waste your time trying to work here.
bad,They cater to the ones who are Latino or Mexican they give the hours and positions to the people who they like not the ones who actually work hard. It’s a very high stress job and I wouldn’t recommend working for them
bad,"This is one of the worst places I have ever worked. management yells and swears at you, calls you out your name, shows favorites, refuses to work with you on your schedule- is not flexible in any way shape or form"
bad,I worked 2 days a week maybe 4 or 5 hours a day. Got a 50-100$ check every week. The people were fun and after working there for a while you get a discount.
bad,"The management is terrible, they dont care about their employees. It's also funny how they only do things the right way when corprate is coming in. Good luck on ever getting hpurs"
bad,"For a company that is supposed to care about there customers And there employees.. that is far from the truth !  Very greedy , only caring about themselves and not the customer or the employees at all!!"
bad,I never liked working for cracker barrel. They were always rude and the pay sucked. I would never go back and work there. Leaving that restaurant was one of the best decisions I have ever made.
bad,The West Memphis Arkansas experience was terrible. Always had different management and a different GM every other month . times got rough they didn't care .
bad,"horrible management,such a shame really,i was excited to be there but they made it too hard,they have their favorites and that is just the way it is and if your not one of them your screwed"
bad,"Favoritism everywhere and wrong people in charge hatred the place was harassed by a manager with other motives company didn't back me, really poor choices for management split shifts suck"
bad,"Management wants to yell instead of guide their employees. When you enter the restaurant you are owned. Roll 100 silverware, spring clean is the definition of their side work. Cut your hours when you go to management and ask for different hours. Co-workers you ask for help look at you like your stupid then talk about you behind your back. This is a place I would run away from"
bad,I will never work or eat in that place ever again I’ve been disrespectful called out my name stolen from and management don’t care about any at all but themselves
bad,"Scheduled one day a week at a location 30 minutes away from me, and they would still send me home from my shift early almost every week. I was getting 2-3 hours a week, or maybe 6-8 if I was lucky. I worked minimum wage. My friend and I left because we learned they can be racist, dismissive, and used favoritism to when distributing hours."
bad,This is a terrible place to work. I have not worked for the restraint however the retail side is a mess. The manager is very rude and disrespectful and she is also very selfish. I say this because she cuts everyone to maybe 8 hours a week to maintain her bonus for keeping everyone part time. She also punishes people by cutting hours and publicly shaming them if sales are low or they aren’t doing things in the specific way she does them. H it is overall a terrible place to work with no room to grow thanks to a stifling manager. While there are good people working there there are also people with seniority that take advantage of people that are less set in their positions. I recommend looking for work somewhere else.
bad,This is one of the worst restaurants I have ever worked in. There was no order to how anything was done and no compassion for their employees. The management had no idea what they were doing.
bad,Don't work there.  I was hired for over a month before I started training.   And then I went through training for another month and a half.  And then they only gave me 4 hours a week
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,My job is hosting in other words making sure the guests are seated. The management is unprofessional. The servers are also disrespectful and complain they like to bully the hosts and pretend that they are in charge p
bad,Totally opposite of company's philosophy.  Pressure to sell is unbelievable and training is horrible.  Sets up employees for failure.  Horrible retail manager!!!!
bad,My time at the Cracker Barrel has been awful and regretful. Manager's are poorly do there jobs and the GM doesn't know how you manage the store at all. He yells and crys in his office
bad,Older servers with three stars are generally lazy. I became a three star and they want you to manage for free. Which is just being nit picky when you have they exact same job title. Management will change schedules without telling you. Grill cooks are over worked and grouchy. You have to run trays entire work shift which seems like not many but there are over 300 people that can sit in the restauran. You and your other three servers are expected to run it all.
bad,Management was unprofessional in many ways other staff didn’t want to do closing side work poor establishment to work for. When getting corporate involved nothing was done
bad,"For a company that has been around as long as they have, I am appalled at the way they completely lack any regard for their employees or theirs needs. The management is petty and plays favorites. There is constant screaming and yelling, which is not only nerve racking, but makes it impossible to hear anything the line cooks have to say. There was not a single shift I worked that I didn’t hear someone say they were going to walk out and quit. You don’t leave bad jobs, you leave bad managers."
bad,This job was very unequal. The pay was really low and the mangers were really disrespectful. I hated this job and would never put anyone in the position I was in
bad,I've been at the Cracker Barrel since January the management team it's not very supportive of work duties the expectations are too high for the tasks that need to be completed there is too much to do in the limited amount of that is not possible and getting disciplined for it
bad,"this is the worst job i ever had. they lied to me upon hire, i was forced to burn my arms when farting trays because it took “too long” to place something under the tray, was screamed at for not knowing something on my 3rd day, never got more than 8 hours week after being promised full time hours, i did EVERYTHING for tables but because of my job title i didn’t get any tips, managers were extremely unhelpful with anything, benefits not available for anyone until after a YEAR. "
bad,"The retail manager was horrible at Kingwood, she will make your life so miserable you will quit, which I did!  RUN do not work in the retail side! All I did was clean bathrooms and got tired of cleaning the men's bathroom!"
bad,Was taken off the schedule without warning a week before Christmas. Employee of the year & management also had a conversation in front of everyone about taking me off the schedule. Express how annoyed they were that I had to call out because of my sick child.Make any wrong move get your hours cut.
bad,Horrible! Never got a pay raise or got the pay I was deserved and did a ton of work! Very unprofessional place to work for especially if you are a hard worker. Expected to break your back for this company but never compensated for going above and beyond.
bad,"I was not treated fairly. I was not allowed to be a cashier, and when I left the company and started working at another company I was cashier of the month 5 times. I was never given hours always kept me under 20 hours a week. The management are not fair to all employees. The environment was tense and no matter how hard I worked it was never enough."
bad,Upper Management does not care about its employees - therefore the District Level and HR department does what it wants to. Long hours and the expectations of the role are Ridiculous.
bad,I really didn’t benefit anything from the company I joined the company with a whole different district manager with plans on turning stores around but the managers laugh and different managers came and the whole store just was not what is this supposed to be
bad,"Please do yourself a favor and DO NOT work for this company.                                         Terrible pay, next to no benefits, no breaks. The management will tell you that you can have a break, but I repeat, you WILL NOT get breaks During my nine yrs. as a back up cook at cracker barrel I personally witnessed racial and religious discrimination. Company policies forbidding such treatment are a joke and completely disregarded by arrogant and uncaring management."
bad,Micromanaging. Everyday someone had a different idea of how to run the line no communication and the other cooks acted like princesses. I felt unappriciated because there was always someone else blaming others for things that went wrong.
bad,Managers were constantly coming and going and we kept having to change how we did things to please managers. I did more than I was expected and didn’t get appreciation or acknowledgement for my work. It was unorganized and chaotic all of the time.
bad,This place was run by someone who didn't like the opinions of anyone but himself. Although our differences made it difficult to work there I found it was a good stepping stool to where I am at now.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"If you join the army , better, Not recommended, family life ok, too much Drama, 8 hours of the shift is cooking, always busy , tiring, not worth their much money."
bad,I enjoyed working hear for the time being only problem was poor manegment n some of the staff was far from friendly let alone helpfull................
bad,I had a full time job with them but the store got hep A in it and they cut my hours down to two hours a week because they got slow on business and had to many people on staff
bad,If its your first time as a sever you will get tossed into the fire right away  little to no help from the mangers. and if you ask you'll be belittled and dissimed of right away.
bad,"The money is good, if they are short handed, but the mangament is aweful, at least 2-3 callouts a day, they cant schedule, they overwork their servers. Was supposed to leave at 8, kept me on the floor until 10! We werent even busy enough to keep me. Takes an hour to do your other sidework that you are getting paid 2$ to do."
bad,I wouldn't recommend anybody working at cracker barrel unless you don't mind getting talked to like a dog and not being values for your hard work. They don't care about their employees
bad,We get treated badly especially in the dish room and they do not have enough people scheduled for the busiest days then complain when it is backed up in the dish room. They are so cheap when it comes to tools we need to do our job only one of the current managers treats everyone fair and holds everyone accountable for their mess ups. Holyoke store 294 is horrible and the GM is rude if you are hard working employee and ask for a day off.
bad,"Although the line cooks were fun and relaxed to work with, the rest of the staff from management to front of the house were less than skilled at what they were to do."
bad,Very poor work life and 12 and 14 hour shift without a break are common in the workplace. Staffing is low and managers work hourly positions daily and expected to cover hourly shifts
bad,They lied to an associate. About putting up there schedule or calling it was a baf expirience one mean associate i didnt like it the way they treated me
bad,"Told I was hired as a full time waitress, the first day they told me I was starting off a busser and wouldn’t be a waitress till 4-5 months in.  Didn’t train well at all, had me buss tables for 3-4 hours a day when I was promised full time."
bad,Managers will act kind to you during the hiring process but quickly change. I have a college degree and was treated like I was was a high school kid. I worked on the retail side of the store and managers would act like we were scum if we needed bathroom breaks if we were the only retail person there and they needed to watch the store for a few minutes. I would have customers apologize to me for how my retail manager treated me in front of them!!! I was one of the only employees that submitted a 2 week notice when I was quitting. The manager refused to uphold the 2 week notice and let me go as soon as I put my notice in. I've worked for a few different Cracker Barrels right out of college and they are all the same. Almost all of the managers are very rude to the employees and treat their staff like they are above them.
bad,"I worked in retail."
bad,"Work their for a month hrs were good pay was good but management was poor I was the only black female their and i did all the cleaning  besides my area I enjoyed some of my coworkers but the way everything was run it was hard for me to keep up. they moved me from job to job i was originally a server then they put me in sales then I became a host  Between the servers and management. I made decent money but the stress of it all on a daily basis was not worth it! I ended up leaving because of work place harassment and getting bullied I was devastated and management did nothing! Degrading and verbally abusive managers. Extremely controlling environment, I was very disappointed with my employee experience. The guest and fellow coworkers are great, however the managers have a huge superiority complex."
bad,The management at the morganton store  needs to be redone. Justin needs to be gone if you ain't 18 n single u dont get anything.he cusses employees in front of guests he is rude and inconsiderate.
bad,"No hours even if people give you their days. They put you on the schedule and take you off at they're convenience without telling you. "
bad,"the location I worked at was miserable. Poor management within the retail department. Had issues with a supervisor and had numerous conversations with my manager, and nothing was changed or considered. I was not the only one with issues and was not the only one with multiple conversations with management. I enjoyed the job that I did, but management made me feel not important or a part of the team."
bad,"Probably the worst working experience I've had thus far in my life. I worked here for 1 and a half years and I still have some mild PTSD from the experience. The management is ever-changing and horrific as you have several different people telling you to do one thing in several different ways, so no matter what you did you were always wrong. No breaks at all, I could barely get someone to cover me to use the bathroom, let alone eat. The waitresses are treated way better I think, I was a cashier and wanted to be trained in other area's but was never given the opportunity."
bad,The only good thing about CB is they will hire anyone so if you're desperate go for it. They will call you for an interview very quickly. 4/10 experience
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"Don't work there well at least the one I worked for the people not nice,they would slave you all day if they could in the kitchen with dishes,if you're a dishwasher."
bad,"I would very often cry in the parking lot before and after my shifts due to the stress of the job. The people were nasty, the pace was too much for me."
bad,Not a great experience. No set hours and I was through a temporary agency. So I was treated poorly. Very bad training. Once they think your done with training. They just throw you to the wolves.
bad,Poor management enabling a discriminatory environment. Favoritism and unbalanced discipline to target employees. Ignored written statements and verbal complaints of verbal and physical assaults to people of color specifically.
bad,"The managers treat you like junk They do not show appreciation for you working over and over and over your hours. For any one who is into being a subordinate of rude ungrateful people, this is the job for you"
bad,"small stations, short shifts and poor management, no raises, separation of servers, did not provide positive feed back and other servers were rude and lazy"
bad,short staffed. managers always had an attitude. they would pick favorites among staff members. there was not team efforts in any aspect of the whole resturant.
bad,I only see the purpose of working here if you don't have another job or opportunity pay is low no benefits unless you work full time and only managers work full time and my general manager sucks at her job
bad,"It may be different after I left, but the workplace is filled with nothing but competition and negativity.  I only quit after being assaulted by a coworker and management tried to claim I assaulted her.  The matter was resolved but I didn't feel safe continuing to work there."
bad,"I have had two brain surgeries so i learn a little slower than some, but once i learn, ive got it down pat. I had regular part time hours at first and once they found out about my surgeries all the sudden my hours went to 10 hours a week. No one can live off of that and they knew that, so of course no one is going to stay with a company that does that. When i told them im gonna have to quit, the GM told me they figured i would due to my health, the EEOC means nothing to them and after all of the paperwork they have you fill out at there orientation for it they are complete liars and if i had the time on my hands id be contacting the attorney general. I went through vocational rehabilitation for 6 months to get me back into the workforce and this is what i got."
bad,Is too stressful trying to doing sales with out good promotion products on this litle place. Most customers only stop for eating and use the bathroom. The customer need suvenier with Florida logo for gifts and we don't have this things. Also customers said the regular price  are expensive. We really trying very hard made sales.
bad,Company  (Manager) will be always on you if their goals for the gift shop are low which in turn comes out by punishing you to lower hours year around.
bad,The company has been founded off racism. But don't let that confuse you into thinking the black people in management aren't racist. They are. favoritism was a big thing there
bad,I hated every minute of working there everyone was rude and no one got along  it was always a drag when I was there there was always some kinda drama going on
bad,Don't work here. I don't want to write any more of these stupid reviews for y'all. This place sucked. Management hides in an office and are practically scared of guests. Company cares not at ALL about staff at the bottom.
bad,"Rude manager she seemed stressed out needs a long vacation she needs to be replaced ASAP! Unprofessional employees, you can feel the negative energy just walking into the place ugh !"
bad,Horrible work ethnicity especially because mangers treat you horrible. If you want hours you’ll never get them. Don’t let pay bi weekly fool you! Mange does you dirty! Food is horrible nothing good comes from this job
bad,Mangers did not help u out when u needed help that where always a smart butt and you don't get to leave when it was time for u to get off work they didn't ask if you could stay over they made u stay over
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,My summary should be enough.. it was the worst place I was ever employed at!! Guests would tell you they want someone else to seat them because of the color of their skin
bad,The manager showed favoritism to other employees and you could not go to them about anything . Employees would bully me and going to HR was not going to change anything. The location I was at sucked
bad,"This CB had a hostile work environment and managers that couldn't be bothered to deal with the festering, scummy company culture. I left for my own safety due to two physical fights breaking out among employees in a single night. Managers failed to follow up with the ""team"" of employees in the following days. "
bad,The place was horrible I did not like how you are treated or payed I would definitely  recommend looking for other employment and it is not worth what you have to do
bad,"I worked there 5 years because the money was decent, however, you worked your tail off. There is NO TEAMWORK.  The managers are fake. They only care about getting their bonuses. The worst job ever"
bad,"This is a terrible company to work for, never met such a sorry group of managers in my life. If you weren't sleeping with a manager then you were kinda stuck at the bottom!! No chance for improvement or advancement in any direction."
bad,Every day is a struggle. Massive menu. Impossible to predict what you will need to prepare for. Hot and nasty place to work. Anyone who is good at the job burns out quickly. Indifferent managers who will watch you struggle without lending a hand to help.
bad,"They only give servers two tables at a time, even on slow days, and won't schedule you for more than 3 hours at a time unless you do split shifts, and the split shifts are always scheduled 30 minutes after your last shifted ended, and even then if you're a server, they won't cut you off the floor until two hours past time that you're supposed to switch roles. Then get mad that you aren't working at the new shift"
bad,Don't like the fact that I was promised more money and never got it just really though it was going to be worth it and it wasn't I love working but this job no
bad,"I have a lot to say about cracker barrel, however all of it is negative. Going into working at Cracker Barrel I expected a waiter/server experience similar to my past serving jobs (I had 4+ years experience serving). Cracker Barrel goes through an extensive training period, which is a mixture of job shadowing, computer learning, online tests, etc. There is NO need for the online learning portion of the training, the job shadowing is MUCH more useful. Within the first week of training I was OVERWHELMED because of the overload of information they presented to me. It was clear that the work culture is VERY militant and strict. There is very little freedom, and EVERYTHING needs to be done exactly how you were trained. There are so many useless rules and restrictions, such as the color and material of your clothes, salt and peppers need to be facing a certain way, sugar packets need to be counted to a certain number, you need TWO signatures before you can leave after side work, the list goes on and on). The older women at my location were vile, and always scolded me for not doing something by the book. PLEASE choose a different restaurant to work for, there is an abundance of serving jobs and you will definitely want to STAY AWAY from this company. I only lasted a couple months (luckily I was able to quit because I got a better full-time position)."
bad,I transferred to the Mebane NC location from Urbana IL. In my 8 years at the Illinois location things were great and we were paid 5/hr. Mebane NC is the WORST. From management to employees just horrible. Very poorly ran store and filthy.
bad,"Sorriest company and managers ever had to work with,  plays extreme favoritism and treats me like a piece of work did me so dirty. allowed one new employee to manipulate everyone, and totally harrass me every day  even harrassed me on my days off a real piece of s!$t scumbag and managers just turn their heads to . I now hste cracker barrel with a  passion it all...."
bad,I was going to work at a new store it was just going to open up they were talking about how great it was going to be and that it would be wonderful from the beginning I was an outcast treated different than others was not trained like all the other workers I felt discriminated against so it's a company that they pick and they want to go forward and if it's not you then ear out they don't train you the way you should be trying and I was one of those so I didn't feel welcome and didn't feel like anybody wanted me there
bad,This place sucks. The management shows favoritism and disregards ur availability and will cut yours hours or send you home if it's questioned. An awful environment.
bad,"Management sucks, they want you to be available to work at all times, they release the schedule one week at a time making it almost impossible to plan anything. My co workers were pretty nice but that's the only redeeming factor. The pay was garbage, shifts were garbage. They wanted to work full time employees 7 days a week on short shifts."
bad,When asked for more hours they never gave u but would. They don’t Communicate at all with the employees. Over all will never tell a friend a bout this job. Sucks sucks sucks.
bad,"Got the job! Yay right? Nope.  They tell u that u will get hours yeah I guess u do if u can live off 10-12 hrs a week. Not me, it's been a night mare. U get thrown in to the job not knowing what your doing and are expected to get it all right.  Back to job hunting for me."
bad,Not really a place I’d recommend to work at especially if you expect good pay and hours. I was promised 8.50 at the time along with good hours so I had quit the job I had before to work for them I later found out I was making 7.25 a hour..
bad,"They say advancement opportunity, however what they really are looking for is to hire college students for fast turnover. They tell you that you can move up, then cut your hours as they hire more people to do the same job. They cut hours so much you are forced find other work and quit, so they do not have to pay unemployment benefits. Worst place for any position besides "
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"They’ve got 6 or 7 managers and only 1 of them actually does it right. In the 2 months I was there I experienced one control freak, two lazy do-nothings, one who screams and pushed her religion on you, and one who actually cares. Then, since the other managers don’t do what they’re supposed to, the poor training specialist has to act in their stead. You will never work more than 2 days a week unless you cover a shift. Overalll, just a super toxic place to work"
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working there. I worked three days before quitting. They only give you one 30 minute break, if you work 8 hours and I never was scheduled for more than 7 and a half. I was in the dishroom. First and last time I'll try dishwashing as a job."
bad,Horrible place to work they expect way too much from a server you never leave when you are scheduled out and the cooks as well as managers treat you like dirt. This job literally almost gave me a mental breakdown from the amount of stress
bad,"customers and co workers were great but the managers were awful, they talked to me like i was a child, it was insulting. hours were short but on par with the pay which was ridiculously low. i would recommend this job to folks just looking to fill idle hours, not someone with a family to support."
bad,I couldn't get any hours. Sure they paid $10 an hour but you only get 8-18 hours a week. If someone quit two more where hired. No hours In the budget.
bad,"Cracker barrel is one of the worst jobs you can have. Even if you're there for a year and a half, if you dont take tests, you do NOT get a raise.  The management was horrible and they do not care about the wellbeing of their employees. I worked night maintenance so I was around chemicals. Such as bleach and 32nt cleaner and they never offered a face mask even when working around black mold."
bad,Working at Cracker Barrel can be fun-when you don’t have bills to pay. Low pay and bad management; hope you’re not looking for hours. The only good thing about the job is the employee discount and when there’s a sale going on.
bad,Company very difficult to work for. Cares nothing about workers just the dollar.  They work the back of house and managers to death. Company not worth much.  Needs major changes to support employees
bad,Management acted like they would really care about their employees but in reality they could care less especially in times of need. I have tried to talk to someone from corporate and have still yet to hear anything and this was months ago.
bad,I threw so much food away I couldn't work there anymore. We couldn't take it home or it was considered stealing. It depends on the manger working that day. But we threw away pounds of food.
bad,managers suck here. they lie about a situation to cover up his mistake and  decided to blame an hourly even thought he guest was the one who was offended at the way management talked to me
bad,Honestly if you only want 15 hours then its the job for you. And if you want poor management then like I said this is the job for you. And they don't treat you with the same respect they expect you to give them. and they pick favorites.
bad,"I worked with a boss that took out her dislike (which changed on a whim) of an employee through the schedule. She also lost no opportunity to be scathing, at all times. She was the most horrid boss I have ever had in 25 years, plus, in the workforce. One employee said after her shift that she felt like killing herself. She was NOT joking. Upper management is aware of this but does nothing. Disgraceful"
bad,They treat you like a slave. They had me on hands and knees scrubbing a machine with a tooth brush. The management takes advantage of you. And the cooks are perverts
bad,"Very poor management staff, very few work hours weekly,heavy work load, only 4-6 hour shifts, less than ten hours per week, hire several people for same jobs then not giving long term staff enough hours!"
bad,Managers treat employees terribly. They don't give out hours and if your a server expect to leave 2 hours or more later than your scheduled. Managers always think the employees are stealing and want to pat you down before they walk you out the front door.
bad,"Worst serving job, management and tips. If you were LUCKY you might make $100 in a LOOONNNGGGG double shift. Management at the store I worked at turnover was incredibly high and the favoritism was blatant. Every year the employees at my store would vote for employee of the year. I won the award. The GM didn’t like me and gave the award to someone else. When he was fired, I’m not proud to say that i felt somewhat vindicated."
bad,"They absolutely need to train their employees better. They also need to recognize a good employee when they have one. I worked there a few months. I showed up on time, didn't complain about anything and did a lot of grunt work all smiles."
bad,The GM was so bad at yelling at all of us everyday. And called into the office  everyday. It was scary  to come to work.  She eventually  got fired 3 days after she fired me I was there for all that time
bad,"Management moves floor plan constantly without notice. Run out of supplies. Ice tea, silverware, ect. Staff is rude, hostile, and obnoxious. Place is dirty. Food mixed with food. The food is so disgusting"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"Literally the worst place iv ever worked in my life, paid no attention to doctors orders, extraordinarily poor management, inability to trust fellow employees, no compassion for employees, either they wouldnt fire horrible employees because they were shortstaffed, or they fired good employees due to personal predjudice."
bad,"I hated this job the manger was very very racist. No respect, always nicked picked. So unorganized. No level of respect for employees. Always expected us to do more than what we were getting paid to do, also the pay was very LOW AS A SERVER. I worked as a hostess as well the pay was okay I actually loved being a hostess more than a server. Servers made 2.13 an hr"
bad,"I worked at the Lakeville MN location for 3 months. Very fast paced in a scorching hot room that’s so small it’s practically a tin can, management rarely cares for any issues you have, they’ll call you so much it’s practically harassment, they’ll change your entire week schedule by the hour (you are never up-to-date with when you work it’s always changing depending on the managers on shift), they’ll drop food on the floor and pick it back up like nothing happened, etc. just an overall hellish place to work. Sure you get paid around 11.50 starting- which raises by .25 for every par you go up, but it is NOT worth the wages I can tell you that. As a dishwasher you are constantly burning your hands on plates/dishes in general, to the point I needed to go to my doctor. received my fair share of chemical splashes in my eyes and burns on my skin,  and you’re treated like garbage by practically every server that comes back and throws plates at you or complains and says they need something that you don’t have nor can help them with. Towards the end of my job here I was then told I needed to “replace the drink fountain dispensers” which was not in my application nor disclosed to me during my first 2 months working here. I quit because they kept scheduling me in the mornings when I specifically stated I CANNOT do morning shifts. They don’t listen to you and then reprimand you for their own ignorance. When I came in to get my last check the manager acted like I was a criminal and quote on quote said to me “excuse me you don’t work here get out”."
bad,Upper Management in the district ranks was very poor - they use their employees and get rid of them without a blink of an eye - So the ones who give it their all are left hanging . Don’t plan to be a long term employee there at any of their restaurants that they consider broken !!!!!
bad,"can’t keep employees, has a lot of issues with management, and treats there employees bad. yet you’re a good employee who shows up and gets the work done plus anything extra that needs done, while being treated awful almost EVERY day by disrespectful, rude, untrustworthy managers and still stay.... To get FIRED over a manager giving you something that was NOT theres to give, yet you didn’t know because you TRUSTED that manager! Always issues with your schedule. If you have an issue with a manager and inform the GM, nothing gets resolved. GM does not stick up for the employees, he only sticks up for management. Even when managers are screaming at you and the guests hear and start saying how awful the employees are being treated, nothing gets resolved. I should have left when I had the chance, but I was trying to be a good employee and person. Considering how many people quit or walk out on them, I’m surprised this location is still in business! This job is EXTREMELY untrustworthy! If you tell anyone how much you make they fire you. If you miss a holiday, or the day before it or after it, your fired. Yet you DONT get holiday pay! They demand sooo much of you, yet they treat you like someone who could be easily replaced! A manager told me that if you put your 2 weeks notice in they don’t care due to you being replaceable. Employees are very unappreciated here. I would NOT recommend this place to ANYONE. I hope my experience helps someone out on finding a good job, not one that’ll take advantage of you."
bad,"Bad managers disrepectful non reliable or flexible schedules no bathrooms even. If u are sick poor cleanses don't ever work here "
bad,Dawn was the worst manager. Assumed I was late when I was early! Disrespectful. Wanted me to do multiple jobs at once but paying me the least amount. (Ex. I was on togo getting paid 10 and hour but doing Togo AND prep work which I got paid 11.25 for prep.)
bad,"I requested more hours and didnt get it until 4 or 5 weeks later and then they reduced my hours again the following week. They scheduled me to work Monday through Thursday night. Then, they took me off the schedule for Tuesday and Wednesday. Then, they fired me for a no call no show. I have talked to everyone before getting ""falsely fired"" about a different position and possibly (hopefully) more hours. Never got it and management were very rude."
bad,"Cracker Barrel's mission is in sync with how they treat the employees- they will always care twice as much for guests. Everything looks promising up front but boy be prepared for the bad days. The weight of the bad days includes yelling to your face, belittling comments, very little tone for breaks if you are A Server... Not the ideal job for students at all of you want a clear mental state after leaving. Time off may be granted but if they are short staffed be prepared to see your name on the schedule and to find someone to fill in for you. Everything falls down to the management and coworkers, but good luck if you move forward with this company."
bad,Many of the people I worked with were nice but as a host if you didn’t comply with everything the servers wanted then you were exiled. It made it very difficult to do the job with everyone breathing down your neck.
bad,"After working in the kitchen for over six months at the springfield location and witnessing regularly health code violations committed by other dishwashing staff and the lack of action by management to address these acts, led me to quit my job to search for an employer that actually cares for the best possible quality of product,and whom will hold their employees accountable for such violations instead of choosing to ignore it or make it someone elses duty."
bad,"Long hours, management is constantly telling, extensive side work, not enough money to be made even on a double, not very flexible or understanding. Rude employees"
bad,Modern day bullies very mean unwelcoming to new employees. The other servers are out to make you quit so they can get more hours . It was awful;( being from a nice small town to this kind of atmosphere was astounding . Truly amazed humans act like they did.
bad,"I hated the place from the start simply cause they had so many rules, pay sucked, hours sucked,  management did not listen to any employee and to get benefits u gia b there for over a yr"
bad,"It was so bad I debated on ending it all everyone morning instead of going to work.  Awful managers, awful serving staff, awful cooks.  The only good thing was the prep cooks."
bad,Never working there again they don’t give you enough hours call you in on your days off have you work doubles with no help no brakes at all just not a very good place to work at
bad,"This is definitely not a location that you would want to work at. The managers are horrible, the job is boring, and you definitely do not get paid anywhere near what you are worth."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"Thought it was just my store but guess it's the whole company that sucks. When you get hired they ask what your availability is and then they ""lose"" your availability sheet and will schedule you whatever they want. Then YOU have to find a cover for that shift because it's not the managers problem. And don't ever give them open availability because they will just take advantage of you. Giving you doubles all week and no breaks. I have worked at many restaurants and this company is the only one you don't get smoke breaks or even 10 minutes to eat your food (that you had to pay for) while it's hot. I personally feel like they want you to be stressed out. If you Express your feelings in the back of house, completely away from customers management gets on you. We are so under staffed that I sometimes have to do 3 different jobs. Servers have more side work then any other position. Say your scheduled cut time is 8pm, first of all you will NOT be cut at 8 more like 8:30 or 9 then add another hour for sidework and tables. So you'll probably be leaving at 10. And that's if you were able to finish rolling your silverware during your shift, otherwise you're looking at close to another hour before you finally leave. We are constantly out of something and you never know if we'll be out of it all night or if as soon as you let your table know we are out of what they ordered then we miraculously have the product again. It's a joke! Management isn't there to help you. I've asked managers to grab drinks when I was in the weeds before and they literally turn around to another server and tell"
bad,Don’t waste your time.  And if you do don’t let it get to you. Even if it’s messing with your money because it will. Do what you’ve gotta do and no matter what be polite and attentive to your guests no matter what because they’ll be rude too.
bad,"I am leaving Cracker Barrel because of their broken promises. I guess I should say lies they tell to get people to work there. It is funny to me that they claim to want to be the "" Best Restaurant Chain in the Country""....well, they have A LOT of work to do to pull themselves out of the 1960's when they were founded. I had recently lost a management job with a company that had downsized so I had applied at Cracker Barrel. It was for the retail side of the restaurant since that is where my knowledge is. The current manager told me during the interview that she was impressed with my years of management experience and could not wait to start me on the path to management with the store so she could help other stores within the district. After my background check came back, I was in! The money they offered me was an embarrassment, but I needed a consistent income, so I caved with the promise that the low salary($10/hr), which is actually  $1.45 more than most are hired in at, was only going to be temporary while I trained.  I made it clear that I needed at least 32 hours a week to make it work. She told me she couldn't guarantee hours, but she had a couple people she was looking to get rid of due to performance issues, so she should have hours. The first 2 days of training were on the computer. 3 hours each day at $8.55 an hour. They pay EVERYONE minimum wage to train. The training manager was not even there the second day of training which she had scheduled.I actually had to track down a restaurant manager  to help get the program working. There is  no real leadership in the store."
bad,"The most absolute worst place i have ever worked, the management is absolutely terrible 0/10 would not recommend, management doesn’t care what they say to you!!!"
bad,"not worth working for, worked there for 4 years during school and it was a bad experience. bad managemnt, bad hours, no lunch break, bad uniforms, no insurace, only $5 an hour"
bad,"Loved my lob, just horrible employees "
bad,Not sure how the servers had it. But the cooks had to slave on a hot line for hours without any breaks. Have fun wrapping ll the dishes in plastic bags every first monday of every month so they can spray for cockroaches.
bad,"You have to beg for hours. It took 5 days one week for me to get 25 hours. Pressure sales in the gift shop were just horrible, they followed the guests around, harassing them for sales. Truly ridiculous."
bad,There was no communication among the managers or employees. Chaos was the only way the restaurant ran. Everything sucked every second of everyday.  After the six months I worked there I had taken only one break!
bad,You have to have very tough skin. Management seats in the office mostly.  No law and order at all. Very chaotic and stressful.  People wait 45 minutes to be seated with empty tables
bad,At first they promise you 40 hours a week. That went from 40 to less then 20 in a few months. Keep in mind this was a NEW STORE. I was making 14.25 when I first got hired. I was offered a day postion to cross train. Worked as an Server Assistant then brought into the office he said I have good and bad news good news you scored perfect on your eval bad news we are cutting labor cost so I went fro 1r.2t to 12.00 an hour. Then a few weeks later they had me folding silverware then tthey outsorced that job then I was told I have no hours for you. Many employees left jobs with more hours for this company butnow get less than 20 hours a week so beware poor managment and car less about employees a big SMOKE SCREEN EMPLOYER.
bad,Do not work here. Servers do everything with no compensation. Poorly managed. Very stressful job. Horrible tips. You can make some money but will have to kill yourself to do it.
bad,Working at Cracker Barrel was great until the original GM left. The new management is more stressful than the actual serving job itself. I love waitressing but I would like a job where I can do what I’m supposed to without being talked down to or mistreated by the upper management
bad,I would not recommend working on the retail side to anybody the manager shows favoritism towards her employees. I would definitely recommend the restaurant side to work.
bad,"The management I had at this particular location was very rude,short tempered which includes an incident of the management even putting their hands on the employees aggressively and verbally abusing them. They also only scheduled me on weekends all three days double shift despite my availability sheet saying I wasn’t allowed to work Sunday due to personal reason. The coworkers are a completely different story, they were very friendly and had a lot of laughs to lighten up the work environment."
bad,"the management was horrible they allowed bullying and fed into the bullying to, they did not care about employees or their health, they made false accusations when employees had medical issues"
bad,"Six managers and not a single one can get along with each other or treat their employees right??? And completely disgusting restaurant. Flies everywhere, people always complaining about the floor never being swept or tables being dirty for longer than 20 minutes. Maybe three coworkers, if that, were actually even nice to me. The rest were nasty, disrespectful and couldn't be bothered to have any kind of teamwork. Bad moods throughout from the retail at front to the cooks in back. Everybody was stressed. I was working about 20 hours a week until I was suddenly dropped to a 4-hour closing shift every Saturday for four weeks in a row. Couldn't find out why until one manager cracked and told me there was another host talking badly about me to the rest. It took four weeks for me to even find out why I was being negatively impacted by someone else's words? Really? I quit on the spot, turned in my apron, and never step foot in the restaurant again."
bad,Horrible work place . Mangers have poor management skills . Customers were rude . Do not get enough hours . Do not really do anything working wise . It’s boring
bad,"I worked 9hrs everyday Mom-Fri and no break, after 7 month's of working there, I finally had enough, my depression was setting in more and more when I went to work there, so I quit! I not only did my job there, but I was doing night crew's job as well and it was stressful to the point I wanted to scream!! I got no help in doing the back up cook on busy day's and everybody screaming at me for not having what they needed to be ready when I had to get other thing's ready for other worker's screaming at me for what they needed..."
bad,District managers should try to be in each store and connect with the employee's instead of once a year to terminate during inspections. The customers are amazing truly blessings at times.
bad,Cracker Barrel is all about the money. They will work you to death then when done with you.Will then cut your hours so you can not support your family.
bad,i have been threatened to be physically hurt multiple times by managers. managers here do not know what they are doing and get mad at people for doing their job. jay is the worst manager in the history of management
bad,It was nice until the staff turned on me. The managers all hate each other but are in cahoots with one another. The co workers are rude and so are the guests.
bad,Managers do not know how to properly communicate with others and use their status to demean other people. They berate if you make one simple mistake and never try to calmly explain to you what the proper procedure is.
bad,"They'll promise you full time, only schedule you for 10 hours a week, and then send you home early every shift and you'll only end up with a paycheck for 5 hours."
bad,The general manager here could not be any more stuck up. The older employees made sure that you hated working with them in order for them to work the same shifts. The customers tie with the manager as the worst thing about working here. This restaurant is hillbilly fancy.
bad,this was the worst place anyone could work at. Managers were awful. Very little organization during shifts. Incredibly stressful when they schedule you BY YOURSELF.
bad,"They played favoritism, censored based on you political view they fire over saying like I hope you die or pray for your death like if it’s an actual threat"
bad,"My time here at Cracker Barrel was extremely stressful as the retail manager was seen as “dirty” “shady” and just downright “disrespectful”. Anyone who has worked here under the current retail manager will not recommend anyone to work here. The retail manager puts herself before her employees as she completely avoids your availability sheets and just schedules you out of the complete blue. You only get a break if you work a 5 hour shift, which 9 times out of 10 will not be the case as 99.9% of your shifts will only be 4 hours long, therefore no breaks."
bad,"I worked here for 2 months. Worked less than 16 hours a week. Terrible Management. Terrible Customers. No Benefits. Terrible Pay. Bad Coworkers. The managers yelled at me in front of customers, for correcting other workers mistakes, while customers praised me."
bad,Walking into work you almost always knew how things would go.. As in it would be awful. Most items were 86'd. Nobody was ever in a good mood. Most management was screaming and cussing you out. Most days sent me into major panic attacks.
bad,Working as a dishwasher they did not want you to take your time to actually get everything cleaned and just wanted you to slightly scrub and throw dishes into the washer. The management had 0 patience and were not at all enjoyable to work for
bad,"While I was at Cracker Barrel the managment team was shifting very often, Most of the Managers were not qualified for the job and did not care to really help or make employees feel welcomed or comfortable."
bad,The group is understaffed and overworked at my location. Overhiring and not using everyone was also a problem. Hopefully this gets fixed sooner than later.
bad,"Got hired as a cook and told details about the position since thats what i'd be doing. Tried to train me at training to be a dishwasher,then when i confronted them they said they only need dishwashers at the moment. Shady place with good pay and even more untrustworthy managers. Work at ur own risk here, shame i have to look at cracker barrel in a different light now."
bad,the work at cracker barrel wasn't hard but the management was the worst part the management treated the staff like children and always would keep them under close watch as if wanting to fire them
bad,The Team Member staff was nice people but the management was so poor and treated us all different because of our skin we barely got hours we barely had tables they had they pick and choose and that place . As soon as I found me another job I got out of there that job was so stressful and I'm taken care of two kids barley making 200 every week.
bad,I was treated poorly and underpaid. I was discriminated by workers that were unproductive and called out of my name by the people i trained. I will never apply or attempt to work here again.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"I hated working there. The management was bad, the would have me clock in as a server and then host for my entire shift telling me they would fix it and never did.. i was making $4.00 hosting"
bad,"Staff is rude disrespectful, mean, management is awful"
bad,At first it was good job but after a while it just turned bad managers are not nice they don't care if your not feeling good at all they still want you to work.
bad,"There were too many cooks in the kitchen, and not actual cooks. There were around five different managers and they did not communicate with each other. There were always too many conflicting instructions in an already stressful and fast paced environment. The inflexibility and uncertainty of what I was actually supposed to be doing finally forced me to walk out the door."
bad,I wouldn't recommend anyone to work this job because of the management and the regulations of the company. I think the food needs more seasoning and the job needs to hire better management.
bad,"Don't bother unless you are a teenager looking for a little pocket change.  Discounts on overpriced junk from China. Have to run a register and try to meet sales goals plus answer the phones from applicants during rush hours (dinner/lunch).  Very little orientation. Outdated and poorly maintained computer systems.  Poor system for handling to-go orders. All in all, not very organized.  Food is consistent but not what I would call good. Lots of animosity between restaurant staff/managers and retail staff/managers.  Not an atmosphere of teamwork at all.  Pay is minimum wage and only get raises if you par but they neglect to tell you that those raises are  10 cents an hour."
bad,"As a host, you will have a million and one tasks that are asked of you to all be doing simultaneously while dealing with ungrateful, entitled elderly people. Cracker Barrel does not accept reservations as of when I worked, so have fun attempting to seat entire extended families together (on a SUNDAY) while they glare at you as you are attempting to set things up for them because you aren't ""fast enough."" Also, prepare to be touched by elderly people without your consent every day you are in there, you may even end up groped by an old man like my experience."
bad,"The people there are always so negative about everything. Management doesnt care about their employees."
bad,"A typical work day is horrible, they treat their workers like slaves and i am saying that in the nicest way possible. The managers did nothing but worried about themselves and money. And they refuse to give breaks."
bad,"Typical serving job, took drink and food orders and had sidework to complete along with rolling silverware, none of which was bad. However the people at Cracker Barrel made it unbearable, as there were co-workers who were bullies as well as managers."
bad,"Would never wish this place on anyone.  When busy the managers would just stand there staring at you with their arms crossed and not help at all.  It was explained to me that if we help you, you will never get better.  Then you get written up because you had long ticket times.  They have double kitchens for about 8 cooks.  One kitchen would have four cooks while I would be in the second by myself.  Asked about a promotion and was told.  We cannot afford to loose you as a cook.  So that was denied.  Also a restaurant that doesn't allow their staff soda.  Come on.  That was a long year and a half.  I would rather be homeless then to ever work for Cracker Barrel again.  Oh yea lets not talk about the big $0.25 raises."
bad,"Typical restaurant duties, however, a lot to complete and very scripted which was difficult to perform, where I like to use my personality when approaching guests"
bad,"The location I worked in was awful. Managers had their favorites, which made the atmosphere dull. Servers had a seniority complex and treated new people like children. The older servers took this job too seriously, as if we were dealing with peoples live's rather than their food. Managers enforced punishment by giving servers less hours a week. Awful tip system (guests pay in the front store, a separate part of the restaurant), therefore, many guests felt guilt-free and often left 1-3 dollar tips (on a $40+ dollar dinner). A typical work day, you could make 50 dollars or more (working 10 hours), a typical bad day could leave you with  less than 25 dollars (working the same 10 hours)..."
bad,"Retail. No one would train me. Made to stand for seven hours without a break and when I asked one of my co-workers if I could take a break because my feet hurt she got really mad at me and told me I could only take five minutes the entire time I worked. Rude co-workers,  bad experience. Would not recommend this job to anyone. Very uncaring."
bad,"Being a dishwasher at Cracker Barrel was too stressful, too fast paced, constant physical activity that hurt your body within 2 weeks of working(finger and feet sores all the time) General manager didn't listen to any of the employees at all, didn't care about your availability and would schedule you times you couldn't work even after mentioning it literally 5 times, expected perfection, made you stay after your shift EVERY DAY, and over all was terrible at communication."
bad,I went to work eager to learn yet i was distraught because i was taught nothing. I was a hostess but they were so limited. I believe they shouldve been cross trained to be able to do something else.
bad,Cracker Barrel as a whole is not good the management is very poor. The corporate office should really look into why I have been through 17 mangers and like 4 GM's in five years. Asking why the store run so poorly.  RIDICULOUS
bad,Was my first serving job and would not go back. Poor management made it a very hard place to work. they would change my schedule without warning an hour or two before having to be there and get mad when i wouldn't be there. would take days off my schedule and put days on when i was off. never approved days off and had to work major holidays like thanksgiving.
bad,Cracker Barrel was the worst place I have ever worked. The employees do not care about their jobs at all. They also do not preform their jobs to the standards of the company.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"Managers need more assistance. They couldnt keep the schedule right, constantly changing my hours and days I was suppose to work last minute. Cut my hours back after they trained me and said I was hired for a full time position but I only received 10 hours a week."
bad,Area district managers are the problem.  They not in the stores to see or want to admit the horrendous issues. Home Office has to depend on faulty District Managers--a sad and unprofitable choice for them.
bad,"awful place to work."
bad,Management talks down to you and aren't very appreciative they street the cooks make the cooks feel little to no appreciation for the hard work put in
bad,"They over worked their staff for the amount of pay they receive. "
bad,Garbage place to work don't believe what you are told in the in the interview management don't care but except for you to kill yourself to please the guest not customer while you can't get a break but they sit in the office
bad,"I had my orientation on a Friday night. That night they proceeded to tell me I had to work the next morning at 9 am. Ok I say. Whatever. So I go in & no one shows me how to punch in so it just left my mind. I am working with a hearing impaired employee who could not properly train or assist me. I had a terrible 6 hour shift. No manager had asked me how I was doing or told me how to do my job. I previously dishwashed at a different restaurant which was much smaller in size. Cracker Barrel had a bigger, unfamiliar set up. I did not know how their restaurant was run. No one was guiding me. I had an awful experience. Also, my break was a half hour, that most of it was spent waiting for my food, which I had to pay for."
bad,Cracker Barrel was my high school job all it was good for was paying for my gas. The servers were awful to work with the managers had no backbone and let them talk back when they were mad about not getting sat. The servers basically think the run the place. I worked as a hostess however the managers thought they could put the custodial duties on their hostess for no additional compensation and NOT including it on our application for a hostess. The management is to cheap to have a bus boy on the week days only weekends when the store/restaurant are extremely busy.
bad,Really awful place to work at and had terrible managers i wouldn't ever reccomend this place for anyone to work here. Staff is unfriendly and managers treat the staff like garbage. DON'T WORK HERE.
bad,"While cracker barrel paid the bills, working there was miserable. Management was bias and favored certain employees, they did NOT follow Alabama state laws regarding breaks."
bad,"Cracker Barrel is a terrible place to work. Managers are not helpful, they don't do much at all. Servers are underpaid and are expected to turn tables faster than possible."
bad,I’ve worked there for over 2 years. In my time there the mangers has made it clear that if you plan on ever leaving the company they will make the work place awful for you.
bad,"In less than 6 months I walked out due to the worst management team I've ever worked for. I wad less stressed NOT working, than what i was coming into work to get paid."
bad,They expect way to much in too little time and don’t care how you feel or if you need anything. They treat you like slaves. They use you as much as they can and when their done they could careless how much you like your job or them.
bad,"Out of all of the part time jobs that I have had Cracker Barrel was the worst. they were very strict about the workers appearance, for example females could not wear too much makeup or have their nails done. everyone was forced to wear a uniform that had stars on it according to who was better at their job which was okay for me, but overall very discriminatory. Hosts and Hostesses were also not allowed to take tips from customers under any circumstances, that is regardless of if the customers wanted to give out a tip."
bad,There was too much going on between the staff management and employees and not enough being done to help one another.there were too many times which underhanded actions took place and made work uncomfortable.
bad,The hours varied a lot no matter what position you worked or of you worked 4 different ones . Hours always varied . Very ridiculous rules about clothing
bad,They treat u like trash.. they made me drive to work in the dangerous snow in ALABAMA (mostly black ice)... i was the onli cook frm opening to closing without a break or help... I almost die 5 time tryna get to work... and they didn't even thank me... smh
bad,"Great place to work if you'd like to get involved with the criminals in your area. Worked for 3 years as a server in two locations. Management consists of a team of pushovers, will not have your back for anything. Just gotta know that going in. Lousy crowd. Terrible, needy guests. Okay temporary job, but start throwing your applications at real companies while you're being taken advantage of at the Crack Shack."
bad,"It was very difficult work at a popular restaurant, I wouldn’t recommend for someone’s first job as it was my first job. You have to buy your own uniforms, and you are expected to have them before your first day. They give you the aprons but that’s it."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"I was in charge of greeting and seating the guests. Making sure that they were seated appropriately in order to ensure fair work for all the servers, and the customers needs."
bad,"If you work hard, they use you, at least the place where I worked. No recognition for the good employees. People slacked off. Not even gloves were used on the grills when they touched raw meat."
bad,The management was poor and treated the employees like they didn’t matter and they only cared about their own agenda. Not caring about the employees or anything about them
bad,"busy busy busy, learned how to multitask to the fullest. you work with a diverse group of people, the management is ok, hardest part of the job is trying to make everyone happy"
bad,"I was good at this job, the job however wasn't fond of me. Countless nights of waking up screaming.  I did learn how to use a long lighter properly and got to enjoy an employee reduced price meal."
bad,"I worked there for a short time, and it was awful.  They let me go because my disability. I'm pretty sure that that is illegal, but hey. Whatever, right?"
bad,"Horrible management, and supervisors - put me on a busy shift the second day of my training and then complained that I got an order wrong. - obviously."
bad,"This cracker barrle was dirty and poorly managed.  The staff is unfriendly, and rude.  The hours were terrible and they set the staff up for failure on each shift"
bad,I had a very poor experience working for Cracker Barrell. Their managers are disrespectful of their employees & are the exact types of people you wouldn't want to work with / for.
bad,many complaints by customers about managment and inability to recieve quality service and food. labor intense during food rush with little to no training
bad,"My hours got cut consistently, and I was told I never did anything well enough no matter how hard I tried to. The job was not great to work at. After I left the store seemed to go down much more in quality."
bad,"Company for the company, not for the people who help make the company. Long hours, little pay, little respect."
bad,"Bad hours, bad pay, horrible management, no benefits, inconsistent schedule, rude customers, no breaks, strict uniform, hostile employees, overall terrible place to work."
bad,hostess work 8-9 hours without a break. the company takes advantage of good employees. managers dont know how to manager the store. management knows about the stress you are under and does not care at all about your well-being.
bad,The employees that you’ll work with will be likely to make the job run smoothly. The only thing that will be considered dreadful about the job would be the management and the work load.
bad,Don’t waste your time if you are a hard dedicated worker!!!!  This place doesn’t pay you for your skills or work ethic. The managers play favorites and aren’t consistent with employee write ups for bad actions.
bad,I worked in the retail department and i loved the manager. The part that I hated was that I needed to work more hours and I asked for it many times but was never given extra hours. I barely worked here at all and it was't possible to live life off of $100 every two weeks
bad,You should never work for this company of you enjoy having a life. You will work seven days a week and that still won't be enough. Don't believe me? Good luck
bad,"Stressful work environment due to managers, have three managers and all wanted things done differently. Make job harder than it had to be. Managers do not back up employees."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"New employees are talked down to and treated like they're stupid. Management is rude and will hang up when you call/ leave you on read. They push and push for you to sell items, and even when you give your all, it isn't good enough. No matter how many hours you work, you'll never get a break. You're constantly reminded that you aren't good enough. Management, especially GM, will treat you like you're less than human. Customers are absolutely horrible and rude, older coworkers love to gossip and are very hostile. Would never recommend."
bad,"I absolutely do not recommend taking this job unless you have a very high tolerance for nonsense. When I began working here, I was promised a friendly workplace that took care of their employees. In the almost year I have worked here, management has gone from helpful and friendly to overbearing and rude. They flat out ignore whenever we need assistance and then turn around and scold us for not asking for help when we needed it. They are entirely unsympathetic about private family emergencies and get angry whenever workers miss work for health concerns. I have been forced to come into work whenever I felt unwell with a stomach bug that could have contaminated a workplace that deals with food, which is a HUGE health hazard to the community that mostly serves elderly people and couples with young children."
bad,not a good place to work.management unproffesional and rude.there was no morale and the pay was not enough to live off of trying to raise a family.dont do it.
bad,"Good System"
bad,The management under staff the dishroom on the busiest days..it is crazy to work here.they try to save money on labor just so they can get bigger bonuses so they work u to death for the least pay that they can get away with.
bad,It is a very cut throat business. They don’t appreciate their employees. The managers are very rude and only think about theirs elves. I would never work at another Cracker Barrel again
bad,Terrible place to work  treated terribly  don’t get any hours they do not understand family emergencies had to fight for time off when my child was born
bad,"Wikipedia is a live collaboration differing from paper-based reference sources in important ways. Unlike printed encyclopedias, Wikipedia is continually created and updated, with articles on historic events appearing within minutes, rather than months or years. Because everybody can help improve it, Wikipedia has become more comprehensive than any other encyclopedia. In addition to quantity, its contributors work on improving quality as well."
bad,They want your life.  There ethics are not as they say.  Too many hours.  6 1/2 days a week.  Not enough support on the store level.  I don't wish this job on anyone.
bad,The GM expects every employee to do way more than is required and nothing is ever good enough.  The pay is low and the work is hard and stressful.  I would not recommend working here to anyone.
bad,"I worked in retail, a typical day was walking around and checking people out at the register. I leaned a lot about retail. Management wasn't very great or friendly. The hardest part was closing at 11pm and having to be back at 6am. The most enjoyable part was leaving."
bad,there was constant yelling from the manager. the days were always stressful and long. most of the time you would be taking criticism and negative comments from the staff.
bad,I was just a new mother and just started working here. You would think that they are friendly but the will stab you in the back! I wouldn't recommend anyone working there! They want too many demands for just 3 people working a huge line! They lost a great employe!and plus that is a peice ahir thing to let a mother go who was willing to work! Supposed to be family friendly but isnt!
bad,"The amount of effort and work versus the amount of pay is extremely unfair. On weekends, especially Sundays, are extremely stressful and managers are overly demanding due to bonuses they receive based on how much is sold per hour. I have worked at two different cracker barrels due to location and limitations but will never work at one again."
bad,I did not enjoy working here because of how boring it was and stressful. I felt like I always had to do everything exactly how I was taught or I would get in trouble.
bad,"Lack of management, poor environment, extremely fast paced. It was simply a place I wouldn't want to go back to, as a customer or an employee, especially after I saw the cleanliness of the kitchen and other employees."
bad,"If you think you're worth anything other than minimum wages, you're wrong. Work life balance is non existent and if you don't meet sales goals, you're fired. "
bad,"Very poor management, wait staff are cut throat, to many chief's think they are in charge, they do not have flexiable schedule, management and other staff are very disrespectful and rude, and Management does not hold everyone to the same standards (they have there favorites)."
bad,"It's OK If this is your first job. Management is not responsible for any tips left on the table. If you don't get your tips when you see them and you come back and there gone, then that's on you. There words."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"This was my least favorite job, all the managers took the job way too seriously and being at work felt like being held hostage. There were numerous times that my hard earned money was stolen straight off my table by a fellow server, and being right down the road from a church on Sunday led to some pretty awful customers"
bad,"I love being a customer at Cracker Barrel, but working there was quite stressful and challenging.  I felt like someone was constantly watching my every move.  I didn't feel relaxed or happy at this job!"
bad,"Managing is difficult to work with and boarder-line abusive with their power. I am a very upbeat, positive employee, but I became very emotional and unhappy in the short time I have been employed there."
bad,a typical day at work- was filled with one to two managers not talking to each other and one telling me one thing and he other telling me something else
bad,It's good working place but also rules to follow ND u have to be on time .great people to work with and managers are understand able.its a very biusy place that receive alot customer s .food are great ND it's a very fast paste to work harder n get alot done.
bad,the place is a job and that it the work place is bad they are unfair would not recommend this job unless you really need some where to work and you like being treated more of as a pet than a worker
bad,Wouldn't work there again
bad,Unprofessional retail company in the orientation procesd of a new hire.  Waste of a persons time.  Treated very badly when I came in as a new hire for the orientation to work for this company by the person who does the orientation process in Morton Illinois.  It was uncalled for and her phone call even days before giving me information on  the kind of fingernail polish I had to wear and the size of my earrings. Totally uncalled for.  Very very unprofessional for a company to have a person like that do their calling n training for a new hire.  It was a total waste of my time filling out all the papers to get hired over the computer.  Life is too short to deal with a company like this
bad,The only good thing that came out of this job was the insurance. I work there for 5 years and had amazing hours but dealing with everyone's in maturity led me straight out the door.
bad,As I have been with Cracker Barrel over the pas year we have lost managers and each new manager we get they not schedule me anymore our management team has gone way down they are hiring new people and trying to get rid of all the old people!
bad,"manager sends other employees to your table for there order, due to sales per hour. Guest do not matter here. Working here was like herding cattle.do not work here."
bad,Management was disrespectful and pay was low no team work or friendly environment and plenty of confusion between co-workers. It was like working with children.
bad,"I did not enjoy this job. The managers were overbearing and choicy. I wanted to achieve great things at this company, but the management was just sad."
bad,"40+-year-old women bossing everyone around, foreign chefs that you cant communicate with, racist, rolling 150+ silverware before getting a table on the floor THEN before you can leave another job while you're getting paid 3$ an hour. The worst job I've ever had absolutely hated it and the people there. They are fake."
bad,Very poor management! Wouldn't recommend working here to my worst enemy. The managers clearly have favorites. Upon hire I was told that I would get at least 25 hours a week and I was getting less than 10.
bad,i will not make a remark on this as to the fact i didn't enjoy my time working for this company.  i have never worked for a company that didn't help the cooks or servers if there was any problems or if they were short handed.
bad,"worked there for 4 years, saw new people move up in the first couple months of being there while I was never allowed to advance. Managers played favorites, hardest workers taken advantage of."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,This was not a fun place to work. Management was horrible. Very high turnover rate. I feel as if the management did not treat employees the way they should have.
bad,"I didnt work at this cracker barrel long, but my tips were constantly coming up missing and managment did nothing to investigate. My tables were constantly being stollen from me. The overall atmosphere was dreary."
bad,Too many hrs. Spend most of time working position not managing. No life. So many hrs working 12 he day. Employees who have been there for a long time can refuse managers and won't get fired. Can be late every day and will get hundreds of write ups and nothing hapens.
bad,"Just run this place is awful. managers try to start problems between coworkers.you get no help from management. it's a horrible place nobody likes their job."
bad,"Two managers would hit on underage females. High turnover in managers so don't get comfortable. Employees were never happy, were very dishonest and would steal tips. They acted better and higher at the top than you."
bad,They do not care about you and treat you awfully and expect things that cant be done and do not aid anyone and the pay is absolutely awful for how much money the stores make on a daily basis.
bad,It is really difficult to review a place if your consistently being sent home early. Most often times was sent home before gas money was even made for that day.
bad,"lack of hours, never consistent, managers act like children, favoritism is alive and well at Cracker Barrel, horrible place to work, no concern for employees health just for what they can do for the company. You can be the best person on your team and go unnoticed because you aren't part of the group!"
bad,They have a lot of nice guests  come in to eat there.  It is a friendly guest who come in there and they usually leave good tips. It is a very busy place and clean.
bad,"This location that i worked was ok , but could use a lot of improvement. They hired just about anybody who applied. i beleive that they would be a great place to work if the employees were better picked."
bad,"Poor place to work. Management is unfair, dishonest and will give no feedback on hwo to imrove until it is too late. They will cut your hours without notice and still expect the same amount to be done."
bad,I did not like working there.  Servers have to do to much work and don't make enough money.  Management was poor to say the least.  Very stressful place to work
bad,There wasn't an equal balance between work and pay the dishwasher position is none stop then you have to do odds things like this trash  for. The entire store which as a dishwasher sets you back when you work is already hectic   then you also have to do with lack of respect from CO workers treating dishwashers as the lowest postion
bad,This is probably the worst place I've ever worked at.  All the managers were very unorganized and not very helpful at all. I wouldn't recommend working st the Cracker Barrel
bad,This job could be great if the management staff respected their servers and cook. They disrespect them and belittle them in every conversation. The schedule is a good thing when they dont change it at the last minute and then call wanting to know where you are.
bad,"this place is not one i would recommend anyone working. the management are all about themselves and wont help you out no matter what. the servers are always  doing things to push you over the edge. nobody in there is in a good mood when they end their shift. "
bad,I worked for this company for 3years by far the worst job I ever had.. I tried to hang in there because I am I single mother of3. The management sucks
bad,"poor management, low salary, not enough work hours, kept people on purpose away after they were required to get off work even though all their work was done."
bad,"The managers were so rude to you. One manager even calls people out, and makes fun of them, and continues to yell at other servers like they are dogs."
bad,"Not willing to speak too much about my time at this job. The things that I did learn was how to adapt in a very fast paced environment, and how to expedite tickets in 10 minutes or less."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"I am so happy I am leaving this toxic work environment. The managers are probably the most arrogant people I've ever encountered. They expect everyone to carry all the weight while they sit back and do NOTHING. On top of that, they are so condescending when employees need help or want to ask a question. Workplaces should NOT be like this we need to work as a team and family NOT blaming people individually for completely irrelevant things that they have no control over. They continue to contradict one another and are never sure of rules and regulations because they make up their own rules because they all put themselves on a pedestal they have no business being on. They don't allow people to work overtime even though we DESPERATELY need people to work. And then an added bad part about this place is the customers. They come into this place expecting to be treated like they're at the Ritz Carlton. THIS IS CRACKER BARREL. OUR FOOD IS CHEAPER THAN MCDONALDS. The only good thing I can take from this place is the fact some of my dearest friends are my fellow hosts. This place is absolutely unbearable and I'm so happy I'm done with this place."
bad,I have never worked at a place with so much drama and favoritism. Some of the staff that has been there for a while will bully the new people. The mangers act like children.
bad,They work their employees like dogs. Their customers talk to people any kind of way and the managers allow it to happen. You will spend majority of time in there just to receive a 300 dollar pay check.
bad,"Management is awful, they treat servers like dirt and do not fix problems that need to be fixed. This location is poorly ran and it reflects in the tips even though it isn't your fault."
bad,"Bad management, bad customers, bad pay. Horrible food, bad food preperation, no advancement, bad coworkers as well. Would not recomend anyone to work here."
bad,Wouldn't ever recommend working here or eating here all the managers have horrible attitudes and they treat everyone like they are less than them and the servers get the worst end of all we do all the work the serving the busting the sorting of silverware while the managers do nothing
bad,I made pretty decent tip. Managers were very unprofessional. Always bad language and arguments. I did learn good customer service. they wanted me to work a schedule that I could not work due to high school. It was brought to the mnagers attention he told me that I could be there or loose my job.
bad,Cracker Barel is a poorly managed company. They schedule you with the he worst possible hours and they pay you as little as possible. I hated going in for work!
bad,"This job was so stressful. No managers cared. They expected a lot from you in so little time. Always work to do. No breaks, no lunch breaks, this job was the worse."
bad,someone is always cutting you so you lose hours or gain hours depending on how busy it is at cracker barrel. its supposed to be family oriented but its not. everyone talks bad about everyone and everyone has something disrespectful to say no matter what kind of day it is.
bad,i got paid 80 a week i never got scheduled and you run around the entire time you are working you will always have somthing to do and the other employess like to start stuf 24/7
bad,I worked there for 3 months. They had a requirement for EVERY employee to work on THANKSGIVING! And they were opened on Christmas so I left. The management was terrible and few of the employees cared about their job. There were nights when I was one of two servers in the entire restaurant! It was ridiculous and chaotic.
bad,"That is all I have to say! I don't wish to say anything else about my experience working there. Someone else my love working there, with those benefits & discounts."
bad,The co-workers were mostly rude and management here did not care what kind of manager's they hired. I can't go into further detail due to confidential rights. Not to mention the kitchen was not clean. I have never eaten at a cracker barrel again not will I ever after seeing behind the scenes.
bad,It was a very stressful job. Managers always yelling blaming the staff if sales were down or our percentage  percentage rates were down. It was not a happy place to work. Some managers took there failure out on the staff. And the GM never took responsibility for there failures cause it all starts at the top
bad,"The Milford location is awful. I hated working there. Awful pay, awful management, staff was rude and dirty. The best part of the job was the customers."
bad,"My manager was often rude.  She was unwilling to help.  She threatened to cut our hours if we were not meeting sales requirements she set herself.  When I threatened to go to upper management she stated ""she could do what she wanted, and did not care""   Our food managers were caught several times by employees yelling at one another.  They actually almost go into a fight."
bad,Don't work here if you don't want to be stressed out every shift. Cracker Barrel is the only restaurant that runs out of main entrees 24/7. IT is over-staffed and poorly managed.
bad,"They treat you like you don't matter, you are given minimum wage only for them to cut hours and talk to you like you are subhuman. I wouldn't work for them ever again nor would I suggest it to anyone."
bad,the store i worked at was supper dirty. grease and dust and who knows what else is there. vets got to do whatever they wanted and i got stuck covering for them and doing their job when they didnt do it. horrible work system.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,The store is very unorganized on the retail side. I worked retail and regretted it. I had many friends who worked as a waitress or hostess and they received more hours and there managers were more organized.
bad,atmosphere was entirely money drive no consideration work workers they would change your schedule without notifying you in advance would sendn you home when business was slow you could never rely on the amount of hours they told you
bad,"a typical day for me is getting accused of stuff i did not do, having management constantly down my throat about anything and everything, not getting paid enough to be cursed at by other employees, also getting walked over by management. What I have learned is nothing. work place is very diverse. The hardest part about my job  is the lack of communication between management and staff, as well as the stuff listed above. There is nothing enjoyable about the company, for example everyone says that Walmart treats their employees very badly well cracker barrel treats theirs way worse than Walmart treats theirs."
bad,This job was great at first until management went downhill. They never allowed me time off even when I requested it off in advance and if I was sick or had an emergency they would never help me find coverage. They also never gave me a raise like they were supposed to since I was a lead hostess and they also kept me over my time being scheduled.
bad,"I was a hostess for about 2 years there and when I tell you it was a bad environment to work in it was terrible. I had workers who would talk to me any kind of way; rude. Expecally the manager(s). I liked it better when the previous managers where there & I wish they would come back because those were the best managers I have ever encountered since working there. Very nice and doesn't seem down and very energetic to be around. I dealt with staff talking about me constantly making me look bad. I had racist customers who lied on me by stating I was rude when I couldn't sit them at a table that was dirty when no waiter was available, just pure hatred there. I would never consider anyone to work here at this place. I already filed complaints but nothing was done. My reputation & being able to find a job somewhere else is slim because of this company which was messed up since I was fired because I asked the manager who seemed very aggressive to stop yelling at me in the office when I asked to speak to him privately. I was already stressed at that point from the place being over packed & I had to take names with no help, I repeat- NO HELP! I've medical problems where I would have a seizure if I become too stressful or told to do one thing then another. Someone could've at least gave me a hand that day. He was too busy helping the kitchen staff when he could've came and help me. But I guess that Cracker Barrel supposedly teamwork for you."
bad,This was a good job in that I was able to have a flexible schedule while I was going to school at the same time. Overall it was a good experience so long as you worked on days that was busy enough to make good money.
bad,This job was ok. The pay wasn't great neither was management. Company was ok just had a few problems with them .mostly management was my problem.......
bad,Most of the management doesn't care about the employees. Lazy employees who dont show up to shifts and are constantly calling out are never fired and hard workers suffer.
bad,"Very christian and they push you to be as well. Management at my store was awful,the GM was rude and constantly told me I needed to quit my other job because ""they probably didn't pay as much anyways"" when I was making maybe $50 a night at CB"
bad,"A typical day at work would be preparing your uniform an hour before you came in only to have it criticized and if not perfect you would actually be sent home. If it was perfect (which it had to be if you wanted to work) you'd have to spend 6-12 hours in LED lighting listening to the same country songs play over and over again. The managers were mean and dismissive.They consistently talked to me as if I were a child, but if they ever had to help pick up the slack they couldn't do what we were doing either. Co-workers were always really sweet but some of them have been there for 10+ years and they also are not team players. The ones that have been there forever will not help you run food or put in a confusing order and managers don't know how to do it either. So you're pretty much at the mercy of people who are also new there. The hardest part of the job is managing your tables. Managers get mad at you if your table stays around for longer than 30 minutes. And most the time their check never exceeds $30 so that screws you on your tips and a lot of old people don't tip at all. "
bad,"For the amount of work that is expected out of the workers, the pay is not near enough. This company really does TRY to make it hard on employees. Every manager is overworked and stressed, they can never keep decent people in the kitchen, everything is always broken. How they run the company really makes no sense to me but good luck to them I guess."
bad,Job security is not promised and should only be provided for college aged students who are looking for temporary employment. Training is minor and the management get upset when employees can't provide services that were never taught.
bad,"When I first started working there, the hours were ok, then after a while, I started getting more hours.  It got to the point where I was only off one or two days a week, and working double shifts every weekend.  When I was pregnant, they still kept my hours the same and not problem, but after I came back from leave, I asked them to change hours on the weekend.  They cut my hours and gave my hours to new employees.  I was getting so few hours that I was barely making enough to cover my gas to go to work.  There were good managers when I started there, but the General Manager left and went to another store, and the new one was very rude to employees, and the good managers left or retired.  There is not very much advancement here.  They test you when you have been there a certain amount of time and if you do not pass with a certain score, you do not get raises."
bad,"Cracker Barrel is a horrible place to work! Their staff and management are complete joke, super rude and just all around horrible people to work for in Beckley."
bad,A bunch of crabs in a barrel!!! Great raises and opportunities but no hours. You can barely afford to live working there. You have to have and extra income.
bad,"The training is horrible, the person who trained me talked badly about the place the whole time, and was teaching me how to cut corners versus doing it the right way. The employees are unwelcoming. It was my first day of training and i met the District manager was rude and apparently was unaware it was my first day on the job. There is a gap in the communication between hourly employees and management. You will regret working here. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Id rather beg on the corner."
bad,"The Management is horrible, they degrade new and young servers, guest have called and complained about them. Just had a meeting a while back to discuss the things that where happening at our store that the CEO disagreed with."
bad,"Horrible place to work. Would never return to this job, was promised decent raises at intervals but was denied them when I didn't pass exams based on company thoughts. Mangement always making demands beyond professional boundaries. Was always asked to be there when it was inconvienent for me during my days off."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"Hire more dishwashers. They are all angry, exhausted, and overworked. People might stay at that job if they were treated like human beings. All the equipment was broken when I worked there, even though they were supposed to replace it."
bad,its got some good food but management is awful you cant do anything literally its like working for a army that is always fighting against you i would never work for this complany again
bad,"If you're good with people, and like being yelled at by hungry customers, than this place is great. Most of the management is ok, but tend to just want things done, rather than helping."
bad,"If you can't do any better this employer is ok, but only for the short-term."
bad,The Gm was awesome there bit there was a manger who was rude to me hated my guts told me to stay away from her when i wasnt even doing anything people would take your silver wear at night so you couldn't get out when you were suppose to and if you sent out cold food after you grabbed it right out the window it's cold it's your fault not the cooks
bad,I worked at cracker barrel for 7 months and it was buy far the worst job I've ever had  The manager on the retail side was rude and didn't know how to leave her problems at the the. Prepare to be verbally abused and pushed around if you get a job here.
bad,They claim customers first but if the customers knew the quality of there work I would almost guarantee they would not go back. Left this company due to quality and integrity.
bad,I was very unhappy working at Cracker Barrel. As an employee you are disrespected and talked down to. Definitely not a good place to work. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"It was a horrible work environment with a poor management team. Managers were not coordinated and the policies were interpreted differently by each manager, so they could never all be pleased at once."
bad,"Management sucks....hillbillies "
bad,"a normall day is come to work do your job. work for a little wile. go smoke a cigarette, go work some more. go get some food take a break. finish your job and then go home."
bad,"The management team are completely inconsistent as far as rules and discipline go. The managers are allowed to bully hourly employees, including their key hourly people. Absolutely zero work fluidity in the BOH. Malicious gossip is tolerated and continued by managers. Only senior employees get money making shifts. You get only certain percentage off of your meals depending on what par you are on. That meal, that you purchase with your money, must be ate at the store or thrown away before exiting the building. It is just down right impossible to make a living there unless you are one of the senior people."
bad,the hardest part of the job was getting the different buttons ans sales under control for the customers when they combined their meal with merchandise they bought in the store
bad,Extremely long hours and a true pressure cooker. I worked over 65 hours per week and often may more hours. Truly the worst work experience I have ever had.
bad,"a a a a a an a a aand a a a and  aif if it was you. and  what will you do, it is all of not what it is, but if you prefer to be their and you want to advance you have to be on the management tail at all times."
bad,It's a decent company. .. but that location is not a good one to work at.  The management could care less about the employees... it's all about how they can get ahead and make more money regardless who it hurts or anything else. ..
bad,"The food is awesome, the atmosphere is great,the employess are ok,the managers really don't take the time to train people to the best of there ability."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,Managers will make sure they get there break and feed thief faces but could care less if you get a break or eat.Always short staffed they expect you to run food answer the phone for to go orders and put the to go orders together. Also going up front to take to go orders and still providing great customer service.You have to carry a tray and a towel with you at all times. Out of everything else the GM abuses is power and is the most unprofessional thing I have ever worked for. And I have been in the service industry for 19 years!
bad,"Disgusting kitchen, disgusting people, etc.  Was hired for one position and when I didn't meet thier standards I was moved to another position and lied to about what I would make a hour.  Management is extremely petty and vindictive.  When I changed my availability to three days a week I was put down to one day a week.  A handful of decent coworkers who aren't meth addled."
bad,I was a host here one of the most worst jobs I ever had. I tell  a story about this place at every interview I have just to give an example of my worst jobs ever. I hated this place.
bad,"Die not care for management very unfair,very unprofessional.Management played favorites with hours and tasks assigned"
bad,"You will be abused beyond all recognition.My wife worked there for 10 years and was never promoted, they rather higher from outside for some reason."
bad,I learned how to cook and cleaner and be good with time mangermemt. But over all over I just feel Cracker Barrel is cutting my hours because they hired way to many to work there.
bad,"When I worked at Cracker Barrel, I really enjoyed all the employees and the managers. It was a pretty laid back job. I would clean tables, set the tables up, seat people, provide  menus and silverware, clean the bathrooms and sometimes changed the signs and open or shut blinds. I left the job because they worked me for six months and I was maybe called in twice a week for five hours. So I had to quit."
bad,"It is not a place for the faint of heart. You must comply to their work schedule and are often times left by yourself to fetch orders, make them, and serve them. As for cooks, management does not help at all and gives them a very short leash for mistakes. Finally, the dishwashers the backbone of the restutaunt. They are left by themselves almost 90% of the time and management often puts them on shifts that are very unkind to them such as them being by themselves with no help. Them when they ask for something it slows down the whole store's productivity and when productivity goes down customer service goes down. They pay is based on a unfair and biased performance system that if you have to comply to their standards and practices you would get raises but only on their time. In closing do not work here if you absolutely have to only work at least one or two days. Your best bet take it from me is work only one day because you will certainly get sick of it."
bad,"everything about this cracker barrel is bad from the food to the employees, they are biased toward certain people in the workplace I feslt as if we were all crabs in a barrel"
bad,"This was the worst Job I Ever had, and will Never even go back to the store for anything ever. The Management does not know how to treat its employees."
bad,"I absolutely hated working for this company who ever goes to apply to this company I would really look into before applying, they treat their employees so bad they don't give you breaks no matter how long of a day you are working and also they don't appreciate anything you do at all !!! If you want to have a good day at work and not be stressed out this is not the job for.. & we can never go a day without running out of food that we have on the menu to offer to our customers..... And last but not least there is mold in the kitchen"
bad,"management doesnt really care what you do, pretty much just like to get loud. they cut hours for people who dont bend over backwards for them. decent place if you have nothing else"
bad,They do not allow breaks if you have any tables. If you have worked for 5-8 hours they won't allow you to even sit down you always have to be up doing something! Even around lunch time you'll be lucky to get to eat!
bad,"they run you into the ground, and even though they pay well compared to other restaurants, this is for a reason.  Its honestly one of the worst jobs i ever had....STAY AWAY."
bad,"Managers will work you non stop. You will not get your two 10 minutes breaks and most of the time you won't get your lunch break either. They always want you to work doubles too. I almost passed out a couple of times from working 10 hours or more without a lunch break. Sometimes on a holiday or on a Sunday one of the managers would lock the bathrooms because he wanted us either working in the kitchen non stop or working tables. The managers are hateful and very cocky. The corporate office might be all good but what goes on in this local cracker barrell is awful. They should really go undercover and see for them selves. I talk to a girl that was a cook thier one year ago. I ask her if they were still running it like that.She said ""yeah thats why i quit too.They wouldnt let me stop and eat. I was getting so sick from not eating."""
bad,"Cracker Barrel has to be the worse place to be employed. I did learn very good communication and people skills there as my first job, but the management was very poor. They did not provide lunch or breaks. I always dreaded going into work there. A typical day at work was nothing but drama and short staff/"
bad,"Cracker barrel is like an STD that keeps pulling you back in and expects you to do all the work for $2.13 an hour. I learned a valuable lesson there, that I did not want to do this job the rest of my life and needed an education."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,The Lithia Springs Cracker barrel is the worst the management is horrible this is my part time job and they get upset because i can't work all the time
bad,"I started working there as a hostess late in December. I finished my first PAR training on the computer before they ever even put me on the schedule. But it took three months for me to get promoted to PAR 1. And my pay raise was late. Here it is mid-May and I still don't have PAR 2, meanwhile I've already finished my PAR 3 training. The managers are immature and fake. They used to schedule me for at least 15 hours/week and I was making good money for a high school student. But the week before last I only got two shifts that were less than three hours. This week I got one shift, less than three hour long. My schedule came out for this upcoming week and guess what lol I HAVE NO SHIFTS. I've talking to management about this SEVERAL TIMES and they always act surprised but they dont do sh** but make it worse! F*** Cracker Barrel. I'll be quitting this afternoon when I get out of school!"
bad,"I only worked at this place for a few months in which I thought I was going to be going from Rising Star to being having my first star and name on the apron and be there longer than I was.. Yet I was completely wrong. They hired me before they hired the seasonal help for Christmas and I found out that the seasonal help was going to get their stars and aprons and I wasnt because of some incident that happened with the discrict manager of retail; (she is very strict and doesnt like jokes at all; even good funny ones she doesnt like period.) so basically I went from being regular to seasonal because of the DM not liking me she wanted me gone. She got her wish; I would not tell anyone to work here because not only do they play favorites but also management talks about you behind your back, dont give you any breaks unless you are a server or someone of the kitchen, plus they watch you for any faults that they can pin on you as well."
bad,"Servers that have been there for awhile go above and beyond to try and get new hires to quit. Management favors the ""pretty girls"" and enjoys mocking and embarrassing people for mistakes and fail to stand for the qualities that made this company appealing. Shifts are short with too many servers on the floor so when you get cut your lucky if you've made anything. Money shifts are only given to long term employees."
bad,unsupportive framework. Stagnant educational theories in use. Meets the bare basics of education. Minimal differentiated teaching despite a diverse student body.
bad,"Very horrible company, unclean, everything, I cleaned for hours on just the bathrooms, and dining rooms just for it too look nice. I also was to seat people and give them there menus."
bad,"Unorganized, dysfunctional and hot.  I did not learn anything and I believe there is not room for advancement.  I did not like working for cracker barrel."
bad,"Cracker Barrel is and okay place to work, you will meet and deal with people constantly but not alot of room to grow from here"
bad,"I hated working for this company but had to to make ends meet. horrible management and staff. no team work, or sense of urgency. food was always delivered cold and late."
bad,"I was both host and server and was told by the store manager that I more than proved my work ethic over most others, but that she was not going to give me the supervisor position that was available because she didn't want to make other employees upset. Basically because other people that had been there for 15+ years wanted it, i didn't get it. point being, if you want to advance in the company, good luck doing that over the old timers."
bad,"I worked as a server and broke my foot at the job, management tells me there is nothing wrong and that they are gonna have to fake workers comp case, get to hospital and the manager at cracker barrel makes it show on workers comp where its my fault so they deny my claim"
bad,"not a good company to work for, fast paced, no team worker"
bad,It was bad. Long days with no breaks. Lots of hostility. Scheduled changes randomly without warning. Given large tasks and not enough time or help to complete them.
bad,Working here wasn't that great because of Management I know that there are going to be rules and everything but every employee deserves Respct and not to be treated wrong or spoke to like were not at work i had to deal with one of the worst Managers in my life and i had to leave because it wasn't taking care of.
bad,I really enjoyed the fast pace environment. The only thing about Cracker Barrel was the way they treated their staff. I ran successful shifts for Cracker Barrel and made sure that the guests and staff were safe and had a sanitary place to come to
bad,"Not a fun place to work, managers are not managers, they do everything but manage.  No balance of job and work.  Managers go behind others backs to get advanced, also many managers sleeping with hired help."
bad,"Degrading and verbally abusive managers. Extremely controlling environment, I was very disappointed with my employee experience. The guest and fellow coworkers are great, however the managers have a huge superiority complex."
bad,At first it seemed excellent and then the management turned.  We we treated poorly.  Their moto of pleasing people went down the tube.  I'm very disappointed with Cracker Barrel now
bad,"This store is supposed to be friendly and all about family, but management seems to think it's not. I enjoyed coming here to eat, but quit coming, because I was tired of no one smiling and looking like they actually enjoyed their job. I will just go to Decatur or Cullman from now on."
bad,"It has been a few years since I have worked there so maybe things have changed."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,this is a good company to work for but the problem is that they did not give you enough hours a week like i was promised. some of the mangers can be mean.
bad,A typical work day was busy and I truly enjoyed working with our management team and my fellow co-workers. The hardest part of the job was making sure the guests got the correct food . The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people ( our guest) and being able to provide them with great service and great food.
bad,Awful place to work. You never know when you will have to go in or how late you have to work. Management was very inappropriate.
bad,If it was possible to give this job a 0 i would. I hated it Manager was pushy and horrible. Horrible hours there rarely was a chance i got more than 4 hours. It was not worth my time nor the gas.
bad,When guests would enter the building i would ask how many people are in their party then i would go find a table that could acquire their whole group.
bad,Managers never helped only pushed. They were scared to get their hands dirty. Nothing more then what I already knew. Co workers for the most part were friendly and helped get the job done. Being by your self and you got 20 plus tickets and no one will help. Leaving to go home.
bad,"unpleasant job atmosphere, poor management. Lack of enthusiasm by management, unwillingness to help employees. Lots of high school drama, co workers not willing to help one another."
bad,I work at pit to plate on and off for 3.5 years.  I have never been treated so bad in all my life. I would never tell anyone to apply their.
bad,While I was working there one of the floor managers humiliated me in front of guests. Not very good management. Some would say they pick favorites and pick on the others. But the co-workers were great and accepting.
bad,"i worked very hard & managmet was mentally abusive, you cant play mind games & degrade your employees & expect them to work harder for you.  if you do work harder for them, they will try to turn you into their slave"
bad,This job was a complete waste of time and energy. It was just extremely cheap labor. I worked from long shifts from 3-10 or even 12am for overtime with out pay. I was paid $2.75/ hr. and no one tips. Plus and tips we did make we had to give to taxes. And there was no time for breaks since one person might be running everything while others are joking around. Plus washing dishes and cleaning the kitchen and the restaurant with heavy dishes and chairs. I only lasted a month.
bad,Highly stressful To many Chiefs not enough indians To much favortisum shown to individuals Much disrespect shown to a Great new manager
bad,"They will work you to death, good money only because of the location"
bad,"I worked here as a cook. They only gave me 4 to 5 hours a week, that was about a $40 paycheck(which is horrible). The management was very rude and unprofessional. The only time they had me working was to clean friers, stock food, and sweep floors( I might as well have been a janitor). My first day there i seen the manager sneeze in somebody's food. They told me its not required to were gloves. Again very rude, unprofessional, lazy and disrespectful management.(DO NOT WORK HERE IT WAS A COMPLETE WASTE OF MY TIME)...(MIGHT AS WELL DRESS UP IN A MONKEY SUIT AND HAVE PEOPLE THROW PENNIES AT YOU)"
bad,The managers talk down to the employees if they get sick and can't make it to work. If you have family with medical issues and that causes you to miss work they will tell you that you need to get your family healthy as if you can control things like kidney stones or unforeseeable issues with your wife's pregnancy. If you have doctors note for days you missed they don't care they will still write you up and fire you. I don't reccomend anyone with a family to work for them.
bad,"I washed dishes, took out the trash and that's pretty much all that I did there"
bad,Should never work there. The company is not set up for workers it is set up for u  to fail.
bad,"Crazy workplace."
bad,"I worked at Cracker Barrel for over three years, I am someone who once having a job, keeps it even if I do not like the job very much. I very much enjoyed serving people and being a waitress, you meet very interesting characters and learn things. But the environment in the back of the house was terrible. Always people yelling, screaming and arguing. The managers play favorites and if you're not one of them, you suffer."
bad,"I loved the people and staff at Kmart but i did not like a couple of managers and the hours. There was never any room for advancement, it was always more responsibilities but no more money."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"It is all about seniority there, employees are not on a level work basis."
bad,"This is by far the worst job I have EVER had. Our management team is terrible and they treat the employees really bad. There is no respect within the workplace, and no one values your opinion."
bad,"filing and administrative work. Answering multi-line telephone systems, helping patients with paperwork"
bad,Always seting they cheat on clients and they dnt have any stabililty for thier employess
bad,I was not cut out to be a server/waiter. It wasn't for me. I was overwhelmed and I would get frustrated when the people didn't leave good tips.
bad,This job was very stressful because the management was run very poorly. My typical work day consisted of doing the normal hostess duties.
bad,"My employment at Cracker Barrel has not been an enjoyable experience. Their standards are not attainable, yet are expected to be met. The position I was in required me to pick up the slack for everyone else's laziness and I was held accountable for my co-workers' shortcomings."
bad,"This was the worst Cracker Barrell location to work at. Drugs are trafficked In and out of there. The management system is a joke. They are all so rude and if you don’t kiss tail in there you will never make it. They make the actual good people pick up the slack for their favorites, and stay late. The kitchen and serving area is filthy, I would never eat at that location again. The cracker barrell system and food is great, but this location is horrible. The place just needs to be shut down and rehire a completely new staff."
bad,"Sorry, management was bad, they were very unprofessional and immature. It’s a good job for a short time period but to receive good benefits you will have to work for a year. You will have good hours one week and no hours the next. Management needs help"
bad,I was fired for no reason and therefore I did receive unemployment. I worked there for eight years as an associate manager but was never given the opportunity to become a Senior associate manager which allows you to apply for a GM spot. It is politics and a good boys club. 50+ hours was required.
bad,"A very taxing and demanding work environment. A lotto expectations are put on the employees with very little compensation. The managers are not very understanding of one's outside life especially if you are a college student, they expect your life to revolve around the restaurant."
bad,"i began working at cracker barrel as a host. they hired a bunch of new ones who were just horrible & would be so rude to other employees. i am the person who sticks up for myself so it really just made it worse. they started threatening me constantly & would never leave me alone. i didn’t want to go to managers about it bc i was scared bc they were never the nicest. i tried to hang in two weeks notices four times and each time they’d try and talk me out of it and my anxiety was too much to stick my ground so i just kept caving in. my other coworkers began seeing it happen and they went to the mangers about it. they called me in the office, i showed all the messages and things i was getting sent. they did absolutely nothing about it and it continued to happen. i told them once again i would leave and they offered to cross train me as a server so i wouldn’t leave bc i was a “valuable asset” (this gets funny later on) and it took them about two months to ever actually hold up their end of the deal. on my last day working, i ran out of gas and was stuck on the road for literally my entire shift bc my parents were out of town and everyone else i knew was at work. i called atleast 15 times to try and get in touch to let them know what was happening & each time i’d sit on hold and no one would pick up. that same day, they removed me from the schedule. i was never formally fired or told anything to about me not working anymore. but honestly, it was the best thing that could’ve happened. but now, everytime i apply for a new job, the managers give them a horrible review on me so i have"
bad,There is never incentive to stay.  They claim advancement opportunities but do not give opportunities for 15-25 years. They claim to work with you schedule but refuse to when schedule is given.
bad,Restaurants can be an awesome place to get good money in ur pocket everyday. Except when you work for a company where the grill cooks don't want to do their job. Managers don't want to manage!
bad,"While not all Cracker Barrel’s are created equal, the one I worked at was a train wreck. The management was insane, one of the managers was caught stealing tea bags and doing cocaine in the bathroom."
bad,"They really not worth it, they don’t care anything about there employees..... they will make up anything to fire you.....so please don’t waste your time applying."
bad,"For the last five years, I have had alot of positive and negative experiences working at Cracker Barrel. There are some nights I have made a little more money,  and other times I didn't."
bad,No matter how long you work to Cracker Barrel they would expect you to train new people and then give them the good sections they did not care about any of the people I Cracker Barrel
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"Over worked under paid.."
bad,I was let go from Cracker Barrel for something alleged. I worked there 5 1/2 years. Never called off. Always came in when asked. Stepped up to do jobs I wasn’t hired for. Out of the blue I get let go for alleged allegations
bad,"Management team, and district manager are a complete joke. There are literally 0 rules you have to follow until the dm shows up. Then it’s all some play pretend nonsense."
bad,"Most co workers are great. I looked forward to working with them as a team. I miss plenty that have moved on. I've worked as a hostess and Server in California "
bad,"My experience working at a Cracker Barrel was absolutely terrible. I can’t speak for other locations, but my managers constantly put me in uncomfortable situations and tried to cheat me out of a fair salary."
bad,I have seen too many things that would be breaking rules or even laws. I had a medical note to have a sit down break for 10 minutes every 2 hours. I had to fight for this break all the time. I know many people that were told by their doctor that they need to take time off of work and they would not give that to them. I have seen a manager less than a foot away from a waitress yelling in her face about silverware. I have seen waitresses not use gloves when they are supposed to and managers see this and do nothing.
bad,Cracker Barrel preaches black and white rules but ignores the gray area needed to survive. They overwork there managers and show zero appreciation. New rollouts are not shared with anyone below an GM status but execution is demanded.
bad,"I wondered why Cracker Barrel was constantly hiring, come to find out they have a horrible turnover rate. At first I didn’t understand why. Maybe a bad area? Not the right people? Oh boy, was I wrong. From the start, I noticed how awfully unorganized the entire establishment was. Their trainers weren’t trained to teach new hires and weren’t even informed beforehand that they’d be training until the minute of and always looked so unhappy to be training you. The entire work environment was SO hostile and uncomfortable to be in. They’ll tell you as a new hire or a “rising star”, you cannot do certain things so you won’t be trained for them (such as answering the to-go phone) then you’ll get yelled at for not answering the to-go phone. Then once you do answer it, you’ll get yelled at for doing it wrong. Makes sense, right? Their uniform is the standard natural hair color, no facial piercings, only one ear piercing per ear, no long/acrylic nails. However, they love to choose favorites. Someone else may be allowed any of the above, but if they don’t like you, they pick out every little thing wrong with your uniform. Fellow employees there are judgmental, rude, and have 0 sense of teamwork. I never thought it was possible to have a job so uncomfortable and hostile to be at that I cared more about going home than making money. They treat new employees with little to no respect at all. I will never recommend this job to anybody. Ever."
bad,"other than working with terrific people, Cracker Barrel as a whole was and still is the worst place I've ever worked. under payed, over worked and completely inconsiderate of your life outside of their walls."
bad,Don't waste your time trying to advance with this company was there for 12 and 1/2 years shift leader for four and a half years and still couldn't get into management even with multiple employee of the month Awards
bad,"This company is, really and truly, a joke. The pay is sub-par at best, the hours are awful, management is disorganized and rude, and the overall work environment is pathetic. "
bad,"The place was run by reverse racism. If you were white, you went nowhere because we were told we didn’t “meet their agenda.” Was made to drive N hour from home every day each way on top of working. 12-14 hour day."
bad,Everything you are told down at the home office is a lie. There is no quality of life as a manager. You are expected to work positions to make labor. No career advancement. Can be fired if an employee makes up accusations about you even if there is no proof. Required to go in on your days off if there is a meeting. Decent pay but not worth all the hassle
bad,"This is one of the most horrible places that I have ever worked and I've been a waitress for more than ten years. You get no breaks, and if for some strange reason you do, you are not allowed to leave the building. It's like stepping into a prison. You have to carry a beverage tray at all times even if your not carrying anything. And sidework is out of control because they are too cheap to hire busters, so expect to do it all yourself.  And if you love to get 3rd degree burns on your arms and treated like a slave, because your not allowed talk to co workers then this is the place for you. They leave the food that's ready to go out in the window on the trays ,so you cant even carry them without getting burns on your arms!! Oh and dont expect to carry the trays in a logical manner noo, you have to carry them in front of you at waist level. So if you ever see that a Cracker Barrel  is hiring , no matter how desperate you are run for the hills,its not worth you time,or the money,or health,or sanity. Just some friendly advice from a previous employee."
bad,When I worked at cracker barrel in sanford no one did there job there and I was always getting blamed for everything my coworkers started to lie about me saying I was being racist and I started to lose hours
bad,"Thought I would get at least 30 hours a week, but only got more than 20 hours in the 4 months I worked there. Never had a same schedule week to week. Had shifty as short as 2-1/2 hours. Several times I was on way to work and would get call to come in an hour later. Was treated with no respect."
bad,"Very bad management in Retail Sales, Extremely high turnover in all employment areas even management, Horrible attitude from management in Retail Sales (everyday) such as do everything my way or you can and will be replaced immediately.  Very stressful working conditions. Great guest (customers), Great Store, Beautiful inventory, Great prices, Extremely good food. The store was great but the management was bad. Other Cracker Barrel stores may be great just not the one I worked in. All employees pretty well felt the same way I did about the employment in that store.I would not feel comfortable recommending anyone for employment in that Cracker Barrel. Please do not post this anywhere for the concerns for myself."
bad,"I don’t recommend working here if you’re a minor. You’re only able to work 4.5 hours and if you’re a server you don’t always make enough for expenses. Hours were not flexible, I am still a high school student and was scheduled from 9-12 on a Monday morning after putting in a new availability sheet."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"I worked at this pathetic excuse of a company for 4-5 years. It startex out okay and then everythong changed. It went straight to garbage. I ended up going nowhere, teaching myself how to do nearly everything, and being harrased by management to the point where they were hoping to get rid of me if they pushed hard enough. I would work long hrs, had no social or private live, and be at work sometime from open to close. If I got overtime it would ve met with drastically cut hours and me struggling to pay bills and make bologna. The management there is such a joke anymore it's not even worth my time to even call back and request that I get my job back I've got another job now and I'm much happier there but my time there was a living Nightmare and I will never work for Cracker Barrel again."
bad,"I have worked for two locations of Cracker Barrel.  NC and the most recent Wesley Chapel, Fl.  I will never go back because of Wesley Chapel."
bad,This job is good for a first time job and for people looking for experience but I wouldn't stay there much longer after i got experience. Id say after some time there look for something that has a higher status.
bad,"If I could give this company 0 stars, I would have. Management is about as good as the dust on the decorations. Customers were great but nobody likes it or tries to make it a fun or easy place to work. Company lies about nearly everything. So glad I left when I could."
bad,"I believe Cracker Barrel is a very good place to EAT but NOT work. I would not reccomend employing with this company unless you like snobs, jerks and tweakers around you every day"
bad,"I stuck it out in hope of improvement for 3 years, no such luck. No raise yearly as promised or Parr raises. They do not care about your availability and will punish you if you can't bend to what they want you to work and try to force you to stay well past your end of shift. They allow chosen few to not do their work or complete it and expect others to take up the slack. They change your schedule and not let your know. All Managers don't care about the condition of the store or employees, Except, for the one male manager. They belittle and talk down about employees to other employee, And only care about how to make money without lifting a finger. They also wait until the health department or Corporate visits to do the correct way and company policies. There is little to no Training and a person has to venture out and collect information to know how to do the job, from other employees. The Management have bad attitudes most of the time and talk to the employees like trash, with off color comments. If you get hired- Good luck."
bad,"Manager told me I stunk(and we're in a hot kitchen), overworked, hours were never correct, poor team leadership, once again way too much work. The company treats employees as replaceable. Managers whined regularly about not receiving promotions. The list goes on and on."
bad,"Was treated ok to start, then when I got injured as a dishwasher and I told the management about the soap irritating my skin they wouldn't get another type of soap so it wouldn't irritate anyone's skin. I even tried industrial strength gloves to stop the irritation, but didn't help. I was out three weeks without workman's compensation for the time out. It destroyed the gloves within 2 days. I still have them.  When I returned to work they tried me as stacker of plate ware, but I noticed I was still getting a rash from the soap.  While I worked there the waitresses would constantly ask me for silverware and I told them that they had to be washed twice through the dishwasher.  They would take the silverware out of the bins to be rewashed to serve to the customer.  This place is not managed correctly and I will not recommend anyone going there to that particular Cracker Barrel in Stevensville, Md."
bad,"The fast paced environment made the days go by fast, but due to poor management my typical work day was 12-14 hours long with a one hour lunch. When getting home I was exhausted I did not have the time or the energy to do anything else in my days or days off, such as clean, cook, pay bills, grocery shop, etc. The amount of time and energy I dedicated to Cracker Barrel seemed to go unnoticed."
bad,"The GM's are overworked, overwhelmed and under trained.  Their skill levels don't meet the demands of such a multi-functional work place.  The employees, at least the ones at the stores closest to the city, mostly have bad work ethics and are some of the worst staff members EVER with nasty attitudes and talk to the managers very inappropriately and nasty."
bad,"Worked fingers to the bone and got no where, complete waste of my time. Nightmare of a company GM/District managers only one making money...Insane business model to keep hiring staff when your fully staffed..absolute nightmare...food is terrible also high fat content and is what is making America obese!"
bad,Working here spiked my anxiety. I would get yelled at daily for simply doing my job by the staff. I was also accused of favoritism and working agents some staff when I have just done what my job stated me to do.
bad,"I worked in re tail, and cashier. Loved interaction with 'll people! We a server as well. over daily cash money! Management defiantly not the best! Sad for that"
bad,Felt like a slave working there. Had someone break into my car and the manager did not cooporate with the police to give video of the incident. Does not work together and managers were sleeping with employees.
bad,The retail manager is awful and criticizes everything that you do. She is so rude and disrespectful. I couldn't stand working there (in the retail store).
bad,"Every day at work up until the most recent, it was a friendly enviroment. however my manager went to me, as the GM, and i asked if i could take home the new apron they had for me in the back, she asked for my phone for some reason, and i felt if i didnt hand her the phone for some reason, i would get fired. She took the phone and said i wouldnt leave without the phone, so i wont leave without the apron. later on that evening i walked out of the resturant with phone in hand, and we wrote a letter to the main office about it. If you think to apply there, keep in mind, they sell the job very very well. but it is more like a trap in the long run after 6-8 months of working there, if you dont stand up for yourself, you will be taken advantage of."
bad,"The employees were rather gossipy. Instead of pulling employees aside and attempting to fix issues with gossip or anything else, they just cut your hours down to zero and leave it until you are removed from the system as an employee."
bad,"Indeed will not let me post my actual review because it was considered slander against Cracker Barrel. In short, all employees were mistreated, and I would not wish such employment on anybody. Look elsewhere."
bad,"Theres never enough people in the dishroom, Its always stressfull you never get a break and the managers never come back to help you. It could be just one or two of you washing and cooks or other workers always have something to yell at you about regaurdless if you could control it, theres always 4 or more managers working and all they do is walk around and ask if your okay they dont bother to pick up the slack, co workers are extremely rude especially when you have to put things away, often found myself screaming at other co workers for them to get out of the way. Nobody cares about the dishwashers they are treated poorly and get absolutely no respect from anyone here. Would not recommend working here."
bad,"stressful work place at all times"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,The management isn't what it should be a lot of personal vindications that prevent a good work environment. Mostly the restaurant is overstaffed for how slow it is on most days. Obvious favoritism from managers.
bad,If you want hours dont work here it just that simple! Youll be lucky to get 20 hours a week.. If go to management and say something about it they will threaten to fire you.. Good luck...
bad,A typical day at work consisted of constant verbal abuse from management and seasoned employees. You should always assume that during every shift you will be doing your job and probably 3 other peoples at the same time. Always understaffed and never treated well.
bad,"They give you no hours, if a manager doesn't like you they don't schedule you any hours. I've been scheduled 4 times a month for the last 2 months just about, They're not really willing to work with schedules, and it is very unorganized to work there."
bad,"As A Hostess You Have To Seat People, Clean Tables, Make Sure Correct Boards Are Up, Change Menus, Stock Silverware. Management Wasn't Good, Sometimes Messed Things Up That We As A Host/Hostess Could've Handled."
bad,The stores only have two prep cooks at a time which means you work night shift day shift and two all day shifts in one week. I don't believe this company believes in breaks unless you are a server who smokes or work an 11 hour shift. You get a ridiculous list of things to be completed by lunch time. If you like to be underpaid and overworked this job is for you.
bad,"Worked 15 whole hours once and only got one 10 minute break. Servers very unprofessional, management very unorganized. Servers/all other employees steal product, great place to get experience in a busy restaurant, good tips if you're a server."
bad,My experience is this place is not a good place to work at. Everybody there has attitude problems and they lie to you. I had my evaluation on the 1st of the month and was guaranteed my raise be effective the following day which didn't happen took them almost a month to get me my raise. Was also promised to move up to grill cook but that never happened either. Just an all around bad place to work at. If you enjoy working with lazy people and doing the job of at least 2 people and only getting paid for one person then go ahead and if you also like working with nasty people with bad attitudes then hey go for it.
bad,This place is okay for a Part-time high school job but there are much better options available. Cracker Barrel's retail management sucks the life and enjoyment out of working.
bad,"I was a hostess. I was told I would get two days of training, but only got one. I was trained on a Sunday, which is the busiest day. After that, I was given a 6 hour shift by myself, again, on a Sunday. I would not recommend working there (as a host anyways)."
bad,"Not a good place to work. I hated the hours, the management the customers, basically everything. I needed to move to a place with better people and better pay."
bad,"This restaurant is absolutely terrible the management is terrible the servers short of a few are also terrible and some of the laziest workers I've ever worked with. Management is not hands one chased me around the whole restaurant when I was busy asking me to pick up a cup instead of just grabbing it himself..... there is no disciplinery action for anything which I can assume is what makes everyone so lazy. If someone is repeatedly asked to do a task and they don't there is no repercussions for their actions and they are never told firmly to do something just asked ""nicely"" which of course people never take seriously. Servers are given 3 table sections and somehow are still too busy to run food or do anything for that matter.   Even take the extra 3 seconds to scrape trash off a plate to help out the people in the dish pit who have to sort through all the trash on top of washing dishes then are proceeded to get scolded by management for not being fast enough cleaning the dishes.. not the servers who are to lazy to lift a finger to help them out when washing dishes is by far the worst job one can have In a restaurant. I took it upon myself to step up and help them out on top of running trays for other servers and then why my food would come up Id get scolded for grabbing it knowing that if I didn't it would die in the window. I would also tell people firmly to step up and do their job, all of the shifts I picked up to help the restaurant out, helping out in the dish pit and running everyone else's food was completely overlooked by management and I was fired for what? Occasionally"
bad,Management treats people like dirt.  employees are overworked with no family balance.  If you need time off your not likely get it.  Management will lie to you to get what they want.
bad,"Greeting customers and trying to sell products, it was a fun place to work at I have developed personal growth there at cracker barrel."
bad,I can not say anything but just cry. The hardest part of the job was trying to get past the servers with dirty dishes and they would not let me pass by to the dish room to get the dishes clean and then things started to get behind in the dish room.
bad,"I was a dishwasher and my consisted of hard work at a fast pace. I the importance of teamwork. my mangers were up front from the beginning and respectful. My co-workers were friendly and hardworking. The hardest part of that job was working in the dish room, when we were short staffed. the most enjoyable part of that job was the food, and interacting with co-workers."
bad,"The hardest part about working for this employer was the total lack of faith in the hiring agreement.  Pay was wrong from week 1, hours were never as agreed upon in hiring process and going up the chain of command fixed nothing, it only made things worse."
bad,"Co-workers are great. Managment works with your schedule, only after a few weeks of messing it up and not wanting to grant requests. Management is extremely rude, unprofessional, and uncaring. They don't like to be bothered, especially when they are sitting down eating, for the 3rd time during their shift. Employees are not allotted breaks, for food or personal reasons. I would never recommend a friend or family member to work here."
bad,in 2 and a half years the values I know to be what cracker Barrel wants to represent have vanished unless you suck up to the management team you are treated like some lazy person no matter how well you do your job
bad,This place will work you over 60 hours a week when they need you and the minute you need them they cut you to 10 hours a week. I have seek employees that have worked for cracker barrel for over 20 years be droped like it was no big deal. The food uality is horrible the work atmosphere is even worse managers screaming in your face and talking to you about another employee. My co workers were the best people I had ever worked for but the place was poorly managed and they do not like to promote from within.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,The company Needs a whole new management team Overall. Levels of maturity not there. Management's discourage working for establishment...not well mannered
bad,if i could i would give negative 5 star to them. reason for this is that i felt like management didn't care much for dish team and had trouble where i felt like i was being miss treated by a person on my dish team told manager and they did next to nothing about it.
bad,"Most retail and waitresses were great to work with. The real problem are the managers. Disrespectful,dishonest,and rude to employees. And to up and change work schedule after its posted and not bothering to ask people. Have to say in my 30 + years of working this place was in top 3 worse. Would not recommend anyone to work at cracker barrel"
bad,Management picks and chooses!! Non flexible schedules even when you tell them. Scheduling so called manager hates women.. Especially me!! No hours practically and its not my work performance. Discriminates and retaliates thru schedule. Worse job in my life!! Hate it
bad,"First thing's first, at Cracker Barrel as a dishwasher, you have no choice over basically anything. The managers decide your hours, breaks, and even when you get off so the schedule doesn't even matter. The workplace culture is horrendous, you're basically in a hot humid area running all around all day burning your hands and if you're not used to yelling everything, you'll have an awful time. The only real good things were getting a half-off meal discount while working there as well as the pretty good pay at $9.25/hr with regular reviews and raises. If you really want to work for this company, I highly recommend going in as a server or retail."
bad,I was released on my day because I accepted a shift in the blind.. I wasn't told about the itenerary for that night until I arrived. It was a two man job I made the attempt for two and a half hours straight couldn't complete the the task. And I was therefore released or terminated. Unfair completely.
bad,I works there for 2 years as a cashier it was horrible! I could never get hours. I was pregnant standing on my feet for hours in 1 spot to get people in and out as quickly possible I asked for 2 min a manager would take my place at the register so I could use the bathroom and I had to wait 45 min before anyone came to relieve me.  There is no such thing as a break or a lunch and the managerswillwothtalk about you ind ypur back with the other staff including the waitress and or waiters. It is not a hard job it is a very stressful environment and I would not recommend anyone work there!!!!!
bad,"Awful management  scheduling did not work with my schooling  "
bad,It was a bad place to work and never got hours. I liked the people I worked with but the managers were mean. Pay was ok I guess. No training was given to me for host.
bad,Managers show favoritism and discuss other employees personal business with everyone. If you work hard then you get to work double shifts and 10-12 hours on the weekends during peak season while the slackers do nothing and get promoted to trainers. I wasted a year there hoping it would get better but it didn’t.
bad,"You would walk into work and would be greeted, Then go to the kitchen to clock in and there was clutter, people everywhere. nobody used excuse me, It was chaos. I personally do not recommend working at cracker barrel."
bad,"The management at this location keeps you on edge, some managers more than others. Management definitely needs some work, especially in the area of communication. There are some cooks here who will freak out and scream at you if they claim to see someone (even if it wasn't you) on their phone, then they go on a loud rant about how they work harder than everyone else there. If you work in the evenings during the week, you will have to buss your own tables. Otherwise, there's a busser who can help, but not all the time."
bad,Lack of management support...stressful work environment...no appreciation of a job well done.. I show up every day on time I do my job to the best of my ability
bad,"No breaks, long hours, rude customers, not making enough money, managers blame servers for everything, don't care about employees, trashy co-workers, dirty kitchen, ridiculous uniforms you must buy, always short staffed, work two hours longer on side work, roll massive silverware."
bad,I enjoyed the work for about 2-3 weeks but after that the favoritism showed for certain managers. I was always given more work than I could handle and then reprimanded when unable to complete everything. I started to slake more in my work because I was tired of getting yelled at for every thing when it was out of my control. More than half of my co workers were unreliable and could get away with constant smoke and bathroom breaks. Some of the other employees weren't horrible and I made a couple of decent work friends but nothing memorable. And don't get used to days off because they will almost always call you in to cover someone's shift. Having worked here has made me vow to never work in a restaurant again.
bad,Cracker Barrel is constantly hiring new employees with out making sure older employees who have been with them for years have enough hours themselves. They also are not willing to work with changing availability questioning why or why not you are no longer available. Even when it’s because of taking care of your family.
bad,Can't keep people their.Been going threw a lot of Manger's they r lazy.They don't know what there doing.Am looking for another job.i ask for supplies and never get it.know floor soap for 2 week's.Very sad.
bad,The condition of the store were poorly managed by managers who were out for themselves. The store needed and still needs renovation to the building and new equipment. The treatment of employees were harsh most of the time with no real support on employee relations. Managers acted like regular employees and at times employees had to act like management.
bad,Dont  its very bad especially the GM he don't know nothing he want to be right at any means the place isnt right don't respect the good workers everything is such a cover up just to get by they treat us like dump
bad,"Want to get tested like trash? Then work at a Cracker Barrel. On multiple occasions I’ve been called a bad server or a disappointment by management. They also quite enjoy humiliating you in front of everyone. For them, It’s Cracker Barrel and Cracker Barrel only. They do not care about their employees and their life outside of work. Once had a manager ask me “do you even have enough money to eat here” and snicker about it. The absolute worst working environment. Do not work here."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"They don’t care about anything going on in your life. My father had a stroke while I was at work, mother called me on the phone I went into the restroom to answer ( it was slow I hadn’t sat anyone in 20-30 min) I told my manger I needed to leave that my best friend who also worked there would be able to cover me for the 2 hours I had left of my shift. He got mad at me that my mother called my personal phone and not my work itself and told me if I left I wouldn’t be welcomed back ."
bad,They will try and give you hours that you never were warned about and they will change your hours without telling you if they are struggling. Wouldn’t recommend as a main job
bad,They say they care about the employee experience as much or even more then the guest one. Don’t believe it. They work you to death. If you’re sick doesn’t matter they still want you there to work. Overall run away from this company!
bad,"Borderline racism and favoritism. Revolving door of new managers because the managers they hire either do not know how to manage and the let the employees get away with so much nonsense or they're the biggest creeps who try to sleep with the servers. This may not be for every cracker barrel but at least the two locations I personally worked for. Every work place has its ""Drama"" from time to time, we are all human but it becomes ridiculous when the managers are also intertwined with the servers personal lives and it is completely unprofessional. Managers sometimes would not want to be bothered with guest issues but instead sit in the office and do nothing. You almost never get off work on time and you are forced to deal with situations that are above your pay grade because the manager(s) on duty is/are incompetent. No support system. No real functioning ""system"" of any kind."
bad,Terrible company to manage for! They treat their people like garbage and expect the world from them. The productivity expectations are far beyond obtainable. Hourly employees are paid very poorly with grueling schedules for BOH and always understaffed. Cause you can't treat people that poorly and keep them. Retail and host Pur company standard are only scheduled two and three hour shifts. Expected to show up with ironed starched uniforms and work 3 hour shifts making like $8 an hour.
bad,"Wound up getting tables stolen repeatedly by one waitress, management refused to do anything because he didn't want to offend the waitress of color for fear of lawsuit. "
bad,"I would give Cracker Barrel a very poor review after working there. Many of the managers have alcohol/substance abuse problems that they will often inappropriately discuss with employees. Managers are nowhere to be found when there is a problem with the guests and they don't have a care in the world for your availability and expect you to just figure it out whether it intereferes with child care, school, etc. With those obstacles the managers will still give you grief for trading shifts when you have to."
bad,"They were so bad at keeping employees, they had to have managers from OTHER stores come in to help run the place until they could find permanent solutions. No buzzers as all of them quit, only two hosts because the rest quit, very little servers. It was awful. Then, I didn’t get paid for a month straight. Each paycheck that never came, they would just say they had no clue where it was. They said they couldn’t help. I wasn’t the only one to not receive any money. You weren’t allowed breaks or anything to drink. I was trained in completely different ways by different people. It was a mess."
bad,Horrible place for work management does not care for their employees they will work you to the bone I don’t recommend working for this company unless you want to burn yourself out
bad,"Do not work here unless your desperate for money, management does not care about you, co workers are very bossy and think they are management, this place is not professional or clean"
bad,I did not like crackerbarrel. The manager was rude and didn't treat us as people she's treats us a employees and that's it. They never ask the employee s how things might need to change and they are always getting on to us about something that was their fault and we're trying our hardest.
bad,"terrible place to work"
bad,"I was stoked to work there until I started and they gave me nothing but complications and excuse when it came to getting my proof of employment form in for my health insurance company and weren't understanding with the fact I had no money to but new non-slip shoes from Payless or a dang pastel polo button up because I was literally broker then broke, hence the reason for the job in the first place! Sadly it's rare to be able to chat with anyone because 90% of the people who come through are rude or disrespectful.. Unfortunately I don't have many good things to say about this specific Cracker Barrel beside it smells nice lol"
bad,"Management is very unprofessional, even upper management, unorganized, company does not care very much for their employees only really about their profits, they say flexible scheduling but it for sure isnt, Managers play favortism."
bad,cracker barrel is a very unfair place to work at I've been working there for a year now and I'm par 3 they just hired a new guy to be doing my job and he's already getting paid more than me and he still par 1 I do not recommend this job for no one this job will make you lose everything if you sit around thinking that they're going to give you more hours and more money.the manager the main manager at that jokes too much and thinks everything is a joke and he's a bully when it comes to dishing out Fair hours and fair payand when you let one managing those about a problem that you have they throw it off from the other manager knowing that you're not scheduled around that time for that other manager to be there they just play ping-pong with you
bad,"The communication coming from management is nonexistent. They gradually scheduled me for fewer and fewer hours until they decided not to schedule me at all for weeks in a row, despite me speaking to multiple managers about this issue. Other employees have had the same complaints about management just refusing to speak to any of their staff, not only at my Cracker Barrel. Do not work here if you want your superiors to actually care about you at all. "
bad,"The customers treat you terribly, the management had no concept of common sense, you never clocked out on time, family emergencies mean nothing to them. No benifits until after over a year."
bad,"Cracker Barrel has poor management and organization. I only worked for a few months and had three managers due to the high turnover rates. I made no tips as servers were not required to give the host's a gratuity. Managers and servers were rude, racist, transphobic, and sexist. I was not trained, yet was penalized for having a poor understanding of my job. I was asked to stay a few minutes past the end of my shift, yet my clock out time was changed to the minute my shift was supposed to end. Additionally, I asked for unpaid leave for a total of two weeks. Because of an error, I was scheduled for two months of unpaid leave. When I called the company to fix this, I was made to wait another two weeks until I was scheduled."
bad,"Hours were inconsistent.and management was horribly lacking. Management didn't know what they were doing or seemed to not care."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,The management at Cracker Barrel is passive agressive and disresptful. I would both work here if not for the need of money. I would not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,"I've heard that other locations are very nice to work at and other Cracker Barrel's I've been a guest at have seemed impeccably run. But the Frederick Cracker Barrel is extremely cutthroat. The managers try to get their hands dirty as little as possible (which is a manger's job) which means that the ruder employees are allowed to take control of whatever they like, including choosing the best areas. There is a regular turnover because of lack of hours from the constant hiring of new people and the good workers loosing morale. There is also difficult working conditions caused by either coworkers with their own agenda, such as some that will skip work for weeks on end with no warning and be given no discipline, or the management trying to trick the system into thinking their numbers coming out better than they are. When in reality there are many issues that are made infinitely worse by the managers trying to cover them up. There are large issues such as the staffing (some downright rude) and hours (either overstaffing which leads to cut shifts, or understaffing which causes frustration in the workers and customers because of the slowness, I can only assume this is so regular because the managers are trying to be cheap.) But there are smaller issues such as cleanliness and poor food quality (its was RAW), which leads me to assume they take no pride in their store. You will also be threatened and manipulated in ways that are rarely beneficial to yourself (such as being forced to stay late if you don't fill a quota preset to an impossible number that you have on control over) sometimes"
bad,"I was injured very severely at this job and not much was done, I was expected to be back at work and on my feet which was not at all possible. I loved some of the people I worked with but over all I'm a better employee for leaving. It taught me how to appreciate calm work environments and stable management."
bad,"great co workers, but company has gotten greedy and lost focus. If you do not take care of your employees how do you expect them to take care of you. few remaining perks to working with the company its sad."
bad,"Dish washing always understaffed. You have to do on-sight online training before any promotion or raise, but they will schedule you for every hour you list available and on sight training has to be done outside of work hours. No time for a break since you're the only dishwasher on staff."
bad,"Not much more to say other than it sucked. No hours available, forced to do server assistant shifts when hired as server, never any changes made, some of the management sucked"
bad,"Not only did they mess up my pay and would not fix it, I found out later on they were paying some employees unfair amounts compared to others. That is why I left."
bad,"Cracker Barrel has lost 3 managers in 2 years and it clearly shows. I made wonderful friends out of coworkers there, but the horrible management was too much to bare. I was “punished” by calling out for a family emergency by being taken off the schedule and told I couldn’t pick up shifts. I wasn’t scheduled for a month. I had no other option but to leave."
bad,"The company shows a lot of favoritism, no team ethic, fails to give raises when deserved, etc. The management does not communicate well amongst themselves let alone with the staff. Not a great place to work and machines break down constantly."
bad,Management is totally oblivious to the way that some employees treat other employees.  I did well in my job and customers loved me.  Other employees act like it is high school or we are in the street and management acts blind to it all and when a fight occurs because someone stands up for themselves and termination is a repercussion it is the employee that loses their job due to standing up for themselves that is the one who is injusticed.
bad,"A typical day at work for me starts anywhere from 7:00AM to 9:00AM and can go till as late as closing the store past midnight. The management lacks proper planning skills, rewards the worst employees and puts the strain left by them unfairly on the other workers that do their job correctly. The management solely relies on their better workers to pick up the slack of those that refuse to do their job, and let the poor workers get away with whatever they want. I would not recommend this job to anyone that I do not hate."
bad,Very rude and snotty workers. Customers were also rude if you was new. Management would sit in the office all the time. Cooks and dish washers would look at the waitresses sexually. 1/10 in my opinion
bad,"I've worked at two different cracker barrels as a server. Management is poor, there's no stability, and numbers come first, not employees. The sidework and amount of silverware required is ridiculous for the 2.13 an hour you're paid. I don't recommend this company. They don't care about you and the management is terribly overworked and pressured from the DMs. They don't understand the concept of a life outside of work."
bad,"Lazy co-workers, and managers did nothing about it. I had to pick up the slack and do the work of 5 people, but received no additional benefits. The hard working employees are treated poorly, while the lazy ones get away with anything."
bad,"Definitely  wouldnt go back, they under payed me plus I never got a raise, they didnt wanna pay me for my paid vacation. I had to call cooperate office"
bad,"Been through about 4 managers in less than a year. None of them were any good. Most were god awful. Work life balance was non existent. Food's awful, even at 50% off on shift. Constant sanitation and health issues."
bad,Upper management is the worst! Turnover is constant! I had 4 new restaurant general managers in the 2 years I was the retail store manager. And 2 new district managers.
bad,Management was very inefficient and did not communicate well between each other and the other team members.  Bussers were not quick causing guests to become upset with hostesses and waiters.
bad,Being apart of the cracker barrel family has shown me what it truly meant to have great work ethic. I love meeting and seeing new people and to be able to go to work and know my day will be productive.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"Good food, still my favorite place to eat to this day. I hated the management and some people working there because they thought they were better then everyone else. Didn't get enough days to work and couldn't seem to get the manager to change my hours. Got two days maybe for hours a day"
bad,I worked there back in 2005 and it started off alright. Then the weekend's happen and the hostess's was over worked because of so many people came in from soccer. Then one day I kept getting asigned to work one day a week and they had 4 hostess's at one time on those days to. It was crazy on those days. When they tell you they don't need all of you and two of you can go home. All four of us would raise there hands. And I was always picked and the other person was random. There mangers always changed up from the person who hired you to who you saw on a daily shift. There didn't seem to be one real manger just three in total for some strange reason it was a total mess.
bad,was a retails sales associate. Got verbally abused by the retail manager. was treated like a child. Noone cares about you. I'm telling you they are one of the worst companies ive ever worked for.
bad,A typical day at work includes the servers yelling at the cooks. The managers do nothing but sit in the office. I have learned how a restaurant should not be ran.
bad,"Cracker Barrel is a great place. The one I worked at needs an over haul. I loved the job, just the management made it bad for me, except for three managers..They would yell and scream all the time and made it hard for the ones who was team players."
bad,as and single mom I needed to work as many hours as possible. I approach the management on the hours I was getting and they would  promise that they would work on getting me more hour and ever week i'd ask the less hours I would get. forcing me to quit working with the company.
bad,"Corpus Christi is the worst Cracker Barrel EVER.. Nader is the worst manager ever...make good tips, but the environment is horrendous ... Charging people 2.50 for a bottle of water during a water crisis... And mangers bragging about how they are making so much money..."
bad,"The only positive aspect about this job was the customers, everything else was unsettling. My managers yelled at us in front of the customers to rush them to sit down, and they didn't care about how their employees represented themselves. There was so many coworkers that had inappropriate conversations loudly in front of guests (that were sometimes children!!) and I told the managers about this issue and yet they did nothing about it. Also there was a girl that I worked with that would talk badly about the other girls that I worked with and I again presented this problem to the management, and no surprise... they did nothing again. So for all of those reasons I left and found a better job."
bad,Direct management was poor. Disrespectful and inconsiderate. Manager changes schedule on employees the day before.
bad,I do not get much hours and the pay is horrible. I am a great energetic worker.
bad,"My day at work usually starts very calm and then becomes very stressful. We are a very busy place and us cashiers have a lot to do, we have a line, we are trying to assist customers, take to go orders and have to make sure all phone calls are answered on top of that the managers don't come up when we call for them and when they are needed which makes everything a lot harder and also makes everyone get inpatient which I feel gives our company a bad reputation. The most enjoyable part of my job is the regular customers that always come in and the awesome staff we have, its like a big family or team and I like that! "
bad,Worst experience ever!!!! Long hours and treated poorly. Bad experience
bad,treat employees like cows.
bad,"I was an 8 yr employee of the company, crossed trained in every area, employee of the month, and a trainer. The hours were flexible, but the management was poor at best, the money inconsistent, never had a break in 8 yrs and often worked 10+ hours. They viewed employees as disposable. Favortism ran rampant."
bad,"Poor management, poor training"
bad,The coworkers are bad you only get 4 hour shifts at the cash register which sucks it’s not a job that pays the bills you have a better chance to doordash all day to pay bills
bad,Management is/was very rude. Would totally embarrasse employee's in front of customers. As a college student not sure if what I will pursue I would never work at Cracker Barrell again. They were very rude to am older lady who was a hostess. Dishwashers would walk out. Deidacation to the job meant nothing to mgmt.
bad,"The job is not stable and stability is so important. Especially with children, bills and the holidays. I’ve honestly never been so let down and treated so badly in my life. I’ve fallen into such a depression and am trying to pick up the pieces from what this management has done to me"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"Worst place I have ever worked. I worked in the gift shop and it was alright until I stopped answering the managers phone calls that I would receive multiple times a day on my days off and even often before coming to work. She was new at managing a retail store and didn’t know how to write a schedule so I understood. But after probably 6 months of this, I stopped coming in for her as much and stopped answering the daily phone calls as often. And this was where it went downhill. She started scheduling me on my days off even though the employees availability sheets are in the binder she uses so write the schedule.  She started being very rude to me ie she would give me jobs nobody else wanted to do or exclude me from conversation. Small petty things but still very annoying and unprofessional. But the icing on the cake was when she grabbed my arm and tried to guide me around as if I was a child because she  misinterpreted a guests needs. I’m twenty and I managed a restaurant at one point when I was 16 and I’ve had many jobs since then but I’ve never worked somewhere so demeaning. Oh and if you have paid time off, don’t even try to ask for it. They’ll just tell you for months that they’re waiting on corporate.  They won’t give it to you. I loved my job at first. But I would’ve thought that it would progressively gotten better not worse. The work is fine just some of the people there are not"
bad,"Terrible management and coworkers are rude, disorderly and never on time. Hard to thrive in this type of environment. Also, the customers make it hard to love the job. Generally you serve a large amount of elderly people whom are judgemental."
bad,The split shift are crazy.  The rudeness of the employees to each blew me away cussing each other out threw the window cook between server awful.  I've work at alot off places and this one by far had to be the worst employees I had ever worked with.  It's a job and money but a background check is it really necessary for a serving job.
bad,"Nightmarish experience.  You're either completely stressed with having to deal with far more customers than you should at the register which causes extreme stress, or you might have to clean the bathrooms (it was based on if it was your turn).  You were responsible for any mistakes you made at the register, so that's a lot of extra stress.  You had to go to orientation meetings for 1 hour every weekend as well, whether or not you were scheduled.  Had to work longer than your shift sometimes.  I really don't know why I even applied there.  The pay was less than I got at previous jobs and it was just awful."
bad,"At the location I worked, management did not know how to run their kitchen. When it was busy and the kitchen was clearly struggling, management was nowhere in sight. This was a constant battle to get the managers to actually work and help out in the areas they were needed. The kitchen itself was absolutely disgusting and some of the staff did not follow proper sanitary practices. I would see employees drop food on the ground and serve it to customers on a regular basis. The pay was below average for this type of work. You get reviews every once in a while and maybe get a 25 or 50 cent raise maybe every few months. Overall, the management was lazy, careless, and dysfunctional. The pay below average, and the kitchen full of broken equipment and very dirty."
bad,"Worked for the company for 6 years and there's a reason why they put up flyers about suicidal signs in the breakroom. Poorly managed, from not being allowed to eat for 12+ hours, to being sexually, mentally, and physically harassed by management, to being forced into free labor like handeling/ portioning food etc. Also they take a ""tip credit"" so you don't actually receive a paycheck as a server and if you cross train into other areas you're working for free"
bad,"I worked at CB for almost 2 years. I was a host, Togo person, and server. The customers were amazing and down to earth, so were the other workers. However the management was horrible. To the point where people had break downs or walked out."
bad,"I worked at Cracker Barrel for 9 months a dishwasher and it was awful. More often than not I had to work by myself because there was always someone who called off. They were hurting so much for people, they hired anyone no matter what their work ethic was or job experience. One of the managers that worked there was fired for texting a dishwasher at 3 in the morning asking ""what are you wearing?"""
bad,"Even after working here for awhile you do not get the respect or the compensation for what you deserve. Hostess are constantly doing everyone’s  jobs especially the servers job because they can not even handle having 3 tables and clean their tables at the same time. Even with there only being 2 hostess and 12 servers we are still doing their jobs including cleaning their tables, bringing out the food when it is backed up, rolling their silverware, and even taking their tables drink orders on top of all of our responsibilities. The job is stressful and I don’t not suggest working here."
bad,"Management has clear favorites anyone else is just a pawn. They try to get the most work out of you for the least pay. The job itself isn't hard as long as people do their job. But the management doesn't focus on that as long as their individual shift ""seems good"". They lack communication amongst each other and with the staff which leads to a stressful environment. The pay is one of the lowest for restaurants in the area. With at least one employee I know working for more than a decade and only making around $10 an hour. The company would rather hire 5-10 people in one position so that none of them are full time so they don't have to give benefits to any of them. But then they expect everyone to give up their time without a moment's notice. The only holiday you get off is Christmas Day and all other holidays are blacked out according to management. Most of the employees are good people who are dug in the trenches of the dredge with you and it's easy to feel like an us vs them with employees siding against the lazy management."
bad,"Good money, and co-workers are awesome. Work-life balance is extremely stressful and hard to maintain. If you have a tight schedule its hard to escape scrutinizing comments from many employees."
bad,"CRacker barrel has terrible managers, terrible and entitled customers, and bad employees. nobody listens, nobody cares. its a terrible place for teenagers to work because they give you like three hour shifts and like 8 hours a week"
bad,"If you work there be prepared for no training before they throw you into working with customers on your own. The management then expects you to know everything and for you to be able to work as quickly as everyone else. Also don’t expect for management to treat you like you have a home life. They change your hours without calling and schedules you to close and open the next day so you get less than 6 hours off. If you work retail be prepared to work the cash register, answer phones, greet people, communicate with kitchen for to go orders, clean bathrooms, and stock simultaneously."
bad,"You will never be guaranteed hours so don’t expect it. The typical workday (in the dishroom especially) will be severely understaffed. The dishroom is completely disgusting and will rarely look decent (the management will yell and bicker about how it’s not decent constantly but refuse to ever touch anything or help when you are completely backed up to no end). You will either be cut an hour after you get there or stay 3 hours past your out time. The people you work with are very interesting ranging from inappropriate mannerisms/touching to the spreading of drama continuously. You can make good friends and be on good terms with many people here but most of the time, all you will encounter is servers constantly complain about their lives and how everything sucks and they hate that they only made $200 that day while you are working $9.35 an hour and barely made $30. Expect your attitude at work to change. No matter how calm and collective you are, you will end up leaving this place yelling and upset. I highly suggest you take yourself to a different place of possible work."
bad,"Manager's and human resources are unprofessional. 30 to 50 minute tickets are commonplace somehow, the kitchen is unsanitary, and they will hire anyone which means coworker's can be very unpleasant. Also was on the verge of shutting while I was there."
bad,5+ managers and none of them are on the same page or communicate with one another. Human Resources is a joke and does not hold all perspectives of all employees to equal value. I suspect racism and gender favoritism within the ranks. Though my last GM was one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of working with in my cooking career.
bad,"Many food shelf life violations that I was not comfortable being a part of. Also OSHA violations that were not safe, ie having employees operate a gas powered pressure washer inside a closed locked building over night."
bad,"You are usually overworked, with little pay, and not very good hours at all! Even when extra hours were requested, you would be told you would receive them, yet you never would."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"The Panama City location was fantastic. There was great management, terrific team building, and great work flow. The Tallahassee location had an opposite persona. There was changing management, ignorant behavior, and it was overall a bad work environment."
bad,"Employees / managers don't care about you and complain about everything and anything. You typically get blamed for things out of your control, even if you communicate it to the management."
bad,Awful job. Terrible management. Would ask for hours and wouldn’t get any for 2 weeks. Would request off and be forced to work even after site said approved time off. Belittlement from managers and customers. Had a manager on multiple occasions disrespect me and belittle my intelligence in front of guests. Managers work you long enough that you’re there for a while but won’t give you a break. I could get paid millions and STILL wouldn’t choose to work here. Won’t even spend my money at this company after knowing how they treat workers.
bad,"I didn't work at Cracker Barrel for very long at all but the time I did work there... I hated it. I knew very soon after getting hired that this was not the job for me. I worked in the retail part of the restaurant. The RM was HORRIBLE! The way he talked to the employees there was just unacceptable to me. He spoke down to everyone and treated them like they were dumb. He was also very pushy with customers when it came to sales. Very pushy! Also, a lot of the female servers and hosts were in cliques and the environment reminded me too much of high school!"
bad,I enjoyed some of my co workers at cracker barrel but that was the extent of it. There was a big lack of communication between all of the staff at all times.  And management is very unorthodox. They don't listen to you at all .
bad,I’ve been working here and management doesn’t know how to properly treat an employee. They put you down and make you feel like dirt. The reason I’m looking for another job.
bad,"I’ve worked at this store for several years now and I’ve seen it go downhill fast. Several employees have been getting the managers personal stress taken out on them, going as far as to make other servers cry more often than should be accepted in the work place. The servers I do work with are lazy for the most part, and incredibly unknowledgeable. Our grill team is very rude to the front of house, often mocking us to our faces. The dish room can never keep up with any amount of business we have, regardless of the staff. The backup cooks are all angry and slam stuff or just don’t do their jobs. I’ve watched this company decline for the past few years and I think something should change before we lose it. We used to be the best store in cape, and now we’re a declining business with all of the wrong managers. They are unwilling to help us, instead resorting to yelling and making us work hours over our scheduled time off. Our general manager has been the root of all of our problems. Those of us to try and just want to better the company are often put down and taken for granted by the managers."
bad,"Managers pick who they want to give there hours to based on how much you are selling. You also may be cut 30 mins to an hour a day, when shifts are only 3-5 hours long. Home office has “features and benefits” witch is what you are suspose to sell to your “guest”. Your store has a certain dollar amount goal. If you meet the requirements you basically get a pat on the back and your manager gets entered to win a trip or a bonus check. Some of those things are hard to sell. not many people can spend $40 on a shirt or want to buy a $20-$30 candle, its also hard to sell candy at the cash stand to people who just ate a big meal!!!"
bad,"Although this may not be the case for other Cracker Barrels in the area, the retail manager would pick and choose the rules he wanted to follow. Every time we asked questions, he would snap at us, but how are we supposed to learn anything if we can't ask questions? He would make all of our days very uncomfortable and we felt at ease when he was off. He was also very petty and if you made a minor mistake or tried but couldn't meet his candy bar quota, he would reduce the hours to nearly nothing. Other than that, it is a great first job for someone with no experience."
bad,"The management is very uncaring, and sometimes rude. They don't understand emergencies. Breaks are very slim, if you get any. Most of the workers are not polite either."
bad,"This company leaves no room for advancement. I was told at the time I got the position (a year ago) that I’d be able to become a server working a few months. A year has now passed and after much persistence and patience I have still not been trained due to the manager’s own mistakes. I WOULD NOT recommend working for Cracker Barrel, especially if you plan on advancing throughout your career there."
bad,"Stressful environment. Only pleasant during the day, can’t work those times because a set staff is already in place. Worst mgmt. , strict, unclean, dismissive"
bad,"Customers were the only somewhat fun part about this job. I never believed in “bad” or “mean” managers until I started working here. They lead based on fear tactics, very inconsistent hours, favoritism, managers are passive aggressive, and overall just strange. I wish I could say I enjoyed working here, but it was a job I wouldn’t recommend to anyone unless you’re desperate to find something in-between jobs. Almost all employees do not like the management here. All are in competition with one another, everyone just seemed miserable and stressed out, which made the job a drag. It should have been a fun, learning experience, but it was a stressful, on-edge, environment. I can’t stress enough how odd the management was. Just degrading and fake. I wanna compare it to somewhat being “targeted” in high school. Employees that had been there for YEARS were not treated the way they deserved to be, they weren’t appreciated for their hard work, like the rest of the team as well. I made more starting out than workers who had been there for years, and that isn’t fair. Find something else!"
bad,"Cracker Barrel is a tough place to work at. They are not flexible with your work schedule and as a former college student, it was challenging to manage school and work."
bad,"When I had worked there, one of my managers was a really bad hot head. He never listened to his employees and assumed someone did something without hearing their side of the story if he didn't see or didn't know what happened."
bad,"Terrible quality of life,  you work crazy shifts and nothing ever meets their satisfaction, you give and they keep taking. Great place to eat,  but employee experience is also terrible."
bad,if you go into the retail position thinking its going to be an easy job you will soon find out that you are dead wrong.  They have so many rules + regulations to follow its insane!
bad,The Management is ridiculous here well at least at the location i worked unnecessary screaming no respect shown to employees. Your expected to do way more as a server side work takes up to 2 hours sometimes. They make it impossible to for you to receive benefits  because they cut hours.
bad,"With a staff of 120+ people, management was 0-100 and a constant headache. Working 50 hours turned into 60 or more every week, and without guidance, I was lost in the woods."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"Cracker Barrell does not care about there employees what so ever. Working double shifts with no break, they fire you for just about everything you do and are just hatefuk"
bad,"Great co-workers, but most of the mangers suck! They are rude and do not know how to talk to people. They are not good at handling situations with customers. They allow the grill cooks to talk to you any kind of way. I am always grateful for having a job but this has to be the worst one I have ever had."
bad,"Bad work life balance. You will work a close, mid, then open and if you request a weekend off you will work 9 days in a row as a punishment. "
bad,"I hated my month here. I gave them a schedule I was able to work, (no early mornings, no late nights due to the fact I lived 40 minutes away), we agreed on it, but a week in and they were already pushing it- two weeks in and they were ignoring it. Team was extremely rude. Too many hours."
bad,"I think this is a great work environment with friendly people. But it is very stressful. The managers get to stressed out over the smallest little things and then want to talk to you like your nobody. The co-workers there are great, well a tleast some of them."
bad,"They dont pay much at all, the tips are horrible, they treat their employees like dirt. They pick favorites. If you arent young and cute they wont like you."
bad,"I wasn't trained even though they advertise ""exceptional training""...so that is false. They have a PAR program, but I have par'd up and still haven't received my raise. Not a melanin friendly environment. You're supposed to get 50% off a meal to eat on break but I've never even had a break as long as I've worked here. A lot of work for retail, by yourself with no help. The pay is not good considering how much money the company makes. Your work/life balance is good because your shifts are usually not long. Also, if they don't necessarily like you, you will receive about 4 hours a week."
bad,They brag all the time about the great training program they have... I seen none of it. You just get thrown into the job and then yelled at if you did something incorrectly. I sat in the training office and listened to the head red shirt trainer talk about the idiots she has to work with and all the drama happening in the store. Really made me feel welcome to hear that on my second day. There is clearly a problem when you cant keep employees.
bad,Not easy to get along with mangment. They overwork you. They pick on you and treat you as though you are there servents. Most staff very lazy!
bad,"My typical day working at Cracker Barrel was taking phone calls, checking out our guests, greeting, and thank them for coming. At the end of every day, we would call our this woman who, I assume, runs the store. I have never met her. But we tell her about our sales in retail, and in the restaurant. "
bad,Cracker Barrel is a great company to work for!  The job has its problems just like any other job.
bad,"Very odd, all of the questions would just have to be answered very very odd."
bad,* A typical work day is a minimum of 15 hours a day and longer if you are an associate manager.  You will spend most of your time as a cook instead of a manager.  Working 6 and 7 days a week is not uncommon and are mandatory at times.  The upper leadership will tell you that you are required to work a minimum of 55 hours a week but there is no limit to the amount of hours you work over the 55.  The Company is requiring the managers to hire so many people so that the hourly employees all work an average of 20 to 25 hours a week in order for them to not qualify for benefits.  They are currently in a Proxy Fight with another Investor and the Company is on a downward spiral over it.
bad,"Worst job I ever had. Worked in Batesville, MS as Associate Mgr. GM harrassed and was horrible. No ppl skills what so ever. Sick to my stomach every day I went to work from the stress!!!!!"
bad,"I worked here for four years in just about all the positions available. I did not care for the management team. For six months before leaving I kept telling them of critical errors and things that NEEDED to be changed around the kitchen alone and I was ignored. Other cooks were serving food that was days out of expiration, lettuce that was reddish and wilted, turkey that was still raw in the center, and prep sheets-- even short ones-- were rarely completed. A change of environment and relocation to be closer to school were other reasons I left, but the horrible disragard for human safety and employee wellfare were ultimately what drove me to seek other employment in the first place."
bad,I worked for Cracker Barrel for over 3 years. I was one of the youngest trainers ever. I could do almost anything in the back. I got employee of the month and just recently when I went back to see if they would hire me back they said I was unrehirable... I was NEVER late once in 3 years and when I left I just moved to be with my husband down in Jacksonville. So clearly as you can tell they dont tell you everything... I was never talked to in the back or anything.... So somehow I went from having tons of awards to they dont want me... So I would just warn new people starting up with them... They have policies for everything and those polices change . I bent my back over to help them and they never said a word to me till now when I go in and I find out this stuff... So Id really not want to ever put any extra energy into a company that puts a knife into the backs of their employees.
bad,"Overworked, overwhelmed, petty petty rules, bad systems,  angry and lazy staff, bad food, just an unhappy staff with favorites not pulling their weightoverwhelming o"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"Management never took the time to look over work availability or time off requests. They threw away my two weeks notice and acted like it was never turned in. "
bad,Terrible place to work with terrible management unwilling to give hours unless they like you and don’t help new employees learn and everyone there smokes weed
bad,"I have worked at Cracker Barrel for 6.5yrs and towards the end (because I am currently looking for a new job) of my CB career, it has just become miserable to even show up. Nobody helps anybody else, your management can't even manage the restaurant because your GM is nowhere to be found half the time, The people you get to work next to is the ONLY good thing about that place. The customers never tip well, and it seems that managers want to ""please people"" so much that the guests come in the place and act out, just because 9/10 times, they get something for free. It's become a rotten place to work and I don't think anybody should waste their time."
bad,"Stressful during holidays, some managers are good others awful. Kept getting put on schedule for days and times I couldn’t work. Lots of side work, mostly older customers who don’t tip well."
bad,They pay will but the job is very stressful and time consuming. They don't really appreciate your work. Besides that it can be a really fun job. The training you receive is excellent.
bad,"Discounts are great but you never get a break, managers yell at you left and right. if you’re new, just figure everything out for yourself no one is going to help you. Don’t work here. Management is horrible, coworkers are okay but not the best."
bad,"Employees are not held accountable, in 1 Year we had terminated one employee. Typical Friday night you’ll have 10-20 call offs, guess who is doing all their work? "
bad,"I learned how to work with difficult management and to problem solve under extreme, stressful conditions. I learned how to anticipate the needs of customers"
bad,"When I worked there the managers were on a power trip all the time. They basically bullied their employees and we were afraid of them. Not only that, you were expected to clean all the tables, refill your entire sections salt and pepper shakers, sugar packets, sweep, do side work (for example, emptying and cleaning all the juice machines) and rolling and entire bucket of silverware before you could leave. And you had to start all that work AFTER your last costumer left or you’d get in trouble..so I’d be there an hour after my shift was over cleaning like a dog making $3 for that hour because I had no customer so no tips that hour. Cracker Barrel is a joke"
bad,"This place expects so much more from you than what you can give them."
bad,"I saw at the very least 17 people leave in the 9 months I worked as a retail sales associate here. You are expected to do things you didn't have training for, and when you ask questions, the answer might be a scoff, or a ""figure it out yourself"" even if it involves power tools."
bad,"Too many high schoolers!"
bad,"There's a reason why the manager turnover is so great. This job will suck you dry. "
bad,"Managers are childish, low tempered individuals. Many guests would call servers over to ask why the manager was screaming at the minors working in the kitchen. Food quality has gone downhill and many people have left. Managers have no compassion for their employees, especially the minors. They take advanage of the high schoolers who are working there as their first job. When you interview it’s made out to be a family and team based organization, but no one will help you with anything. Everyone screams at everyone. If you’re hardworking you will carry the store."
bad,"Get ready to work"
bad,Would not recommend working there. Pay is not competitive. no breaks or lunches are allowed. Managers not focused on operational consistency or fairness  to all employees
bad,"Not too much really to say about the company,but I can say out of my work career this was the most weirdest job  I ever bend on plus a waste let me say it., because I didn't receive  good work privileges unlike some of the workers did,wasn't being  acknowledge for my hard works like some of the other workers was."
bad,The managers are always picking and replacing workers and if they cant get some to quit they cut there hours to 40 to 6 in an instant if they feel like it.I was not put on the schedule for weeks then I logged in to check my schedule only to be told I'm terminated.just flat out fired without discussion.I called recently to get my W2 INFORMATION and I was treated so coldly that any (if at all)joy  working there was erased.They treat you like a tool and if you get hurt or are exhausted from long hours they replace you.The only thing rotten at Cracker Barrel Is the fake smiles the manager give you.DONT WORK HERE.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"Incompetent management. Minimal on-the-job training. Poor communication. Always understaffed, and you'll be overloaded with work and then get in trouble for not finishing it all."
bad,This would not be a good company to work for in my opinion. There's no room for advancement here. There's no structure or reprimands for bad behavior.
bad,"The management was not very forth-coming and I had barely any hands-on training. The expectations were set too high for the lack of help and training given. The co-workers were very unpleasant. There was no flexible schedule and it was difficult to get ahold of a manger to discuss scheduling. Overall, the guests and environment at Cracker Barrel was very nice but being a team member was not ideal."
bad,"Whole family loves CB so a brand new one opened up close by so I start working in the retail side & I haven't been able to eat at CB since quitting! Company has a ""RED SHIRT TEAM"" that travels goes to every new store opening & trains everyone for months! The word customers is not allowed it is GUESTS if your heard saying it they make u turn in a circle 3 times! They have crazy chants/songs. Have open menu counts every 2 mins! Still owed money from work. Your told one thing but mgmt does another. When they go to the bank they say going to grandmas lol.. in retail u have hourly sales & if u don't make it mgmt starts sending people home. U have to sell $300-$1000 every hour! & ive saw it done then the retail mgr gets a fat gift card for making projections. Mgmt literally yells at u through walkie talkys LOOKING FOR $400 in30 MINS!.. that red shirt team is insane literally. K I'm done lol"
bad,Cracker Barrel was an extremely stressful work environment. If sales goals were not met it was a very bad day. Management was not the best as there were several managers and they all had conflicting opinions on how the associates should behave. The entire thing was conflicting.
bad,Definitely a place where dreams go to die most people working here have multiple jobs because this isn't a career unless your manager. A lot of negative servers and negative energy and very low pay for a Hard Day's Work and unless you work on the line as a cook you will never hear a word of thanks
bad,Seriously dont work at the cracker barrel on smokey park hwy as a dishwasher especially if you are hispanic. Just dont kevin spacy type things happen there. Heed my warning and have blessed day!
bad,"I worked for the home office for 3 years moved up the ladder pretty quick.  Had to relocate, for 3 years returned to lebanon 3 years later and they would not hire me back.  Never once was i written up,given a warning etc.  If you ever leave you are never hired back.  I  also hear from friends it has become a terrible place to work."
bad,"I had deffinatly an expirence working at cracker barell. i love the food there and i enjoy being there, when im not working. working there is not fun as i thought it would be."
bad,"The job was not a problem, the authorities and how they treated their employees was awful. I absolutely do not recommend working there. Constantly being yelled at in front of guest for things i did not even do. I was bullied by other employees and I would not tolerate it."
bad,"You had set days off however if someone called in you had to go in.  Conference calls everyday about the same things, you cant improve your store or staff if your constantly on the phone and not out teaching and coaching your team. They set you up for failure."
bad,"im a dishwasher. im like the only one doing work. everyone else is doing something else. i cut myself on glass and they were ""too busy"" to help. i always have to do all the work in the dishroom. ( breakdown , dishes, send plates, put plates away) every other dishwasher is in the break room on there phones."
bad,Nasty place to work ...... wish I had never worked there..... managers and ETC are friends only to get info out of you and are very quick to spin knife in your back..... nothing more to say.......
bad,"mayberry is dead, this company is only concerned with it self, there is no work life balance, there is no quality of life for its managers. You are paid very well how ever in exchange you have no life to spend it on."
bad,"Productive work place and decdent pay . If you work a double then youll make good money. "
bad,"This was one of the worst jobs I ever had there was no support from the management team ,there was no communication  management often removed their headsets so if help was needed on the sales floor  no one would help out. Multiple Employee's in the kitchen came to work under the influence of some type of drug. the most enjoyable part of working there was walking out the door."
bad,"cracker barrel was the worst place ive ever worked very unprofecional i would never recomond anyone working there, amazing food horrible management!!!"
bad,"This company does not care about family life nor do they care about days requested for doctors app. Or family events. Money isn't everything. There was something called task reduction. When you were finished closing system at night you were required to stay another hour and half doing nothing, no matter you were required to be in 30 minutes earlier than scheduled"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,The managers are mean and bipolar when they have to work in the kitchen or do something else because the restaurant is busy. They force you to roll silverware twice even when you work 12 a 14 hours with no breaks no lunch breaks. Sometimes there is not even enough silverware to roll ( because they ask to roll a number of silverware they do not have in the entire building ) there is definitely not a single growth opportunity; the pay is pathetic and for all that overtime they make you take is not even worth it. No free meals after working extended hours.
bad,I began working at cracker barrel after losing my Post Office job to sustain myself until I moved to Colorado. I was just thankful to have a job.
bad,"Working at Cracker Barrel has taught me the value of teamwork. Our every day shift goals are to provide customer care/service to all. We have guest come in everyday from ages 1 all the way to 90 years and plus and they are all treated equally with great care and respect. We provide a listening ear, compassion and the best service we have to offer. Pleasing People, and helping people was our motto."
bad,No experience in the BOH. All new people. Management is all new and clueless. They will work you to death if you are a good worker. Poor workers get by easily. The pay is garbage too. I worked there for almost 9 years. They fired me 6 days before.
bad,"I could only force myself to stay in this position for a few months. Management was absolutely terrible. With the exception of a very few servers everyone is very rude. Its not a very nice place to work. The back kitchen area is filthy. When its time to go home and you get all your side work completed you have to find one of the managers to check over your work, which is fine, if they made it a priority, but will seriously let you stand there for 20+ minutes until they get around to doing it. Not mention, the others servers will actually steal your rolled silverware if youre not careful. It was most shocking.  Then they pat down your apron and walk you out at the end of each shift. And to top it off, I never made any money there, they would always schedule far too many servers and only give them 2-4 tables each. The General Manager seemed like a really nice guy. However, his management staff could use some serious work."
bad,"Manchester Tn. Store#3 Customers were great, servers very kind and professional. Management does not respond to WD's and bring cash for the cashiers. Retail manager is a bully as is one of the retail employees. Because of these two women, many employees seek employment elsewhere. Very unfair employee reviews due to the absence of the retail manager influenced by her bully partner. I was going to be written up for not having a button at the end of my collar. She said my hair band was too sparkly and my pony tail bow was too big.The cash registers are horrible in this store. The check readers won't read, the printers are horrible. You can barely see the ink and the cash registers are very old and slow.The environment with these two women became so stressful that I developed a horrible case of hives. Had to see a specialist and administer 4 shots a day in the stomach and take many medications. About two weeks ago I quit. Funny enough, once I quit the hives went away. Wow! Amazing! My doctor said that the hives were from stress at work. If you are looking for a job, DON'T GO TO STORE #3! It's terrible."
bad,Ive never worked anywhere where the managers were more rude and demeaning to their employees...unprofessional. They hire a bunch of employees so they dont have to give you enough hours to recieve any benefits.
bad,Management is rude and does not care about advancement of their employees. Place too much emphasis on sales than pleasing the customer.
bad,I didnt think this place was gonna be like it was. Terrible! The manager wouldnt put more hours on after i have talked to him 10 times.
bad,"Always short staffed, unprofessional management, unsafe co-workers and environment. Best part of the job would be the guests. Hardest part of the job was feeling as if you mattered. Offered healthcare but would not schedule the allotted amount of hours needed to require it. Would not keep to your availability."
bad,The managers were always nice but the kitchen work was hard and unrewarding. Not that I dislike hardwork and all but it's nice to have a sense of pride and such and it's just not there with this company.  Short hours and low pay.
bad,"The second worse company I have ever worked for. The day started and ended with rolling silverware. The hardest part of the job was being talked down to, and disrespected on a regular basis by people with little to no ability to recognize you as a human being, and being paid next to nothing for it. Or jumping through endless hoops for customers only to have them stiff you on the tip. People often talk about how if your tips don't add up to minimum wage you're supposed to be able to get it from your employer. Guess what? That NEVER happens, and I've seen several servers fired for bringing it up. You'll take that $20 for your six hour shift and keep your mouth shut, or you will get fired. The best part of the job was the people I worked with. Hard working, stressed out people whose job at the Barrel made them so cynical that absolutely everything was a fit subject for humor."
bad,"There is quality of life with this company, so prepare to give them all of your life energy."
bad,Cracker Barrel is an un-professional establishment when it comes to it's employees and therefore I consider this to simply be a job to bring in money until something better comes along.
bad,I worked here to fund my college degree. They try hard to work with me on my schedule. I have since graduated and of course looking for a position in my field of work. Cracker Barrel is a good company for a college student.
bad,"I HATED Cracker Barrel. I worked in the retail store so I'm sure the job would have been better if maybe I worked in the resturaunt part, but I'm not sure. Everyone I knew at the job also hated it. The hours SUCKED and the pay was terrible. Managers don't want to give you more hours, because they're always hiring, so hours are always going to new people. They hire new people every week. Its an ok Part Time job, but if you want money DON'T work here!"
bad,"Cracker Barrel is an ok place to work. Managers are rude, customers are the best. (Most of the time)"
bad,"Very strange environment, was harassed by managers and sexually harassed by 2 male and 1 female managers who all asked me to ""go out"" with them. The tips were very good I must say but not at all worth the drama."
bad,"I did not enjoy this at all, horrible values and managment . Never again !!!"
bad,The location that I most recently worked for was a terrible excuse for a Cracker Barrel. I worked in 4 different stores and my most recent store was the worst. The management staff was never on the same page and co-works were extremely hostile toward any changes that the company tried to enforce. There were a lot of illegal drug users who came to work while intoxicated and were not held responsible for those actions. Discrimination and the hostile environment from the management team all played a part in my leaving after ten years of dedicated employment.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"As a young college student I needed a job that I could still easily focus on my schoolwork. However, what I did not expect was to get barely 3 hours of scheduled work time a week. Most times I was not scheduled at all. It is not that dependable and the work environment in general was not great."
bad,I have never worked at a place where management teams belittle you talks down to you they panic in the busy times they offer no assistance and bring their home problems to work they also feels a little racist
bad,Cracker Barrel has people in place that still discriminate.  They work managers in every area to save labor. They treat us like slaves. You get paid a salary of 55000 but work 80 hours a week washing dishes taking out the trash closing and opening with bare staffing
bad,They don’t stick by availability changes so make sure you are very clear in the beginning. Seemed to always be short staffed and co-workers weren’t made sure to know what they were doing. Managers seemed like we weren’t important in dish room.
bad,You stand all day and most of the people there act snotty and rude . Some coworkers you can get along with most you can’t . You get treated like a child most of time .
bad,"Management is horrible. They talk to you like you are beneath them and less of a person than them."
bad,They expect way to much out of you for what you’re getting paid which if you’re a server is 2.13 I’m a great server and management has always treated me like garbage. There’s way too much drama between everyone and I highly suggest to anyone NOT to work here take it from me who has worked here for over 4 years and is absolutely miserable.
bad,"Great job for single people, but if you have a family be prepared to spend most of your time at work. Checklists for checklists for checklists, meaning finish checklist one, then follow up with checklist two, then three etc... No time to be an interactive manager with customers."
bad,It’s a great work inviroment the servers aren’t the nicest how every it is easy to ignore them. However I wasn’t given many hours and most or the workers have additudes daily
bad,"Management was lacking in communication, cohesiveness, and played favorites. One manager micromanaged to death and couldn’t get along with another one, they were always in deisagreement about how to do things which left me in the middle to decide who to listen to. They couldnt pay a living wage and blocked my husband (we met in the kitchen) from career advancement simply because they didn’t like him, regardless of his work ethic, knowledge, and work history. If you like sucking up to grumpy old men, then this is the job for you."
bad,"nice place to work very fast paced when busy"
bad,Since I got the job the conditions and management have continuity declined. People are constantly leaving and the major of the managers are self-serving.
bad,"I was let go when i couldn’t make it in to work, i ended up in the hospital and they fired me. I even Called while on the hospital bed to inform them."
bad,I love working for the company but hate the location I work at. Management has a lot to do with things running smooth. This location def lacks communication between management. Also lacks consistency.
bad,Constant stress and worry over job security. I don’t have anything else to say about Cracker Barrel I did not enjoy working there at all and don’t recommend it
bad,"Nowadays Cracker Barrel seems to be more interested in profits than anything else ."
bad,"work 12 hr shifts on the holiday weeks and only 1 day off"
bad,"If you are a seasoned veteran as a cook, this is not the environment you seek. It is a place for amateurs. Judging on other cooks food presentation alone, the experienced cook who takes his/her job seriously and might be certified from Culinary Arts schooling, you will take offense to the productivity."
bad,Management is awful. You would clock in and managers wouldn’t even know who is working for the night. Management would change your clock in time and wouldn’t call you in advance. People in the kitchen do not know health violations and servers use their hands to handle salads with no gloves on. Pick up other servers slack constantly.
bad,IT was work work work. get the food out the window. Presentation wasn't always the best. Managers played favorites. Employees were messy. Hard to take a break.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"It was ok job. My manager always said I have a stack of applications so you need to get going. I was voted by my peers as empyoee of month at least 3 times ,v oted emplyoee of year one time. Went through their managment training program but was denied managment because they said I did not have enough front of house"
bad,"The favortism in this place is horrible! And if you take your vacation or change your availability at all, they cut your hours back to nothing. Yes, they do offer great benefits, but you pay dearly for them. When I worked there, I left on the verge of tears most days, due to the managers!"
bad,Hours were short and yet I would be aching by the time I got home everyday. The amount of benefits and the pay simply do not justify the work. Labor like this should at least be rewarded with $14 an hour.
bad,"In a normal day you get at least 2-3 tables as a server.After every shift you have to sweep with these 3-foot height brooms that are back breaking! You are expected to so SO much for a measly pay of $2.10 per hour."
bad,"Always busy work place, always someone new coming in to eat with families or even regular customers coming in just to talk and relax by the fireplace."
bad,"I would highly recommend Cracker Barrel if you were single, had no children, no hobbies or other interests besides work.  This is a good company to get experience and they do pay a livable wage."
bad,"This company is at least 10 years behind the industry in technology and operations. They turnover general managers at around 25% per year. Advance , leave or get fired."
bad,"There was drama everywhere in this store. Between the servers and management. I made decent money but the stress of it all on a daily basis was not worth it! I ended up leaving because of work place harassment and getting bullied and ganged up on by two other servers. I was reprimanded before them so I thought it was best just to take myself out of the environment completely. I desperately needed the job, I left at 35 weeks pregnant with my third child. I was devastated and management did nothing!"
bad,"Even if you work a 10 hour shift, you are not allowed a break and practically have to beg for one. You are lucky if you get to sit down and eat. I do not smoke but you are not allowed smoke breaks. Managers are unprofessional and unhelpful. They treat the workers terribly and are always yelling and angry."
bad,"My typical day at work would be a stressful  one ."
bad,"Cracker Barrel has a folksy old timey corporate culture that has to explicitly state over and over about discrimination in the workplace. It was a high volume dish with the stickiest dishes (eggs, maple syrup, ketchup, fixadent) all the while trying to keep a blue oxford and khakis. Worst dishes, worst trash."
bad,i personally didnt like working here because it was worse than high school with the drama and i wasnt with that the managers were rude but some of the employess were nice
bad,The environment is a high paced well compensated area.  This is a fantastic place to work without the need for quality of life.  The upper management is very vague and hidden agendas abound.  Expect to be spoken to and treated very poorly in exchange for your high compensation package.
bad,slow working enviornment.... co-workers did not get along with each other well. management was unorganized. the hardest part was being over staffed and waiting for customers to come in.
bad,"The managers wouldnt communicate with each other. Always having me do different things at once while trying to actually do my job, then get mad when I couldnt do what it was they wanted. Hours were horrible."
bad,"Great for college students. Flexible schedules, easy cash in hand daly, good benefits"
bad,it was an okay job. i realized that serving isnt my faviort thing to do.
bad,The only reason we are there is to make our boss her bonus. She micromanages our every move and makes the job much harder then it has to be. Great job boss needs a chill pill. She chases away all the good help.
bad,Management is horrible here!!! I was asked multiple times to clock out and keep working by a specific manager but all the managers knew it was happening. As a minor they would not give you breaks so they would schedule you for 4 hour shifts because you can only work 5 hours without getting a break as a minor. But you do not stop getting served tables till you shift was over. So you technically have a mother hour or so of work to do. Which is when I was asked multiple times to clock out so they wouldn’t get fined for me working over 5 hours. All in all do not work here unless you 18 or over. Which you don’t get a break unless you’ve worked 8 hours.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,Poor management. Very unorganized. Not fast paced unless it’s a weekend or holiday. Pay rate is good depending upon your position. It is basically a learn it yourself environment.
bad,"I was faced with racism almost every time I worked. my coworkers and even the costumers  were awful to me,  It wasn’t worth not getting paid that well. Again coworkers were terrible to me and I was a new girl."
bad,Management was so rude and caddie.  They would sit and talk trash about the hourly employees. Also i was let go cause of a stalker who said blood will be shed if i didnt do what he said.  It was unfair that i was let go cause of his actions and words. I was let go 2 months ago and i still haven't gotten my check. I have contacted Headquarters 3 times and the stores GM and I even wrote a letter to both locations with an address.  STILL NO LAST CHECK!!!
bad,This job is ALOT of work for very little pay!! I switched jobs to try something new! I regretted it! It was horrible. I worked 5/6 days out the week. I only made decent money ONE day out the week. Sunday! You never leave on time.. A hour after ur schedule at the least ! You have to roll 100 silverware a day and wrap them. The sidework is very extensive! They make You sweep with a baby broom that'll leave a scar near your thumb. Also the workers are very unwelcoming very LOUD and obnoxious.. The managers were okay..You have to get 4 signatures just to leave and get tips. Two from managers 2 from servers (who are still working and barely want to check u) literally my first check (after training) was 2$! Two!! And i claim 3 dependents! Thats crazy! Everyone who worked there either had to pull doubles. Had a 2cd job or dident pay bills. That tells you alot. Thered so much more... Just dont do it! Its to much. And u wont make any money!
bad,the managers would talk about employees to other employees and cause half of the drama in the kitchen. very unorganized and unprofessional. I would not recommend this job to anyone. I think the managers need more training
bad,"I always wanted to work at Cracker Barrel, and I worked there for 2 years. There are employees up there who are backstabbing trash and don't deserve a job. I hated having to leave my job, but the straw that broke the camel's back was a certain shift leader who acted like she was a manager. "
bad,"On the first days of training I quickly realized Cracker Barrel is severely outdated. Borderline racist training videos. Sexist uniform regulations. Old people who work there do/say whatever they want. Management is absent. Lack of training, they basically just throw you out on the floor after watching two days of videos. Inconsistent hours. The headsets are useless and make things more difficult."
bad,The managers have no idea what they’re doing. They don’t care about your availability schedule or if you request time off they still schedule you. Bad work environment. No one wants to be there and no one gets listened to if you go talk to the managers.
bad,"We were literally always understaffed, causing an extremely stressful work environment. The management was awful, none of the managers completed their job properly, usually relying on the people who had been there longer and knew more."
bad,I was given 40+ hours for the first month or two then a new management came in. Changed my position and reduced my pay. I wasn’t able to live off of the job anymore.
bad,"You never knew which manager to go see. If you got hurt because of a prior medical condition that they knew of when you were a new hire, they accuse you of doing drugs. It was ridiculous. Not to mention that when you're the top sales person on the floor, they give you 5 hours a week."
bad,"They decided to get rid of our GM, all I can say is the rest of my time there was a living nightmare! Management was horrible, everyone had thier own set of rules to follow or not to follow! Overall it went down hill fast and as far as I hear it's still the same way. Treat your employees like you appreciate them!!!"
bad,They will terminated you on faults statement with out any proof. They have bad management and allow workers to have iligal cars be on their property I brought it up to their attention and they allow it. And still have it there every day since January 2017 and it is out of state tags
bad,Very stressful working environment. No smoking/going outside during shift. Management is on a constant power trip. Not enough praise/encouragement. Too much yelling
bad,"A typical day at work was met with endless amounts of stress. The shift before mine never cleaned up very well, and left huge stacks of dishes just sitting there waiting to be cleaned. Not to mention how badly the dish machine needed to be cleaned; which they never did either. The management was great at best, but not very responsible. They didn't care for the employees at all, only about profit. My co-workers didn't care at all for the job, they broke dishes on a regular basis and cleaned very poorly. The hardest part of the job was taking harassment from a co-worker. The most enjoyable was getting paid every week. The reason the job security is so high is because they keep you trapped there for as long as they can. They abuse the younger employees to make them work very long hours."
bad,"They don't give you enough hours, and if business is slow you get sent home so you make virtually no money, and managers at the time was not very nice"
bad,"It will drive your stress levels up the wall, through the ceiling. You will be taunted by some customers almost daily. The tips you get from people will really be random, a lot of elderly eat there and don't have much, so don't take it to heart. There isn't a lot of teamwork depending on the shift. You will get yelled at by some customers and coworkers, especially when you first start, so please don't work here if you have depression or a tender heart. It will also be chaotic daily sometimes during the day, so please take some kind of medicine working here if you have anxiety."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"Cracker Barrel paid decently, but it was a stressful job. People were always screaming and fighting with one another. I got sexually harassed on the job and filed multiple reports with management. It took over 6 months for my issue to be addressed. The company treats workers like they are disposable. One time, I thought I broke my hand, and my boss still made me roll my silverware before I got to go to the hospital. NEVER AGAIN will I work there."
bad,Employees are valued and encouraged to excel. Most days are fast paced and I have learned how different fast food issues are vs sit down restaurants. The hardest part of the job is introducing change/technology.
bad,Get to work early to access my surroundings. My day was to designate the job duties for the rest of the servers and make any preparations that is necessary for the night.
bad,"work 14+ hours and still get beat down for any little errors made.  After working 34 in 2 days, expect to get verbally abused by your boss for not getting coffee mugs soaked in bleach."
bad,"The restaurant is so high volume, there are at least two other paid positions they could have a designated person that would support the servers so they could actually be on the floor, in their sections waiting tables. Instead, they put it all on the servers for $2.13 an hour while tips are affected by the poor service for being too busy in the back of the house. "
bad,"job was do-able, management needs work. hardest part was deal with other responsibilities, i learned to put you customers first and to keep in mind to make the customers haoppy"
bad,"It is not a horrible place to work but the company doesnt really care about their employees very much. The co-workers are all very nice, there is some drama there but there is drama at every work place. They sometimes stick to your availability and you are never guaranteed a full time position with them if you get 40 hours you are lucky."
bad,"I worked there for 8 months, the first 5 as a hostess and the last three as a server and hostess.   It is a very busy place and you must have a thick skin to work there, not because of the customers or coworkers, but my experience was with bad managers.  I have worked at Waffle House during night shift and had a much better work environment.  The managers were fine when I didn't do much as a hostess but when I started serving I was eventually treated like a slave.  I thought I was upgrading from my previous job at Waffle House,  and the only reason I applied there was for that reason,  but I was sadly MISTAKEN.  It was so so so much worse.  I worked at the Hattiesburg, MS location a few years ago and whenever I see some of my old coworkers that have now since graduated college with bachelor's/master's degrees, we always talk about how awful it was for all of us.  Please trust this review when I say, only apply to this business as a last resort if you are desperate for money.  I was eventually treated so poorly that I just tried to call in, requested not to speak to a manager about it, and was just fired but didn't care.   It was a horrible situation where a customer hugged me when I was trying not to tear up once.  Shame on this place!  I still think about it which is why in the middle of the night I have to get it out on here still after all this time of being away.  Even when you are praised for your work ethic other places, you will be dogged down working for them.  Unfortunately."
bad,"A typical day at work would include greeting and entertaining customers, usually families or large parties, taking orders, and getting drinks out to the tables."
bad,managaers arent the best ppl for the job
bad,They treat hardworkers like slaves and expect you to do more than whats possible for one perso .Some of the managers are rude and not understanding treat you like your stupid.
bad,"The job itself was amazing, but the management made it unbearable, if the management would’ve been better I would give the job an amazing rating, because nothing else was wrong with the job."
bad,Like working cause of the tips place to work not that one at least management have favoritism and deals with whom they want if you voice your opinion or disagree with management you will be fired.
bad,"I am unfairly treated by management daily, many people get away with breaking rules. There is a lack of organization and managers show no interest when brought to their attention. Management does not act upon employees breaking rules, showing up late, or doing an inadequate job. There are many instances that managers will yell at employees for unreasonable reasons, they also tend to be harsh and uncaring if an employee is sick or injured."
bad,The place was horribly managed and very cut throat. I was only payed $3.20 an hour. The employees were also very rude and a lot of them were dirty and didn't keep their work place clean.
bad,"the food was good , but working there was miserable. I was excited to have worked there when I got hired , but the lack of communication , poor management skills and favoritism gave me a bad outlook for them"
bad,Did not like the work culture or the way things were ran overall it was a nasty place
bad,My name is kris and I work at cb and u dont want to work here the place is a joke and dont eat there because they dont wash there glass and plate are dirty too they tell the cooks to cover it with more food so I may have to work here but u cant pay me to eat here
bad,"•I wasn’t given any hours for almost 2 weeks and that was every other week. •They purposely put my schedules in late so I only got paid for one hour and then received my checks the next week. "
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"The company overworks their management team and hires individuals that lack worth ethic making it highly improbable to make store goals. As a manager coming from a professional environment of hotels where staff was held accountable for things like performance, attendance and drug policies it was difficult to adapt to a company that does not drug test its applicants prior to offering employment so you had to deal with a lot of front of the house and back of the house employees that had substance abuse issues that would call out or show up for work under the influence"
bad,Do not treat you fairly. Your sections are never seated adequately and evenly. The trainers are extremely unprofessional. Cooks come and go when they please and how they please.
bad,"During my time at Cracker Barrel, I became increasingly disappointed with management and the overall cleanliness of the store. The managers would turn a blind eye to employees they favored, but would quickly punish those who they did not like. The kitchen was dirty constantly and health codes were not followed in the particular store I worked at. Silverware, plates, and glasses were always coated in a thin film of grime and tables were often filled before they were cleaned properly. When I put in a two week notice so I could focus on school, I felt threatened by my managers who told me I wouldn’t be accepted to college if I couldn’t learn to balance school and extracurricular activities."
bad,"No work life balance, micromanaged and not allowed to think outside the box. Company supposed to be based on treating people how you want to be treated but they don't actually care about their employees"
bad,"Worked here for 14 years, not all good and no good leadership. Managers didn't care about the working environment and there were always picking and choosing who got the most hours."
bad,"I've been a server at other restaurants but this is the worst place I have ever worked, period. The food is cheap and poorly made. The management is nowhere to be found on the floor, and the steps of service are ridiculous. Having to take empty coffee cups and a pot to the table with only 2 creamers per cup, having to clean and set your own tables... Food trays that are 200 degrees hot I could go on... But I won't. This job sucks and nobody but servers who never served before stay"
bad,"Not good manners,  Don't appreciate you coming in on your day off to cover for other workers.Management have favoritism to others, .Management has fired over 6 people in past week please people this job and management is not the best to work with.I dont give no stars if it was left up to me."
bad,"Cracker Barrel is one of the lower tier places I have personally been employed at. Not great working conditions, managers ask for lots of overtime (pt), and breaks are hard to come by"
bad,"Promises broken, no steady schedules, or hours, employees hours get cut to a ridiculous amount while managers get bonuses, can work a 12 shift with no break, not even a 15 minute break, yet managers make sure they get a meal break, no benefits, no transparency, even when a manager promises to be .transparent."
bad,I don't like this place it's racist i worked there 2months maybe 3 and they treat me like a little kid no capp like i didnt deserve my respect i gave them respect so it should be given the same way
bad,It takes a special person to work here. You really have to have patience because of the people who come in there. They are all spoiled and it is annoying.
bad,"Dysfunctional chaotic backwards close-minded self ego. Lack of teamwork, belittling from management team. Laziness, flavorsome, barking at employee. Major cross contamination though out the back of the house.  Everything comes in pre-cooked, or in a can,tube,paste. 3 microwave. Break room is next to the backdoor where the trash sets.  Next to the package food."
bad,Make this your last option. They get rid of the good and take care of the lousy people. Managers discuss personal information with employees and there is no code of ethic.
bad,"Sucked being a dish washer with a button up and khakis on. Just a horrible place to work very miserable as a dishwasher. Manager was annoying. Always was mad going to work never had a smile on my face. Job sucked, dont do it."
bad,"Well they started off as a good company, always talking about how they want to please the employees and such. Ended up they just wanted to be a company that wanted to make money"
bad,No job security.  I worked with someone that was there 26 years and got fired on the spot for eating a bisquit without asking a manager first.  Managers have screamed at employees in front of other employees.
bad,It was fun at first and then the general manager decided to take my hours away to where I would only work one day a week so I left. But overall it was a fun place to work.
bad,"I absolutely hate working for Cracker Barrel but I suck it up because SOMETIMES just sometimes I made decent tips. The worst managing place I have ever seen, the one in Richmond, KY has a horrible managing team."
bad,If you don't already have ties in the company don't bother unless you are willing to sacrifice everything for a low paying job. They will make ypur job haed if you don't adhere to theor way of life. Be careful.
bad,"I hated it!  Didn’t like mgmt, corporate policies and procedures and the constant promotions that we HAD to push with NO incentive. No interdepartmental cooperation between mgmt AND the employees"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"Managers gave punishment by cutting hours and giving impossible tasks with a time limit. Overall working at cracker barrel for this many years you would think seniority and loyalty would mean something. I worked very hard and was noticed by everyone but that means nothing if the management wont help you, instead they put you down and expect the impossible. Overall rating i would never suggest eating there nor working there."
bad,no. just no. don't work here. its awful. the entire company sucks. you hardly make any money. the managers are the worst. don't do it. save urself the time and mental health.
bad,"I recall working there back in 01' n it wasn't that pleasant of a job experience but it was a job experience nonetheless, would recommend this job to only thick-skinned people."
bad,i did no enjoy this job because its very hit or miss and the side duties were a little outrageous. the managers were cool but the guests were often grouchy
bad,"iPads are used to take orders. If you don't look up to par management will inform you. Had been sent home because no belt and wrong color brown pants. The workplace culture... well everyone who worked there would be getting into fights. I didn't enjoy anything but if Todd the manager was working it would be a great shift because he was always so sweet to everyone and always asked how everyones day was. "
bad,"i found the company was treating people wrong, was very wonky with scheduling< also i believe the company was sill prejudice in some way, i believe i was hired on with higher wage and less experience due to the fact that i am white"
bad,I loved working here it was fun good money great folks to work for and with very busy cant be no slacker make money friends and co workers become family
bad,I worked at cracker barrel for a while and at a number of there stores.  The managers were terrible.  If you weren't his  girl you got bad section and did the worst of side jobs.   Most of the servers were on some kind of drugs.  The cooks would make you wait for your orders if they didnt like you. Management didnt care one bit. Most of the time you couldn't find your manager.   Management favored black servers.here in the south.
bad,"I worked as a hostess and unless one of my coworkers was willing to give up a shift, I normally worked ten hours a week or less. There would be weeks when I would only work one three hour shift. RIDICULOUS. On top of that, one of my fellow hostesses revealed she was only getting paid nine bucks an hour. I had to leave."
bad,"Wasn’t a very kind place to work at at all. Very poor management team. No reall extensive training, best if you have prior kitchen experience. They throw you into the fire with little explanation"
bad,"I did not enjoy my time at Cracker Barrel. "
bad,"This is a very hard job and if you are willing to work hard for your money, do this job. They will give you back breaking work as a dishwasher and you will not stop until they tell you. Get ready for some fun."
bad,"I wasted almost 2 years of my life at this place. The managers have no respect for their employees. They do certain things that could get the place shut down by the health inspector. They didn't like the fact that i disagreed with the things they do to ""help"" servers because it made things 10 times harder for the dishwashers. The majority of the time your lucky if you get a break at all during a 6 hour shift or longer...they always denied my requests for a break when it came time for it. Overall just a terrible place to work unless you are the general manager."
bad,"With this job there were too many managers and everyone had conflicting rules. One manager would tell you, you could/couldn't do one thing and another would tell you the opposite. Also they did not help out very much when a problem arose with a customer."
bad,The management at any cracker barrel store is awful. You also either get 0 days off a week or you dont work a week. The scheduling is one of the worst things about working there.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,They are great people to work for and very accomadating but they have entirely too many servers on to make any money in tips. The only people who make good tips are the closing servers which they give to in preference. The average a server makes is 10 an hour which is ridiculous for the amount of work and side work. But the management is top notch and very nice.
bad,"I worked for the company for 5 years, and I've never had a job that gave me nightmares. Managers only cared about making numbers, and the staff suffered for it."
bad,"The job is very stressful, poor management, not a friendly place to work at all.  bad shift coordination's.  never work more than 4 hrs. a day.  As a host has a lot or issues with the servers."
bad,"when i started i was hired as a dishwasher, i tired for more then a month to try and get crossed trained on a diff position. Then after more asking and someone quitting i finally got my chance to cross train as a cook and with in the first week of me being in that position a manager pushes me out of the way cause i didn't have something ready that still had 20 mins + left to cook. He then proceeded to take said food off the kettle and serve it to quest under cooked."
bad,"First of all, ask for at least $12.00 an hour starting, they’ll give it to you because no one wants to do this job. If you aren’t insistent, they will easily take it upon themselves to start you at $10.00-$10.50. This company is not a family no matter what guide lines, principals, and videos they attempt to show you. It is akin to any restaurant environment. A bunch of adults or young adults pretending they’re in high school again. They will attempt to make your job more difficult with their lack of work, don’t let them. You can report this to a manager. However, the next issue is management. The lack of communication is astounding. It took months to get standard needed supplies because they would simply forget until you brought it up again. And again, some management is childish just like everyone else. One manager made me feel uncomfortable from day one, it’s been seven months. Kinda sad on their part really. This job is only good for picking up skills such as time management and proper cleaning techniques. Other than that, it’s simply a job where you are locked in a building all night by yourself, when your work is finished, you eagerly await a manager to tell you whether or not your work is sufficient. And if they think so, they let you go. Well...you may have to sit for an hour and wait for the store to open first, just so they can get one more task of taking trash outside out of you. But if you’ve done something slightly wrong, be prepared to fix it. They’ll complain about how long you’re on the clock while giving you extra demanding task to complete. Don’t make this a"
bad,Job is stressful and ha low wage /benefits. This job does not meet the cost of living standards for this area.company does not have proper management team to ensure the health and welfare of employees.
bad,"Management was generally hard to work with, and customers are normally difficult to deal with. You can tell the management is overworked, thus making it harder for everyone else to work efficiently. No real benefits were offered, and day-to-day life was stressful."
bad,"It was fast paced which it’s good to be busy but they were changing cash to also work the sales floor very high pressure to sell I just wanted cash I’m no salesman and don’t want to be"
bad,This place sucked to work at and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone. Two table sections. Too many servers. On busy days you might make $60 if you’re lucky.
bad,"It’s a nice an quite place to work just to many young kids with drama it’s to loud an the mangers treat people better than others , they money is not worth the amount of work u do you don’t get appalled when doing a great job"
bad,"Fast paced, bad management, and bad work environment. You are required to do a lot of computer training and then are thrown into your job to learn on-the-fly, really bad experience"
bad,Management is very poor. The way they talk to their employees is very disgraceful. Makes employees feel unwanted and better off not being there. Used to love working there until we got a new GM.
bad,"This job was very draining. The managers pick favorites and depending on who their favorites are, that’s who gets the most hours. Don’t make them the slightest bit upset because they will cut your hours dramatically. One week you could have 30+ hours. The next, 6? 10? It was horrible. There are people that are given titles they aren’t qualified for. The hours are just ridiculous all together. I loved this job at first. You truly do meet some of the sweetest people ever working there, but the employees at my particular location made me dread going to work."
bad,Management didn’t know what they where doing buying wrong stock and not enough stock. Wouldn’t let me get to first aid after cutting myself on there knives on clock.
bad,"This employer does not give ANY employee anything over 28 hours a week max, and retail is usually 8-15 hours a week. They dont want to pay for benefits and healthcare, even though its ""offered"". If you get injured on the job, your hours get cut and they will force you to work with said injury despite any doctors orders. You must pay for every part of your uniform, no excuses. Management is poor, your voice or concerns are not heard, if it's slow and you cant possibly make your sale quota, your hours get cut drastically. The inside behavior of this company are completely ironic for being a family restaurant."
bad,The cooks are always so slow takes forever for food to come out. The management acted like they cared but really they didnt. Servers worked the hardest but never got noticed for it. The drama between servers was also bad. If you enjoyed high school like this is the job for you!
bad,These jobs have accused a bunch of good people for really bad things when they didn't do or say anything wrong. The management members team up against co-workers that they don't like.
bad,Management hired so many people there weren't enough hours for everyone. Then they would pick and choose who could have the most hours. Although it has it's drawbacks it was a clean place to work.
bad,the management isnt very good and it is slow most times at night and the customers rarely tip the correct amount and a lot of the time they we leave without tipping at all.
bad,its was an OK job. I don t plan on going back to it i hated the job it was only for a little bit. I would never work there agin i feel like it gave ok discount
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"I worked at two different locations. Most of the managers are well meaning and do their jobs well. However, long hours working with a break by being scheduled to work multiple positions back to back is an ongoing problem. There is little to no chance at advancment if you do not look the way they want their managers to look. The injury I had was a direct result of my store manager being careless. I was physically assulted at work and it was covered up by the manager on duty and the company itself. At the Guntersville Alabama location it is common for certain managment to lie about people quitting when they are having a bad day or week. In the end, this is not a job I would ever return to."
bad,"My tips went missing for a week, I spoke with management and told me there's nothing they can do. You work 9-10 hrs daily Unprofessional, no teamwork!"
bad,I did not feel appreciated here. I was always doing more than I was asked and I was never thanked. Eventually our management team gave up on themselves and the store that I worked for became a very hostile and negative environment.
bad,"A normal day at work is just helping boost sales and anyone at the cash stand.  I didn't really learn much it was all pretty simple basic math for the cash register, helping sale a certain amount in the store everyday, and keeping a positive attitude and helping anyone who needed it. It was never a hard job and the only thing I really enjoyed is I had friends there and made some as well."
bad,It was a horrible place to work. Your coworkers would grab you by the throat and choke you. They yell at you all the time. The manager will grab you by the ear just because of a cartilage piercing that no one could see. Even when you asked many managers before getting it. Poor pay and it's just a really stressful place to work. Will turn you into a cruel heartless person.
bad,I did not enjoy working at cracker barrel; it was stressful and I didn't feel like I was paid enough. I ended up leaving because the job was so stressful.
bad,my day started at 6 am and ended at 230. very busy store lots of regular guest. fast paced and learning the menu that people could eat all day. high volume store
bad,You aren't valued as an employee and the managers all hate each other. They are childish and treat you like you're stupid and they expect the worst of you and treat you like you are invaluable. The customers are rude and feel entitled to free food every time they eat there. The only decent part is having nice coworkers.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working at cracker barrel to anyone. The management harassed and bullied myself and other employees, even customers. There was no order there, many illegal things were looked over. They promise benefits and raises at the beginning of the job but never follow through with them. They are disrespectful and rude to anyone they want to. Drugs were done on the grill where food is prepared and management just stood and watched, workers have fornicated in the coolers where food is kept."
bad,"As a server at this location always has you on the edge. You know your routine on what to do, but depending on which manager is there you have to wait and see how the day is going to play out. The management is always threatening people with their jobs and favor several employees. This is a hostile work environment which also makes this the hardest part o the job. The regular guest asking for you is the most enjoyable"
bad,"In my own opinion I wasn't treated with dignity, this area was very hostile environment to work, I was left alone to do a job that required more employees,"
bad,1 week 20 hr next week 8. make you leave early if buisness is slow no hard work but it doesnt pay the bills. hours change all thetime employees are great few managers not so great
bad,I worked there for almost a year as a cashier and they would not let me take breaks. They under staff so much that the manager must take your place when you take breaks. The manager will constantly tell you in a lot to you can and then never help you. You can't have any food or drink or bathroom breaks. I got sent to the er twice due to malnutrition and i passed out on the job. Dehydration and malnutrition is a huge problem there.
bad,"When I first started at the opening of the restaurant is was a pretty good place to work, but it started going downhill fast when the general manager left. The manager left in charge was very change able and not a pleasure to work with, it wasn't uncommon to hear him yelling a servers. There aren't any breaks. I know several people that would work on the line for twelve hours at a time with only one 30min break, and only if it was slow. So if we were busy all day, no break. Which is illegal. The co-workers were gossipy and always looking to get you in trouble, I did meet some of my very best friends there, but that's because we all started at the same time and watched the decline of the store together. No matter what you're scheduled to work that day, you will work until you make them let you leave. I easily could have been working 40hrs a week, but they wouldn't put you on full time and you would receive no benefits."
bad,at first crackel barrel was a very good company to work for at least that is what was told to me and also it was equal non discriminating workplace which was not the case this company is very unfair on how management play favorites to employees and does not solve problems when they should only when it is too late they promised great hours turned out that you were getting only 20 or less
bad,"The management of the restaurant is the worst possible, no one can show new employees the correct training, no hours are scheduled."
bad,"The Cracker Barrel I was employed with management was horrible, it was more a zoo than a restaurant. All workers weren't treated the same most weren't appreciated."
bad,"I completed sales transactions, greeted customers, "
bad,A typical day at work would be to stand before the counter for hours and cash people out. Hardly ever saw my manager. Usually worked behind the counter alone so really didn't have co-workers. 
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,Good company bad store i worked at felt more like a club and the bad employees got benifits that the good employees never got. Scheduling manger was a joke.
bad,Wouldn't recommend working there. Management takes favorites and there is a lot of unneeded drama. Work balance is a joke. You can make money there and it might be worth it to some
bad,"Watch your schedule. They are notorious for changing it AFTER it has been posted. I would recommend printing out your schedule or taking a picture of it because if you don't have proof, they play stupid and you are SOL. "
bad,I loved this company until I transferred to a store in Georgia. Most of the managers were rude and unprofessional. Employees did not work as a team and managers did not care for the guests.
bad,Do not recommend to work there.  Employees are not respectful and managers don't know how to manage the place.  Retail manager could care less about how the restaurant is doing and picks out her favorites.  Retail manager is also two faced.
bad,"Not a great experience working here. Started off great for the first month and it all went south. Some of the managers seem to really care, while other clearly don’t."
bad,"Starts out with excellent hours/days, then the constant hiring of new employees renders less days/hours for you. "
bad,4 manager quit before the Restaurant was open for 2 months treat workers poorly most days couldn't even take my break. Never get a chance to take a ten. Cutting hours and poor treatment of employees
bad,I do not recommend working at this particular cracker barrel. I had a mental breakdown every day at work. Management was nice but didn’t have their stuff together if you know what I mean. Time off... What’s that?
bad,"This particular location is a high traffic very busy one, yet a lot of equipment is broken and needing to be replaced. they are usually understaffed and getting time off can be difficult. But most of the other employees are friendly."
bad,"lack of good management, very unfair company not enough hours to remain a steady job no representation from management when you have problems on questions"
bad,"When employed, I was attending college. I had plenty of time. "
bad,"bad management, terrible communication, they make people cry, and are bullies. Run out of food during dinner, get mad if you blame communication, managers let servers steal tips off tables"
bad,I was unable to make a lot of money here due to employees not doing their jobs as needed. I found myself running more food out for other employees than tending to my own tables. This led to poor tips and poor customer service.
bad,"There is not much room for improvement outside of your location. Once you become a server, you'll most likely stay one unless it is your dream to one day be the CEO of Cracker Barrel. You ;can do so much better."
bad,"I loved the wonderful people that I had the privilege of helping and I loved the good people I worked with. It's not an easy job, you are on your feet all day but it does have its rewards"
bad,"Management is a joke, servers and to beg & ask permission to give the guest what they ask for. Not everyone is held to the same standard not all employees are made to complete task that are required of others"
bad,"Although I started working there with optimism, it quickly became clear that this location was NOT good to their employees. Management was always negative to their people. There is almost ZERO training so you have to learn yourself. NOT a good way for a restaurant to run. The hostesses did not rotate customers at all!! Either you were swamped with 10 tables at a time during lunch rush or you would only get 1 table during your entire shift."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,The managers are not on the same page as the trainer. The trainer was very inappropriate and creeped me out. I felt sexually harassed by several employees at my location.
bad,"Stress level is high. Never the right equipment to do the job correctly. The management based  reviews on work performance however, they blame the employee for the  bad performance when they din't train them correctly."
bad,Cracker Barrel #465 is a mess. Poor management. Servers complain entirely too much.. nothing goes smooth.. lack of prep cooks. Never get off on time. Wouldn’t recommend this Cracker Barrel location
bad,"Other than the people that I met while working at Cracker Barrel, I did not really enjoy working there.  Most of the management was decent.  My direct manager was great."
bad,"I really enjoyed my direct manager, she was the only reason I worked there as long as I did! All my co-workers were terrible people! No training at all! They pick fun at you because you don't know what you're doing because they never trained you. They make fun of all 'Rising Stars' in front of other rising stars!! They were hateful to guests as well! They don't need to be working with the public! The other managers treat new hires the same way, you feel like a bother asking for a drop for your register. It was the worst job I've ever had!!"
bad,"Highly stressful the customers are rude it is not African-American friendly Management lacks in the retail section the place is understaffed, the pay is not equal to all that you have to know in order to work there. Advancement is a possibility but you have to fake it till you make it. Cracker Barrel provides a atmosphere that allows their customers to feel entitled thus no respect is given to staff. I would not recommend this job to anyone especially single moms it's okay as a part-time job for a teenager no more than 5 hours a day"
bad,"Most customers did not tip over 10% to any servers, managers over-staffed both high and low customer volume days, kitchen cook times were always extremely high, there was rarely a need for rushing, most co-workers had an ""I don't care"" attitude, the only enjoyable part was the regular customers"
bad,"Typical server job with responsibilities, but management was homophobic and was subjective to favoritism. "
bad,"management is very stressed in turn it creates a hectic work place. most employees are disgruntled and it makes the environment horrible. they hire people who are incapable of completing jobs and then applies pressure on the rest of the staff to get the rest of the job done. Quite frankly, theres a lot of unprofessional and ridiculous behavior and management would rather smile and turn a cheek then make life harder for the employees who actually do their jobs."
bad,"There was a lot of favortism, Some people got a way with murder and others were forced to pick up the slack."
bad,"Would not properly train me how to close, work environment not friendly, and I worked with a server with an extreme ankle injury, managers paid no mind, this attitude reflected in the whole workplace."
bad,"I thought I would have a life time career with this company , however they are way behind the times and have unfair policies and procedures."
bad,"Varies with each day, some are better than others. Money income is a problem, not making as much as when I first started. Some of the people make the environment better. "
bad,"I was in the retail part so I had to stalk shelves and perform customer service. The environment was clean and friendly but at times there was literally nothing to do but walk around in circles. At the times when we would get super busy I wasn't allowed to hop up on a register because I wasn't allowed to, then customers  would look and me and wonder why I'm not helping on a register. That was annoying. My manager was never there (honestly don't know where she was half the time). In the end customer service was always number one at cracker barrel and thats always a good thing."
bad,"Most days were stressful with seldom the correct use amount of people to help. I stilled learned how to make due with the situations that were given to the best of my ability. Managers would often disrespect other employees and rarely acknowledge when the right position in the place would need assistance. The hardest part was staying caught up during the times when business was high due to the process of keeping everyone focused on what needed to be done. Despite all the stress of the matter some days, some employees and management maintained a level head by providing a small laugh within the workplace."
bad,"This company has a policy that's supposed to promote workers who advance through a ""Par"" system to Par1 or 2 to only be the employees considered for cross-training; However they play favoritism, making experienced employees with the ranking and seniority in place wait to advance, while forwarding newer amateur employees who are barely a rising star. This is against policy and is clearly discrimination.... something they claim to not represent."
bad,It has been a number of years but at the time I worked there it seemed to be a number of issues with management. Loved the fact of having regular customers. A number of them felt like they were family.
bad,I would work a couple hours a week because I was in high school at the time. I had learned how to greet and be social to new people. The management didn't know what they were doing at that time ad they were always mixing things up. They told me that I had to choose between work or school. I went with school because that is my main goal. The co-workers were great they had lots of spunk in their step and never looked down on me. Starting out was the hard part of me because I had no idea what I was getting myself into. Seeing everyone I worked with and seeing the smiling faces of the guests.
bad,"i have never work in a place where the manager have no respect for their workers and their managers. I am not saying I was an outstanding employee but I have never work in a place where manager humiliate you, scream at you, and treat you in a very bad way. Where you could you notice instantly who their favorite employees are and who have the benefits of getting their hours secure. I felt uncomfortable and very bad. The condition of the workplace is poor. I had to work long shift with no breaks and if you did get a break it was later on rub in your face and made your feel like you had the obligation to be there and work there like a slave. I did not appreciate the way many managers handle many situations and i wont expect anything to change either."
bad,I learned alot about how a company runs from the training i got at the job.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,Not many hrs to work with. If you're a person with the family this is not the job for you just for the simple reason is you do not have enough hours to make up for the time that takes away from your family and the cost to raise a family
bad,"Management’s always disorganized, and they prioritize certain servers over others due to favoritism instead of job performance. There’s always drama going on between the kitchen staff.The overall culture of the restaurant is extremely unprofessional, and the food is often not up to code. The only benefit to working there is that it’s a good way to make quick money, and the guests are often nice."
bad,"Be prepared to work long and hard hours.  Upper management extremely demanding; as long as you made your numbers, life was good, but (most) goals were very hard to attain"
bad,I feel like this job is more for high school students wanting to make some extra money. The hours suck and they switch up managers like it’s nothing. I would recommend a high school student or an high school athlete to work here .
bad,8 long years with only one of then with a good management team. Laziness and no structure. The employees that do work have to pick up the slack first the lazy ones. No consequences and they par up anyone half the new par 4s couldn't even use the computer or new the menu.
bad,"Very demanding, no time for family or anything outside, have to work positions due to staffing, just all together not what i expected from a company like this."
bad,"I was an opener. I'd come in very early, clean and restock shelves at a very decent pace, greet customers, and check customers out who had finished breakfast. I learned the rumors about Cracker Barrel treating employees badly is true. The smell of the store was always pleasant and the customers are indifferent towards employees. The hardest part was pleasing the manager. Everything we did was wrong in her eyes. The most enjoyable part was my coworkers. There were two that were about my age and they made the day easier."
bad,It was my first job and at first it was great until you learned who management really were. They guest weren’t all bad but I had people say I was racist (which I am far from it) and it was because I said I will get them more coffee and then looked at my other table that I just got sat with. Management would do nothing if you were sexually assault from the guest (one of them told me to take a compliment wherever I can get one)
bad,Management is horrible. Three people already quit at my store because of management. They cut back hours so much that the non favorites were working 1-2 days a week for four hour shifts. Favorites were working 7 hr shifts almost everyday. DO NOT WORK HERE. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO A WORST ENEMY. THEY USE YOU FOR PROBATION AND LET YOU GO. I SAW THAT HAPPEN BEFORE.
bad,"What's a good place to work out when I first started. I love the culture and I love my coworkers. Slowly it started to feel more like we were slaves. No brakes, no time to drink ( especially when you're on the line cooking in high heat temperatures), certain people got special privileges (favorites). Overall, it is a good place to work if you're in need of money and need a hours right away."
bad,"To much favoritism. Managers don't agree on anything. Different answers from each one on the same subject. Don't ask for time off or try to switch shifts. If you do, your hours will be cut."
bad,This place was full with addicts and felons who have not been rehabilitated and their behavior showed. The management here was very inconsistent from manager to the next and one in particular manager prided himself on making fun of the employees there and suffered from a severe power trip where he thought he was cool by putting every ones personal issues on blast in front of other employees.
bad,Working at cracker barrel was very stressful. the pay and hours were small. at the times the job was short staff and very demanding of those that were at work.
bad,"They are very rude, unorganized, and classless. I’ve heard so many racist jokes there I’ve lost track. I’ve had several customers treat me terribly for no reason at all. Management is so unorganized and lackadaisical it’s ridiculous. The servers are so egotistical and selfish it’s hard to work. And the older women argue every single morning"
bad,"Typical day at work consisted of stocking, and trying to make sales for which we were given very little training on how to do so (only through videos). There was no room for error, even for those who were first-time employees of a retail setting. Management expected you to watch the training videos and immediately be able to sell, without catering to other learning styles. The hardest part of the job was making the sales. While I did what I could, even though being a student at the time, there were times where I was put on the schedule to only work two or three hours for just one day out of the week. I was often told that my school schedule had been lost, and that those were the hours they figured would work best. The most enjoyable part of the job was the stocking."
bad,Very stressful at times. You were not allowed to have any color on your nails. You had to wear a very strict uniform. The people you work with are not nice
bad,"Since I was younger I didn't get any time on the floor so I was stuck being paid as a server which is $2.13 an hour plus tips but I hardly got tips because the older staff members wouldn't add me on the floor plan and when being told to a manager I was told to ""just deal""."
bad,The managers treat you awfully and they will not give you a single break. You could work for 8 hours straight and not get a break. There is no opportunity for advancement and the management is way overpaid. Don't ever expect to become a manager at one of these places it will never happen.
bad,I have been with cracker barrel for awhile and the longer I work there the worst the store get.I go to work stressed out and I leave more stressed out
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"The managers at cracker barrel are so overly stressed that they dont know how to deal with the employees. This is why everyone constantly quits. We are so over worked at cracker barrel and dont even get a free meal a day. The schedules are always messed up. You never get the days you ask for off. The dress code is insane. No piercings at all. No nails done. No hair down. Button down shirt with khaki pants. No room to express your personality. The inside kitchen is so messy with everyone always stressed and arguing. The store is a disaster. Overall, they need to work harder on fixing management and taking care of all the problems they cause for employees."
bad,"The turn over is ridiculous, constantly having to train new hires. Hours suck. Most of the people are friendly. Most guest will not tip well, on a good night you may make $40."
bad,"Cracker Barrel is a very bottom level job. It was was the worst job and company I have ever worked for. You will be sent home as soon as the rush is over so the store can make money it does not matter how long you were clocked in. Or you will be called in but by the time you get to work you are no longer needed so they tell you to just go home, without taking into consideration the hoops you just jumped to get to work. They do not care about their employees at all. It is a very bad place to work."
bad,In my experience they do very little to promote from within. There is a lot of favoritism and they lack the will to punish employees for not following procedures. The culture can be very negative and they expect people to work long hours and be on call all the time. They also expect most people to work numerous positions in the restaurant and just switch every time someone calls off and they have a spot to fill. So in other words servers are forced to cook whether they want to or not. The general manger is very negative and demanding . He also treats his employees poorly and tries to intimidate.
bad,"Their was no set hours, specific duties, and very unsafe environment. It was very messy and unsanitary in the back area where food was prepared. It was as well super crammed and cluttered."
bad,Managers tend to apply rules whenever they feel like. They don't take any constructive criticism from employees who want to see the store move on in a positive manner. General manager is rarely even at the store. Only thing that makes working at Cracker barrel store 285 positive are the co-workers.
bad,liked the staff.Just that some empolyees dont back you up when you have a lot of work to do. Like they put me with a lazy young dude who didnt want to pull his own. He'd always be on his phone and have the dishes stack up. Was really mad told manager and nothing was done.
bad,"Great place to make money. Great staff, some managers are great but only a few. Not a good balance of work \ home life. Never get off on time and management doesn't care if you have responsibilities like kids to pick up, only their own behinds. No respect for employees time."
bad,I worked here a few months short of a year. The hours are long and compensation is extremely low. Management treated the workers terribly I would not recommend this company to others
bad,Management is terrible so the older staff would cuss me out every shift. Also they kept hiring new host so I got 6 hours per week. we got so slow that the shifts were boriing
bad,My manager did not care about her employees. She simply wanted juicy gossip. Everything was always a mess. She never let anyone leave the floor to go clean the stock room.
bad,"The hours were long, no breaks were given. 7.5 hour shifts were purposefully given to avoid allowing breaks. Scheduling was often last minute and not often posted online as it should be. Hot, smelly, hard work."
bad,"The food is really good at a discounted rate, as far as the work environment everyone is overworked and underpaid and is treated like we all are replaceable with little value at all."
bad,"after it your to clock out you will be stuck at work at least and another hour close too 2 hours rolling silverware,doing side work, and looking for mangers to sign you off just to get your money .at the end of the day."
bad,There is no need to work here unless you abosolutely need money like badly or you because you litterelly can't get a job anywhere else so hopefully nobody has too.
bad,"At first I really liked this job, the managers were super friendly, as time progressed they started to get very discriminatory and eventually cut my hours to 3 and a half hours a week. Wasn't worth my time. In order to get a lunch it was a nightmare of going to a few different people."
bad,"Not a good place to work, I mean it's a job but super stressful and very unappreciated, but it pays the bills. New employees get away with murder and older ones get scolded."
bad,"I did not enjoy working at cracker barrel. The management didn't care about your life, so if you are like me and get sick they expect you to work. Other employees are unreliable and rude and hours get cut without notice."
bad,"too much work for the pay, awful management, way too much drama, no flexibility at this store, and if your sick you get written up for it! hate it there"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,They lied to me about pay. They litearlly work you all day with not one break. They act like they dont know people have a life outside of work. I busted my hump for 6 months. Under paid and all. Couldn't do it any longer.
bad,"I have been a waitress at several other restaurants so I know generally how this works. The tips here are some of the best I have ever seen; however, when hired, I was promised full-time hours if I ""showed up, did good work, etc."" which I knew I could do.  This never happened.  After being there a while - even after addressing this issue with Management - it appeared that the ""favorites"" or ""whiners"" get the hours, not the hard workers here.  And there is a lot of regular drama that goes on (between wait/cook staff and management), which is just not conducive or helpful when trying to work.  It's too bad because the tips are great and there are actually some great people there.  But with not getting hours promised, working your tail off, and almost non-stop drama, it gets old pretty fast.  (Oh-note: if you're looking for benefits, they don't offer insurance unless you have been an employee for at least a year.  I have never heard of anything like that.  And the employees who had the insurance said it was awful.)"
bad,The Money as  server is nice. The management is terrible. Work environment is like any other kitchen. Coworkers are really what makes the job worth coming into. Working so close with people you tend to build a family bond
bad,"The co-workers are lovely, but the management only cares about money and neglect their workers lives and needs. The only perk is learning people skills."
bad,"If you need a part time job this will work, a lot of customer service interaction is needed as well as sales. The management has become bad over time and does not care for their employees as much as they used to."
bad,"I despised this job. A typical day at work depended on the time of day. I was usually scheduled during the dinner rush, so I was very stressed. I learned that you can't please everyone, no matter how hard you try. The retail manager above me when I was there was very corrupt. There were some of my co-workers that he liked and they would miss three or four days at a time and he wouldn't say anything. I missed one day in the six months that I was there and he threatened to fire me for excessive absences. I didn't really have a lot of time to get to know my co-workers. My shift was always very busy, and I was always the person who closed the store. By the time things slowed down, I was the only cashier there. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the crowd. The most enjoyable part was being able to demonstrate with toys to kids."
bad,"As a high school student this was the perfect job. There is no real chance of career advancement, and a lot of the employees are ""professional waitresses."" There is a lot of chances for the company as a whole to improve."
bad,the work day started off with chaos. as the employee you never had a consistent work schedule. the managers were very condescending and down right nasty.
bad,The restaurant business is not for me. I stuck with it for 2 years until I was blessed with something I love. I did advance in the company because wherever I am at I give it my all.
bad,"taking care of the guest, I served hosted and was a cashier. I helped the guest through the whole experience. "
bad,"There was ice on the roads. My husband had to drive me to work that day. We got a cup of coffee and breakfast that morning. They want you to feel at home while you are away from home. That is not true. My husband was going to have coffee while I was working, to avoid driving up the mountain on icy roads and having to come back to get me in about an hour after he got there. The manager said he could not stay there while I was working and sent me home that day. Why couldn't he stay in there and have a cup of coffee, feeling at home while away from home? That just was not right."
bad,a typical day at work at cracker barrel is like wondering if you are going to have to feel like you have to babysit. one thing ive learned at cracker barrel is that you dont feel like you belong. management does what they see fit. i get along with some coworkers but not many. there is no hard part about my job. the most enjoyable part about the job is when everyone is on the same page.
bad,"In this particular work place, senority ruled...being the newby, if they did not like you, even the managers were this way, you would not get good table sections or mabe just a two table section and a lot of side work to do. It was like being in highschool all over again and being bullied, come on people we are all adults now, grow up and at like it...one can only take so much of this work environment. I did try to approach my manager about this situation and he just shrugged it off as if, this is the way it is and will remain the same."
bad,"A typical day at work is what you would expect from most restaurants. I can't say I have learned anything new from working at Cracker barrel. Management is never on the same page and it's often difficult to really know what is expected of you as a cook. "
bad,"Working as an employee at Cracker Barrel takes alot out of you. You have to do your job plus 5 other peoples jobs in order to please your manager. My favorite part of working at Cracker Barrel is the customers.. I love working with people. There isn't any room to move up in the company and if you feel that you deserve that promotion, you won't get it because no matter how long you have been there and how many times you have proven yourself over and over again, you will not get the promotion a young kid will and this is his first job and has only been there for 8 months."
bad,"A great place to work if you want to be disrespected. Management treated me like I was less an a human being. They pretend to care about you and your needs, but at the end of the day they couldn't care less."
bad,a typical day at cracker barrel is normally drama unorganized and dysfunctional. I learned how to be a better person than I was when I came into the work place. I learn how to take things and hold my tough more. management was not the best its to many heads and not enough tails. the hardest part of my job was it not being in team work as much as I would have like or as much as I am use to but the enjoyable part of my job was dealing with the guest and some coworkers.
bad,I have been working at store # 20 in Kennesaw  Georgia for almost 2 years and they say you can move up to management quickly well i'm a par 3 one step away from being a par 4 and considered for management and without any interest being shown to my performance at this job and no pay increase I have started to look for something else the servers and cook staff are great people this store just needs someone who isn't going to micro manage.
bad,"I did not feel comfortable pushing customers to buy items, they obviously did not feel comfortable either."
bad,The new management made working there very difficult and stressful.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"Night Job, the pay isn't enough compensation for the job - the job was okay but I didn't get paid the right amount on my debit card for the work I did. I didn't like getting locked in the building at night either - a fire hazard - I know from being in the fire dept. I did general maintanance/cleaning and some early morning food prep work. I had no co workers. The hardest part of the job was being locked in overnight by yourself, no way out or keys to get out."
bad,I loved working there until they hired new manangers and they were'nt really up to part. A few didnt know what to do.
bad,I enjoy working at Cracker Barrel.I just need more money with being a single parent.
bad,"Cracker Barrel could very well be a great work place , but you are over worked and under paid. It is very easy to get over looked."
bad,My Grandmother has dementia and I also take care of my mom with some health concerns. I was lucky if I made $100 a week before they started cutting my hours for not being in my right mind because they would tell my business to other employees.
bad,"Work here if you want to go into work and get yelled at as soon as you clock in. The GM expects you to roll silverware, run food, do your side work, and care for the guests needs all at the same time. Which is humanly impossible. There is no order to how things get done. They claim that it’s a family and it is far from that. No one helps you unless you help them. You get yelled at for not doing what she wants you to do. But you need to get what you know you need to get done for you to make your money. I like far from this location and it was the only place that would hire me, so I took the job. But I only work 1 day 2 if I’m lucky. So I only make $50 a week because sundays aren’t as good as you would think. The management needs help. And it won’t get any better. A lot of empemployees say they are unhappy... it’s sad"
bad,"General Manager is unfair and unprofessional. She plays favorites. People who actually work hard get punished for dumb things that others don’t. She sits in her office until the rush is just about over, and then comes out and yells at everyone for not working hard enough. We have been through a lot of GMs and none have been good. I’m sure other locations are fine, but would not recommend this location."
bad,its not a terrible place to work I personally feel like the attitudes there were horrible. they were very disrespectful (yell in your face) etc. and I was only allowed to work 4 hour days.
bad,Cracker barrel is a nice place to work as long as you never go against their words are never late and never talk back. If you do any of these things you will be punished in the form of less hours or no hours at all.
bad,"A lot of drama and can’t ever get anything done that needs to. Need hours, won’t get them here. I’ve wanted to quit for a while. Only thing actually worth a thing there is the pay"
bad,At cracker Barrell I was a hostess and that means we basically sat the guest down in their seats so they can order and get something to eat we are also in charge of cleaning the glass windows sweeping the bathroom handing out menus and silver ware
bad,I enjoyed my time at Cracker Barrel and I enjoyed the guest experience. The pay was not enough to support my lifestyle and my growing family.Its an ideal job for retirees or college students.
bad,"This job took my soul away but I made really good money, but it really wants worth it. I would only work there if I’m desperate need of money. Management does not care about the servers. Will cut your hours to intimidate you. Unhealthy work environment due to unsanitary in the building."
bad,"Managers would often bully staff and change schedules after they were posted. If there was confusion in the kitchen, managers would take it out on servers by verbally abusing them. Employees were demoted or fired without notice. Managers would under-schedule many employees so that they didn't get to receive full-time benefits."
bad,"Management walks all over you. Doesn’t care about your personal life. Sometimes expected to work 5 doubles in a row, only get a week of paid vacation after a year of employment. Strict call out policy."
bad,Was fired for missing a shift I wasn't scheduled for never written up prior nothing just fired just like that. They were very rude and cold I didn't understand why but it was so sudden it was crazy .
bad,"Crackerbarrel makes you do entirely too much work especially for the amount of money you’re making. People will work double shifts and walk away with less than 200 dollars. Sundays are the busiest & most annoying days. The kitchen doesn’t communicate effectively with the servers, neither do the managers. The managers are trash only 2 of them actually try. Instead of managing they’re too busy doing other people’s jobs because they don’t have any people to work."
bad,Hardest most stressful job ever.Form2.13 an hour a server was very much under paid.Had to do everything in the entire restaurant but cook and checkout.Money was great but that’s it
bad,Would highly recommend not working for this company is the most insane crazy place I’ve ever worked. If I had it to do over again I would never have taken the job
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"I worked at a cracker barrel that primarily served poor older people, so the tips were abysmal and the customers were always cranky or ""scheming"". The people i worked with were fine, but the atmosphere was very stressful and I was far too relieved when I was able to leave."
bad,"If you'd like a job instead of a career and enjoy working long hours without encouragement, guidance, or appreciation this may be for you.  Added perks include lack of integrity and no vision.  This may look good on a resume, but there are very few promotional opportunities or job growth.  Frequent reductions in staff occur and people are overloaded while the company becomes top heavy with the addition of senior titles.  Execs have little functional experience for their roles, which makes the work that much harder for everyone else."
bad,"Dont work here if you need to support either yourself or a family. I worked only 8 hours a week with terrible pay, condescending managers, and terrible work environment. They get on you about the most menial things. Your socks not covering your ankles, your apron straps not being under your collar, your hair being too frizzy, even down to the COLOR of your socks. (The dress code is black socks, I wore gray socks and manager had a fit)"
bad,I was a very Ggod worker team player however management changed every year for the most part. Rules changed made it very difficult to work there people were cut throat not very nice
bad,"If i had to go back to work there i would. A typical day there would be; I clock in, go check the restroom to see if it needed to be cleaned and if it it needed to be cleaned, I would clean it. I would cash the customers out after they’ve eaten and walk around the retail store to see if everything was in its right place and greet the customers as they came in the restaurant. When my shift was over i would check the restroom again and if they were clean, i would clock out for the day and leave."
bad,"This job was just to get money. I did not intend on working at Cracker Barrel, they were just the first people to offer me a job. Here are my three breaking points:"
bad,"Do not work here run very very far away!! Managers will constantly scream at you for ANYTHING, even if asking about schedule or where something is. Lots of favoritism, some servers are very nice and some are just straight up bossy n rude for no reason ! U will have to stay over 2 hours when ur suppose to clock out due to the sidework and 100 silverware need rolled. You’ll make barely any money working nights. Weekends is when u make the best money other than that u will barely make any money at all."
bad,"As a retail associate I had some of the most ridiculous expectations, some of which could not be met at all times. I was simply not making enough in the position for what they were having us do."
bad,"I do not think all Cracker Barrels are bad, however it does strongly depend on the district manager you work for. Down south and in the west, there is more trust and flexibility. They seem to care a bit more about their managers. I worked in the central Ohio area that included covering Columbus and Mansfield, and it was the absolute worst experience. Until there is someone else in charge of the district, no one stands a chance there. So much turnover and uneasiness amongst all levels of staff. Customer base is also a ruder crowd than the customers in other parts of the country. I had no sleep, it was a high stress environment all the time, and I was even losing my hair towards the end of my employment there. Several more employees have since left since I have, with no regrets on leaving."
bad,"Management does not like to do their job and handle problems with other employees and brushes all problems under the rug. Will not honor requests for days off fixes the schedule for certain people only."
bad,"At the store I worked at Retail had to cover Restaurant's lack of organization almost on a daily basis. "
bad,They bad mouth there employee to other employees stressful work environment have one worker do more than others very big on favoritism will cut your hours if you don't do extra work that is not required of you even though you have done extremely amount of work no compassion for the employees
bad,Too many years in the industry to put up with there idea of acceptable service. Standards are very strict but rarely enforced. Incredible turnover which makes it near impossible to have a shift without problems
bad,"Kept to yourself"
bad,"Lots of items got stolen, the busboys often times stole the waitress tips and in one incident a crew workers money got stolen from her phone case. I dont recommend anyone working here especially if they are just starting off."
bad,"Job was fast paced, stressful, and understaffed.  I learned customer service skills, cooking, and maintenance of kitchen machinery.  Management needs improvement."
bad,"Not a fun work environment.  Guest are very difficult to please, very demanding.  Employees show up when ever, no one cares enough to be on time or at times even show up."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"I was a skill trainer with Cracker Barrel for almost 2 years. I was constantly asked to stay late and cover shifts or do extra, not that i minded as a role model that is expected but it did not  seem to gain me any more respect as an employee. The one time I told management no  i was written up in front of my guests in the dinning room. Highly unprofessional and do not recommend this company"
bad,"A typical day at cracker barrel involved hiding from certain managers you feel are out to get you. Then, also avoiding anyone who has been there longer than you, because all of the employees gossip, and will be the first to throw you under the bus for being new(er) and not as experienced as them. Doing things by the book isnt good enough for them, stepping outside the box and helping the company is not okay, and you get reprimanded. You cant win for losing at cracker barrel. If you like to be told exactly what to do, when to do, and how to do it, then cracker barrel is the place for you."
bad,"The scheduling manager doesn't take your time off into consideration when making the scheduling. When you request time off it gets denied almost instantly. The customers are often rude, especially during the holidays."
bad,on average crackerbarrel is understaffed and runs long ticket times during good hours so the customers get annoyed and tip less you work long hours and are paid less than you should be and some of the management is not practically qualified and do not handle certain situations properly i once worked a 14 hour shift without a break and ended up doing one of the more time consuming sideworks the place is overall not clean and not cleaned properly
bad,"Management was condescending and rude. Would take their anger or frustration out on the workers. The only good part was that we all kept our tips, but there was a lot of favoritism"
bad,"I was blessed to work with a great team with outstanding management, however this does not compensate for them paying you 2.35 an hour and making you work 3 hours past your out time without pay."
bad,My day would start off slow and then it would only get busy at most 3 times out of my whole shift.My managers would only nag and sit in there office . It would be very rare when they helped.
bad,"everyone who works there, including the management is very rude. everyone is always stressed out beyond belief. not great pay. they break tons of health rules in the kitchen."
bad,"You really have to love serving to work here, It takes a special person. There are better places to serve, with better people, better management, and better tips."
bad,"*Bossy co-workers "
bad,Very low pay and shift change constantly.  They call you on your day off and expect you to drop everything and work the shift.  They are not big on giving 5-10 minute breaks for an 8 hour shift.  Constant standing and downtime frowned upon.
bad,"A good job for teenagers looking to make a little extra cash. Good for those who want to be a waitress/waiter. "
bad,"This job is transferable all around the world which is a plus. But no matter where you go management picks there favorites. Some are nicer than others(but they are under a lot of stress with the hours they work)"
bad,"I worked here for ten years and the turnover is very high. The current culture of the Lancaster store is very abusive, and allows the cooks to be as well. Theres a lot of screaming. decent wages most days."
bad,"I said I'd like to work 15-20 hrs weekly. 3 weeks I had no hours. Mother's Day week 22 hrs. Many weeks 5-9 hrs. Sent home early or shifts cancelled because of ""too many labor hours"". By the time I quit (8 months later) I had to juggle 3 other jobs because I was so behind on my finances. Later on I found out that almost every long-time employee had quit after 7-15 years. Because of shortened hours."
bad,"If you have a problem, don't count on a manager here to care. Instead of giving you the hours you need to do your job, they cut hours, overwork you, ignore your issues and just don't care all in the name of greed. Their bonuses are the only thing that matter. You are not allowed to leave the building, have to have your coat searched, wear clear purses and frankly it feels like working in a prison cafeteria. The Managers are highly overpaid and lazy. If you don't want to work, just come to this company and be a manager!"
bad,"I would be scheduled until 8 p, but not able to leave until 10 or sometimes 11 due to all the silverware they made you roll. The environment is too fast-paced and very crowded. There needs to be more space and if you have to stay late, you should be payed more than just the $2.40 an hour."
bad,"management was difficult"
bad,I worked at Cracker Barrel for 2 1/2 years. It was great at first then I got pregnant. The manager Steven Good was very very judge mental and condescending while I was pregnant. He would crack small jokes about me being a single mother and that I lived off the government. All lies. I worked hard for my kids and to be pregnant and work as a server at cb was mentally and physically and emotionally stressful. I worked with older people who acted like teenagers. Eventually I snapped on an employee and ended up being fired and they kept the other employee even though he instigated the argument. Overall this environment is not for the sensitive or shy person. It’s every man for themselves here.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"Rough practices are in place for back of the house employees, management is god awful.The culture of this company is to squeeze every drop of work they can out of their employees until they quit, then find new blood."
bad,The guest can be great or rude and make you want to walk out so with the mangers. Therr are good discounts. But severs can't get raise at all and only get paid 3.35 per hour in idaho.
bad,"A typical day at work varied. Some days I would come in and we’d be on a thirty minute wait and other times, the place looked barren. Management was very poor. Four managers and none of them never wanted to do anything to help further the restaurant. They treat their employees poorly and play favorites. The hardest part of the job was how much work we as hostesses had to do. We bussed tables, cleaned, and more. The most enjoyable part of my job was my coworkers. Everyone was very nice to me from start to finish. Would not recommend to anyone unless they like fast paced environments with little to no breaks and ugly uniforms."
bad,The only part of the job that I enjoyed was seeing everybody’s smiling face as I sat them down for their meals. They company is too strict on their dress code and think it’s still 1960 when men weren’t allowed to wear jewelry.
bad,"I've worked here for about 2 years, I'm a closing server, hostess, prep cook, to-go server, and a SA. Our managers like to play favorites and only certain employees have reprecusions for their actions. Overall I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone with a soul."
bad,Management does not respect boundaries set when hired. You can tell them what days you absolutely need off and they will still fight with you on it and make you stay later. I am a full time student and it was a daily occurence for my manager to call me and try to get me to come in while I was in class.
bad,"Very busy day.  That standing on your feet all day is had on the back & feet.  Nice people to work with, but management was lacking professionalism.  I would have like working in the gift shop area much better.  I wasn't cut out to be a waitress."
bad,this job had so many managers im not even sure which was which. the staff was very much like being in high school again and though they gave you breaks there were so many rules attatched to them it was kind of pointless to take them
bad,Rude management! I got a give minute break once  every two hours!@ stressed  me out.. didn't  pay me what the originally said  they was going to pay. I didn't like this place early all.
bad,"Bonus system in shambles, staff non existent, good old boy system, lack of communication, out dated technology, and anyone making decent money being pushed out."
bad,"I loved this job when I first started. It then later became stressful, fights broke out very often. Employees would try and stab people. There were gang related fights that happened there. I was always having y tips stolen off my table. I was just not happy nor was I safe at this job. So I would never recommend anyone to this job, unless it took better management and the managers took more responsibilities with there job titles. Then the employees would not be running over them or threating them violently."
bad,Cracker Barrel is very fast paced and cutthroat. The restaurant that I worked at would hire anybody that applied and none of them would ever be trained.
bad,"Honestly the customers are the best part of working at Cracker Barrel. Some of the staff is really enjoyable to work with, but its the mangers that need some readjusting. Their management style clearly doesn't work but they are too comfortable and lazy to change anything about it."
bad,Ok place to work. Co workers are lazy and theres no team work. Sidework is easy but rolling takes forever. There over an hour not on the floor and still making 2.13 an hour.
bad,Ive been working at cracker barrel for a year its a good job for a teenager but not adlut you its alot of work but not enuff pay for the average adult
bad,"On a typical day a dishwashing employee may expect to bus tables, separate dishes, clean dishes, and stack them. The social environment is toxic, as people (including management) will yell sometimes when things are moving slowly. I was typically the one to pick up the slack. The hardest part was dealing with this."
bad,"I have been working there for about 4 years, it is flexible, and you get great training but being a server isn't something i want to do for the rest of my life, but its a great place to start out in."
bad,This job was a great first time serving job to teach you hard work and patience. This was not my first job but was my first serving job. I liked the environment and made a lot of friends.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,I worked at a Cracker Barrel in Columbia SC. Where managers would not attempt to help you not would they be willing to work with your school schedule. Had 16 and 17 year olds working doubles with a hour break knowing there's rules about the minor labor then yell at the kids because they didn't let them know. Would work doubles then have to stay at least 2 hours after my shift to do sidework and silverware. Like I said it was great money but all but one manager was selfish. They would just sit back and watch us fail and then yell and scream in our face about it.
bad,"Cracker Barrel could be a very enjoyable place to work.  However, the entire time I was there - 1 1/2 years - the cook staff was terrible.  There were days when customers waited 45 minutes to get their food.  The managers are inconsistent in everything, and some of them play favorites.  You get great hours when business is booming, then you get cut way back when it is slow.  It is impossible to make a consistent living.  Workers that have been there for a while think they are experts and treat new people horribly.  I would never advise anybody to work there.  What bare bones benefits they do have are horrible."
bad,"Lots of stuff to do. Selling product had to be an art form, and fast, elaborate transactions were key. The team's mood was the most important factor. If everyone is happy, the mood pushes the night."
bad,There is very little to say about this company. The management as an whole is o.k. but still has a lot of room for improvement. Sometimes showing your employees you value them goes a long way.
bad,"A typical day is cashing/monitoring sales floor, checking cleanliness of bathrooms and generally keeping store inviting to the public."
bad,"Server isle lacks control by management.  Many employees on cell phones constantly after being told not too, profanity is constant, loud unpleasant music played in kitchen, server isle floor extremely dirty, wet and slippery.  Sometimes management will cut you off the floor long before your shift ends resulting in working about 1 1/2 - 2 hours after that for the hourly server rate with no tips.  You will never get out of there when you're scheduled too. Breaks are highly discouraged.  If you work here, be prepared to break your neck working for very little money."
bad,"I provided customers with a wonderful dining experience."
bad,My time at Cracker Barrel was a hostile. My typical day of work and coming in on time and doing what needs to be done. What I learned was putting up displays and following the rules that follow. Management there is un-organized when it comes to employees and customers. Some of my co-workers gets the job done and dependable. The hardest part of the job is proving all you can do and its still not satisfying to them.. The most enjoyable part is having fun meetings.
bad,"Working here was horrible. I was never told I was seasonal (apparently they never told at least 5 others too)- in fact I was told I could work there all through college and that they would work with me and my hours. I was never told I was laid off. I got no notice for anything. No calls or anything. "
bad,"Working at Cracker Barrel is definietly an experience I will not forget.I handle customers of all races, and backgrounds. We serve and aim to please every guest that visits us every single time. It's a neat place to work if you have a busy life, are attending school or have a big family. They are very flexible with your schedule and you make up your shift. Essentially employees don't work more than 5 hours, so breaks are not given at any shift. Employee receive discounts on food, clothes and retail items in the store. I love my co-workers and the people on the management team, especially my boss in the retail department."
bad,Where people comes and get a good breakfast lunch and dinner good family dinner. Its a very fast pace company inwhich the food has to come out 9 minutes or less.
bad,"My husband and I worked here for several years. Their management is constantly changing and getting fired for this or that, and they will schedule their employees horribly long shifts and refuse their employees opportunities for breaks. They have a system of advancement built in but they will do everything they can to make sure you don't advance. We did have two good managers the whole time we were there, but they were only associate mgrs and couldn't do enough to make up for the company habits."
bad,"I absolutely love my coworkers.  We are a great team and truly feel like a family.  During our busiest times we pull together and help each other to get thru incredibly busy, and stressful, high volume dining times.  Our managers are under a lot of stress from the corporate office to keep their labor costs down.  As a result we are short staffed most of the time.  This causes uncomfortable guest situations that go unanswered by our management staff because they are too busy in the kitchen to come out and speak directly with customers.  That being said our managers are amazingly generous and help us whenever they can.  They strongly encourage us to do our best at all times and even when it feels like things are spinning out of control they are able to pull us back into order again."
bad,"Enjoyed the guest "
bad,"Not even a break room ,most of the time we didnt get a break.From the time we punch in till the time we punch out we worked non stop."
bad,"I always thought i would enjoy working at cracker barrel because it was ""home cooking"", totally false! At the time i had this job i was also in college, my managers were not understanding of my school schedule at all. I was forced to work the closing shift every night and was always asked to work overtime when i had told them ahead of time what my school schedule looked like.  I think that management was seriously Lacking at this particular store. The were always understaffed in the busiest times creating so much stress and friction. The kitchen was a disgusting mess and food safety rules were not always followed!"
bad,I hated working there. I got paid $7.25 and got about 12 hours a week.
bad,"Typical Day:"
bad,"A lot of the job was cleaning, labeling, dating foods and running trays."
bad,"I was a new mother it was hard balancing work school and a child"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,It is a okay job if you are in high school. Otherwise I wouldn't take it that someone mature would want to be bother with this job.
bad,I worked here while attending college full time. The majority of the time the resturant was ran in a non efficient manner. This was not a culture of appropriate business attitudes.
bad,"Used to be a good company to work"
bad,"To much expected of one person and not appreciated enough, management is not concerned about the work load on employees and pressure them to do more than expected of them"
bad,"When I worked there, the place was chaos.  The managers were awful, in so far as, they were always yelling at the employees.  It's an awful place to work if you're anxious."
bad,"Cracker Barrel as a restaurant is very good and quite pleasurable to be in. Wide variety of food selection and excellent service. However, the team culture was lacking and could use a team meeting to encourage servers and managers to work together."
bad,District manager and regional vp were deceptive and conniving. They undermined my authority at every turn.  Did not give praise for anything that was accomplished.
bad,It was very annoying to get my schedule on Thursday.  I could not make any plans for the weekend or the rest of the week.  My manager never gave me a chance.  She chose certain people to do everything.  She used to feel free to straighten my shirt or apron often instead of telling me it needed to be done.  Shifts were only four hours after commuting an hour each way.
bad,"I was grateful for the opportunity I was given, and the ability to progress in job status. You get a lot of knowledge from everyone that you work with in all positions. However, the employee management relationships could be improved."
bad,Would like my job to be dependable i never know what hours i get never knew what the syress level of manager woild be asked for more hours no can do they hire more people so really they dont care for loyalty
bad,"There was really no room or opportunity for growth. The managers always changed but the food was amazing. Everytime a new items was introduced, we got the chance to taste it first."
bad,It's easy to get in a location where you can felt held back from your potential. The general manager controls the flow of the business. There is little physical involment. From your district manager.
bad,"Cracker Barrel started out as an ok place to work in college. They were pretty flexible with my school schedule at first, but began to schedule me when I was marked unavailable (for class) and then would act like it was my fault that I couldn't come in when they were the ones who scheduled me out of my submitted availability. Management was sub par at best. Store managers aren't too bad. GM was a jerk most of the time. He plays favorites HARD. I got written up for not having enough ice in the pitcher I was taking around the dining room, but there were employees who showed up late every single day and never received a write up. Tips are good on weekends, but pretty low during the weeknights (I've heard weekday mornings are decent money, but didn't work many of those). Most of the customers are elderly people, but they are usually very friendly. Coworkers were the best part of the job, and what kept me around for so long. We were very much like a family and they were very supportive. Always willing to help out. You have to buy your own uniform (besides the apron). Employees receive a food and gift shop discount and that is pretty much the only thing I truly miss about the job."
bad,Most of the employees I interacted with were very helpful and caring but the management ruined it for me. This place did not care about you in any way shape or form
bad,"Management didn’t care about employees, just wanted bodies in the building. Management was a revolving door of different people. Every shift there was stressful because only 1-3 servers actually did their job. The hosts would triple seat one server & skip another server’s turn in rotation. The dishwashers sent out dirty dishes. The cooks sexually harassed me & every other female that worked there and management did nothing about it even though they knew. Management didn’t care about your availability, they scheduled you when they felt like it. In the end, I had to leave because Cracker Barrel was such a toxic place for me. I’ve been much happier since I left."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,They are worried about labor dollars so much that they lose all of their employees. They would rather send someone home than have them do there job duties which makes it fall on one or two people.
bad,"I enjoyed working here as a server however, it was almost impossible to get a day off for vacation or to find covers for shifts. It was extremely hard to balance life and work especially for a 17 year old working towards college. The managers weren’t the greatest either. If you called out feeling extremely sick or had a family emergency they wouldn’t let you off easy at all."
bad,"Poor scheduling, poor management, always understaffed. Lack of teamwork, negative energy between servers. Lots of high school drama. Overworked and under paid."
bad,"Very stressful in Pantry. I work by myself most of the time and my boss expects me to get 3 different areas done in 10 hours and it's impossible!!! I work like 7 to 8 hours in pantry, they want biscuits and cornbread done and also jump to prep side. I'm give 100 percent everyday and do my best and they expect to much for little pay."
bad,"very fast paced work enviroment,,management is very willing to work with you but very under staffed,On weekends expect to work you're butt off 12-14 hr shifts of non stop cooking(no breaks)you get a food n store discount,"
bad,"Retail management was like a black widow spider, or an iron maiden. Kind to your face but plotting your end and making as if she forced you out,  she was very good at that, and she would tell you that.  Mgr. Would follow you  around to bathroom etc."
bad,"Crackerbarrel, you make great tips, even on slow days if your a great server you'll still make great tips.  I'm not sure about all the other locations, but there was poor management at the Craig and Losee location, don't let that be the reason to not apply & get a job there though, they don't pay enough attention for you to move up, it takes forever."
bad,"Cracker Barrel was a great company to work for then around 2010, the company changed and benefits went down and upper management went from caring about people to only caring about the share holders."
bad,"In this work environment, I was always stressed about something happening in the restaurant. It did not help when the other hostesses, servers, or managers would start yelling about something they think I did wrong."
bad,It could use alot of work especially with communication. Better management. Wish they were more understanding. Learn how to appreciate their servers more
bad,My experience was great up until I was forced to file a complaint against a co-worker who was sexually harassing me. The harassment stopped but my manger hated me and mistreated me after that going so far as to try to publicly humiliate and punish me (she made me do push ups while scolding me in front of a full house because I did not script to a party I was seating). I later found out that other coworkers and even customers had lodged complaints about his incredibly inappropriate behavior and still nothing was ever done except perhaps a slap on the wrist. I was denied schedule changes and was never given more working hours resulting in very little money. They also withheld a raise that I had earned and was promised. When a guest tipped me specifically my tips would be confiscated by co-workers claiming that hostesses are not allowed to accept tips.
bad,"Most of the time, the kitchen was understaffed so the managers were too busy in the kitchen than out in other areas of the restaurant. They care very little of their staff (unless you've been there for a while) and no matter how much you bide by their policy, it almost isn't enough."
bad,"the new manager at the place juts doesn't know what to do she sucks, and the salary is bad, i had to wake up really early to go to work and always here that she could fire me if she felt like it and its her store to do whatever she feels like it, it just made working really depressing"
bad,There's a lot going on at once. Received virtually no hands-on training. Learned on the fly exclusively. Kitchen layout is always changing with zero communication on those changes. Often left alone to do the work that usually requires 3 people. Management is hit or miss. Some are more helpful than others. Lackluster staffing needs on busiest days. Incredibly stressful.
bad,Management needs more communication within there staff also there’s no structure there so I feel Like I’m always walking into a mess by time I walk in.
bad,I only worked here a week and hated it they didn't train me the just pushed me out without any knowledge the scheduled me a 12-hour shift as a 16-year-old minor I never got any breaks and the manager was always gone
bad,"never anything to do"
bad,"It seems to me and a few other employees that the upper management seem to have an extreme ego and they tend make people with entry level jobs feel less important. Aside from that, the employees kinda get the feeling of being talked down to so it makes co-worker to co-worker relationships bond a little more. Thus making a very good team oriented style of work."
bad,"Cracker barrel was okay at first but then you start to realize the poor management, the way they do things and talk to you was very poor and unprofessional, they didn't tend to answer questions to help you they just yelled and you never got off until two hours later than the schedule would say ."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"I only worked here for about 4 months. My first day at Cracker Barrel was on a Sunday.(busiest day for CB) It was so hectic and I was so lost because no one was helping/training me. The manager would just constantly scold me and tell me I needed to do something besides stand around. I never received proper training, everything I learned was on my own. There was not one professional manager there. They would treat customers poorly & even talk about employees and guests behind their backs. It was a very stressful job & you'd think the managers would be willing to help and be kind especially since the motto is ""pleasing people"".Wrong."
bad,Loved the employees I worked with. Management not fair and sometimes ride to employees..you might go in and work for an hour and get sent home for the day of business was slow..No breaks but management sure took their breaks.
bad,I learned that you could hardly ever get help from management because they acted to good to do any work especially when it counted the most for the customers.
bad,"Do not waste your time working there was a dishwasher, you will be treated like cattle and worked like a pack mule. As a dishwasher you do everything except cook the food and I'm surprised we don't do that. The managers are very incompetent and act like they have no idea what they're doing. They help everyone else in the store especially the cooks but won't even look in our direction because they know that being a dishwasher there is pretty terrible. They will only schedule one person to work in the dishroom even on the busiest of days because they are just that cheap and don't want to pay anyone. You only get paid 9 an hour which isn't worth it at all. The dishroom requires at least 3 people to work back there but most of the time you will be back there by yourself to do everything. In the dishroom there are several stations where you have to wash pots, dishes, stack plates, and run the plates to the grill line and the grill cooks are so lazy they cant even walk two feet to get a stack of plates knowing we are very busy in the dishroom and have the nerve to complain. Don't even get me started with those lazy servers they are something else, they don't give a care about you at all and most of them will talk trash about you for no reason at all because that one person doing everything didn't get the buss tub the exact second they call it and most of the time the buss tub isn't even full. Oh and don't be in there on the closing shift on a busy day or even when it's not too busy, of course you have to wash dishes during business hours but then when its time to close you have to"
bad,I hated my job. I was underpaid. You run your butt off and do so much in the store and barely get any pay raises. You are expected to do so much and make up for other staff members.
bad,Managers are very condescending to employees not cooperative co workers are not helpful they only care about their own tables or responsibilities no teamwork
bad,"This store has been through so many managers in the past few months it's crazy.  That could be a major reason for most of the issues.  Employees are over worked, often being expected to work open to close with a short break somewhere in the middle of the day, if your lucky.  This goes for both FOH & BOH employees.  Management talks down to and scolds employees on a regular basis.  You are often scheduled outside of your availability or on days that were approved off.  Employees are having verbal arguments with each other and management,  often resulting in people walking out or quitting in the middle of their shift.  Management seems to have those they favor, who can pretty much get away with whatever they want, while others get sent home or written up over petty things.  Servers are being put in the kitchen to cook, work prep line and assist with dishes.  While hourly employees are being kept sometimes hours beyond their shift, management is leaving the second they are scheduled to leave and they don't look back.  While I really do like most of my co-workers, it's a very high stress server position, unlike anything I've ever experienced.  Most days the tips are really good and that's what keeps me there."
bad,"Came in with a BS in Business but was desperate for a job so I worked in retail. Got paid very little. I was firm in that I wanted and NEEDED fulltime hours but not once did I get them. I was also firm in that I could not work after 7pm due to my children, but they ALWAYS scheduled me late hours, sometimes even having me close. The manager had her favorites and was not shy about showing it. Most of the older employees were nice but the younger girls were full of drama and had their cliques. Made for a very uncomfortable work environment. Not a bad first-time job but not something I wanted to stick around for. Was THRILLED to leave."
bad,"Such a terrible job because of management . Management was never helpful, they didn’t care at all about what you had to say. The staff was so un team oriented. It was so stressful. They money was good but the stress wasn’t worth it."
bad,"Overall, Cracker Barrel isn’t a horrible place to work for but I personally am not happy working in a restaurant and would like a change of pace, preferably in a retail or sales associate position."
bad,Good summer job good food . The pay was ok but not enough to live off of. Decent management.  Decent atmosphere and family friendly. Discounts are ok for meals
bad,The schedule was unorganized and caused under staffing or over staffing most nights. Management did not take care of hour request changes in an efficient manor and working conditions were uncomfortable.
bad,"No work life balance, great pay no life outside cracker barrel. Not a great location to work in lots of minors in dishroom, resulted in a lot of labor by closing manager, extending closing hours doing paper work after and sending out numbers for the day."
bad,"Not so great for people that need to provide significant income unless you've been there for 5 years or more. Shifts are few and far between and when you get a shift, the waitresses are cutthroat to get the tips."
bad,I never liked working here. The management only cares about making money and have give no consideration to people's personal lives. They work people like slaves over there.
bad,"Working as a server is supposed to be a little challenging, but the whole point of working in an environment with other people is that your co-workers are supposed to help you out and make it go a little easier. Not where I work. No one helps anyone and the managers don't care. Similarly, they foster an unhealthy environment where we have to almost beg guests to buy drinks/products that aren't quality (crafted coffees, for one). The clientele at Cracker Barrel are the same at every single one, traveler's, locals, and older people, so you get a lot of interesting stories, but usually the regulars don't tip because they've been coming to the Barrel since the dawn of time, when prices were a lot lower. However, if you have a good section, you make a lot of money because it typically is a very busy restaurant since it's a household name. Overall, my experience at Cracker Barrel has been overwhelmingly mixed. The money is ALMOST worth the amount of stress that my co-workers give me."
bad,my experiece with cracker barrel has been a eventful experience to say the least. i love the poeple i work with & enjoy my job but i dont agree with the way some of us are treated by managment.
bad,"Worked varied hours, days off were cancelled from time to time due to excessive call offs of staff."
bad,"No steady hours. Hours would fluctuate week to week. There were weeks that would average to 30 hours for weeks at a time. The team was good to work with, but no room for advancement."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,They do not treat employees equally. They do not know how to correctly handle situations. They accuse people unfairly. Have had hours cut suddenly. Shows favoritism
bad,"Higher upper mgmt consistently creating VP roles, but cut field employees & labor hours so field mgrs & employees are stretched too thin. Too many rules, policies, audits to do any job 100% & have made the simple job of Pleasing People nearly impossible with all the unrealistic expectations upper mgmt have."
bad,"Working at this location started out fine and dandy. I had a decent amount of hours, my coworkers were nice, management was nice, but then things changed. Management started scheduling me for jobs that I didn't apply for (i.e. Busser instead of Host). It would have been one thing if they had asked or even given me a heads up before hand but they didn't. Not only did they do that once, they did it twice. Management doesn't know how to communicate with their employees. Then me and other hosts started to only get put on the schedule once or twice a week for a total of 6hrs or less. I am currently at the point where they didn't put me on the schedule at all. The customers their can be very rude (which is usual in any restaraunt), especially since you're dealing with such an older demographic."
bad,I was told i was going to be full time and only ended up working 1-2 hour days. If I even worked at all. The managers were very nice but i just could not afford to stay there.
bad,"was not provided with proper training, everyone was searched as we were leaving, like we were some  kinda criminal. and was made to feel small if i asked for help,"
bad,Money wasn’t worth the work.  People hardly ever tip you what you deserve. People are rude. The environment is not very clean and just old. Wouldn’t recommend working here.
bad,"the scheduling manager was never there when i was so i couldn't change my schedule of working 30 hours in 3 days. "
bad,"Friendly co workers, mostly. Half off food, very little breaks, long hours during weekends and holidays. Poor pay. Poor pay. Poor a pay. Not much to look forward to in promotions. Dead end job."
bad,"there is a huge drop in sale and people coming to cracker barrel during the summer months, hours will drop and they like double the highers during this month cutting even more"
bad,"No advancement opportunities promised cross training never happened. Good people a lot of hard workers, very fast paced. Restaurant hours mandate weekends but a good thing was if we request off in advance it was usually granted."
bad,Management is terrible. Food never goes out on time. Guests tend to get angry all the time. Managers are rude and don’t care about their employees at all. Otherwise pay is good and co workers are great too
bad,"Working there was very stressful. Coworkers were unreliable, constantly calling in ""sick"" or just not showing up making the rest of us cover for them. While this is not the managers fault, some people would get in trouble for certain things, while others would just get laughed at about the same issues."
bad,When store firsted open was wonderful but now just not completely  sure anymore hours have realy been cut work environment  not relaxing anymore customers are very nice all the time I work with a great crew but mangament  needs a lot of help with dealing with employees needs
bad,"Tough to be a manager there.  No balance with work and life.  Thanksgiving becomes  your least favorite holiday, but Christmas off is nice.  If you overnight doesn't show, you get to work 18 hours...your 20 plus the 8 you have to stay over."
bad,"It wasn't the worst job in the world definitely not, and I wasn't the best employee even for a dish washer. But the job was garbage, if something was broken that could be considered hazardous they pretended they couldn't see it and they maybe fixed something once. They didn't mind if food came out with a smudge of old eaten food on a plate as long as it went through the dish washing machine quickly. Sometimes industrious behavior can become cynical once they become rushed underpaid and start to care too little for their employees."
bad,"The manager at this location is one of those ""has been"". He brings down everyone around him just to make him feel better. When management changed, the employees started to leave or relocate to another job. He did not care about anyone advancement."
bad,"absolutely hated working there. They hire way too many people so you never get the hours you want, the shifts are typically 3 hours long, coworkers are rude and lazy. Servers are required to do basically all the work in the restaurant even though you don't get more than a dollar on your paycheck because of taxes. Dishes/silverware is ALWAYS dirty and they are given to the guests that way. Guests always complain about how gross the food and silverware is. The customers are low-paying old people that tip no more than $2. Only way to make money here is to work all day long. hated it"
bad,"I worked at CB for a few months before I quit. The main general manager for the location i was at was sexist and had a very mean demeanor, not professional at all. He would make remarks over the speaker/headsets to me that were not appropriate. Very fast paced though and need to be able to stand for awhile and face people who want to sit in certain spots and complain about it to your face. Otherwise the company itself is good, yummy food, excellent coca cola cake!!"
bad,I worked for this company from 2016 to mid 2017. Some of the management doesn't care about their employees when it comes to them being hurt on the job. Their are some management that worked there who made false statements on some paperwork and kept me from getting paid when I had to take medical leave due to an injury i had sustained while working for this company.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,I have always liked the retail store and food of Cracker Barrel.  Thought I would like working there but you never find out certain things till after you start the job.   At this point in my life I don’t want to be ironing clothes everyday for work or rechecking the weekly schedule already assigned for me to see if it has changed. It doesn’t work for me. I need a set weekly schedule. It may all work for others who don’t care about either of those.
bad,"At times I enjoyed working here, the shifts would go by semi quickly, Good teamwork was a big focus here,  other times it wasn't quite as smooth, Managers had bad tempers and would often curse at workers. Had to worry about coworkers stealing tips."
bad,the management is out of syncwith everything that's going on in the restaurant and it reflects on their management styles to a degree where it comes down on the workers as if everything is our fault
bad,"working st cracker barrell can be a very stressful and competitive work environment. the best job to have at cracker barrell is a server, you make $10 to $12 an hour just in tips."
bad,"Working on the retail side of Cracker Barrel is like one huge joke- they make you keep track of the sales per hour, like selling the gaudy clothes, overpriced toys, and hideous looking knick-knacks actually means anything or is why people come to Cracker Barrel. They're constantly pushing you to sell candles and what-not to customers who are obviously just in there to eat at the restaurant. When I was new, they pushed me to try and sell a candle to a young man who proceeded to hit on me, ask for my number, and where I went to school. Always had customers asking me stupid, mocking questions about what I was trying to sell/force down people's throats at the moment. It was actually a pretty demeaning job. They would set me up in the middle of the overly crowded, tiny store side of Cracker Barrel, and try to get me to give out free samples to people who had already ate at the restaurant. The uniform they make you wear is completely silly as well; they make sure EVERY time you work you have all the proper creases in your apron, or pants, or shirt. The girls I worked with were fat, and rude to me. They would always make me go unclog the toilet, and turned it into a cruel joke. My managers were very nice. The male coworkers I had at the host stand would come up and bother me when I was giving out samples, and one time I had to have my mom come in and tell one of my managers that they were bothering me. If you like being a pushy sales person who is constantly made fun of, or a loser in a specially ironed, hideous uniform that is paid horribly, then go ahead and work here."
bad,It was a high stress place and the managers expect you to do everything at once. It's impossible to get a break unless you beg for it. The people that come to eat expect way too much.
bad,"I need something better, prefer all days. Pays well, has health insurance and good environment! It's too much drama and not enough hours! Not enough benefit"
bad,"Never worked in the kitchen before. Understand I had to keep a good pace but had no understanding from management. Was alone to soon, didn't seem to be able to ask questions comfortably"
bad,I hated every single weekend. It was too busy the wait could be up to 2 hours. The most enjoyable part had to be leaving to be honest. Too much work and not enough recognition.
bad,"they truly do not care about employees.  Talks about caring, yet do not really put into action.  they do not believe in long term employees. burn and term."
bad,Many of the other waitresses were mean and very unhelpful. Nobody was willing to help on busy days (Sat and Sun). Managers were constantly yelling. A lot of yelling between the kitchen and crew outfront.
bad,"I had a terrible experience, management calling people names, yraining sucked, ghostoirs cut, sent home early,coworkers were awesome though and unrealistic ticket times"
bad,The company wants too much for a person working for minimum wage. Lots of drama within the workforce. The hardest part was trying to talk customers who were at a restaurant to eat into purchasing retail products. The only enjoyable part of the job was a few of the other associates I worked with.
bad,"I don't have too much to say about this job, besides i wouldn't work there again. the pay was okay, but i was always on only two days a week and most of the co-workers were not welcoming."
bad,Family restaurant with good values. The menu had a variety to choose from making our job exciting. It was fast paced and always had routine work. Good friendly people.
bad,"Terrible employees do not get a slap on the wrist, because it is expected of them to be bad employees, but if a good employee does something wrong, they never hear the end of it. overall work is easy and does not require a lot of brain power, but is tough work after standing on your feet for hours and having guests upset with you."
bad,the management staff at cracker barrel is poor but they have very patient and well knowledgeable training staff. The employees can sometimes be rude and unproductive but most time they do what the need and are a pleasure to work with in the mornings. The employers there have little to no interest in schedule flexibility. Employees well diverse and for lack of better work cultured at times.
bad,"Would be a great company to work for, but my experience was poor due to management. These select few do not care about the business or their employees"
bad,At work mangers don't help at all for example I'm only host on staff and have to use the bathroom i ask for a manager to watch the podium so i can use the restroom and no one comes to help. I've been with the company for over a year and a half and only get 3-5 hours a week. I've had a time where a manager made a threat to smack me. only enjoyable part of this job was creating interpersonal relationships with coworkers or even the guest
bad,The food here is terrific but the work is another story. It seems like at times the company does not care about their workers. People tend to come in late and no action is ever taken. Management will care about you one day and then treat you like a stranger the next.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,It was a very good experience ..I learned much good and bad.Sometimes it was a great place to work.I really enjoyed my employees.
bad,I wouldn't recommend working at Cracker Barrel to people of color. I found that my managers where racist and one or two of them actively did drugs on the clock in the worker bathrooms. The hours are flexible mostly but to work here I believe you have to put on a completely different persona and I couldn't work with people who wanted to fight others over the notion that someone was stealing 'pills' from their locker. Im not saying all CB's are like this but they will blacklist you in order to prevent you from going to another branch and informing them about things going on that you don't agree with
bad,"Some of the managers treated the retail and cashiers with little to no respect, and they never supported or encouraged the new people.  They seemed to be in a bad mood 98% of the time; you were lucky if they said hello to you.If they didn't  like you, you didn't get very many hours. The retail ladies that have worked there for a long time were very clicky and could be rude/mean at times, definitely not ""team players"". It didn't seem too many employees liked their jobs. No breaks no matter how many hours you worked. If you asked to take a break, and if they said yes it was half-hearted. When you took the par test you were supposed to get a raise, I never got mine. BUT the dealing with the public was great, most of the customers were very nice. It was fun helping the customers shop for things. It's too bad the management wasn't better."
bad,"The customers and some of the co-workers are nice people. But the constant nagging from the manager and regional manner to sell is beyond ridiculous. They even do this in front of the customers if you are not up selling enough. I lost two sales in one shift because the manager made the customer so uncomfortable with her pushiness. Alot of BS favoritism going on here. Not even a thank you from the retail manager if you do your job well. For some reason they protect the college kids that work there, probably because they work the shifts that are tough to fill especially in summer."
bad,Horrible experience all around. Was a paycheck and that was all. Too many managers with conflicting agendas. Just wasn't a good experience for me at all
bad,"I use to love going to work for Cracker Barrel. "
bad,They do not promote teamwork because they are only interested in their own promotion and advancement. Management took no consideration for employee needs and scheduling. Sunday work was double shifts with only an hour break in between when asked to accomodate church attendance. Want too much for too little in return! Most enjoyable part of the job was leaving!
bad,"Management was bad, refused to put in for your raises that you were owed according to company standards, refused to pay you back for the time that you were waiting for them to put in for your raise, even if it was another three months. Was called in a multitude of times so the coworkers were not very reliable. However, the coworkers made it somewhat worth it to go in day in and day out. Not LGBT friendly."
bad,"I worked for store 12 in Knoxville TN and then transferred to Goodyear AZ. Do not work are Cracker Barrel!! You are required to push  products onto customers when all they want to do is come in and eat breakfast with their family, and if you don't push product or try to entice them to buy something then the sales being down is your fault. Also for being a down home/ country store, they don't care one bit about thier staff-they don't care if you need time off, they don't care if it's your day off, they don't care if you have already been there all day and don't want to close, all they want is an employee they can use until they are burned out and quit. My management in TN was wonderful, we all got along and we could all work together, here in AZ all the GM cared about was the restaurant and couldn't even talk to the retail people. I got yelled at for putting in my two weeks"
bad,"The managers don't treat their employees with respect. They are rude and also inappropriate. Some of the employees act like they are in high school as well. It's not a stable job. You never know how much money you are going to make for the day. Even though you have countless conversations with management about your schedule they will continue to mess with your schedule giving you random shifts or the very shifts you explained you could not work. This has been the worst place I have ever worked at, it's really sad there. The managers only care about themselves and making their money. It's very clear what or who they care about. They have favorites and even flirt with certain employees."
bad,"A typical day at work would include answering/transferring calls, ringing customers out, helping with retail sales. Most of my coworkers were nice and really helpful except part of the management and floor employees. Uniform is wayyy too strict for minimum wage. Very very nit-picky with everything. You have no sense of independence as you have to get a manager to approve EVERYTHING. You arent allowed to have drinks/snacks with you, even if you have an 8+ shift. You dont get a break unless its not busy and you ask, but it most likely wont be given to you. Sometimes hard to get a managers attention as they're busy with their own things. Very disorganized. If you're the last person on a drawer and it's short it's your fault, even if the person before you was the one that caused it. I loved most of my coworkers and made it more enjoyable but thats about it."
bad,"Wash dishes for hours and take out the trash"
bad,I would seat and serve customers while getting to know them. I would ensure they are being taken care of and have all needs met.
bad,I loed what i did their and wouldn't change it for the world. I gave a 2 weeks notice and the manager said no don't do that i will give you a leave in two weeks and come around and right back on the schedule no one told me about me being back on the schedule.
bad,There was one or two supervisors that I really liked but some of the others abused their power. I was bullied by one of the supervisors and I feel like they where intentionally trying to make me quit my job because of the attitude and various things they did. One manager would intentionally mess some of my work up so I would have to re-do it and he took the joking to far at times. I'm not sure if this individual is still there. I got good hours and a steady schedule at this job but the work load was a little unrealistic for my position. I think other positions in the restaurant would vary.
bad,"it is not as fun as used to be working there, very stressful job to many changes have taken place since the orginial owner has passed   away."
bad,"Providing excellent customer service. "
bad,"Was the worst restaurant chain I've ever worked for. Period!  No appreciation for the employees, ""Pleasing People"" is the motto, unfortunately mgr's have no backbone and let customers walk all over servers. They don't care about turnover and the place is a meat grinder for servers.  Benefits are good but not worth the stress. Won't even enter a Barrel again so be ware.  Long hours and very busy but always your fault. Go else where for a job with less stress and better management."
bad,Worked 30hours in 3 days. Not the place to work the management is very bad and cooperate is worse
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,Cashed customers out after they ate or bought things in the gift shop.  I learned how managers should not treat their employees! I had an allergic reaction to come face wash and I still went to work and the managers made fun fo how my face was red and swollen.  Made me cry at work then they just laughed about it.  Co-workers were pretty nice.  The hardest part of my job was putting up with the management and how rude they were to the customers and employees.
bad,"I like the people I worked with, never was a dull day til one of the managers that shouldnt be a manager was there. I only quit because she was manager and didnt understand my disorder"
bad,Getting to know the customers was the best part of the job. Most days were enjoyable.
bad,"The hardest job I ever had was rarely thanked or shown appreciation for that hard work. The dish room is always understaffed. This store is located in a mid to lower income area, it doesn't profit well, and the result is to ""cut"" people when not busy to save money. After lunch when it slows down, which is the busiest time for dish, one of the two people are sent home, leaving one person to carry out all of the dish room duties. Rarely does a manager step foot into the dish room."
bad,"ok so they say that team work is a big deal there and i agree without the team helping you all would fail, but even though they do help all you hear is how much they hate being there and how this person didnt do this or how bad of a person this person is or someone is stealing tips, bla bla bla."
bad,Cracker Barrel is an intense place to work. It is very physically demanding and teamwork is not a priority.
bad,"There are good highlights and bad highlights about working here, pay is minimal due to not given enough hours at all, co-workers some are lovely people and some are not, management definitely needs an upgrade but overall it’s an okay place to work."
bad,"Very unhelpful staff, when it comes to training. No team work at all. Managers are always too busy to actually train people correctly. Very unsatisfied working experience"
bad,"The general manager is highly unprofessional. He will find a reason to fire you for looking at him wrong. I was an employee for several years and I loved coming to my job. Once he was transitioned in, he absolutely killed the good vibe."
bad,They need to do an overhaul on management. To many chiefs and not enough indians. Rules and regulations change almost everyday. You have to ask what rules to follow when you clock in. No breaks. I worked 8-9hour shifts without a break. They check your apron and coat pockets at the end of your shift and women have to use a clear purse cause the overall company does not trust uany of the people
bad,Long story but to sum it up if you want to work part time and dont care how many hours you get you better have 2 or 3 more jobs cause they will not give you the hours you need for anything. I was sent home twice. The first time the etc said inwas the on the wrong day. The second time i arrived with my knee bothering me and they clained they had nothing for me to do. They were also trying to give neday shift when i work nightsm told me i knew when i was hired id be walking around alot. In my opinion for a hist/hostess job if you tell them you are having a problem standing thwy should give you a chair
bad,"The management needs to understand we are there for the guest, not them. The manager needs to learn how to speak to their employees. (This was one of the main reasons I left). The pay, hours, or benefits was not there for the employees that wanted to be there, but would go out of their way to hang on to employees that didn’t care and push others out the door."
bad,The kitchen equipment is in bad shape. The floor is uneven. Only work part of your hours even though you are promised 30+ hours. Messy all the time. You are required to work everyone else’s dirty mess
bad,"Cracker Barrel gave complete training, flexibility but was struggling with a car at time totally insensitive about that. I had to have the job to get vehicle was still making it to work tho, now I have a 🚗"
bad,"Working for this company was not beneficial to me in any way. The position had very little payback for all the effort required, seeing as they expected you to do more than what your job title asked. Management did not really seem to care much about employees."
bad,Good luck with this company management team don't care how hard you work. Co workers were better than managers they were all about team work. And ur under payed
bad,"Unsanitary, crab-in-a-barrel atmosphere, flexible work schedule, no manager assists dishwashers but assists every other position. Difficult to advance to a better position"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,You can ask for more hours but will not get them. The company is more worried about profits then its employees. Would not recommend to any of my friends.
bad,"It was fun for awhile, but, to many cooks In the kitchen. I mean everybody wanted one thing in particular no matter what u did to make someone happy it didn't matter."
bad,It was an ok job but to stressful for the pay. Managment was rough long shifts with no break at least you could use bathroom on the clock. Overall working there was pretty bad.
bad,"Stressful, poorly managed. Lots of turnover. Pay is low. Would not recommend this as a first job training is poor 1 day and then you're expected to know exactly what to do and how."
bad,working there was very stressful because they’d have host do everything plus hosting and that would break us up mentally and physically. and the management was horrible help.
bad,"It was a rough 3 years.  My particular manager loved that I worked like a dog, but didn't  want me to leave her by advancing so she kept me from that."
bad,Cracker Barrel tries to hire managers below their experience level and make them compete for positions. The locations that they placed at managers at where at least a 45 minutes drive. Nobody wants to help each other out. No team it’s every man for themselves.
bad,"It wouldn’t be my first choice to work here. Overall, it was a good job but it was very hectic and chaotic. The hours definitely weren’t the best. If you’re traveling for this job the money isn’t enough."
bad,"If you are a by the book type person this would be a good job for you.  But if you are like me, meaning your life doesn't always run on a specific schedule (because I am a single mother and kids do not care about your obligations lol), then don't bother.  Management is not understanding or flexible whatsoever."
bad,"They booked doubles at least once a week, with a ""break"" in between for legal reasons. However, no table left exactly on time so you worked through the break. Up to 12 hrs on your feet with no official rest. Burns from trays regular and expected. Management NOT supportive. Drama between coworkers. Horrible experience."
bad,I was seasonal and I have never spent 4 hours board folding shirts before nor will I ever again. I was sent outside with no coat in December to hang up wreaths. Just not a place you want to be seasonal.
bad,"Certain managers there are in charge of the schedule and they are terrible with it. They'll schedule you on days that you've requested off.  Sometimes, they'll even expect one host to take on days that we're at our busiest. I feel that the pay does not compensate for the amount of work that we have to do at times."
bad,"a typical work day requires a minimum of more than half of your work completed, no complaints or complications, but the most enjoyable part of the job was clocking in."
bad,They barely give you any hours. They forget about the existing hostesses and hire new ones that take your hours. I got about 3 hours for each day I worked
bad,"Went from making great money with great hours with one gm to barely getting by and hours all jacked up. We were making progress on making the store better until the new gm was ""hand picked"" (her words) and the place started sinking. Horrible place to work right now. Was there 5 years and never planned on leaving until she showed up."
bad,"A typical work day went well or bad depending on the manager as at any other job. Most of them come in reiking of alcohol as well as some co workers too. Oh, take note that if you are new expect the seasoned servers to steal your silverware once you get put of your 2 day training.  I learned to kiss butt very well both managers and customers. If you are new trying to work for this company my advice would be to not get comfortable at Cracker Barrel and always keep a plan B and C. This company has the worst turn over rate in its district. If you come in as a cook expect to never have a Sunday off unless you've been there over 4 years, or unless you just enjoy the money if you are a server. Expect the managers to talk about you in a nonprofessional manner. And expect to be humiliated from time to time. The company can not make food cost so do not let them trick you into thinking your few months being employeed there is the cause or blame. You are not a robot or a multitool unless you are compensated for it. Remember this and you'll be fine !"
bad,"Out of date equiptment, poor communication, low pay and hours as well as continual customer service issues, needs better management."
bad,In all it's not a very friendly environment to work in its hostile if you go to the management with a problem that you seem to sweep it under the rug do they tell you they're going to do something about it but they don't
bad,"The job wasn't bad per se. The management and employees could have used a firmer hand, majority of the employees and one of the managers didn't even do their job correctly."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,Gained a lot of experience with customers and diverse clientele. Would not work there again due to poor management and unfair treatment of employees in the work place.
bad,This place is not one i would recommend to anyone. The management doesn't care about their staff and they are very strict considering where the restaurant culture is heading. you better show up early or on time and expect to stay an hour past the time you were supposed to leave. PICK ANOTHER RESTAURANT
bad,Working here is not super difficult but you have to have a lot of patience to deal with older guests. You also have to be able to bear with country music played at all times.
bad,Managers can be rude and are almost never willing to work with you. You'll end up working 8 hours a day and you'll be refused a break every shift. I worked there for almost 3 years and they forced me out over nothing.
bad,This will be my first experience working at Cracker Barrel if you hire me I'll be the best you ever had. I have been at Posados for 2 years. How do I say kitchen work I have a lot of experience
bad,"Not enough to live off of.some weeks 8 to 10 hours a week.  Raises are annual and only usually like 10 to 15 cents. "
bad,Was undergoing a new general manager while I was there. He was so rude to everyone. Didn't give anyone any respect including any of the other managers working there.
bad,"This place is a great college job, they are very willing to work with your schedule, and days off that you need. However, I worked there for a year, and was only given one 30 minute lunch break. The restaurant is constantly busy, and you are constantly working on something, with no break."
bad,Cracker Barrel is a very fast paced restaurant. Their mission goal is pleasing people. I did not like working st Cracker Barrel because the management was not great and things weren’t organized very well.
bad,"Being a cashier at Cracker Barrel was a good experience.  The guests are very friendly, and I enjoyed working there.  It was just hard to survive only getting to work 15 hours a week."
bad,The pay was very low and the place was dirty. I liked the management but the organization of the place needed to be way better. I didn't learn anything. It was an easy hostess job that allowed me to interact with different types of people.
bad,"I am not sure how things are now, however, while I was employed there, the management was very poorly staffed and trained.  Their interactions with employees were less than satisfactory."
bad,"I am biased in that I am a horrible server. They had a great training system, but I do not have the skills that makes one a good server. A typical day was rolling 500 rolls of silverware, finding your section, and waiting on customers while doing your sidework (cleaning/maintaining/stocking the kitchen). The coworkers were a lot of fun, but the customers make or break the job. Management was okay, but they could have done better. Also, I was a pretty apathetic server."
bad,"A typical day at work would include taking orders from customers, serving them food and beverages. Daily cleaning task's such as breaking down the machines and cleaning them, cleaning of the tables chairs and floors. The most enjoyable part of working here is all the great people that you meet everyday"
bad,.........Just an okay job place to work at if you need a summer job or part time job ...............So hey my experience but your choice ...............
bad,"During my interview I was told I would be able to get lots of hours so I quit my other job but now at Cracker Barrel I only work less than 5 hours a day, 2-3 days a week. This job basically only pays for my gas to get there."
bad,"Managers at the Woodruff road location only care about making money. They do not care about their employees and they are mean. Very mean. I worked there 3 years and I discovered that the new hires who were teenagers were making more than me. And they didn't even work there a week. I brought it up to management and they kept saying they will ""fix it"". Never did. The servers there are MEAN. If you cant handle being cussed out, named called, This is the not the job for you.  the customers are amazing and fun to talk to. And some employees are great as well."
bad,"Managers talk down to you. They talk about you in front of you and behind your back and to other employees. Was told this is a right to work state so I had no right to work here. They could fire me in a drop of a hat and if I did not like it I could leave. Scheduling is not consistent, and new people are given more hours above the ones who have been there for many years."
bad,"I hated every minute of working here. My manager was sleeping with employees. We were able to cross train into other departments after being there so long, but i guess since i wasn't sleeping with the boss he wouldn't let me cross train."
bad,Not a bad job.  Did not enjoy the guests.  They were all nice but did not know what they wanted.  Ran you a lot for the little stuff. Was not planning on making it my career.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,If you’re a hard working person do not apply for this job. Everyone else will take advantage of you.  If you’re a lazy person with no work ethic at all then this is the job for you. It smells terrible and you’re always wet.
bad,"The communication throughout the whole store is a bit sad. No one is ever on the same page which leads to something going wrong and that's just because no one is informing each other with information. Some of the employees can be very rude and nothing is ever done about it. There's employees who don't do their job and get away with it. They stand around talking while there's work that needs to be done. Etc....."
bad,It might be a good place to start for a starter job. I got along with people but was unable to give two weeks notice. I found a higher paying job at a position i wanted.
bad,"Work/Life balance is not at all what they advertise it to be as management. Pay is great, benefits are sub par. Management growth is almost non exsistant"
bad,"Cracker Barrel pays low and does not make up for it with any decent discounts or incentives. The work pace is fast and you have to run your own food and drink, take orders, and do clean up jobs as well as roll silverware after your shift; keeping you there at least an hour after your shift if not longer. Most customers tipped poorly and there was no way to make up for it, because the restaurant was constantly overstaffed giving one server two tables or three (if they're lucky) . Managers were nice but it was a bit chaotic and many managers change in short time periods. The managers rarely have time for you seeing as how they have to try to deal with the customers who are unhappy at the servers who understandably cant always get to them when there is 30 other things to do at any given time. I would not recommend working here if you want good pay and a good work environment with ample room for advancement."
bad,So much gossip in the work place . Inappropriate relationship between management and employees . Drama and outbreaks between employees . Management was unfair and verbally abusive .
bad,"A decent place to work. Managers got stressed, some lack of team work. I loved the customer service part of it though. So many people from so many different walks of life. That kept it interesting."
bad,The managers here are incredibly rude and snappy. A usual day is stressful and full of angry and unappreciative comments from managers. The good thing about this job is the amount of money you can make in a shift and the coworkers. The hardest part is staying on while the managers are rude and yelling.
bad,"Very fast paced and hectic. Customers often rude as well as management. other employees are nice,but the management team ruins it. They have their favorites and only schedule them so you have to pick up shifts and sometimes they wont even let you do that"
bad,Different stores have different cultures. Some are more family like than others. Overall like any big business you are just a number and generally get treated as such unless somehow a manager with  a heart slips through the cracks and ends up being your supervisor.
bad,"Started at Cracker Barrel as a server in 1993, ended as a shift leader and grill cook in 2015. I did most of the jobs at Cracker Barrel, and they are all fast paced. There is very little positive feedback from management, who instead think negative motivation works best.I was told in 2000 that I would never get another raise. They discontinued many incentives like free insurance and stock options for PAR 4's a long time ago, and insurance cost to employees has risen steadily. It is great if you need a job immediately."
bad,I really enjoyed the staff I worked with. The job itself was not an easy one and was more challenging than I thouht it would be. It taught me a lot surprisingly and for that I am grateful.
bad,Typical day at work was crazy their wasn't many dishwasher on a busy day. The workplace culture was good but also had the bad days. The enjoyable part was when we all worked together.
bad,"At work, we are supposed to be working as a team, I only see teamwork rarely. People are messy and leave their messes for others to clean up. Managers do not respect us and do not follow our schedules around school."
bad,Management at Cracker Barrel is terrible. They don’t care how good you are at your job. They don’t care bout you as a employee. They don’t care about anything but money in there pockets.
bad,"When I first applied to cracker barrel the management was great. After a few months management changed and the bussers were forced to do everything. Im fine with working hard ,but not being out to work like a slave."
bad,"It's totally corporate, Greedy sobs. Managers get huge bonus for keeping labor low, at the employees expense, leaving you understaffed. They have cameras  put up all over the workers area, and have to escort you  to the door after your shift. Worker's are subject to be searched when leaving and females must carry see thru purses or bags. For the most part, employes are not allowed to leave for breaks, prison like atmosphere. Brakes are nonexistent unless you work 8 hr shifts, which is very rare for this place. It's more layed back for servers, and would be the only position that is tolerable, my experience. Stay away from  back of house positions, trust me. Majority of the people working here are beyond miserable."
bad,Management lacked tremendously. It didn't matter to them what you made or how you felt just as long as the managers didn't have to be on the grill line and that they had at least a grill operator they were good. I didn't approve of how I was being treated their on top of going to college full time. I barely got a day off in a matter of 2 week cycle. I couldn't even ask for a shift off just to catch up on homework. Not very compensated on the work ethnicity and reliability you put in. Whenever we had no cook or someone called off. I was there. But I was only appreciated by a couple managers.
bad,"When I first started out, I was so thrilled. I LOVE Cracker Barrel, and always had fond memories of eating there as a kid. Great food, good service. Can't ask for more. And as a whole, I'm sure that is the reality of working for the Barrel."
bad,Not a fun place to work managers do not manage well at all you have to learn everything for yourself there's no enjoyable part of the job at cracker barrel
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"One of my biggest pet peeves is lack of communication.  This position was my 1st exposure to being a line cook.  My trainer was poor with communicating how things were to be done.  I was thrown to the wolves after a week of training.  Then when I was having a problem memorizing the menu, instead of retraining me, they moved me to another position, cut my pay AND hours without telling me!!"
bad,"I worked at the Fern Creek store. Each store has multiple mangers, but it seems like we had at least 1 new manager every month. With the lack of communication between management and the continuous changing in management it affect how the employees were treated and how the store was run. There were days I would be waiting over an hour for a manger to speak with a guest or complete a task in order for me to do my job properly. My ETC was wonderful and would normally have to do the managers' work in addition to her own because they would disappear to the back leaving the employees and ETC to pick up the slack."
bad,"We don't get breaks, working 10-12 hour shifts, Always run out of everything. Managers don't respect scheduling availability, and poor training. We always have too many people scheduled on weekends and have 2 table sections instead of letting people go home. You have to wait around for 2 hours if we run out of silverware which is almost always. If you don't mind any of that it's the perfect place to work!"
bad,There's nothing wrong with the job. I had a very great experience with cracker barrel.  Small things that need to be fixed. But in about all totality I was a great experience
bad,"The specific location that I worked at was horrible, they didn't appreciate any work that was done by their employees, and were very messy in general."
bad,"Working at the Cracker Barrel I've been employed by has been exceptionally unpleasant thus far.  Management is poor, scheduling is a nightmare, and the kickback for dealing with it isn't sufficient.  Expect to get the worst shifts when you start, and don't expect things to get better anytime soon.  Generally working 12+ hours on Sundays, closing half of the week, and any lack of availability is pushed to the limits."
bad,"If you like to cook work here, that's all you do! Pay is great but you don't see your family and work every holiday! .................................."
bad,"Cracker Barrel was an okay way to pass the time. I loved it in the beginning, I loved my direct manager and the general manager, as well as most of my coworkers (two of the six managers I had to work with regularly actually made my job a lot harder by being rude and overall just kind of obnoxious). However, the training was minimal, and though being a cashier/retail associate isn't hard, there are a lot of things that I had to ask for help on (mostly with the register system) because I was never properly taught to do it. The work isn't hard, though."
bad,I honestly only worked there because it paid the bills I felt I was overworked and under paid the management team I was under we're horrible people I honestly wouldn't ever go back
bad,i enjoyed coming to work because the customers were amazing. i even enjoyed the people i worked with they would always brighten up your stressful day.
bad,working here started out fine but slowly took a turn in the wrong direction the turn over rate between management and team members is crazy but my co-workers were great.
bad,The people there do not seem to like each other at all. Also they are more likely to give you more hours than necessary.  Management is pretty much the same as other restaurants.
bad,Didn't have good management. Didn't treat employees with respect. Punished employees if they were not able to work a shift due to scheduling mishaps. Overall not a very great work environment.
bad,"Fast paced, always running around hardly ever catching a break. Answering the phone. taking tables, taking orders, running food, putting orders in, helping your co workers."
bad,"the manager over the dept that i was in had her favorites.  if you werent one of them, or when your time was up you were offered a job as a cashier.   They will give you multiple chances though.  say you agree to work and then decide to go to the beach, then that was ok with her."
bad,its a good place to start out with as your first job but past that dont expect to advance in the company because they dont like people who actually care about their job.
bad,"It is not a good fit for any creative fun or laid back human. Service stinks, customers are rude, coworkers only care about themselves, and the managers spend their time in la la land. Plus, the pay horribly, especially in tips!"
bad,Good tippers are not very common at the cracker barrel probably because of the low priced food and country home-style atmosphere does not promote it very well.
bad,Everyone is really nice. Only problem is lack of hours and never getting off on time. But besides that it's a really fun environment to work in and the tips are sometimes really good.
bad,It is an ok place to work if you are in high school or just looking for part time job on the side. I enjoyed greeting each guest that entered the store/ restaurant whether it was to come eat or just shop. Management sucked really bad I would constantly have to call for change or customers who wanted to speak with management before they actually came.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"Work at the CB was very chaotic at times, most of the time but I did learn patience and customer service. The hardest part of the job was when a guest was unhappy and nothing offered changed their experience. I enjoyed seeing all the regular customers that would come into the restaurant and enjoyed offering a customer a great experience."
bad,"It is a good place only for part time because you are going to be crazy in that place, for me was ok but with the time you realized that you deserved better than this"
bad,There is nothing I care to spend the time explaining about this organization at this time. I would not recommend this organization to anyone at this time.
bad,"poor food, disrespectful customers and poor tips that's what you get when you work at cracker barrel. I only took this job out of desperation I never want to work there again."
bad,"Working at Cracker Barrel is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. They would try and work me everyday even though I had days off that I could not work, then would completely cut my hours and barely pulling 10 hours. The managers are hypocrites, unprofessional, and like to use you as a ""crash test dummy"" when higher ups come to the store. After two coworkers laid their hands on me, they did nothing but ask what I did to make them do it. It's fast paced and if you can't please every opposite thinking manager and server (from a host standpoint) then I'd advise you not to work here."
bad,Worked hard an a daily basis. Sometimes work short handed because leadership would only let you work with so many hours. Had to work every holiday and had many blackout dates where you could not take vacation or time off.
bad,Horrible bosses. They really don't care about their employees.  They have lazy managers that don't want to do anything but sit on there butts and eat..
bad,"Cracker Barrel over all is decent company to work for. However this last Cracker Barrel I have transferred to, not at all like my previous store, hard long hours, doubles, and they don't even give you 40 hours a week. Management is less than acceptable they favor suck ups rather than hard working individuals."
bad,Through the years of working for this establishment i have gone through more than 10 managers in a 5 year working span. There is not one thing that is consistent for this establishment and all the weight falls onto the servers. Now one thing i must say is that the employees become thicker than water and really help each other out. I believe if the employees ran Cracker Barrel world wide this cooperation would make billions more and never lose a customer.
bad,"In my time at Cracker Barrel, I learned that there was definitely a lack of management within the store I worked at.  They never seemed to care about what was going on and gossip too much."
bad,"I loved the job itself and all of the guests, the money was fantastic. But the management was horrible there was only 2 good managers and I dont see how the other ones even still had a job.  They arent the best at working around schedules, and very unprofessional. if you can serve for cracker barrel, you can serve anywhere!"
bad,Cracker Barrel was an okay job. The money wasn't really good enough for me to stay . I have a 2 year old to care for. They where also very harsh on me if my child was sick.
bad,At first they gave me high hopes for working with them. After a month of me working there they started cutting my hours and everyone else hours to save money. Cut people off of each shift leaving one person per shift and leaving them with a huge work load to the point where taking breaks isn't really optional.
bad,"They teach employee experience first then guest experience however,in management its impossible to get work life balance & spend time with your family"
bad,Good starting job long hours and poor communication with management. It's hard work and really hot.  vacations after one year and benefits if you work over 40 hours week
bad,"great pay, amazing bonus potential....however, expected to work 80 hours a week and cover hourly shifts since you are salary manager and can be worked all the time. terrible work life balance...also you can never leave the building once you are there, it is against company policy, so you are like a prisoner."
bad,"amazing managers. "
bad,"You don't get paid enough to deal with all you deal with, not to mention it's not enough work for all the staff they hire. The managers have little respect for the employees and the ones that do are either mysteriously fired or relcoated"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"It was very unorganized and hard to work there. With aldue respect im not looking to get into detailed review about previous jobs, i just need a good resume."
bad,While I worked there the manager's played favoritism and the Cracker Barrel's down south are nothing compared to the one I have worked at. Southern Cracker Barrel are far more friendly.
bad,"Overall, the job was good. I made good money. I loved the people. It was relaxed. But the management was terrible. Manager choose favorites and were very picky with those they didn't like, looking for any and every reason to write them up. Everything was fine if they like you, you could get away with anything. It was a poorly managed establishment and definitely not strict enough on rule enforcement for everyone."
bad,"Some days were busy and others were slow"
bad,"I worked at Cracker Barrel for eight months. The people were friendly, but management gets real sore if you intend to move on from the company and are not helpful to those who wish to leave."
bad,"A typical day at work was coming in turning on all the lights, doing a little hosting in the morning before the host would come in. I was a cashier. I would keep the area clean, ask our guest how was their meal and ring them up. I would also fill out the sale sheet and continue to please our guest or cover the floor if my retail co worker needed assitance. The hardest part of the day there really wasn't one. Working in a fast pace restaurant/retail store youre going to be busy. The easiest part of the day was just keeping things clean waiting for customers to come pay for there meal. I didn't really like management as much. They were never really organized and they did a lot of favortism there was always alot of drama with managers and servers in the back where the breakroom and cooks were."
bad,I loved my co-workers we got along very well. I was a grill cook I cook per order working on a fast pace getting the food out 5 minutes of less. I enjoy the creativity of cooking.
bad,"Cracker Barrel has wonderful food, however the retail side of it is most definitely not biscuits and gravy. We consistently had to yell out greetings, if we were with a customer or not. Everything had to be cookie cutter, no tattoos showing, no piercings other than your lobes and the earring had to be as small as a dime. If you're creative or artsy at all this place is not for you."
bad,I would imagine if I did anything other that dishwash I may have had a different experience but I didn't. i didn't like that i had to come in at 5 am on Wednesdays for 3 hours to unload the trucks and i was the only dishwasher made to do it. sundays were insanely stressful. overall i did not like the expeience.
bad,"hard working, customers were very friendly and helpful,my co-workers were funny and always willing to teach me things i didn't know"
bad,Employees most part were nice.  One manager gave out my personal telephone number to a waitress to have me not come into work instead of doing it himself. would never work for the company again if they allow their managers to give out personal information.
bad,"Difficult place to adapt to, but if you can they offer great benefits.  Communication barrier between associates and management made it difficult as the rules changed per manager. This did not allow all associates to be on the same page with the same standard each and every day preventing efficiency."
bad,"I loved working in retail, lovely items. Have good personality and smiling face is needed for sales. Loved the job but my immediate supervisor would cause you to lose incentive with her constant condescension."
bad,"As an employee you felt like you were in boot camp and were treated like a criminal, as you had to be walked to the door by a manager , so you did not steal from the retail store. Hopefully you could get one of the several managers to actually do so."
bad,"Greeted customers as they entered the store/restaurant. Set displays, got to see merchandise before it was put on the shelves. Was able to smell all yankee candles"
bad,"Country music blared over the speakers. If it was an artist that was being promoted, the same songs would loop. Christmas was the worst. Customers were rude and drunk which is amazing because we didn't serve alcohol."
bad,This job does not work with you with every day life. Your hours is never consistent. Management does not communicate at all. They don't understand you have to work as a team to get everyone on board.
bad,"I was treated like an animal.  People are treated like they are sub human.  No regard is given for human needs, and breaks and lunches were often skipped because management did nothing to alleviate the problem."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,Very fast passé works and friendly work environment. The management staff was ok and somewhat easy to get along with each shift  although not always.
bad,Working with my co-workers was the best part. Learned about food preparation.
bad,"it was an alright workplace. Helped customers, handled money, cleaned store. Didnt learn anything. Management was alright.Co-workers werent very nice. Hardest part of the job was dealing with people."
bad,"My typical day at work was organizing the retail store, cleaning the bathrooms every 10-15 minutes, seating guests & putting tables together for a bigger party.I was very interactive with the guests. I learned that it's okay to lean on people for help & not to be afraid to ask questions about your duties. I learned to be more personable, friendly, & determined. The management was very poor at Cracker Barrel. They were very rude & had no respect for you. My co-workers were awesome & they taught me every single thing I needed to do step by step. They were very patient with me. The hardest part of the job is when the managers were being very rude & disrespectful. The most enjoyable part of the job was I got to interact with people & help them in any way I could."
bad,People were unhappy so it reflected in whole company.  Bad boss made life hard. most people were  friendly but some were not.
bad,"The hardest thing is  when I'm scheduled for a 6 1/2 hours straight work shift by myself and forced to do a 3 man job, alone. Especially on high volume periods of the day."
bad,"A typical day of work is not fulfilling or satisfying in any way, unless you have a friend that is on the same shift as you. Not to mention your shifts are not guaranteed and your hours are usually short, such as mine. Went from working nine hours a day to three hours a day, three days a week for what was supposed to be a full time job."
bad,The money is not good and you have to spend a lot of time to make just a little bit
bad,I had great co-workers and I met a lot of great people and I really enjoyed the food.
bad,"Typical day at work was stressful,and management did not help make it any easier. Co-workers were great, everyone had each others back and tried to help as much as possible."
bad,"A fast paced restuarant, with many employees and alot of heat. Preparing orders as needed, I enjoyed the management team there. I just wish there was more room for growth, hardest part about the job would have to be dealing with the heat. And the constant standing over the stove. Most enjoyable part of the job was the work staff, and the pay."
bad,"Typical day boring"
bad,"I would constantly be required to sign out of the system to sign back in. Management is terrible. I would constantly be switching jobs while on the clock and only got paid for whichever position had the lowest wage (each job varies with wages) Co-workers are friendly until management has no idea what they're doing, then everyone is aggrivated. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people that realize the company is under terrible management and are still patient with all of the employees."
bad,"worked in the grand opening. Mangers were ok. Co workers were rude and unprofessional, if you apply for partime, you rarely get any hours. Very multitasking"
bad,"Over 2 1/2 years of service. Management very one sided. Never confirms incidents. Was to do alot of online courses but was never given the time to complete. Was given tasks that no other Managers were given. Asked to be transfered to be closer to wife's work and GM never put forth any effort to keep my family together. It was a job not a career! Enjoyed customers, tourists. Long term servers but can be alot of turn over in kitchen staff. Ten hour days and days off changed weekly, no consistency!"
bad,Responsible for taking care of customer’s food and drink orders. Taking orders over the phone in order to fill customer’s to go orders.
bad,"When you start at this facility everything seems so great, everything has a home feeling and management was great when I started. Alot of the service went down hill, people were not as motivated because we were told we were going to get raises and the amounts we were given as raises were nothing compared to what everyone thought. some of the managers that were there when we opened decided to leave and new managers came in that I felt were not fit for the company and i decided it was my time to leave. . .  not what i expected from the company at all."
bad,I love working hard for this job  managers and co-workers are nice
bad,loved it here. was fun relaxing and fast paced. only thing that made a good day bad was the fact that managers completely sucked.
bad,"The only position worth working here for is the server position."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,Very fast paced and the money was decent.  You had to work really hard to get ahead and especially on Sunday.
bad,what i love about this job the people that ive worked with. i feel the pay isnt enough for all the hard work you do.
bad,the managers use favoritism as motive to hire and fire workers
bad,"Management was aggressive and overbearing. "
bad,"Job was extremely frustrating, most of the employees there had no idea what they were doing. Management was never around when you had a problem, refused to listen to concerns from employees, made scheduling a real tiresome affair due to their lack of communication. Overall this job was a joke and I would advise anyone to stay aware from here unless you are that desperate."
bad,"The back of house is clean. Kitchens clean."
bad,Working for cracker barrel is okay. Its hard to be what they want you to be with little pay and little hours. mangers are all over the place they don't help out much. the hard part was handling all the guest at once alone. the best part was all the guest and there storys.
bad,"If you're a manager, expect to work long, hard hours. Hourly help can be substandard and store management not equipped to handle the responsibility"
bad,work was mostly easy but could be overwhelming on weekends
bad,"I worked at Cracker Barrel in San Marcos, TX for over a year. It was alright in the beginning, but then it turned bad. The managers were number crunchers with no good experience on how to handle employees or daily business. I was lied to repeatedly about change and promises of things turning around. While cooking, we took the blame for all the issues going on while the servers got away with murder. The cook line was a mess. Old food, mold, utensils, and other bacteria ridden items were everywhere. I'm surprised we were never shut down. I left over a situation that got escalated by a manager over something that was always a given during rush hour. Then a manager got in my face and basically told me that he knew that I cussed when I think that I know what i said better than he did. finally, the gm gets a huge bonus for the hard work the cook line put in."
bad,"A typical day at work would result in all of the servers getting angry, and yelling at there co workers. Also having your manager yell at you and treat you like your back in school again."
bad,"worked as a grill cook. took me four years to obtain a total raise of $1.50. overall a horrible place to work for, management is not trained to run the restaraunts"
bad,"I've worked for a restaurant before and I have never had an experience like working here. Management team is good until they are against heavy business traffic. I hope they have improved but the order system has plenty of room for improvement. Ticket time standard is unrealistic to the actual cooking time. (Ex., A well done steak requires atleast 15 min. on a grill. Management would ask for it at 10 mins. and then bring it back saying that it's not well done, after the fact that they were informed that the steak is not ready.)"
bad,"You get all sorts of guests that come through the store, its a great place to work and you get a lot people skill experience working there."
bad,"I am available to work a variety of hours, and yet I am always having to work extremely late hours. It is difficult to get breaks, even though I work over 6 hours at a time. I love working with the public and helping customers to buy products."
bad,"A day at Crackerbarrel is full of fun when meeting new people it is hard work, not enough hours, and the managers do a great job of getting things done. The employee gets the raw end of the stick but the customers are happy at least most of the time."
bad,People can be friendly the bad is the management is bad the lost my ✔ two checks of mine sad took 3 weeks to get uniform bond work cards. T fui uh grrr ugh
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"It is a okay job,but I don't  feel like I can make it a career.Every job have it's ups and downs.Maybe  more team work.I cannot see my saying for a long time."
bad,A server unfortunately had to do many jobs than most would believe here at cracker barrel as well as having to coop with the lack of employees which makes it difficult to leave all of our guests leaving happy
bad,"Unless you're a grill cook, don't expect your pay to really mean very much at the end of the month. They will give you very few hours if they can, schedule you to work alone during rushes, and typically claim it is too hard for them to do any better. If you just want some extra cash and still don't have any bills to pay, go for this job. But stay away if you need to reliably pay rent or any other large expense."
bad,It was a very good learning experience however the management was never on the same page which in the long run would effect the servers and how the shift was ran
bad,"Painful and stressful.  Zero support. That's all.  Worst worst worst job I ever had making more than $10/ hour.  Indentured servant at the most optimistic mindset in the 7 years of hard time I endured.  But hey, great health benefits.  And yes, the only reason I stayed, f cancer."
bad,"The managers caused the most mayhem. It’s like they couldn’t go a single day without causing someone to lose their cool. I quit this restaurant because it drained my mental health, always getting verbally put-down. I made complaints to corporate of course and nothing was done. Was a good first job, but after 3 years you’ll learn why many quit after their first week at this location"
bad,I have very few hours and I personally find the job to be stressful. That probably comes down to what you personally like. But I prefer my jobs to be set in stone.
bad,"Get money quick. Some good managers look out for their employees most look out for themselves. Stressful and fun. low pay/ low hours "
bad,"It is a decent job. The regulars are amazing. You get a great discount, with opportunity to advance. Paid vacation. They offer medical insurance."
bad,"Would over-schedule floorplans, end up either cutting people 10 people 15 minutes into a shift (still had to roll 100 silverware and do 30 minute sideworks) or saddling 30 of us with 2 table sections (2 tables?? That’s only 50$ in a 5 hour shift). Intense favoritism. Not allowed to criticize management. 35 minute checks were a norm, for small or simple orders. Nothing goes out correctly. Some managers, transfers specifically, were fair and tried to treat employees right, but more often then not they got out of our Barrel as fast as humanly possible. I’ve worked at 2 other Barrels, and this is by far the worst in terms of overall quality. That being said, the others weren’t exactly a walk in the park either. I have seen persistent issues that are definitely fixable if given the right mindset. I would not recommend working for Cracker Barrel if you enjoy your sanity."
bad,"Working at cracker barrel as a dishwasher was not that hard if your a hard worker."
bad,"Some of the empire are really great, but some are so obnoxious and loud and so mean to each other. Management is good for the most part. Food is good. The kitchen line is outstanding."
bad,"I work there to please people, guests and coworkers. There are ""too many chiefs, not enough indians"", rules change daily, which makes for a new interesting challenge everyday."
bad,"I never get hours and I cant seem to convince my manager that i need more hours, for one week I'm maybe averaging 4 hours if that. Trying to live off that is impossible"
bad,"The money isn’t what I thought it would be. During a night shift it was hard to even hit 40$ sometimes, you have to work a lot of hours to make decent money. Too many servers were scheduled on a shift.  Side work took extremely too long, especially if you worked a night shift (expect to be there 1-3 hours after you’re cut)  And I found some mangers to be very unhelpful. The meal discount was nice though"
bad,"This doesn't go for every Cracker Barrel, but the one in Gainesville is a joke. The ""Head"" manager is the rudest lady you will ever encounter. If you take one second to breath in between taking a order she will yell at you and may even send you home. She also almost got fired for physically fighting her employees before. The customers in this area expect free things everyday and will leave a bad review when they have to pay full priced for their meals, which is a given. Did I mention how the severs have to make the salads and desserts most of the time or how the kitchen only makes half of the food and you have to make speciality drinks, side items and spend 2 hours after each of your long shifts rolling 150 sliver-ware and cleaning the place spotless? And a manager has to go over and check you did everything and if not, its done all over again."
bad,Doesn't schedule you many hours a week. Even people working there 20 or so years struggle to get 30 hours and hardly do get that many hours in a week. Sorry to say it but 10 hours a week is not what I signed up for despite wanting part time work. I need 20-30. Hours.
bad,"I used to love my Job at cracker barrel, but now with poor new management it has turned into a Stressful disturbing environment and needs to be under review"
bad,"Co-workers are most often unfriendly and rude, you don't get very much money- basically all you get paid is whatever you make in tips. Money is unreliable because it can be really slow one day or have customers who don't tip much. You also hardly ever have time for a break, no matter how long you work. If you take a break you are more than likely going to lose money."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"Worked there for awhile, made some decent money and met some wonderful people! Put in my two weeks because of a dispute with a coworker. They took me off the schedule completely after that, which I hear they do fairly often. So in other words, don’t give them any notice. Just stop coming in when you’re done with it."
bad,Could of been a great place but they rush everything even if the food is bad and I’m all about taking care of the customer and this place was all about cutting corners but there quick to fix a guest food mistake just take care of the problem before it goes to a table
bad,I have been at Cracker Barrel for 6 months... scheduling is difficult. Trying to work around my school schedule and work schedule is difficult when scheduled a few days a week. Management is poor and co-workers think that they are in charge. Do not recommend...
bad,"It started off good then they start making unreasonable changes, cutting hours, cutting days,  i did my job to the best of my ability came in everytime they needed me when i was off put in more than what was asked of me and do you think they appreciated it? No They Didn't!!!"
bad,"I wasn't a minor when I was hired and in my state minors are required to have a break after 5 hours of work so I didn't get a break for that. Also, I was scheduled for 7 and a half hours instead of 8 so technically didn't have to get a lunch break either and would end up working for 9 to 10 hours with no breaks. They did say I could ask to use the bathroom though."
bad,The hardest part of the job is running the cash register ringing up guests and managing the floor by yourself I learned to set displays and go get items from the stock room for guests the fun part of the job was doing displays and having parties for when we reached our goals for the week
bad,"The management at crackerbarrel where I am  is horrible. The managers don’t listen to the workers and treat them like garbage. The hours aren’t consistent for any of my coworkers and we complain about how the managers treat all of us unfairly. The pay is not fair at all for any of the workers. My coworkers are amazing to work with for the most part as well, they are friendly and helpful."
bad,"Great for getting back onto your feet. Enough to pay bills if you manage your money enough. Managers micromanage and don’t trust employees enough. Employee meals 50% off but you have to eat it in the break room, can’t take it home. The A/C is never really on in the kitchen and dish room, employee break room isn’t air conditioned and bathrooms not ventilated well. Very stressful and high speed with not enough dishwashers ever scheduled. Most often only one busser and maybe two or three dishwashers. There’s little to no advancement and the pay raises are barely anything, maybe 25¢ if you’re lucky. Everyone has their own addiction or crutch to get through the work day.  Oh and they’re always hurting for employees so they never fire the horrible or bad ones. I end up doing two or three people’s work loads myself because they won’t."
bad,"If you want to work for a company who works with your schedule, this is not the place. It is required to work on holidays and you will often not be given time off to be with family. If your personally schedule changes, it is near impossible to convince the managers to change your work schedule."
bad,"Poor management, Need to act like they have time for employees and help them when they need help and not yell at them. Make sure to schedule all workers so they can get to know the place and not forget to schedule them."
bad,"A typical day was doing dishes and running around to put them away , I didnt learn much there , the management was decent,  the workplace was crowded the harded part was staying after they close tell 1 am to finish the dishes. There was nothing enjoyable about this job."
bad,I honestly didnt enjoy it my manger was racist and always pucked on me and i was the only black person working there at the time they hire 1 black person a time
bad,"Cracker Barrel is a very flexible place to work if you have a limited availability. Its labor oriented.  There is quite a bit of favoritism involved when schedules are made or making cuts to manage labor.  They use the phrase ""Aces in their places"" however that is not always the case."
bad,"The manager at my Cracker Barrel made everything so difficult. When he was not there everything ran so smoothly. Once the managers switched jobs that’s when my scheduling went sideways. After I left they tried to fix everything, but I was not having it."
bad,"things may be different now, but when i worked there, the employees were snobby, the managers didn’t want to work with my schedule, the “guests” were rude, and everything was very cut-throat."
bad,Would work for hours and hours without a time for breaks. Pay was low and sometimes would get belittled by my manager for having to take a restroom break.
bad,"CONS"
bad,"I liked Cracker Barrel when I had first started but towards the end of my employment my experience spiraled. They gave unfair pay, the management team failed us, the guests were often rude and racist."
bad,"the managers pick and choose who they're respectful to. Things weren't organized for the hostess. If something went wrong the managers handled the situations poorly. The work others and myself did and the  distance we drove, was not worth continuing to work there."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"managers pick favorites and fire others to make examples.  if you don't do them favors like close dish pit until 1 am when they ask, they give you two table sections."
bad,"Management is full of people who don't want to do their jobs. With five managers, not one could take care of the store or restaurant side when the time comes by themselves. I love the people I work with, but coworkers aren't enough to make the work experience better. When I first started, the managers were amazing and got stuff done, but now all they want to do is argue with guests. The customer isn't always right, but they also don't try to make things right and bring back guest loyalty. The hardest part of the job is working with two or three other people and feeling like you're working alone. The most enjoyable part of the job is going home."
bad,"Retail employees only allowed shifts of 3,4,or5 hours unless in leadership or a favorite. CB claims this is due to heavy work but of course the truth is they avoid paying benefits."
bad,At first I liked it but as the years went by the managers was nasty they had alot of pucks n choose at times I felt they made racist options....I would go back or advice anybody go there for a job I fell it has become racist
bad,"Worked there almost a year, management was stealing hundreds of tips from to-go servers and sometimes regular  servers. Awful job training! Management is not understanding and there’s so much gossip and the job atmosphere is awful"
bad,"If you love a highly stressful environment with little praise for a job well done but always being told what you did wrong, Cracker Barrel is for you."
bad,"I have been working here for about 2 years and I loved everything about it. I work in retail and its pretty simple but stressful at peak periods. Retail management is awesome, but general and restaurant management make some days hard to work there. Regular guests and other employees are what make working there bearable."
bad,The manager's play favorites and verbally abusive. Coworkers were inappropriate and back-biting. Mixed encounters with customers. Pay was decent. Benefits from the company were great.
bad,"Though, I asked for help and advice on top of working hard, I feel I received none. I did try hard to get faster at my job, but I felt I could not keep up with the other servers."
bad,The GM was not very friendly from the day I started.  Many managers left during my tenure.  It was hard at first to fit in because I was a seasonal employee. The hardest part of the job was finding an item in the stockroom.  You can only advance through the PAR system and not really through how you are performing.  You cannot leave the retail area at all to get a drink of water.
bad,"Payed $2.13 an hour, even doing back work"
bad,Poor management attitude towards helping employees during a rush. Flinging water in the dish because they have to help a litlle. Not very professional.
bad,Too many hrs.  Spend most of time working position not managing.  No life.  So many hrs working 12 he day.  Employees who have been there for a long time can refuse managers and won't get fired.  Can be late every day and will get hundreds of write ups and nothing hapens.
bad,"A normal day consisted of me walking around the sales room trying to get the coustomers to buy one of the products. Every hour I had to calciuate the amount of money made by the retail staff. Every 30 minutes I had to check/clean the restrooms. I had to keep the shelves stocked with new products. If I closed at night I have to keep the floor clean, and restock the shelves for the morning shift. I learned how to confidently talk to strangers. I learned how to shock shelves. I learned how to sell people unquie products. The workplace culture was full of nice people. The hardest part of the job was making the hourly sells quota. the most enjoyable part of the job was talking to all types of people throughout the day."
bad,"Large staff, small sections, low price point and therefore low tips, high turnover rate, ""turn-and-burn"" quick service style restaurant. Offers regular chances for promotion with meager wage increases."
bad,"I personally was not impressed with the management at the location i worked at. I did'nt find the work hard to do, it was quite easy actually.the shifts i worked were always pretty slow except for weekends."
bad,"Everyone is rude and doesn't work together, management ignored important issues until they turned into huge problems. Everyone doesn't work together and speak to each other with no respect."
bad,"Friendly co-workers but poor management. Poor due to not knowing how to give their employees an adequate amount of hours. Also, some of the jobs required knowledge of things that management didn't work hard enough to train as some of my co-workers didn't know how to do it."
bad,Everyone is constantly in everyone's business and 9/10 times people will talk behind your back. Lots of unappreciative people and no breaks unless you're a server.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,I enjoyed working here for a short time. I did not get chances for advancement nor was I treated like I was part of the team. I felt like a black sheep on the team. Ignored most of the time.
bad,"I thought(when getting the position) this was going to be the last place I would work. Until, like anywhere else, you get in there and see how terrible the management, supervisors, and leads behave. A lot of dishonesty goes on, you can bust your back working anytime they ask you to, but make a few simple mistakes and they are quick to write you up to the point you are on the verge of termination, while allowing employees that have been there for several years do literally nothing and take extended breaks, with no disciplinary actions, you have to worry about your safety as well because if it is a good fast employee that picks at the rate or above they expect, your safety is lower importance."
bad,Loved my job because of the customer!!!! Easy going but sometimes stressful!!!I The store was dirty. Some employees were very rude and not helpful. Some were very nice to deal with.
bad,"When I first started at Cracker Barrel in NLR it was pretty amazing actually but then I started seeing stuff and hearing stuff another drama job of course. The managers really don't help out except for two K&M not going to mention names there has been times where your hours would get cut if you call of doesn't matter if you have an emergency they would get cut. They make the schedule two weeks in advance, doesn't matter if you have to go out of town and you've requested off they will still put you on there. They give all the hours to the new people just to make them stay but after a while they will be cut as well I've figured out why Cracker Barrel doesn't keep workers long enough the Managers at this NLR are not compassionate they will yell at you in from of everyone when they really suppose to pull you in the office like a professional manager does. I can not tell you how many times I've seen females run into the back or the bathroom and cry. Yet they kiss the people butt whose stealing from them right great job on giving then more hours and letting them keep their job D&K&M&D. I would have said some more details but I'm not going too this job would be so much better if you've gotten more hours and if the managers took control of managing. It's alright I'm looking for another job as we speak!!"
bad,management and the workers was horrible. you never had set hours and the way you are treated is horrible. i could say being a dishwasher here was probably my worst job
bad,"As I said, fun but a lot of hours. Usually got home very late and didn't have much time with my family.  The people were great though, and the management team was fun."
bad,"No insurance.  No benefits: no vacation, no sick leave. "
bad,"you work holidays, nights and weekends.  all stores are short managers so expect to work 9 days in a row and only one day off some weeks.  hardly ever get out at your scheduled time.  your always under staffed and rarely praised for any job well done."
bad,"This company was great at first. The economy was slowing down and Service Merchandise was effected greatly. The store was told the company was going out of business, and the employees just gave up, when, I believe we should have fought."
bad,"I just needed something to pay the bills but its no way to make a living. They pay you little, and the tips are not great. It's not worth but a bartending license."
bad,I have nothing to say. I liked the people I worked with. I just needed work and hours and they didn't give that. To be honest they didn't teach me anything new. I mean if your looking for a second job that gives less hours then they are a place to go
bad,Many of the shifts are short 3-5 hours. My experience at Cracker Barrel was that the management is too quick to belittle their employees when things are going well instead of trying to fix the problem. The managers are usually incapable of helping even if the wanted to try. The hardest part of the job was trying to achieve the unrealistic expectation of having every ticket out to the table in 10 minutes or less and getting berated by incompetent managers if you fail. The best part of the job was the people that are employed there. Nobody really liked their job their but we all tried to make the best of it.
bad,"I've worked for this company for almost a year now. The main issue I have is with communication between managers and employees. When you first start you will be trained for your position, and the training is actually really good. But if you change positions like I did then that's where you will have problems. I still to this day haven't been trained for my new position (six months later) but I learned as I did it more. They like to talk about what your doing wrong but don't really take the time to show you how to do it right. If you're looking for a job to help pay the bills then this is perfect, but if you're trying to make a career out of this I wouldn't suggest it."
bad,"In my four-year position as a server with Cracker Barrel Old Country Store I was recognized as an outstanding server and employee by my management team and customers. I have gotten employee of the month three consecutive times in their busiest time of the year for the company. It was with this company that I learned the skill of proper dialogue, attention to detail, problem solving, and focus."
bad,The cracker barrel is busy most of the year but especially in the summer time.  They are open from 6am till 10 pm so hours can be flexible however it is difficult to get over 25 hours a week because of management.
bad,They keep you in the back always and makes you keep doing the dishes not to mention there are NO breaks what do ever and the servers always pile dishes up high where they can fall down and sometimes they make you even though you're soaking wet go into the deep freezer and pull boxes out and break them down when there are plenty of other people avalible to do the job and sometimes they throw you in the dish room with barely any help at all and expect you to do it all also when thanksgiving comes they will make you work over your shift and you get no special thanks no bonus or anything basically they keep you from your family and then some staff sit in the back and act like they run the place telling you what to do
bad,"Worst restaurant to work for. If you work over 8 hours they will complain aboiut you getting a break. Management is not good at all. No job security whatsoever, not even a warning."
bad,"I really enjoyed working with the staff. They were all young, but friendly. 5 Managers. All of which were very fun to work with except the Retail one. A lot of people quit due to this lady. CB refuses to remove her obviously. She told me, and I have it recorded, that I could work 20 hrs weekly part-time. She told me also that after I got my evaluation I would be getting a small raise, and that people were praising my work and I smelled really good. Then she told me that if I didn't sale candy, she couldn't get her bonus. Really?! Now, mainly older couples/people or Diabetics is what comes through CB. They don't want candy or they'd buy it. Every person I asked said no thanks. So she hires more young people, then all of the sudden my hours go from 17 weekly to 5 weekly. Now my checks go from 124 weekly to 40 weekly. I took a week off to spend with my kids for their school break - she calls me every 2 days to work after approving my leave? Now I'm not on the schedule at all?? Just be real and say YOU'RE FIRED, instead of this guessing game. Calera, AL is the store. Do not work here in CASH/RETAIL if you want to make ends meet, because they won't. I miss the friendly faces, but I'm not getting walked over. She told me read your contract, no raises. Others tell me they got theirs in 3 weekly paychecks. She lied to me. If you do work here, avoid cash and retail. Be Blessed."
bad,I used to enjoy working here but it seems the company has really let go on how each store is ran. I  dread going into work here now.
bad,"It wasn't a really good experience at all for me, i didn't take work seriously but the management wasn't good either.a lot of employees left that place too."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"I liked working here but when I had a miscarriage, I had to quit because I was hemorrhaging and the manager would not let me leave."
bad,"I like the job but i wish the work hours could be more stable. Each day has its ups and downs, but you could get use to it if your work time wasn't changing each week. The company is still growing so different things will be tested good and bad. I do recommend this job to people because you get a chance to get batter at your job as long as you come to work that is. The last thing is when this place is busy it will work you and each hour will feel like three but good workers makes for easy work."
bad,"Job was really easy but I worked there for two years, working two days a week, 4 hour shifts.Management was rude and didn't really care about your personal life, they always made rude comments when calling out for emergencies."
bad,"A typical day at Cracker Barrel included conversing with the guests and performing simple waitressing tasks.  This includes taking care of the guests and making sure they leave satisfied and full.  The management was not the best, and I think this is where I learned how I will be as a manager, in a much better and positive way.  The hardest part of the job is when management is not respectful or grateful of hard work.  They have a problem with pointing out all of your faults and mistakes, rather than congratulating you on a job well done.  The most enjoyable part is working with co-workers and meeting different people with every table I serve."
bad,The management were difficult to work with. There was a strong culture of gossiping and negativity amongst coworkers. I generally felt unappreciated.
bad,"It would not have been so stressful if the management would relieve cooks when they need a break. Overall management need to assist the cooks more to reach a common goal, serve the customer."
bad,"A typical day at work is usually very fast paced. Hostesses are required to make sure the guest is satisfied and seated in a timely fashion while keeping the kitchen informed of the traffic in the restaurant. The job can be very stressful when the restaurant grows busy. We have multiple managers in the restaurant and some are easier to work with than others. Often times they just add stress to our job and they are not very accommodating, we do not have set schedules and they do not easily work our schedule around our lives. Management is my number one stress when it comes to this job. What I enjoy about my job is the interacting with the guests and being with my co-workers. I enjoy making our guests smile and connecting with them as well as my co-workers."
bad,Good place to earn skills in Restaurant Industry.  Fast paced and quickly changing priorities.  Must be adaptable to keep up with day to day tasks. Good People to work with.
bad,"lacks appropriate communication abilities, disorganized"
bad,"I worked for Cracker Barrel as a Seasonal Cashier when I was a teen.  The front area is clean and I loved interacting with the customers who came in. It wasn't what I expected shortly after working there. The customers would always tell the cashiers that they didn't understand why they had to pay for bad service and cold food. Being a cashier, we were apologizing for the inconvenience of the other staff. Management was uncaring and would talk about employees personal lives and gossip often. Lots of very unprofessional talk in the workplace. Also, lack of communication from management to the other staff. I left shortly after."
bad,"A day at work consisted of me walking into the dish room and seeing what needed to be done, who I would have working with me, and starting with the top priority job. I usually went from doing from one job to another. I would check and see if the other areas of the back needed dishes to be stocked, or if they were low on stuff that I could help with. I enjoyed being able to multitask and not just do one thing. I did not like the management styles and how people were treated. If I were in a management position, I would not follow their example. There wasn't good communication between the employees and management. They were not treated as they should have been. I really liked my coworkers, some of them ended up becoming my best friends. The hardest part was not having the people I needed to get the job done, some slacked off or had to be repeatedly told what they needed to do. It was stressful because I felt most of the responsibility fell on me and I didn't have people I could count on. I became more headstrong, developed a backbone. I learned to be a leader and have become confident of my abilities and what I am capable of doing."
bad,Great place to work. A lot of fun. I met a lot of cool people and they work very well with your schedule. I work there past time and I am able to support myself and my husband and put a roof over our heads.
bad,this business is not so bad. the hours were bad and the pay was low but the people were worth working with
bad,"average work day 12-14 hours. 5-6 days a week ,sometimes 7 to be able to accomplish all that is expected . time management is key to preforming this job and having ANY quality of life . they pay well but will work you for EVERY penny !"
bad,"I usually work 3-5 hrs a day. I would llike to have afew more hrs. I dont get them because the manager says that I doont sell enough but, you cant sell if you dont have the hours. They go through alot of managers and workers. I guess the enjoyable part of my job in the customers."
bad,"The management there is not up to par. The managers worry about the wrong things to help the business better. They also want us to basically do their job for them , but get paid server pay."
bad,"When I first began working at Cracker Barrel I was engaged to be married in January 2009, I requested to have 5 days off for my wedding and honeymoon. However they scheduled me to work all five days, I went to one of the managers whom got the schedule straightened out. They also were difficult when it came scheduleing their workers when it came to school. I only made $2.16 an hour plus tips, but there wasn't enough money coming in for me to continue driving to Springdale."
bad,management needs work. team work needs to happen more often as well as giving people the chance to cross train.
bad,It was was good when the owner was alive but u count pay me to work there I was treated so bad and infer  very bad. So sad sad work for25 year thy don't take car you
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"Being a serve you will constantly be on your feet and always busy. Not only do you have to cater to every single need of the guests but you also have to perform many tasks after. Each server was assigned a task at the end of the night, sometimes I wouldn't get home until midnight because of this. Hardest part of the job was always having to carry the hot and heavy trays. They also wouldn't work with my schedule which led into my quitting since I failed a class because of them. Part time but they worked me like I was full time."
bad,"Good luck Lots of positions to try out or for "
bad,Really enjoyed my coworkers while working there... loved my customers! You cannot make a living working for this company...always cutting hours while hiring more employees! Frequent schedule changes so that it is near impossible to make any plans.
bad,"While learning a lot of beneficial job experience, it wasn’t the most beneficial job. I wasn’t provided hardly any hours, even upon many requests. Most of the other employees weren’t polite and very judge mental."
bad,"Poor management. It is a stressful  job with hardly any work/life balance. Expect to work every holiday and weekend. No team playing from management, and it’s a very fast paced job"
bad,Just like any other typical day at work walking in and clocking in and getting started  by settling things up and cleaning down making sure things neat and clean for the next person
bad,"There were not enough cooks, so managers were the cook. The ticket times were absolutely horrible over 20 minutes for simple breakfast. Each manager gave you a different answer for the same question."
bad,"The work environment at Cracker Barrel is extremely high paced. You are almost constantly moving and always on your feet. Management is hit and miss. Some will help when things get tense, others don't care and let you drown. All employees are just numbers and warm bodies. Managements only cares about their bottom line. Don't expect sympathy or care beyond general courtesy. Be careful about volunteering to work a shift on a different position. Each position pays differently but they won't mention that. Moving from grill to prep was a loss of $3/Hour. Coworkers are generally caring and laid back. At the location I worked at as long as you didn't insult other employees or customers you were free to do and say whatever. Decent enough for college students or a summer job."
bad,This was the worst serving job I ever had. I loved the people I worked with but they hired a GM that was racist and she fired me and every other white server who had been there awhile. I had never even been written up for anything and she fired me for something someone else had done.
bad,"Hours will fluctuate wildly in both directions, people leave constantly, and a lot of the managers don't seem to know what they're doing. The only reason I haven't left is I haven't found anywhere else yet."
bad,They are friendly to work for. They managers were nice. It was a nice first job. My only problems were is tou didn't get breaks and the hours weren't there.
bad,"As we all know once you work in customer service and retail your nerves are pretty shot. Always busy, days went fast, but they have some pretty strict rules and policies"
bad,"If you value your time on the clock, and would like to be treated as you treat others, this may not be the job for you. Those still in school, whether it be high school or college, expect to not have any free/personal time to yourself with this position. Half of the time, when new hires are brought in, their first experience is so bad they leave the same day, and I should have made the same decision. I was planning on being here for at least 6 months, but I can barely go on after one month. I myself am not use to being on my feet so much, and considering how I work between 5 - 10 hours every day, 6 days a week, this position is not for the faint of heart. If you're use to being on your feet for so long, you may fair better than I did. "
bad,"Chaos occurs every weekend"
bad,If you're 16 I wouldn't recommend this job for you as it is very fast paced and can be extremely overwhelming. But fun place to work!!! It was a little too fast paced and overwhelming but they didn't really schedule teens in as much as the teens would have wanted.
bad,"I have worked at two stores. The first one was amazing, friendly coworkers, lots of chances for training and advancement. At the current store, there is no chance for training or growth."
bad,"The employees I worked with were great but poor management. I was fired by a new General Manager for something I had nothing to do with and I had never even been written up and it was my day off, I was filling in for someone else. What a bad day. Anyway, the general manager is now long gone and I think the ones she fired have since got their jobs back but who wants to work somewhere where they allow that to happen. Corporate would not even call me back to talk to me about the whole situation. I should have sued them"
bad,"I've worked at two CBs and had the same pros/cons at each. Coworkers are usually pretty great and there's always a few very motherly servers/shift leaders to look out of you. If you can do the work you want (for me, back room/stocking/floor moves), it's great. But they have an increasingly aggressive focus on nearly impossible to make sales ($100 by 7AM, $3000 days in low-volume stores). We are threatened that if we don't make numbers we lose hours (and implied, respect). I've gone through 5 retail managers and if they can understand that you're human, it'll be fine. If they expect you to work 110% every day, smile on your face, no drink/break/food for 8+ hours, making numbers, it'll absolutely suck."
bad,"Not the job for stand up individuals, great face money, no tipping out, must work holidays and weekends, long shifts sometimes without breaks, scheduling outside of availability"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,The customers are nicer than the managers depending on where you work you will get a different experience with the managers but it is such a fast-paced atmosphere that you will not catch a break you will become very exhausted
bad,"High potential, they offer a 1week paid vacation after 1 year of employment, several benefits including discounts in store, movie and theme park passes, car rental discounts, and more. However the atmosphere is terrible, and management is uncaring and typically unavailable."
bad,There are alot of drugs going in and out of this place and the same people are still working there doing the same.  The good ones that have to be there are the ones that have to pick up the slack and work there butts off to make a living and they seem to praise the people that are slacking and not doing the right thing.  I cant believe that this cracker barrel has turned into a bad place.  I use to love it.  Now they just hire anyone.
bad,Managers either make the shift bearable or not. It depends which managers are present if you will have a good shift. You never get breaks and get ready to be taken advantage of.
bad,"They asked too much of their servers. You will have double the amount of sidework than any other restaurant you work at. Also, it was the smallest amount of tips I made out of the restaurants I've worked at."
bad,"Management is a good ol' boys club. When I started there three years ago, everyone helped each other, and worked as a team. Employees were welcoming and helpful to new hires, and hard work was noticed and acknowledged by management. now its become a culture of cliques and teachers pet mentality. More and more sidework and cleaning activities are added to servers for the same pay, all while searches of the servers aprons and personal belongings have become mandatory at the end of every shift."
bad,"I've worked here for about 6 months, at first it was wonderful and I enjoyed it as it was my first job. Now i HATE it, the managers choose favorites and if you're not a favorite you never get a thank you and you're not appreciated. They cut my hours down to one day a week, less than 4 hour shifts at a time, and they never told me why or gave me an explanation."
bad,Cannot provide quality of life. Extremely stressful and not all supervising managers are quality. Health benefits are not very good. Not garaunteed breaks at all.
bad,"Fast-paced high-stress environment, especially on the weekends. Constantly understaffed, including management, so everyone feels overworked. The restaurant managers tend to become stressed and can be hard to talk to/work with. I love my coworkers and the customers, and the retail manager is one of the best managers I have ever worked for. But one thing all my coworkers and I seem to have experienced is a lack of pay raises, despite the company policy of a 3-5% raise every 6 months if you pass your performance evaluations. They avoid it by simply not doing the evaluations; I'm not sure if they do it purposefully or just feel they have more important things to do."
bad,Not enough hours. Hours being cut if you have to be out of work for anything. Favoritism shown toward certain employees from management. Poor management.  Did have benefits got paid vacation after being there a year. If you can get enough hours you do get medical insurance after being there a year.
bad,"Workers are swearing at each other getting into fights in the kitchen, customers can hear this, harassing the hosts when their table isn't sat next due to a table request, very rushed environment, very unfriendly"
bad,"Not only do the managers slack heavily on their jobs, they treat their employees horribly. More often than not, dinner rush would be a train wreck due to an issue caused my management, (low staffed due to an attempt to cut costs/they didn't order things we needed/ etc) but they always found a way to blame it on their staff. The turn over rate was incredibly high for employees and for managers which caused a serious lack of consistency. It got to the point where they would literally hire anyone, and this caused a lot of negative repercussions."
bad,This company offers great benefits. However management needs to improve and working conditions for employees could be better. This job requires lots of stamina and endurance. Shifts can be long and stressful. Pay is not compensatory.
bad,"Not a terrible place to work,  just really busy all the time.  Always hot. And if you're a cook, don't plan on getting any breaks. And it takes forever to get taises."
bad,"Management at the store level and higher up needs to care about their employees and stop trying to literally work them to death for peanuts in pay. Get professional and get organized and stop trying to ""fly by the seat of your pants""."
bad,I did not love my experience working for Cracker Barrel. I would sometimes only get scheduled for 4 hours a week making only minimum wage. There was a lot of pressure to sell items at the register to guests that were just ready to pay for their food and leave.
bad,"Managers are required to work hourly positions majority of time in order to reach labor goals, which are not met by a large percentage of the company.  So, attaining bonus is near impossible most of the time.  I personally witnessed the District Manager force a General manager to come back to work after working a full day +, the day before and with less then 2 hours of sleep, to work another full day + just to save some labor.  Why would I ever want to move up to a position like that???"
bad,"If you want to hate every second of work then go here and experience the terrible hourly rates. The only good way to make money is get a ton of tables, which is hard to do at first"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,Its an okay place of employment but they alwayss have far too many employees there on one shift leaving the servers no oppurtunity for decent tips. Usually wont leave with no more then $50 a day. They will use all servers until it becomes slow theb send everyone home leaving few servers cleaning up the entire dining room area. The tips arent worth the work.
bad,Cracker barrel promises a lot of things but as a server you do not make good tips. At the end of the night you would spend just as much cleaning as you did serving and that would make me average about minimum wage.
bad,"I didn't like this job much for the simple fact of all that was expected of us for such little pay. Also, for some odd reason, customers weren't the best to deal with on a daily basis."
bad,Some days it's worth it. Other days it's not. Just depends how much you make. On the bright side you get to bring home cash everyday.
bad,The work is pretty easy but to save money your often doing more than is fair for the compensation. you can move up the latter and do get some benefits but the pay is still terrible.
bad,Cracker Barrel was my first job after high school and it gave me the worst experience as a first job. The management was the worst. They didn't treat everyone equally that worked there.
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of taking orders, serving food, cleaning tables, kitchen duties, table maintenance, and even rolling one hundred silverware.  It was normal to be working for at least an hour after the scheduled work time, usually late at night.  The best thing about working at this Cracker Barrel was the people I got to work with.  They are some great people and would always help any other server at any time."
bad,The pay was descent but they didnt treat their employees well and the management was poorly ran. I was a dishwasher and we were like the black sheep.
bad,"I started here in July of 2015, very busy restaurant. Management agreed I'd be working first shift because of school, my first schedule I was on Mon.-Fri. 4 to close. After speaking to my manager he gave me only 1 day a week. The sections were tiny only 2 tables per server, no way to make good money. Was not allowed to leave the building on break. This is a restaurant not prison?!? We were forced to constantly tend to every table not just our own. I had customers complain too many servers were constantly coming up to them, and didn't know who their server was."
bad,"The work was very hard and the pay didn't seem to compensate for the amount of work I was doing. Though, my coworkers were very friendly and helpful."
bad,"While their slogan is old country the environment you have to work in is anything but. Foul language and etc."
bad,"I am only in my 20's but I am married and have a child. I am more mature for my age. If you work here you need to be in high school or just graduating. It's not a stable place to work. The hours are all over place, you never know when you will get to leave for the day. I enjoyed the managers there but the other employees were gossip queens and very rude. It made me wonder why some of them still had a job there."
bad,"Depending on my position that day if I was a server things went pretty smoothly.  The managers are pretty attentive to the front of the house, but once you make a mistake they turn it into the biggest mistake of the world.  Instead of a simple solution, it's always a ordeal. Mostly when it's busy the managers get this way.  As far as working dish, it is always a bad experience. We were always helped last, if at all.  Managers would literally help any and every other position in the store and wouldn't consider helping the dish at all.  I was a par 4 so i was looked up to at  the place, the crew I was placed with is far below average.  So I was doing most of the work, most of the time.  It was very stressful. Even working 10-11 hour days you would have to go and find a manager and debate about getting your authorized break.  Otherwise, you'd be working all day without one.  Favoritism was also deeply rooted in the company, I had worked there for 4 years and there were employees that came in and began making more money than me even though i was training them.  There were a lot of under the table events going on as well for example:  managers paying employees off the clock for favors, making new employees clock out and then make them continue to work, etc.  I feel as though this is a very unprofessionally ran establishment in Marion, IL."
bad,I did not like working as a hostess. This job required too much of my time as I was already a full time student in high school.
bad,"I was a Gift Shop Atendant my job was to make dislpays, wrap gifts, clean organize and pull stock from the stock room. Cleaning, counting and facing orders, checking outdates on food and candy, suggestive sales."
bad,"I like the people the work culture and attitude is wonderful, but I was promised a certain amount of hours and was essentially lied to about the work that I would be given I am not happy about that and I am actively seeking other employment."
bad,"Typical Day"
bad,"A typical day would be walking around the sales floor trying to help and sale products. I would stock the floor. Mangement was horrible, I never got enough hours. My co-workers were stuck up they would not help me with anything i needed help with. The hardest part was trying to help a customer buy a product. I really didn't like working there."
bad,You really have to watch out for management at this place. They do not have their customers or employees best interest at heart. If you get on managements bad side they will cut your hours. Other than management it is a good place to work. Co-workers will help you if you need it. The back of the house is pretty much a tight nit family!
bad,"I love the fast busy pace .However, many Long hours no work life balance ""unless you are a GM"" Advancement is limited to those that relocate (usually to other states). Pay is fair until you compare it to the extra hours you put in.  Most days you find yourself working 11-12 + without even a 20 min break to eat lunch."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"We start by stocking the sales floor and rearranging displays.  We walked around the sales floor and talked to customers.  We typically would hold something in our hands as a target item that we would display and try to sell out of that day."
bad,i enjoyed working there. Majority of the days i work be very slow. My co-workers was fun jus like me. The hardest part of the job was putting up with different customers attitudes .
bad,"Start each shift with setting up all production charts, checking voice mail, communication log or other management for any additional information needed for that day or shift. Communcation with all team members in each area as to understanding of what is needed and or what may be their focus for the shift.Set up game plan with other management as to what part of store will be our main focus thru shifts.The hardest part of the job is the constant changing of GM's, DM's.In less than 2years there have been 3 GM's and 4 DM's.The guest that come thru the store are the most enjoyable part of my job each day. So many of them in travels from place to place stop at Crackel Barrels to eat and then they will revisit there favorite ones each time , year after year. They are very appreciative of good service."
bad,"As a previous employee of Cracker Barrel, I would have to say they had a very disorganized management team and not only that but I only got about 15 hours a week after I repeatedly asked them for more. I loved the people I work with and got along with them well. My host team work pretty well together and seated the guests in a quick,fast paaced,manner."
bad,You feel like your going to die at times but you keep going. They push you to your death and always want more..
bad,"I was in desperate need of a job cause because school was running me dry. I only worked there for a short time, but I dreaded going to work everyday! There are like a million people working there and the management team isn't very helpful (or friendly). I didn't like how corporate it was either. Oh yeah and the people that eat there... Let's just say a woman asked me to help her snap her bra in the bathroom."
bad,You will not get proper training. You will have to learn things on your own.  Management also is VERY rude for no reason at all.  They will also cut your hours with no warning.
bad,"Used to be much better.  The company is unable to keep good employees, and lets bad employees stay forever instead of looking for better ones.  I  have wanted to walk out more days in the past six months than the previous six years combined."
bad,"Cracker Barrel is a great place to be, until you work there long enough to see what's behind the curtain. Imbalanced work shifts, old-fashioned work ideals, and lack of concern from management for in-house issues. Busy days are chaotic with no workload coordination. And when days off may be needed for appointments or life outside of their establishment, including another job, concerns are disregarded and scheduling often keeps you there suited to their needs and their needs only. Managers tend to put off a nepotism-type attitude that eventually drives off employees that just come there to work and go home. It could be worse, but most definitely could be better"
bad,"(Sorry for typos) This will be an in depth review of my experience working as a server at Cracker Barrel. I started working at Cracker Barrel a year ago and the interview process was very simple. I applied and was called about a day later, which I would later learn is a red flag when applying to jobs. In the interview they asked the basic questions, but it didn’t seem like my answers mattered. They have a high number of servers who quit and they just wanted more servers when I first started working there it was of course very fast paced.  All of my coworkers were very helpful and nice. Anything I needed help with they were happy to help me. But the problem started to arise with the managers. It was obvious they didn’t care about the servers and were very lazy. They’d yell at you for doing sidework, but wouldn’t help with any tasks that needed to be done. On top of this, the managers are very nit picky and will are never understanding of your problems or if you need help. The and along with this. The pay is terrible and the hours are horrible since they hire so many servers and need to balance them all. Basically don’t work here unless you want to make no money, be yelled at for not being perfect, and want to pull your hair out."
bad,"They throw you in and expect you to know what to do. Dont expect much help from other employees either. GM was nice but didnt train me."
bad,On my third day they put me in the dish room with no trainer I had no idea what to do the people that where there also had no idea what to do they where all starting the same day as me. Not even the manager themselves knew what to do with us they had to ask a cook and a server is they knew how the dish room work. Then after 5 hours they still didn’t want to give me a break. I only people knew how nasty it is inside the kitchen I thought I like Cracker Barrel never again I’m eating there
bad,I left due to the poor management team. They could not properly communicate amongst themselves or their employees. I remember multiple times I was addressed with a harsh and unnecessary tone. I love my job and helping our guests but I simply could not handle the pure disrespect any longer.
bad,"Providing excellent customer service in the food industry is your only guaranteed way of making a steady and good income. It’s giving your consistent and undivided attention to the guest and their needs. A typical day at work consists of tidying up your work space at the beginning throughout the end of your shift in a fast paced enviornment, there are small duties each employee must complete before clocking out."
bad,Bonuses aren't what they should be. Managers do all work GM makes all the money. I was very excited to work for Cracker Barrel. I got sold the dream found out later.
bad,"Poor communication among staff, especially in regards to scheduling. The environment was catty and not conducive to a healthy work environment or work/life balance."
bad,In my experience the managers are over worked and that usually trickles down into drama and hostility. I’ve been with the company 3 years and this has been consistent at least at my location
bad,"My experience at cracker barrel was poor. Overall a lot of work for little pay, and generally hot working conditions. The management expected too much and were extremely unorganized at times."
bad,Not a good place to work. Many employees are just there to make money and they have low work ethics and the management  is weak and shows favoritism to employers whose been there longer. Fights breakout in the dish room there are no breaks for new employee and it is very unclean how the cooks handle the food  using no gloves. It's a whole book and bad language all the time.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"A typical day at work involves cleaning dishes, stocking grill line. Cleaning dish machine every hour. Making sure the store is cleaned. Have to take trash out and clean the floors."
bad,"As far as a typical day would go; I'd clock in around 10, go straight to the maintenance lockers to start assembling everything I would need for the night, and then start the round. In terms of workplace environment.. lets just say it wasn't the ""family atmosphere"" that was advertised on their application website. I learned a lot about chemicals with my time there, what to avoid on certain surface, how to completely lift dirt and grit from raised kitchen floors, etc. Hardest part of the job was probably cleaning the lot and trying to dump 80+lb garbage bins near the end of the shift when you're the most tired, but besides that everything was manageable."
bad,In retail the older generation gets away with everything. In the kitchen server's attitude runs high. Huge lack of communication between all managers. Certain employees can do whatever they want while others are held accountable (for the same thing). No time and a half for holidays (that are mandatory). Advancement in retail is impossible. You have to 'coach' other employees which is pointless since management never backs you up.
bad,"DO'T APPLY FOR NIGHT MAINTENANCE!! It's just a fancy way of saying JANITOR. You have to clean the ENTIRE BUILDING by yourself, while being locked inside for 7-8 hours overnight. The worse part of the cleaning is definitely the kitchen/dish washing areas. Everyone is supposed to help keep those areas clean, but they don't 10 times out of 10, the floors are a mess, there's food/grease/gunk underneath most of the stuff in the kitchen, etc. It's too much work for just 1 person. Why this company thought that 1 person was enough for this position is beyond me. And if the drains in the kitchen get clogged up, IT'S NOBODY ELSE'S PROBLEM BUT YOURS."
bad,"The atmosphere at Cracker Barrel was extremely stressful and, even though the job was fairly simple, left me feeling frazzled and stressed at the end of my shift. The management was a mess and the managers weren't very attentive to their staff. The customers were constantly rude to the customers and they didn't listen to the hosts or the servers. All in all, it was just not the best place to work and I wouldn't recommend working there to anyone."
bad,"The regulars are great but when there's issues the old people really get grumpy. Managers at my store were absolutely horrible. Only one was actually level headed, the rest freak out when the restaurant gets busy. So much gossip and drama."
bad,"From the very moment I was interviewed I was lied to. I was told it was full time, later learned that hours were EARNED- only got 20-25 hours a week, not nearly enough to live on. Speaking of earning, was quoted one figure during the interview, never was paid that much, was informed that ""corporate didn't approve"" of the figure I was quoted. Needless to say, found another job ASAP."
bad,Mainly it’s a good environment and hospitality is nice . Just working there and putting your all your going to fill like it’s not enough money you getting paid
bad,"I waited months before they actually started giving me tables to make money off of then they started not scheduling me completely. The servers think it's all a competition and if you mess up everyone is rude. After finding a job within my career goals, they did not accept my 2-weeks notice 3 separate times, and continued to tell me to ""think about it"". Management was either always over your shoulder or not there when you need them. There was one manager who I felt didn't deserve this poor rating, but a majority was hot and cold."
bad,"If you work in the gift store, you'll stock items, greet customers and interact with them, engage them in conversation with a goal of selling the Chinese-made products they mark up with no compensation incentive regardless of how much you sell.  In the Salisbury location of NC the older sales and register women are incredibly nasty, engaging in non-stop gossip.  Be wary, these select career individuals will blame anyone and everyone else for errors in their own duties such as checking dates and prices.  "
bad,"very competitive, but easy money of you know what your doing, training provided. Short hours and 50% discounts. you leave with money each day and get paid every week"
bad,"Cracker Barrel, at least in some areas, is very fast paced and you never get a chance to learn everything you need to know before starting the job. The managers are nice and the benefits/opportunities are great but it is not worth being in that kind of environment."
bad,"Good company mission but lack of advancement opportunities for retail. Restaurant seems to offer the opportunity to use leadership skills in addition to pay; however, the retail rarely offers shift leader pay"
bad,"It's okay for a bit but it's also stressful. Not much respect for personal time. You can't advance but so much. Barely any hours. One rude manager out of many. No breaks. But, you do always learn something. For me, my manager started giving the little hours I got to someone else until I was just completely off the schedule. I also got yelled at on an intercom by that same manager and embarrassed in front of everyone. Other than that one manager, everyone else was very friendly."
bad,"You go into work find your section, get your silverware, and lastly check your section for cleanliness. You had to roll 100 silverware each day each shift. Some days you had to work two shifts with about two hours in between. Some managers were easy to get along with some were not. There are four managers that rotate through the shifts and some will help you and the others will make you feel like you are the worst person in the world."
bad,I enjoyed my time there but I am not a fan of how they have customers pay for their food.  I have had to pay several times due to customers walking through the gift shop acting like they wee shopping and then just leaving with out paying.  I would have to pay out of my pocket as I got in trouble for it.  Once the guests leaves the restaurant and enters the gift shop I can no longer see them or follow them around.
bad,Loved the people that worked there.The guests were like family. Free employee meal for managers.Home office and RVP need to work on their people skills.
bad,"I hated working at the particular one i did, not saying all cracker barrel's are the same. I was singled out and treated like an outcast because I did not work there as long as the other people did."
bad,"Cracker Barrel has such long open hours that if you're low on the ladder of authority or have some friction with scheduling managers, you're guaranteed to be given hours that require you to work until 11pm one night then start at 6am the next day, not allowing you to get much rest. The establishment also has an ""it's everyone's job to do each task"" which often translates to ""it's no one's job to do each task"" creating conflict between workers and generating blame that targets people who have nothing to do with the issue at hand."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"not the best place to work, stressful and non-beneficial. a lot of the people that worked there were nice but very cliquish as well. its an okay job to start out with if its your first job, but don't expect to get holidays off"
bad,"Poor management, lack of a good work environment. Some of the staff were easy to be around and work with, however the management was insane and awful to work for"
bad,I liked the people i worked with but managers were very strict for associating with friends. Most guests were very mean and rude and we were paid very very poorly due to the work we wpuld put in a day.
bad,They did work with me if I couldn't make it in but they were very unorganized when it came to the floor plan. They would also write you up for anything they could think of if they were in a bad mood.
bad,A typical day at work consisted of working in the kitchen cooking all the food that would be served on the line.  It was very time oriented and you had to have everything done on time.
bad,"I felt awful asking our great employees to do so much.  It was like climbing Everest every day.  Hey my only dishwasher and my only host plz do your best to bus the table and clean the dishes.  Hey servers do your best to take care of your customers, to go orders, getting your food out of the window, stocking your wait line, and maybe even bussing your own tables.  Hey cooks you are going to run one less than you NEED and the manager is not allowed to help, because the rvp says you need to do it on your own, or you are not good enough."
bad,"Overall it isn't a bad company to work for. However management needs to be worked on, and I'm not even talking about management just at my store. Management is supposed to help the employees, not ignore us or say (I can see what I can do) attitude and get nothing done."
bad,Served customers and had to accurately input orders into the computer for the kitchen. Ran food to tables and aided other servers in running food from the kitchen to tables.
bad,"One week I'll work 30 plus hours; the next I maybe bumped back to 20 or less; very hard to maintain a budget.  Some employees whom have been with the company refuse to do certain tasks or adapt to new changes.  Some behaviors overlooked that are detrimental to the company and new employees, thus a constantly revolving door to keep good help.  Must be strong willed, stubborn, and not cave in to survive.  Can be fun with the right associates who look out for each other but very unforgiving to those whom start out new.  Mixed signals always being sent from different mgr's on how to handle tasks. Information always on a need to know basis....."
bad,"Oh everything was great until they started working me only one day a week for 2 hours without giving me a reason. They want me to fix a problem at work, but won't give me hours to try and do so. It was a waste of time."
bad,"I felt like free labor when I worked for Cracker Barrel. It was all about making the wait staff do the majority of the work so the hourly employees could go home. This saved the business money, but also made it so there were too many servers on the floor and almost no one made any money."
bad,Greeting customers with a smile and caring about their needs and assisting as much as possible. Seating customers in rotation of servers who are working that current shirt. Help with any clean up or work that needs done.
bad,"Management often sacrifices the employee experience for the sake of keeping business. There is no required tip, even on large groups. But you learn the fundamentals of working a difficult job at a fast pace. You learn a ton about customer service. They are extremely flexible and will work with school schedules, etc.."
bad,The GM at the Dyersburg location is not qualified for her title. She shows favoritism (which is unacceptable no matter the circumstances) toward certain employees.
bad,"Cracker Barrel isn't what it used to be. Our place needs to be remodeled, needs better management, and so on. We need a complete turnaround. We are getting better at teamwork though."
bad,"In essence, Cracker Barrel is a good place to start out with career building. You've got a great staff, relatable people and a decent place to work when starting out."
bad,"I was backup cook from May 2013-Sep 2014.  I did not like this job mainly because management was very hypocritical; they love to enforce policy, yet managers refuse to follow standards quite often.  When a recipe calls for specificity, it has to be done by the book no matter who is cooking.  Management didn't seem to understand this.  Nor did they care if the first shift left the kitchen a disaster by the time I clocked in.  Also, management is prohibited from fraternizing with the crew, but they don't care about that standard either."
bad,"Management is pretty much non-existent. Co-workers only out for themselves. A lot of walking, carrying heavy trays, bending and cleaning, and sweeping with a small broom. But you get to meet all sorts of great, friendly, special, and unusual people. Helping people is the best part."
bad,"A typical workday for me would be arriving, checking the reports for the day, assisting guests with purchases, expediting the checkout line. The coworkers tended to talk a lot of gossip but never aimed it towards me, so that aspect didn't affect me a lot. The worst part of the job was not having management for 4 months. Management didn't know my name for the first 7 months I was there, and would call me by a different name even though it was printed on my apron. I learned during this time that it is important to get to know your guests, and that they do care about the employees so it makes up for the management not caring so much. Towards the end of my employment a new position came out which was called the Retail Sales Position which was a combination of both of the jobs I did on separate days. A lot of the new hires were paid more than I was, and this issue was never resolved. Cracker Barrel has a program that is supposed to help individuals who need disaster relief and my home was taken by a tornado in August. No one sent my papers that I had collected to the company for evaluation, so I was never assisted. All in all, guests were great enjoyed working to please them, but I would never work for the company again."
bad,The people that you work with are great. The training for a grill cook is kinda pointless due to it being all on a computer. prep cooks and cooks constantly forget to make food leading to 86ing items. The place is the dirtiest ive seen in a kitchen. glasses and dishes are always getting broken every day. workers constantly show up late with no repercussions.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"Some coworkers are nice, but the servers are often rude and do whatever they want with little repercussions. Also, the employee who was to call me and inform me of my training days did not do so, and I had to call her first."
bad,This company in my experience stacks on employees rather than giving out a multitude of hours to its faithful employees.
bad,The managers were extremely rude all of the time. I enjoyed my customers they were my highlight of the day. I was a server and as a server we were responsible for so much it was nerve wrecking.
bad,"Cracker Barrel was just not the type of restaurant that I enjoyed working in. There wasn't a great quality of life, and I really felt more like a number than a person working there."
bad,"I ring up guests from restaurant and retail, as well and help guests on the retail floor. I have learned to make people feel welcome with natural and genuine interaction. Restaurant management gives little attention to cash by not giving change, not coming up to talk to guests, and not doing withdrawals from the drawers. Most co-workers in retail are very helpful and warm. The hardest part of my job is dealing with angry customers waiting for to go orders and being by myself while having a full dining room. The most enjoyable part of my job is talking to amazing guests and learning from them."
bad,"the job was okay the managers were okay some of them not all. "
bad,I love Cracker Barrel as a company it is a great place to work. The management staff at some not all Cracker Barrels need a little work done to it. they say one thing and do another.
bad,"Constantly Busy I learned How To Set And Prep Plates Managers were Ok some Nice As Others. Some Had Order others Didn't. Some Coworkers Were easy to get along with but hard to work with sometimes. the hardest part of the job was to grill, cook eggs and prep plates by yourself on a time limit. the best pat of the job was when we clocked out to go home."
bad,when I was hired on I was told I was going to see 30 hours a week and would only work every other weekend. I ended up only working Fridays and Saturdays at night and only getting 12 hours a week. loved what I did and enjoyed the job but I felt that management had let me down and lied to me. then I requested a transfer and they never did it and continued to schedule me to work when I asked them not to because I wouldn't be able to drive that far. I ended up losing my job with them and it upset me because I would have liked to stay with the company and learned as much as I could to succeed in the industry.
bad,The hardest part of the job was to deal with the overall people that I worked with. The personal motivation and confidence of other employees was lacking.
bad,"This place was great at first until you got to know how management worked. The GM is an absolute jerk!!! I have heard him yell and cuss at employees and he is also a pig and has ""favorite girls"" once I seen him at work I had to leave. Other then that some employees were nice others snubbed you for being new. The customers and guest were nice and they do have a good system for the way things work but I would never go back there again."
bad,"I was upset with how they handled situations. People I worked with, including myself, had constanct communication issues and regular problems were rarely resolved. I also felt discriminated because of my pregnancy. I did enjoy this job but had to leave because of management problems and my pregnancy."
bad,"waitress"
bad,"Your schedule is constantly all over the place, standing for hours on end isn't too bad but we never got breaks, management cared about money but that was it and they were rarely available to help, the things that happend in my location as far as cleanliness were absolutely disgusting and the managers were some of the least professional people I've ever met"
bad,"Would not recommend for anyone trying to support a family, or trying to get their life in upstanding status.  "
bad,"job is okay, management changes quit frequently and servers tend to be treated like low lives. Favoritism happens a lot.  There is no actual end time regardless of what your schedule says for when you leave.  It's when you are told you can and sometimes they would hold you over and say you are only earning 3.15 an hour so we can keep you as long as we want to clean and such.  If you like some independence and to be trusted with your job and ability this is not the job for you.  Also no benefits and although you can make a good amount from tips you work twice as hard as a fancier resturaunt to get those tips because people tend to dollar you to death probably because it's cheap to eat there, but customers where typically very friendly."
bad,"Unfortunately this is a trouble restaurant. Management team is not a team, but a bunch of managers all looking out for themselves. Employees seem to follow the management team as far as being out for themselves. For the most part, is it any worse then most restaurants I have worked?......................yeah it is,I do have to say so. As with all restaurants, it is is a very demanding and stressful job not only for the managers, but for employees as well. To hire staff that is not suitable for this environment is not doing anybody any good. I worked for this company for almost 2 years and its not the company its what is going on with the Watertown Store. I think the biggest culprit unfortunately is who and what is running the retail store side. That is all I can say with regards to that. Oh yeah, I do know what I am talking about because I was one of those managers. I left on my own and it was the best decision I could have made. I guess the environment was just not conducive to my own past experiences working in this industry and being a general manager for many years."
bad,Crowed. not enough space. i learned how to work a cash register. the hardest part was keeping everything together.
bad,Cooking and cleaning store making sure everything is stocked up and put in place as head chef.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,Awesome companies to work for to begin with.. Chances to advance to different levels.
bad,"I worked for Cracker Barrel for six months. I learned a lot about myself here, I grew a lot, I improved a lot, not perfect but I’m working on it. I transferred to the Macon store. When I got there, the managers were great but they were changing things around. The New GM acted like she didn’t care about you, mistreated you, talked down to you and always felt she was right. Every manager under her acts scared and miserable now. I hated to leave but we all have to move on. Just go make your money and stay positive"
bad,"These issues may have specific to my store but nonetheless there were issues. There were a lot of cliques in my job and a lot of childishness between servers and retail associates. I didn’t fit in here . I was told by a manager that I “need to wear makeup”. As a young girl that was destructive to a growing teenager stepping into adulthood . I wish I would’ve loved this job , but it was my first job and I quickly learned that it’s not rare to have coworkers and management that treat and/or speak to you or others that way."
bad,"I enjoyed working with the people there, but I would have preferred much more hours and even after asking management for more, my requests were heard but not fulfilled, despite many more people being hired in my position of work."
bad,the amount of hours you get is nothing you could live off of basically saying you would need a second job if you’re working in retail at cracker barrel. the retail manager is very unfair & competitive.
bad,"Cracker Barrel serves as consistent money where if taught correctly, and maintain a personable relationship with your customers, you can easily have over 100$ a day."
bad,"One of the worse Mgrs I have ever had to work with at a very good job."
bad,There was a lot to do for what you get paid. Management kept us moving non stop. They give you water based drinks only for free and discounted meals  .
bad,Funny employees most are hard working fast pace is good everyone is friendly with good vibes I Also like the fact we can have food when we wanted it .
bad,"Very unorganized, very rude, and the pay wasn't good. The staff here were very unkind and didn't like to work together and the boss liked to yell all the time"
bad,Wouldn’t ever work there again because managers were non understanding of workers medical conditions and did not seem to make sure waitresses were helping bussers.
bad,"A typical day of work would include a mass amount of customers to handle and care for. Great learning experience, though management needs working on. The hardest part of the job is having to juggle too many things. The most enjoyable part is making friends to where they feel like family there."
bad,"A typical day at work includes:"
bad,It didn't fit my personal style. I don't like country music or their food so this is a biased opinion. Tip averages were low. Some of the management and some of my coworkers were great
bad,"VERY slow-paced job. There are many pay raises and chances to gain “stars”, but the job is extremely slow. You’ll constantly be around rude elderly people, and the servers are RUDER!"
bad,"It was my first job. Hours around holidays could be crazy but as soon as Christmas is over, I was lucky if I got 10 hours a week. It would be so dead, sales were in the gutter and they couldn't pay everyone so because of that it turned into an on-call only kind of job. Wouldn't reccomend to anyone who needs a steady weekly income."
bad,"A typical day at work started with clocking in. I then proceeded to get a headset to communicate with my co-workers and getting menus to take with me to the host stand. I would seat guests, change the floor plan, update the managers every 10-15 minutes, and clean up around the restaurant. On busy days, the managers were extra hard on us and guests grew impatient very easily, creating a high-stress environment. Some days, I was left alone to handle the host stand and I would have to start a wait. I would say the job was not hard at all, but there were very stressful situations that made me leave crying at least once or twice a week. The hours were also very unfair and sometimes I would only be working 6 hours a week while another employee would be working 15. I did enjoy my co-workers a lot, but overall it was a very bad experience."
bad,"I know for a fact by trying to get into management that its in the top 15 worst stores in the company. The General Manager could care less about you which henders all job advancement. The managers are hit and miss. Cracker Barrel itself is ran really well and has some of the best food waste mechanics available in the restaraunt business even with a high given ""allowable"" waste yield."
bad,The hardest part of the job was the constant rush of dishes with too few people to work each position. Many tasks were put on dishwashers that did apply to them such as cleaning the break room but as a dishwasher breaks could not be taken.
bad,I did not have a good management team and hated my job every shift I worked as a server. Management played the blame game and picked favorites. Retail wasn't as bad.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"Cracker Barrel is a nice place to work at. I wouldnt recommend the place though. Our management team is day to day. Not one manger follows the other manager. "
bad,It was an enjoyable working experience. I learned that working in a restaurant can be a very challenging but rewarding experience. The number of hours and the pay I was receiving were inadequate for the amount of time I spent working there.
bad,"A typical day at work would start off by clocking in and going to the host stand, dishroom, back up area. In those three position I will be either seating guests, cleaning tables and dishes, or preparing bread or bacon. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to interact with other people as a host. the hardest part of the job is preparing bread and bacon. The management is strict and fair. Most of my co-workers are easy to get along while a few are less desirable to be around."
bad,I only worked there less than 30 days I can not adequately evaluate this position
bad,The pay for this job was very good. Management was often hard to deal with. Hours were often very chaotic one week 40+ hours the next week 20.
bad,Everything and everyone was nice. I just wish my skills were pushed and used more frequently and my thoughts and ideas were heard more. I also wish it cared more about the employees along with the guest.
bad,I worked for Cracker Barrel for a year an a half. When first started GM was new so very friendly. Then a big turn around where she lost most employees. Continuously yelling at her employees and never giving us the support we would need when busy.
bad,Everyone is like family. Team work is key to bettering the company and each other. Making sure everyone is staying motivated and also creating a well rounded and positive environment.
bad,Our tips would get stollen by bussers and other servers management was rude to employees worker here was very stressful most of the time we wouldn't be treated with respect by anyone nor would anyone help when you needed it.
bad,"This job was stressful, they always called me in on my days off because they were understaffed and undertrained, the managers didn't manage well, and the dinner rushes were nearly impossible to deal with sometimes. Would not recommend."
bad,Working at Cracker Barrel wasn’t so bad until it was every week they would mess up my checks and i would be under-payed. Other than that we would get a morning rush around 8-10am then a Church rush around 12-2. The rest of the day would be smooth sailing from there
bad,"Very stressful but that alone does not mean it's not for everyone."
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"Unfortunately even thought this was my first job, never ever again nor recommend to anyone to work there, is about all i have to say about working at this place."
bad,"All i wanted to do was to move up and change positions in the restaurant, and my hours were cut from 30 hrs to 6 a week. It was humiliating. Dont work here."
bad,This was a job where servers were often punished for cooks mistakes and night after night of people asking you what is on their plate because it looks nothing like they ordered gets stressful
bad,Was not flexible and has disrespectful management. I felt disrespected and under appreciated while working here and there were not many people that stayed under that management. Most people transferred to a different store or stopped working for the company all together. I can only hope that they have improved management since I left.
bad,"Job is very stressful and in my area, the Cracker Barrel has cheap customers which lead to cheap tips. Hours were hard to get but the coworkers were mostly okay"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,Learned to manage large crowds and work together with coworkers. I was able to get experience as a host as well as assist my coworkers with their tasks.
bad,"Management made the job much more stressful than it needed to be and were never understanding or patient. Other than that, it was an okay place to work."
bad,"Typical restaurant job, managers can be a pain. If you do your job right it’s not very hard. Very difficult to work with the incompetent coworkers that bring down your tips with long wait times on meals or servers that break glass in the ice bins."
bad,"Thanks to this Cracker Barrel, I don't see myself attending a Cracker Barrel as a customer or even applying to one in the future. Seriously unorganized and chaotic inside and outside the kitchen."
bad,You were expected to do way to much work for the low pay and busy work conditions and got no respect from supervisors no trust and watched made me feel like a criminal the whole time i worked very stressful for the low pay not worth the time
bad,Having a good or bad working day/night at Cracker Barrel varied day to day depending on which employees and managers were working. They clearly pick their favorite employees and it is obvious who those favorites are. Most times some of these managers including the General Manager are not very professional in front of customers when it comes to getting on employees for doing something wrong.
bad,"It was a Good Job But Wasent Paying enough"
bad,I love how relaxed it is but the management does not care about how stressful the job is. People smell like weed when they come to work and some people are lazy and don’t do there own job. Servers are rude and management is very horrible don’t work here or just make it a pass on job to get to the next one because you will absolutely hate it and want to drink every night.
bad,"I asked to work full time before I started back there again. I have worked at most 25 hours a week. The majority of the managers are good, but Lauren is my most favorite. She makes working there bearable. The hours are long and sometimes the managers don't take servers off of the floor plan at their off time, even when we're not busy. You only get paid $3 per hour plus tips and you'll sometimes get an 11-8 shift and hardly make any money because business is slow. Once I find another job, I am putting my 2 weeks in. Definitely not a place to work at for a long time."
bad,"Though years ago the amount of hours given to/ expected of minors was ridiculous, working from 6:00 am-8:30 pm on a Saturday with only an hour break between shifts. Disrespectful management and staff in general"
bad,I applied to be a hostess and that was the position I was hired for. I chose this job because I have had back surgery and it was easy to do. Management slowly moved me to serving which stresses out my back and I am having a hard time getting moved back to hostess.
bad,They would call me off of work way before my shift ended because someone else wanted hours so they would send whoever they saw first home. People were very rude and it was a lot of rushing around not doing things right kind of job.
bad,The managers don’t care about you. Just their job. It was an okay job to be my second but I would never go back. Customers are rude and the managers don’t care.
bad,"It was never easy. Always trying to make people happy even when all they did was complain. If a sever took a break she didn't make money, so servers never took breaks until they were too tired to work. Management was awful. They had favorites and relationships with employees that was illegal."
bad,"I was one of over 120 employees. I was treated as a number, They had way too many managers. All of them had biased management styles. Their constructive criticism was way too personal and very unprofessional. They did not give me enough hours and were difficult in general."
bad,"I loved doing all the varies jobs i did at cracker barrel, but the pay, managers, and work environment was terrible. A typical day at work is busy with very poor communication."
bad,Hard place with a hard problem being able to get staffed.  Horrible above store manager who didn’t seem to care.  Good staff in restaurant shibboleth made me stay so long
bad,I like to enjoy my job that I work at so Cracker Barrel wasn’t really a good place for me personally. I lived really close and barely worked when they made of seem like I was going to be working a lot. I applied for Server and got hostess. The training period wasn’t very fulfilling and you had to be the one to call and check up on things because they don’t call you sometimes.
bad,Cracker barrel is a good place to work at depending on you. It is a great secondary job which is part time and is a stressful job to work at . If your are in high school it can benefit you very well. Having no breaks really makes it hard as well
bad,"A typical day as a hostess at Cracker Barrel is helping with the placement of vthe guest so the serves do not become overwhelmed or do not have enough guest in their section. I have learned to be flexible and adjust to every different situations which might accure I also been taught how to handle each every guest needs, and I have learned even more about being proactive and diplomatic with the guest. The culture at Cracker Barrel is very diverse people coming from all parts of life, from different parts of the world, to beliefs, and age. Is of course the conflict that arises at any job. The most enjoyable part is the interaction with the guest, scripting/advertising the menu and the specials, as well as getting the guest anything that would make their stay/meal motre enjoyable."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"Clock in, check my section, wait on tables. Had to deal with unprofessional coworkers, managers had favorites & coworkers tried to act as a manager. Coworkers and cooks were not very friendly."
bad,Cracker Barrel isn’t an awful place to work at night it defiantly wasn’t for me. For the most part I enjoyed the work environment and how the kitchen was run but the disorganization and the lack of caring about one on other positions is in called for.
bad,"Fast paced environment that was enjoyable to work at and had plenty of responsibilities include ,but pay grade was not up to par.   I switched jobs for advancement purpose's."
bad,"It was good at first but after couple months everything went downhill. i made a a lot of friends but as a hostess you get blamed for everything, the servers don't help"
bad,I do not recommend working at this store. Management is not the best and crying at work is not a uncommon thing. Most days it super disorganized and insufficient.
bad,"Its was a fun job for a while but I have sales training and experience that I would love to use in an additional career. I am great with the telephone, in person sales, all levels of communication, and public speaking."
bad,"I did not feel that I was treated fairly during my time at Cracker Barrel. I was cut short of hours often, paid well under my coworkers doing the same quality of job as me and the management was very sub par."
bad,A typical day at work included taking orders and serving customers and going back through their time there to check on them. Stocking items and cleaning were a big part too.
bad,"I enjoyed the fast paced work environment but found it stressful when management would not assist in growth and a smooth work environment, and would rather discourage you versus see you succed."
bad,Management was annoying. If you are a younger person you are surrounded by older people who have little to nothing in common with you. i just wish it was a funner environment
bad,They just not right in there.  Harassing people time you get to work rushing certain people because of time they have put in . They just inconsiderate of people who do good work
bad,It was a great job for first time serving experience. Depending on the location it is set to your pace and helps you prepare yourself for other future jobs.
bad,Not a good place to work. High turnover. Management sucks. They only care about themselves and not their workers. Food is served cold and wrong. Training is a day and then thrown to wolves
bad,"job duties as a server include washing your own dishes, helping everyone else with no help in return, and staying 3 hours after your shift to complete side work"
bad,Cracker barrel was a crazy horse of a job let alone it being somebody's first job. It's a hardworking job to be classified as a dishwasher. I wouldn't recommend that job to anybody
bad,It was my first job didn't really care to work there but I did take my job seriously. Cracker Barrel is a very serious company and if you don't care about the job then don't apply.
bad,when u have young teenage kids in the kitchen who don't care how the kitchen looks its hard to get them to clean it like it should be every night the right way
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,The people that I worked with were good.  The managers were very biased and had their favorites and were not afraid to show it.  I enjoyed serving the people that came in and talking to them.
bad,Cracker Barrel wasn't for me. The atmosphere and myself didn't coincide well and I found myself feeling very out place and out of my comfort zone. On top of that the pay was very low
bad,"The management was great , always cared about you and what was going on.. But the co workers had the worst attitudes I've ever seen, most of the time for no reason and even coming over and screaming at the hostess stand. Hours were horrible, I couldn't live off a paycheck .. They gave me 2 days a week to work only 4 hours, and every single time they would say I could go home half hour early or even more sometimes.. I'm used to working many hours so to come to this job was a big change.. I wouldn't recommend if you're trying to make money"
bad,"I enjoyed the pace of the job but they just having you doing above and way beyond the call of the server. They would have you basically doing every single job in the building, and when it came to making sure your guests were happy and making sure their food got out in time by grabbing your own trays, they got very upset and said I ""was not a team player"""
bad,"I worked here for a month as a dishwasher. It was very difficult. They did not enforce breaks. Because my coworkers would take such long breaks, I would not take my breaks, because then the dishes would pile up and we would be there until 2 in the morning washing dishes. I did not like it, I did not like that the waiters/waitresses were so inconsiderate when they would bring dishes back to us. Not a fun place to work."
bad,"Communicate, communicate, communicate! Whether it was between myself and my co-workers or between myself and management, communication was difficult. I always felt stressed and pressured and if someone tried talking to me, I would stumble on my words and would hardly be able to express my thoughts. I wish management would have taken the time to get to know their employees a little bit more than just a first-name basis. For example, if management had gotten to know me better, then they would have known that my immune system is a 24/7 battle and if I expressed how sick I was feeling, then they would know that I wasn't trying to get out of work duties but instead I was asking for help. However, communication is a two-way street. If I had known I was pregnant since day 1 at working there, then I could have told them from the very beginning that I needed to work in a different position instead of being around odd smells for long periods of time. At the same time, management needed to follow through with their promises. After I told management I was pregnant, they promised to put me in a different position. Instead of following through however, they still had me as an employee but didn't schedule me for any kind of position for an entire month. This forced me to quit."
bad,"Managers do not help internal issues between workers. Hours are fine but pressured into working double shifts. Insulted when you are not moving fast enough, esspecially on holidays. This is by far, the worst job I have ever had"
bad,"dreadful "
bad,I was a cashier here. Nice clean friendly environment. Great food and customer service. I just cashed out food tickets and bagged to go orders.
bad,"All the employees I have worked with are nice and willing to help me learn, but the company is very unorganized.  There are constant scheduling changes, managers do not relay info to other managers about employees.  They sometimes ""forget"" to schedule additional help for busiest time of day."
bad,"I loved my job at Cracker Barrel for a little while. It seemed like to me once you exit the ""rising star"" level of employment, the managers change the way the treat you. For me personally, I went from feeling like I was a part of a family to immediately having to watch my back."
bad,you bust your tail and dont make that muuch money. its really fast pace so you get them in there and get them out as quickly as possible. flipping tables is the motto. you constantly doing something you cant stand around and talk at all. the Co-workers that have been there the longest are really hard on you when you first start out. dont be late they dont care youll get fired. some managers are cool just depends on if you cut up with them.
bad,"It's okay, the place I worked at, at the time was completely drama filled and crazy. Though pay was good...wasn't worth it at times."
bad,I had an issue with management. They didn't train me that long at all and had to learn A LOT on my own.
bad,"Management was pretty poor, hours were cut fast. washing dishes and utensils were very easy."
bad,I got very few hours. Made very little money. Some customers were not very gracious when it came to tipping servers. Staff was fun.
bad,"It was always busy, which isn't a bad thing but be prepared to get straight to work when you get there. The clientele was awful, full of truckers, old cranky people and just a lot of hick families, not to sound prejudiced but all locations are on the interstate and you get what you expect. My GM stole merchandise and was fired and another store I transferred to for a month, the manager called the servers demeaning names and he was sincere about it and hung up on me when I called in sick on the 4th even though I really did have the flu."
bad,They have unbelievable expectations of Management. I felt like I was under fire throughout my employment
bad,"Fasted paced"
bad,I was also a prep cook here. Arriving at 8 am and working past lunch. I would prep the daily list while also working the salad and dessert line. I learned a lot at this job and enjoyed the baking part when I made desserts. The worst part was mixing coleslaw!
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,"I began working for Cracker Barrel in Spanish Fort, Alabama. I have a complex schedule but I was assured with taking the position that they were more than happy to work with my schedule. When the managers underwent the new rotations the new scheduling manager would not schedule me at all when it says I can work. However, the days I could not work I was always put on the schedule."
bad,"just a part time job and it was ok. I was just a dishwasher.  It was  a good company to work for. Management was alright, I had to issues with them."
bad,In my opinion the place has gone downhill since I have started there. It is very unorganized and the management doesn't seem to care anymore because of this.
bad,"Over the years, the particular Cracker Barrel I worked at, hired more and more young, single, college students.  Some of these people aspired to do great things and were wonderful people; however, a lot of these people were there to only do the bare minimum, called out a lot, and caused A LOT of drama with people's personal lives.  My suggestion would be just go to work to do just that- work."
bad,"Each and every day I learn something new. I meet new and unique people every day, from all over the United States. My mangers and co-workers are very encouraging in every aspect of work. I do not see any part of my job being hard, it is a very easy laid back job that I enjoy but I'm looking for something more of a challenge. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people. "
bad,I enjoyed working while I was in school. They really worked with my school schedule
bad,"Loved the fast paced work environment, but was a tough company to work for. They really didn't care for their employee's, which made it hard to keep them."
bad,I love how much I have been able to rise up in position. Make really good money as a server. The only problem is I have a thyroid issue and have to go to the DR alot then I ended up in a car accident and the Cracker Barrel insurance does NOT do much at all!! Only seven visits to a DR a year and if you know anything about thyroid problems you have to switch meds alot and visit drs. and have tests done. Come to find out Cracker Barrel slipped through the cracks on insurance just to save them money. For a par four server trainer almost there for two years now I also found out there is no short term disability for someone recovering from shoulder surgery. I can't believe of all the we have to go through for this company and all we do for them to make money for them not to help out a fellow employee..
bad,People stealing tables. Rude managers. Wouldnt work here if they begged me to.
bad,Management had little to no training in dealing with conflict within the store.
bad,"The people there were not very nice. I was treated like a criminal. I have worked customer service for 11 years but I was yelled at on a daily basis for saying have a nice day too many times or not answering the phone on the first ring, along with multiple other things I find to be insignificant."
bad,"cracker barrel wilmington has some very rude and disrespectful grill cooks, a few disrespectful managers, gives special treatment to some employees, is constantly out of needed and popular stock, though, the tips are good and usually pretty rewarding at the end of the shifts, has a great trainer and a helpful and mostly friendly staff."
bad,Tips are never consistent (except for weekends). The customers are almost always rude and condescending. Management is a pain at times. The servers don’t get the help they need from the kitchen or dish. Servers kept 1-2 hours past clock-out time usually.
bad,"My older coworkers were very rude and catty--this went unchecked by the management. Other employees consistently delivered poor customer service, but they were allowed to continue working there because managment didn't feel like hiring anyone else. The majority of the managers acted lost and they barely ever responded  to calls over the headset. People would have random conversations over the headset and it made it impossible to relay pertinent information. Half of the cash registers malfunction terribly, and management acts like it's your fault. "
bad,i dont work there anymore. i am never going back. its sucked working there. they dont know how balance. treat their employees not good and cut hours .
bad,"It kinda got old fast as I realized that it wasn't so exciting. After a while, the newness wore off. There's not much of a change honestly, it's not like you can do more interesting work after a while. It's the same old thing, period. Also the restaurant is kinda poorly managed."
bad,"My time at Cracker Barrel was very short lived because I found out quickly that it wasn’t for me. Training consisted of three days and then they put you on the floor. They say they start you out with two tables for your first shift but after the first hour, I had five. "
bad,"Hosting Had it’s ups and downs, working there was nice I w joyed it. Management was nice and very kind. Only problem was getting   Bussing hours twice a week. (Usually weekends)"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,In the beginning I loved my job. As time progressed and changed happened at the home office it wasn’t fun anymore. They only thought about profit and not employee experience. There was never enough help to support business needs causing undo stress on everyone.
bad,"I walk in one day see a lot of dishes needing to be washed. Broken dishes everywhere, more dishes continue to pile up. Everything is a mess , but the food benefits and discounts are nice."
bad,"Personally, I expected Cracker Barrel as a top of the line family restaurant. I felt like I was going to be part of something greater. But, as a dishwasher the job is not only overwhelming, its abhorrent. I have to deal with servers who not only stack the dishes in a way where we can have more in the tub, but some never put their trash or silverware in tje proper bins (as part of their job description). They never listen to management or the rest of the dishwasher team, and have left broken plates and glasses in the tubs. The management always excuses servers because its ""busy"" and mistakes ""happen"", but I'm not allowed to make the job easier on myself? Furthermore, the most people we have on any 1 time is 3 people, which on some days is understaffed. My hiring manager never pointed out if I was working fulltime or parttime, but noone who works here as a dishwasher ever makes more than 36 hours, average is 30. So...in all I am extremely disappointed in the way this place is managed."
bad,I just want to say I got sick had to be hospitalized. They have this program Cracker Barrel Cares a bunch of bull submitted my application an they kept saying that they was missing information but I have submitted everything I could really use the money I have four kids. But they can help some old people go see every Cracker Barrel be open.
bad,It's a part time job good for young people to start off with there first jobs Server part is Fast money .  it also have a retail part with the restaurant
bad,"I did a lot of hard work in the dish room, I was trained to be a server next but they wouldnt take me out of the dish room. I got along great with all the employees."
bad,"Not too shabby of a place to work at. The orientation is a grueling effort, much longer than any other restaurant orientation I've been through.. but if you can't make it through that, the place ain't for you!"
bad,"The one thing I will miss about working at Cracker Barrel is the money that I made, paired with the awesome discount and opportunity to work in other parts of the restaurant. Otherwise, I'm happy to be free."
bad,the hardest part about working there was the sweets & candies. The job was fun I had time to talk to customers welcoming & saying good bye.
bad,"Personally, Cracker Barrel was not a good fit for me due to conflicts of professional matters between corporate rules and myself. For most other people I would suggest this job!"
bad,Everyday I had something to juggle weather it be learning or training new people or taking care of the guests needs. I had three job titles there and that is something that you should try and do.
bad,"I worked there for 2.5 years, until they brought this crazy manager in to be the GM I like I it until then. We had a lot of fun "
bad,"Great company you can work in different areas such as cashier, retail, host, server etc. There is usually about four associate managers and one general manager. Management is so disorganized when it comes to answering phone calls and finding employees to work call-in shifts. The managers will ask employees to see if they can find people to work shifts. Although this job works with your availability they will give certain newer employees or others employees more hours and days. They will also schedule someone to work a three hour shift for two days which is unacceptable. They will just hire more employees until the older ones quit after so much complaining. Employees will get hired and most of them will quit two weeks later when they see they wont get the hours that management said they would get in the interview. They let the restaurant manager handle cashier schedule which they should let the retail manager handle it. The good thing is you get raises but you have to stay long enough."
bad,good place to work love it and good people there moved to a new place and they give you good hours to work nice people that a nice food and hard workers
bad,for the most part its a great environment they can work harder or who they let become manager because everyone not made for high volume stores over all I love it there but need new management
bad,I constantly feel like I'm back in high school. Managers gossip behind your back unless you're a kiss butt who grovels the ground they walk on. Co-workers are fun and different but some are bossy and think the world owes them everything. I learned that the public isn't as friendly (even in the south) when you work for a restaurant. The most enjoyable part of the job were the Christmas parties and events the managers through for us for holidays.
bad,quick paced work environment. busy store. high volume. cycle of service. many employees. helpful team members. stressed managers. long days. unreliable schedules.
bad,I did not like the job very much the management and other workers to me all played favoritism regardless of how good or bad you did at your job or any other job you were asked to do
bad,cracker barrel is a very upbeat resteraunt and is very big on southern hospitality. the scene and moode of the resteraunt is very relaxing and the employees work together!
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
bad,working in a family restaurant was very educational and listening and learning new things from a new group of people. it was for sure a good thing to learn from in a friendly and family environment.
bad,"I love working here. The co-workers are great, the managers are amazing and funny. The only flaw is for some reason this restaurant attracts the worst kind of people both in attitude and tips. You would go in feeling so happy and leave with a depressed look on your face. Huge parties of 20 people would come in and leave a 5$ tip. The amount of ignorance is baffling."
bad,it was an okay job somedays it was smooth some days it was not. It was a experience but it was paying ok. it was a great resuraunt to work at and im proud to say that i was apart of.
bad,"the job is for the more older person not something that i recommend a teen working at. the environment reminds me of a nursing ahome and it is very slow and boring. nothing for a permanent job its just something for me to get by at the moment and that isnt really working because the money there is slow, as a server you are really tipped on the price of the bill and your service but you will never get a 20 tip on a 10 dollar check and almost every check at cracker is 10 dollars."
bad,Greeting and serving guest as they are seated at the table by the host. I learned you have to work at a fast paste and make each guest just as happy. The management wasn't well due to the bi-polar boss and another boss trying to talk to men and women on the job. Both these managers got fired. My co-workers were very good to work with and help you when help was needed. The hardest part of the job was working fast under pressure. I enjoyed serving each customer and bringing home anlot of tips each day.
good,"Never off on time poor pay no benefits unless you want to pay deductable 5,000 up front. Management at that time had favoritism. Do get cross trained."
good,This job was both good and bad. There was always drama and stupid stuff. But so much overtime and discount at the gift shop. Which is awesome especially when you get 20% off plus what’s in clearance
good,"The manager is an idiot. The other managers are great to work for, even though they dont even enforce their own company policies. . The only thing the only thing the manager cares about is profit. Not the employees under him."
good,Very strict but a fulfilling job for temporary. Kitchen was small. Its a fast place environment. It is always very busy all hours of the day. No breaks or smoke breaks aloud for part-time workers.
good,"Good money and it's a good learning experience for servers, host, and Grll cooks. The job is big on hospitality and that costumer is always right. And the snow bird love eating there in the south."
good,I took the job to get me thru a time that i didnt have any income at all.  It got me thru that difficult time and i am grateful for that. I do not forsee myself going back to that work environment.
good,IT is a good money maker but it is very stressful for a server. Not secure to make money everyday some times it is really slow you make 30 a day and you dont get paid hourly.
good,"I always get denied for my requests off. I have to get a doctors note ahead of schedule for  a surgical procedure to get off of a whole weekend after mysurgical procedure. I missed every holiday (Christmas Eve, Thanks Giving). I have no social life and ever since I worked for this company my anxiety is through the roof."
good,"The worse job that I've ever had. You work long hours and make most days barely minimum wage, and yet still owe money at end of year. You get free biscuits but no other incentive or compensation for really cruddy pay for everything."
good,My manager was very condescending and it made working under her stressful and felt belittled all the time. It got to the point I dreaded the thought of having to get up and go to work. The work wasn't hard but the way I was treated I constantly felt like it was never good enough. The training was good though and that's about it.
good,I would work there again but not in Kingman Arizona store location 416.. it was filled with drama and very hard to get to know some one by first name basis due to the fact there was someone new.. and who can work off of 11 hrs a week and like 1 day to 2 days a week? It' was not fun..
good,Does not apply to the restaurant.  It's hard to rate the restaurant when you have never worked for them  This is based on the Louisiana based convenience store.
good,"Not the greatest environment to work in. Worker turn around was incredibly constant. Couldn't keep an employee. Whether cause of work environments, managers, or the stress of the job."
good,"The coworkers were rude to each other and customers , management needs better improvement. Wouldn't recommend anyone working there! Horrible place."
good,my manger was not all that enjoyable but I loved the job. could be better there
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,This location is not the best as far as management and the way that it’s being ran. The costumers often times are not nice and sometimes say things that are very disrespectful.
good,They always held us hours over our scheduled time and they were bad about giving us breaks. They also had some rude managers and one manager who was excessively creepy and also pushed his religion into you.
good,"It was alright. Some of the management team was alright, but others showed a lot of favoritism towards other employees. Money wasn’t really there due to overstaffing."
good,The people I work with are great are able to lean on them and ask question when need. But everyone walks on eggs shells when the GM walks in. Your critisied from you nail color to the age you are when fallen pregnant as personal life is anyones business aside from that person's. Everyone comes to make money not to be criticized about how we are living our life outside of work or our intelligence/ how fast pace of a learner we are. But like I said the coworkers are amazing the management is a joke.
good,"-Lots of drama as can be expected from a restaurant."
good,"I used to love my job, but when new employees were making more than I was after a year and half, I was not happy. Management treats everyone like sub par. the only good thing about working there is that they will work with family/ school working conflicts."
good,"I worked for CB for three years. Two years I was in an advance development program, a shift leader, a promo roll out district trainer, and a certified trainer. By the time I left I trained 12 people promoted over me with significantly less experience. When I inquired as to what I was missing, all I was told was development."
good,"I mean, do I really need to say more? There is a reason I left this job to pursue other venues. I was not cut out to be a server. I am entirely too awkward and no amount of training is going to fix that. I was not making the money I needed to support my family."
good,"No set raise "
good,"fast paced, hardworking, and team member workplace. "
good,The customers are usually pretty easy to deal with. Coworkers for the morning shifts are nicer and more pleasant than the night shift. Management has recently changed.
good,Company is okay but I would not recommend working here for the simple fact that they don’t care about their employees and they work you to death. Fast money
good,"Very Fast passed, Unorganized, stressful"
good,"The management gossips more the workers. The GM was terrible. He came in and didn't learn the atmosphere of the restaurant; he just started changing things immediately. The morale of the workplace declined dramatically. You knew you were expendable. I put my two weeks' notice in, but ended up not being able to work those last few shifts. I was basically told that I would not be able to be rehired. The atmosphere is extremely petty."
good,"I liked it at first, but couldn't even make enough in tips some nights to afford the gas home. The majority of the time you're there, you're required to fill a big plastic tub with rolled silverware, which you have to fight other servers for and every night at least one person will not have been able to do any silverware. You have to clean your area you were last assigned before you can leave. Most the other waitress are rude and will steal your tables if they can get away with it. You don't get paid nearly enough for over half your shift to not be on the floor. Also the trays weigh anywhere from 10-40 lbs."
good,The staff was not supporting each other they had their own agendas of how the workplace should be run. You never know what rules to follow each day. None of the people on the job never followed rules and come to work not wanting to work. Everything was so discombobulated. The pay was terrible I wasn't making enough to pay bills with and I'm still financially struggling with or no income.
good,"greeted, seated and served customers.  Brought out their food.  My first job got me through college till I graduated.  50 % off meals while working."
good,This job pays very little and works you even less. It's perfect if you are 16.
good,"there is a fast turnover there and it is due to managment. I think that managment overhires because so many people quit.  Due to so many hires it was difficult to get decent hrs.; sometime, only working 11 hrs. pr. wk."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"The restaurant atmosphere is family friendly dining with a gift shop. The management was severely lacking in professionalism and patience, they always wanted more than reality could withstand."
good,"Cracker Barrel was not the best choice of employment for me, they did not give proper training, did not care for their employees, did not care if the employees were given their breaks, even on a 10 hour shift. The management at Cracker Barrel was poor and they never cared about anyone or what they were going through. I had a personal experience where my great grandmother was passing away and and my manager laughed in my face."
good,"Cracker barrel,  I hate working here ,  pay sucks,  they don't give pay raises,  they are a cheap company to work for,  no consistent schedule,  no 40 hour work week,  how in the world are you supposed to pay your bills"
good,"I just didn't like being dishwasher there they expect more from you than anyone e"
good,"I was a cashier at Cracker Barrel. It’s a great job, however management was rude and would embarrass you in front of customers that you have to refer to as “guests” which is odd. When working on the retail side you have to go to meetings in which you role play, presenting to make a sale. They also make you do computer work to earn your next star on your apron which only gives you a very minimal raise. Management, unrealistic expectations for sales, never any breaks, and they gave me a hard time not being able to come in during my prom weekend; an experience you never get again all added up to me quitting. After my boss decided to be extremely rude to me in front of all the staff was the last straw. I didn’t quit the job, I quit management. Every location will offer a varying experience."
good,"very poor management, they expect the servers to do everything. make salads, clean up behind other servers, managers don't want to manage, they like to stand in the doorways like they are doing something or watching  sports on their phone. Its sad that someone like me spent 5 years with the company I actually like my job there, but you know a poor management staff and being talked to like a dog, makes u not even want to go to work there anymore. {moving forward}"
good,"The people and environment is fun to work at for a part time job. The management is not too good, the people make up for it tho. Pay is minimum wage, there’s not many career opportunities."
good,"I was only scheduled 15-20 hours a week after months of asking for 25-30 hours, I would be approved for a day off for weeks and still get scheduled, then I got in trouble when I called them and told them I could not work those days.  I trained new employees for almost a year before I found out they were getting paid more than me. The whole management team falls apart when one of them goes on vacation. The general manager causes the most stress during high times and doesn't know how to diffuse a situation between guests or his employees. The servers are overly competitive and will harass others over the smallest things. Servers will come in high and drunk, but won't get disciplined if they are long-time employees. The most enjoyable part of my job was taking a bathroom break and getting away for 30 seconds."
good,"The management could not get along or agree on when to give raises for their employees. Each manager had their favorite, and verbally judged the other employees."
good,"I learned alot from Cracker Barrel. The training procedure was very good. But they do not stick by their employees, no respect, but did make great money there."
good,"Overall Cracker Barrel at first was a nice place. However you are over worked with shipments coming in. Work alone, when it’s a 2 to 3 person job. Then expected to be finished with it in a short period of time."
good,"Cracker Barrel is very focused on pleasing people, but has no regard for the quality of life of the employees.  The culture is rigid and the management is very prejudice, as evidenced by their long standing battle with the Department of Justice for harassment and discrimination."
good,Hardest part is most of the employees are high school students who have attitudes.  Some of the managers are not professional.  Some servers are not friendly.
good,"Cracker Barrel used to be very family oriented when I was first hired and has become a very stereotypical corporate facility. Money has become all of what the business stands for and it used to be family. It is a very stressful place to work, very unaccommodating management team, selfish coworkers, unsympathetic when seriously ill, the money is not what it used to be as far as tips and $4.05 an hour for servers is almost abuse. Nobody can live off of that especially with no overtime. It was a good experience and I got many friends out of it but it affects your health and takes a toll on you after too long."
good,They gave lead hours to the wrong staff instead of the next in line. They dont allow room for raises. 11 is the max. The servers are given 2 days a week and the cooks are overworked and under paid. This company was Located in washington and is soon to be under new management who is very unorganized.
good,"I have worked at two Cracker Barrel locations, one in Bradenton, FL and the other in Flat Rock, NC. The company was poorly run by the direct superiors. I think Cracker Barrel has a lot of potential--but the employees are not compensated fairly. The wage is terrible. The hours are worse, but if you happen to find a worthwhile manager, I believe those issues could be rectified. My paycheck was listed with the incorrect wage my entire time at Flat Rock CB--and I was not aided at all by the home office/payroll department. "
good,"Cracker Barrel hires too many people, then doesn't give the people that have been working there hardly any hours. Management is very rude, and talks to employees however they want."
good,I would take customers orders for food and drinks. Put in the orders. Sometimes make salads.  Sometimes I would work in the back of the house making things for the cooks.  I learned that this job was not the job for me because I would work all kinds of hours.  Management was a poor excuse. Never knew what to do but get onto us about anything. There was no enjoyable part of the job.
good,They would work some employees around 6 hours without giving a single break. General Manager was horrible and disrespectful. She worked her employees to death and did not have respect for any of them. Other employees would slack and nothing be done about it
good,"I love Retail. Love designing the displays.Truck days were always fun sort of like Christmas every week. The bad part is that you can bust your bottom, but you will never make a living with this job."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"I liked my job at first until they started taking my kindness for my weakness. They were so used to me filling in hrs for other people that called out that they would get upset if i told them I couldn't cover a shift for those folks sometime. Then the next week the will dock my hours being spiteful for me not covering them the week before, yet to only have to call me to cover it wen they same people call out. Smh. I worked as cashier and if u work an 8 hr shift u almost have to cry for a lunch break and don't even mention a 15. I'm used to working long hrs being that I'm an experienced retail manger who sometime used to work 14 hr days but I atleast took 15 min to relax. The retail manager seemed a tad bit bias and racist to me Idk if she is still there. I emailed corporate about my concerns and they didn't even follow up. (Some open door policy huh) it's actually very nice employee's there as well but management sucks. They never want to take accountability for anything. Cracker barrel just has a bad source of leadership. But very friendly customers."
good,The management doesn't really do their job and majority of their job falls back on the employees in order to keep the restaurant running. I definitely would not recommend working there. The only good thing about the job is the coworkers and the bonds you form with them.
good,I experienced different things. I enjoyed the guests; learning them and enjoying conversations. It was hard work and fast paced and very long hours on some days.
good,"The typical day of work is dealing with people who want to be seated immediatly and will take you all over the restaurant because they can't find the PERFECT table for them. I learned that patience is a virtue and you have to keep on smiling even when people are yelling at you because you didn't know they were regulars. My co workers are fun, I absolutley love them, I would probably go crazy if I didn't have someone to talk to. The hardest part is when we go on an unexpected wait and your the only person there but you eventually pull through. The most enjoyable is when there isn't anyone coming in and you just stand there and talk about anything and run around the retail store and put on the halloween masks we have on display."
good,I greeted and also checked out customers ready to go. I would also make sure they've enjoyed the food and service as well.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of working hard and making sure everything was taken care of (getting orders correct, bringing food out in a timely manner, dealing with difficult people with a smile on my face). One of the things I learned (but do not use) is the exact opposite of what I needed to learn (don't trust anyone and only worry about yourself). I did however learn to keep my mouth shut when I disagree with something is going on that I do not agree with personally. There was an extreme instability of management. Some managers were good while others were not as good. My coworkers were mostly ""kids"" that did not care if they had a job or not. Some were really hard working, but that was few and far between. The hardest part of the job was being away from my family. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people."
good,If you would like to feed a family of 4. Then come on down to the barell.  it's the lighthouse for travlers. You have to be set up for success. Management is all not on the same page. The lack of team work.  The hardest part of my job. Is I will do almost everthing.
good,"typical day was pretty good and busy , co-workers were good, loved room service"
good,"I would have to wash dishes, put them up, break down buss tubs, I learned how to wash dishes, management was not all great and most didn't even care to do there jobs."
good,"My typical day at work would include washing dishes, preparing food, and some maintenance.  I learned how to wash dishes and do minor maintenance.  My co-workers did not work efficiently as a team with management exhibiting poor leadership skills.  The hardest part of my job working with people not focused on their job.  The best part of my job was participating in the service industry."
good,"The people that I worked with here would rather see you fail than to help you with questions or problems.  I did not enjoy my time (3 years)here.  If you had a problem with management or other workers there, you couldn't go to anyone.  The management here were hard to work for. Very demanding with little patience for anyone or anything."
good,"Go in clean area, start prepping food foe grill line, make salads, serve soups, salads, and deserts."
good,"As a new server you are doomed to have a few mishaps along the way. The guest were mostly rude and because it is advertised to an ""older"" generation, your tips were very scarce. The employees were hit and miss, but usually women and men in their mid 20's up to over 60+ in age and most were heavily involved in drama. I think the hardest part of my job was feeling uncomfortable with fellow employees whispering and laughing as you walked by to carry out a work task or when they would verbally consult you through what should have been a managers job to correct your errors. I found it highly distracting, rude, and unprofessional. The most enjoyable part of the job was waiting on your ""regulars"" and having someone always specifically ask for you to wait their table."
good,Cracker Barrel was an enjoyable place to work being a server.  Good position to be social with guests and other employees.  
good,"There certainly was not a typical day being a server at Cracker Barrel. Customers were different. Depending on the different shifts you worked the staff & Mangers were different, everything always varied. "
good,"While working here, They over work you. Always getting yelled at, company always hiring, never get more than a 5 min break, even on a double shift, only a 30 min break."
good,"Overwhelming, aggressive, chaotic environment. The guests are rewarded for bad behavior by getting free meals, so there are quite a few scammers. I've never experienced a restaurant where so many can just dine and dash, but there it is. They need to staff more people there."
good,Reason not enough worker for dishwasher for weekend. It is good for 4 worker at dishwasher also my goal 20 to 25 HR per week but they gave me less 10 HR per week.
good,"It is a nice company,  the par program gives lots of incenstive to proceed in the company. However,  there is a lot of miscommunication in the company and even though team work is promotes it is not always inacted."
good,"No quality of life, Every holiday, 55-60 hours. One weekend off a month but you pay for that with 7-9 days straight suppose to have a day in the middle to break that up. You will work positions instead of just helping to become a labor saver. Holidays are horrific. A lot of favoritism goes on between Gm and managers. HR is absolutely no help with conflict resolution. Not the ideal job,  more of a secretary instead of a manager"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Working there I have no issue working in a stressful environment that's all Papa Johns was, but whenever the managers themselves can't keep a professional tone with employees, and are very disorganized.... Yeah not a fun environment."
good,Very fast-paced needs more employees in the back of the house to prep another dishwasher to clean the plates in a timely manner. No room for promotion
good,I worked here for a little and they over hire hosts and servers. So they will cut everyone’s hours to working one or two days a week. The management is just poor and working here I not worth it
good,"The management was always horrible, also i was lied to by a manager about getting a pay raise, I would not recommend anyone to work there, it was very unorganized."
good,I lived about 20-30 minutes from this cracker barrel location and they would only give me 4 hour shifts. I was not the only employee who had this complaint. They expect a lot from you but do not give you enough hours.
good,I had a few good managers here but corporate kept trying to move them around to prevent a good working relationship. Most managers tried to create a positive environment.
good,"Greeted and assisted customers with questions pertaining to food and merchandise. Set up demonstrations, offered samples of products and special sales."
good,"At first it appeared to be a great job.  I quickly advanced through the par levels due to my work ethic and attention to detail.  Upon becoming ill and an eventual hospital stay, I was assured by management that my place within the company was safe. However, when I returned, I was demoted to a lower paying position, and my work hours were cut in half, forcing me to seek other employment."
good,"My hours varied. Greeting customers, clean restrooms, sweep the floors, put out stock, organize merchandise, give out sample snacks."
good,Currently working at Cracker Barrel my General Manager seems to be never around I have gone a month with out seeing general manager in some case's when I have an issue by the time I see general manager it's old news and saying something to assistant manager don't do much good since they have to go to the general manager to have my issue or problem solved this is very frustrating
good,"The hours and pay are ridiculous. I work two days and week with bills to pay, a dog to feed, and a baby on the way. I can’t live off of that. I am 18 and live with my parents still because I don’t work or get paid enough to live on my own."
good,"I had a lot of issues here, i did not get along with the coworkers and did not like the management. the dish room, bathroom, and break room were disgusting. The uniforms are strict and hard to keep up with and theres always someone constantly yelling or trying to take tips."
good,I will never work for them again. They do not care about the people who work there. I learned how not to speak to people while i worked there.enjoyable part was the guest.
good,"typical day at work "
good,Cracker Barrel is a fun work place to work for. The hostess job was tons of fun with lots of interaction with different people. The same thing to do but lots of new faces everyday.
good,"When things get stressful, most of managers and employees seem to create a negative atmosphere. Only a couple of managers seem to keep the positive atmosphere In a busy, stressful situation. Only a handful of servers know how to be a team player. "
good,"My experience with Cracker Barrel was a lot to be desired. Since I left, management has changed at least 8-10 times. It was lucrative especially on Sundays, but I feel that everyone needs to work in the restaurant industry to better their people skills."
good,"Fast paced environment, no time for breaks, poor management and low pay. Never got off during scheduled time off. The only good thing was a discount on your meals in store and on meals. The food is really good."
good,"Work with guests in a clean friendly atmosphere."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"45 minute ticket times at exactly 5 pm  Don't know what was happening but every day at 5 the cooks sank."
good,"I have worked at four different locations and they were all the same. If you are fine with highly stressful situations and don't mind being treated disrespectfully, then its not a bad job."
good,"The filth in the location I was in was over whelming. Complete disregard for food safety. "
good,"very bad management, always mess up on scheduling, forced to work over if someone else calls out forced to do someone else's job without the pay. forced to sell expired food"
good,The most negative work environment i have ever been apart of. The most skewed employee seniority placement in regards to number of tables and area of section. Will probably not even want to eat there anymore.
good,Marketed weekly items to customers to meet quotas. answered the customer service telephone. routinely cleaned different areas. counted money. set up register.
good,"I really dont have much to say concerning this employer not sure why i have to fill this out to apply for other jobs "
good,"Honestly, I used to love working here. Ever since new management took over, this place has been awful. I am so glad I left before it got even worse. The retail manager is power hungry and is awful. The schedules are never consistent. They always scheduled me out of my avalibility. It was hard to have a life outside of here, I never knew when I was going to work. You'll never get a break, even if you work 10 hours. Honestly there are better jobs out there, stay away!"
good,In a typical day you are waiting on guest constantly. You are always on your feet. Your job task constantly changes. You are asked at times to stay late even during the holidays.
good,"Management does what they want, including threatening thier employees. When reported to corporate, nothing was done.  Small sections for  servers, no smoke breaks."
good,Being a cashier was always pretty boring. The week days were so slow that you could sit there and draw while you waited for someone to check out. You were expected to up-sell to everyone. You had to constantly push product. If you leaned against any surface you are told to stand up straight. They do not work well with you when you request time off. Once you are given a day off that you requested they would cut my hours to the point I worked one or two days a week if I was lucky when I started with four. They basically punish you for requesting days off. They would not give you a set schedule. They hardly give breaks. You have to work for six hours and only get a fifteen minute break. You had to be there for eight if you wanted a half hour break.
good,"Not all they promised happens. They pick wrong people for skill trianers, work environment is not positive. Side work is a lot and some people don't bother to do anything.You run everyones food not just your own. You have to team greet Tables and are held accountable even if it isn't your section."
good,"Every shift all the managers would sit in a dining room and talk, they don't want anyone disturbing them. Also, they would sit in the office for 30 minutes on their phones, laughing, and eating."
good,"Managers are rude."
good,Retail manager is pretty cool. Restaurant to violent. Too much yelling and cursing. Customer can hear that. Too many managers on shift. Barely get any hours. They're always hiring because people are always quitting. No respect. Managers argue with each other. Not professional.
good,"Cracker Barrel old country store seems like a nice family-friendly place to those who dont work there, but behind those walls are some of the most childish, ignorant workers you will come across. the servers dont listen to the dishwashers. The dishwashers are the first to get blamed by the managers for anything that goes wrong in the back of the resteraunt. For some reason the managers never schedule more then 1-2 dishwashers a day even on they're busiest day, and theyll randomly tell the dishwashers that they want them to go bus, so theres only 1 dishwasher left working in the back."
good,Greet guest and seated them. Just take care of the people who come in. I have no idea about advancements or benefits as it was just a part time job till I could find a full time.
good,"Everyday was a typical day, because everyday seemed to be a busy day. As soon as you walked in the door, you were assigned you area to serve. The hardest part was at first learning to balance trays and remember each order or the specials for the day. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and keeping a smile on each guest face."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I believe Cracker Barrel as a whole is a good company.  I just need more.  It is time for me to move on and start a new career.
good,"Cracker barrel is a very high volume/high pace eating establishment.  People pleasing 300+ people at a time, working with 2 to 5 managers on the floor, and anywhere from 15 to 35 co-workers.  Not having the proper room to move or lack of caring for guest by co-workers theres not many parts of the job that are very strenuous or hard.  Most enjoyable is the food of course."
good,"I worked in the front at the cash stands, management was awful and only out for themselves. They would refuse to let you take breaks and then eat in front of you. They also piled on duties and then got mad if the line backed up."
good,Taking care of guests needs. Server responsibilities to make sure the shift runs smoothly and guests can be taken care of in a timely manner.
good,Just getting to meat people from all walks of life. You had to ask to go to the bathroom.
good,I have worked at cracker barrel for 5 years and it is sometimes a great place to work most of my co workers are great I however don't get to know most of the employees there because there are over 100
good,"Typical day at work was somteimes busy but often slow. The food is great, and the co-workers were fun to work with. Management was good, but sometimes they were hard to find when you needed them. My job was easy as a cashier, and the most enjoyable part of my job was talking to the winter texans about where they came from and how they liked our texas weather."
good,"Management is not consistent in enforcing policies. Favoritism is always evident. Pay scales are not equal among the same job titles. Seniority means nothing to the managers or home office. "
good,"When we have hard workers strong teams, players the workplace is very unified. Also, when management can come together on one accord everything runs smoothly."
good,"Guaranteed 40 hours and it was not provided "
good,"I've worked in several restaurants around and this one takes the cake for distaster. Management was poorly chosen, not only did they join the drama but instigated as well. Favoritism should be the slogan, they will work some people like dogs while others get everything they wanted. I'll never go back."
good,A lot of young people working as managers standing around talking playing around while work has to be done not enough structure pay rate is very low. The rules don't apply to everyone.
good,It was a very interesting place to work. There are opportunities for advancement. They give raises pretty fairly. Good discounts in the restaurant and store.
good,I can’t stand working with co workers who are obsessed with tips yet never want to help. I work at the Crittendon location and sadly there tenured employees aren’t the best employees there just mediocre riff raff who feel entitled. While the good employees usually leave out of frustration . Management usually never. addresses the “problem” employees
good,"Each eval brought up something that had not been addressed prior to, then I worked really hard to improve that area, only to have it not be mentioned in the next eval, but something else brought up. I was left thinking ""if this was a problem why didn't you mention it to me weeks ago instead of waiting til my eval?"" small things, like cleaning the front retail doors or communicating more frequently on the headsets. There was just such an undercurrent of ""it's never good enough... no matter what I do, how hard i work, it doesn't seem to matter"" not just from me but from the majority of co-workers as well.  Any promotion I received was from me fighting for it, going from my retail mgr to the etc, to the gm, back to my retail mgr...  just to receive the training for being a skill trainer, which I had already been attending the meetings (1 hr, min wage) for months! When I left my parting words to my GM was ""it just shouldn't be this hard... it's like driving into the wind, and I'm tired"". Sad, because I enjoyed the environment, the customers were wonderful (for the most part) lots of regulars, and on the positive side, there were co-workers between servers, hosts and retail, even prep and cooks, that knew each other and were very supportive, and friendly. It was hard to say goodbye, but I left feeling it was time thinking to myself, ""well... I gave it my best shot"" and with a little bit of a laugh, shaking my head, huge sigh of relief, drove away."
good,"Just what you would expect at any other breakfast restaurant, fast-paced and high-stress environment that pushes teamwork and guest satisfaction as the priority."
good,I have been with the company for a number of years. I have been a shiftleader and done everything except for manage and I was not compensated fairly for the amount of time and effort I put into the job.
good,Retail is a SALES position not just cashier.  There is no just cashier position.  Hourly wages need to be higher considering what surrounding companies pay.  The guests are awesome!  Mgmt needs more teamwork with their peers & employees. Can be very stressful due to lack of employees at this location.  Cross training is an option but not encouraged from retail to restaurant.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Great people to work with but a very stressful job. There are a lot extra things that are sprung on you. I had to learn how to log inventory, which is fine. It just was just out of the blue. It took me a little while to catch on because I did not have much training on that part."
good,As in many places the managers have favorites and your hours will be based off of who’s who and not actual work ethic. Current manager is hard to get along with and is at times too abrasive and harsh.
good,"Working at this Cracker Barrel for 8 years was a very difficult time for me. I was definitely overworked, underpaid and under appreciated. Management turnover was insane. We went through GMs annually at times, and we frequently had associate managers that were asked to fill in for GMs. Some of the GMs I worked for would treat servers like we were ""cheap labor"" making us stay long after our BUSY shifts in order to do ""extra cleaning work"" that did not fall within our scope of responsibilities in ADDITION to our normal side work, silverware, and table cleaning. For example, I was required to stay after one of my shifts in order to remove all of the boxes from the dry stock vestibule, thoroughly clean the entire vestibule and then reorganize and return all of the dry stock boxes, extra menus and materials. Not only did this take me 2.5 hours, I also only got paid $2/hr to do it and this was in addition to my normal work duties. I would have been more than willing to detail a soda machine or deep clean an ice bin considering I use those items to do my job, but organizing the dry stock definitely should have been a manager duty. Management also frequently expected servers to put on a hair net and get the grill cooks out of the weeds, or make our own salads and desserts but then would belittle us when our tables were not bussed or our floors were not swept in the middle of rushes."
good,Lack of management too many to management don't listen to the employees don't treat other employees fairly no teamwork how to right supplies do your job with
good,In a sudden of a mention don't carry on with any employees on or off the job because if you invite any one into your employment space you are subject to be led of the premiss with a final notice by special beep to as to alert managers to you let yourself back on the permisses without approvial that could cause you to be file charges on.
good,I had finished work one day and I got called into the management office and one of the managers asked me how I thought the day went amd I was honest with him and he told me that he got complaints but wouldn't tell me what they were. I had even politely asked him what were they so I would know what to do next time so I knew what to fix and he literally told me to not worry about it
good,"The store was understaffed, and most of the problems started there. There were no bussers, so the servers were expected to clean their own tables. However, they didn't, and management often turned to the host(s) to clean tables. "
good,"Cracker Barrel has some of the best employees in Lima. It is a fast pace working environment but the downfall is the big manager , he is rude and really does no show any empathy or concern for anyone but himself."
good,"The years I have spent at CBOCS are overwhelming in the absolutely horrendous uneducated, communication lacking, poor spirited management. A typical day at work would be walking in the door to immediately  begin completing your tasks, along with numerous other tasks in the building."
good,"I’ve worked at Cracker Barrel for over a year. I started as a hostess and then moved to serving and to-go server. The kitchen makes too many problems and takes too long to cook the food, negatively effecting the guest experience and causing bad tipping. People come to Cracker Barrel and do not tip. People get fired constantly. The managers create a lot of problems and are just ready to give frustrated customers a free meal - causing loss of tips. The weekends are not prepared for and that causes problems on days when servers could make a lot of tips. They keep minors on the clock for illegal hours. NOT a safe environment for a minor, as they will receive illegal treatment. The shifts are too short to be worth it & you will spend hours rolling silverware and doing side work. Working 6 days a week, at 3-hr shifts (normal scheduling) you may make $300 if you’re lucky."
good,"There are multiple severs allowed to cuss employees and managers out every day. General manager is petty and she doesn't care about anything but numbers. You have to go over her head for a raise. Other managers are trying their best, but the environment is awful. 50+ minute tickets, warm salad cooler, disgusting dish room set up, over worked, and under paid staff are going nuts."
good,I love working at Cracker Barrel but it does not give me enough hours to make a living for myself I was promised a certain wage and when I got my check it was $0.50 Less on the hour I asked them several times to correct it and they said they would anyone give me back paid but it never happened. Now there are those that are being hired making $0.75 on the hour to a dollar on the hour more than the ones that have been there for years
good,"Small pay, small sections to servers. Over schedule servers. Do not work with your life schedule. Benefits only to some. Some managers are okay, some will hate you no matter what. Some days are nice but overall, you can do much better"
good,"Cracker Barrel at Linthicum Heights, Maryland has the worst management and poor treatmeant towards servers. You can make alot of money workinghere if thats all you care about."
good,"This company requires many hours of additional work that should be done by minimum wage or hourly employee pay and not force servers that are making tipped wage do.  It is not a healthy,sanitary nor safe environment to force work in."
good,"It was no good. I left on maternity without pay tried to come back only the management completely changed, which it did every other week.Nope.no freebies, not even the biscuts. U get a small discount to shop in their overpriced store, and eat their so called home cooking, they rate u by stars over a computer test that u cant take without certian time in between so it appears like ur a terrible waitress for a while. They have a terrible policy about thiefs who walkout, they dont do anything , not to them, not even alloawed to bring it up or refuse derive to repeat offenders however u have choice to happily serve them and u get written up every time and three strikes ur out! Also you are not allowed to bring ur own tables food out, they insist everyone runs everyone else's food/drinks so usually the order is missing everything the guests expected you to bring, and feel ignored by you."
good,"I had a wonderful district manager, and he ended up quitting due to reasons I don't know. They I was attacked my retail manager for false accusations. Okay, job not the best. Little to none teamwork. I did contact human resources and they were very understanding of the situation. They helped me out but I left anyway."
good,I liked working here but if your not a server your really not bring home anything if you work in retail. My manger told me that part there was on 10-15 hours and it was ok because I wasn't paying bills like that but it's not worth it if you have insurance and they don't want to give your hours to work.
good,Basically they have there favorites and if your not one of them you get stuck with two table sections. The servers on days run the show. At night management is too busy flirting with kids to do there job. Too lazy to cut the floor cause they are afraid they may have to do something. They never give breaks either!!!
good,OK for a first time job. Management is not that great.Loved my customers. Loved what I did. Other then the pay and management its a great place to work !
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Working in cracker barrel first starts out as place to be but don’t get to comfortable as they will start taking advantage of you and terminate you. Well of course that is store #499. I love cracker barrel brand promise they push for great customer service and pleasing people first but they will never truly show that they would fake it and not show their true colors. It was disappointing that they let me go. But at the same time i was happy.
good,They don't have any advancement jobs available. I enjoyed meeting people. Travelers and home town people. They are very strict and the moral though is non exsistant.
good,I did both job rolls to barely make enough money to pay my bills. The manager was every rude and disrespectful and had picked favorites they down talk an made me feel as though I was less as a person
good,At first i didn't mind my job at cracker barrel although i woke up at 330am and had to be there by 5am. New management took over and it went down hill
good,"As with most restaurants, this was just as stressful, unfair, and a ridiculous rumor mill. I have no desire to be around or a part of dramatic atmospheres like this and management was EXTREMELY inconsistent from one to the next."
good,"I met lots of people. It usually got busy around 11am, especially on the weekends. I walked a lo, about 3-4 miles per shift. I wish hosts were tipped too because we worked just as much as the servers."
good,Its a stressful place to work cause the lack of management even with 5 of them there including the GM. Unless your a brown noser then maybe different.
good,"It isn't the worst, but there are ways it could be improved. The managers are not the best at communicating with each other and there is lots of confusion between them, as well as them not taking too much into account of things you have to do if you need a day off."
good,I loved my job but the manager was very vindictive and demanding i worked for a month straight and asked for two days and they freaked out. I loved talking to guest and seating them.
good,"This was my first experience working in a restaurant and I did not enjoy it; most of the customers tipped poorly and there were timesd where I didn't even make minimum wage. The managers were difficult to work with. I had money stolen out of my wallet from a coworker, after which my manager blamed me for not having it kept in a safer place. Very stressful environment. Definitely recommend serving somewhere else if you're able."
good,"would not recommend anyone to work here, people constantly leave because of low pay and poor managing that goes on in both stores, I would not want anyone to expect this to be a positive experience."
good,they played the favorites game here. lots of hard work went unnoticed by many. Managers acted better than regular crew.. they had no concern for your family life or health. the managers acted like corrections officers and the staff treated like criminals.
good,"Not everyone gets treated fairly, they procrastinate on everything. Can be some selfish peapple at Times. Sometimes I think they don’t know what there doing."
good,this was a temporary job to make money until i got something i liked more it did however teach me to move quickly and how to keep myself organized. very busy place
good,Crackle barrel on cares about making money. I wasted  to much time there. They don't care about your feelings or family and if someone worked there along time they are your boss.Crackle barrel is so busy and you work so hard for hardly no money.
good,Each manager at Cracker Barrel Old Country Store had their favorite employees which made getting a fair amount of hours difficult. Some managers were just completely rude.
good,We are a very busy store many people don't show up for work or walk out due to the stress. Seen alot of favoritism during holidays. Some people get all the tips when all have a part management takes tips and others do the work but nothing during all the work treats un fairly
good,Don't work at Cracker Barrel if you can help it. Cracker Barrel is disorganized. The best thing about working here is the other people that I was able to work with.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,This job is alright as a part time gig. I was a dishwasher and I would come home soaked every night but besides that I didnt really much comlain about the job.
good,You work over 50 hours a week and real stressful job. The job is unpredictable. Also you never get off on your schedule time maybe 30 minutes afterwards.
good,"I loved the customers, they honestly were so sweet. Plus the hours were so messed up there, like one week I'd have 30 hours then the next I'll have 16. Also I wanted to find a better oppertunity at another job because dunkin just wasn't  doing it for me."
good,A seemingly great company... but be prepared for very few scheduled hours. Unpredictable and hard to maintain salary. Current employees beg for more hours and are hard workers while management is still hiring new servers...Management yells and is generally unapproachable. Not worth the trouble.
good,"As my first job, it was okay. Wasn't exactly paid enough to do half the thing asked of me (including letting people yell profanities at my face while smiling and letting it happen) but it's an okay job for starting out."
good,"Ringing up guests, management was okay, didn't really talk to me. The servers and host were friendly. clean place to work. hardest part of the job was standing for 9 hours but at time i was 8 months pregant."
good,The leadership here is that there is way to many fighting for someone elses job but that was when I was there as far as the management went but as cook or server I w was fine as far as my job went and made my money and went home
good,"A typical day at work would consist of arriving on time, preparing myself to serve tables. Talk to my manager about the game plan for the day. After getting the information from my manager, I would start my serving routine. That consisted of making sure the other servers were ok and that my tables were being taken care of. At the end of each shift, we were required to roll a certain amount of silverware, clean our sections that we served at, and do a certain side work."
good,The cashier and retail manager had some serious personality and emotional issues - took it out on the employees and store mgmt. and corporate protected.
good,they need to get better mangment. they need to work on the shifts and theyer hours on when people come in. They management trys to get the staff to walk out. the coworks are rub to everyone. working with people having a smile on there face when they leave.
good,"I worked here during my sophomore summer of college and my junior year of college. The atmosphere was welcoming, but the scheduled hours were not what I needed in order to have a little income as a struggling college student. Most of the managers were flexible with availability. Best part of this job was getting to move around when business was slow. Standing on your feet for a lengthy period of time without moving definitely makes you feel stiff."
good,There were many opportunities for feedback and review as well as advancement within the company.  Leadership and training education was available and very knowledgeable.
good,"I have worked at CB for almost 6 years and I am a par 4. My job title is a server which requires me to turn tables, deliver food in a timely manner, being friendly to guest and co-workers and making some money."
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel actually was quite pleasant, they treat their employees with respect and honor their wishes. I was very good at waiting tables and made pretty decent tips at the end of the night. Serving is basically common knowledge and it came to me naturally.  However, there are some down sides to being a server as well, first is the fact that you only get paid $2.13 an hour plus tips does not guarantee a set monthly income. Also, with any customer service  field you had to deal with difficult customers, who would almost ruin your night. I did learn how to do some things quicker and more effectively while working there. The hardest part of the job is memorizing the menu to know which items go with which meals, however once you get that down packed it too is also second nature."
good,Although there is much advancement for someone who would like to become a manager. For me there is no advancement as I can only work part time. Hours are cut drastically at any given time and I feel as if the company only wants to make their daily quota.
good,Sat customer with their silverware and menus. There was lots of drama and chaos throughout the day. It was almost impossible to get full time.
good,I hated wearing the uniforms and leaving work smelling like a fire. I liked their discounts and advancement program. Some customers were poor tippers no matter how good of a job you did.
good,The managment is horrible. They only care about themselfs. They dont care is your sick or not ok if you call out you have to have a note or they hold it against you. They never let you work more then 4 hour shifts a day unless its sunday rush. I would never recomend people to work here. The only reason im here is because the other hosts and some servers
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"A typical day at work for me was to grab a bus tub and start doing my job as soon as I got there. A few things I learned there were small things like the temperature of water for dishes to be cleaned and time for things to wash. The management could improve a lot. Poor communication skills, poorly organized company. The co-workers were the best people I have ever worked with. Hardest part of my job was doing what I was told because one manager would tell me this and another manager would tell me something else. The most enjoyable part of this job was talking to the cooks and having fun with them!"
good,fast paced working conditions. Loved my patrons and the food was good also. Lots of turn over so constantly working with new  inexperienced people. Management stressed out .
good,"Great work environment,learned alot about double tasking. Management was great,co-workers were fun,theres always one!! I loved the challenge for time and perfection. I cant say anything bad about this company."
good,"My particular store was an extremely busy one. It was nice at first, but then the managers changed (a constant happening) and the new one made our lives horrible. He changed policies and the way we work, making our jobs difficult. The health insurance was unbelievably   good, albeit a little pricey. They have a ranking system you work with, moving up through prescribed time periods and tests, but if the managers don't like you, you won't get an eval that passes to get you to that next level, and your work life suffers till you leave. For most people,I guess I'll say the hardest part is learning the menu. The nicest is the discount and the health insurance."
good,"A typical day on a weekday is slow and the day goes by faster."
good,I enjoyed helping people. But management was not considerate of their employees. I felt like they didn't care about nothing but keep their jobs.
good,"Requires for position as a hostess or server is to have a very flexible schedule. If you needed a day off for work, school, or personal day, management will take hours away from your weekly schedule."
good,"Cracker barrel is a decent company to work for just not a lot of hours, where in my case i need a full time job 35 to 40 hours weekly preferably weekends off. I would like to be paid at least around 9 dollars hourly at cracker barrel you start off at 7.25 hourly you should receive more pay at least 8 dollars hourly. I would like to find a full time job that pays decently where my skills can be used to help people, and also make decent money in the process."
good,I do not enjoy working for crackerbarrel because if you not friends with your supervisors you are treated unfair
good,"Waited and wasted my shift time for the managers to put me on the floor plan, deal with grouchy cooks who get away with attitudes on a paycheck compared to my job working for tips, managers usually tell you off if you're having a problem without explanations, co-workers faked being friendly to get information about others just to gossip and cause animosity in the workplace, the hardest part of the job was when I would have problems with anything management would point you towards someone else to help who didn't even help even after pointing that out to management, the most enjoyable part of the job was the nice and kind people I got to server who made my days better when they were the darkest"
good,A typical day at working is greeting everyone with a smile and getting thing ready for me to start working in my section.I learned to make sure food and the guest is ok and enjoying they visit. Some management care and co-worker to and likes to help when your in need.The hardest part of the job is leaving because i enjoy what i was doing. The enjoyable time when i can put a smile on my guest face and co- worker too.
good,"A typical day at work would greeting/seating guests, doing menu counts, keeping tables cleaned. I have learned that sometimes it is a bit stressful working in a restaurants trying to keep a fare rotation so each servers gets the same amount of guests but also keeping guests happy. Several of my co-workers are great, easy to work with it. Hardest part of the job is trying to seat big parties and stay on rotation at the same time or being by you're self seating all these people. Most enjoyable part is meeting all these different people from places such as England, France, Russia, Canada, and etc."
good,"Management didnt too much care about workers as a person but more like ""bodies"" to work."
good,"Cracker Barrel is one of the top paying chains. But that also comes with a price. You are ""owned"" by them. You are required to attend meetings on your off days, or attend meetings after your 10 hour shift. Also you must use your personal vehicle to make bank runs and deliveries of rockers or pick up merchandise with no fuel reimbursement, sometimes having to travel 50 or more miles one way. No matter what good you do during the week, you are judged on ""Goal Hours"", the two highest sales volume back to back hours typically Sundays 11am-2pm. If you do not make them you are belittled by upper management. Benefits are mediocre, not top notch insurance, and it is a little pricey. Managers do receive a 35% on off time meals (family included, up to 8 members, self included) and retail merchandise."
good,"It's a great place to eat, sometimes, but I most definitely would not recommend working there. If you have a problem you're supposed to be able to go to management, but even when you go to management they do nothing about the problem that you come to them with."
good,"This job just wasn’t meant for me. I wasn’t getting enough hours or making enough money, but the overall work wasn’t hard. It would just become overwhelming to me when you have to maintain multiple tables at once."
good,"Over work a person sometimes, tho my managers were pretty cool and the people I worked with overall good work experience. The party isn't right for the work performed."
good,"I worked there for over a year. It was pleasant for the first 6 months, after that the management went to garbage. Being verbally attacked by management for dumb things. I had to leave to protect my own mental stability."
good,"The restaurant is constantly short staffed and stressful. The staff is not happy on a regular basis, and they show little to no respect for the management."
good,Cracker Barrel is a high stress environment everyday. Everyday felt like an extremely draining and demeaning experience. Management was a very interesting array of people. However I can only speak for my time at this establishment I do not believe much change has occurred.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Management don't take care of the dish people enough to be able to do what is expected. When I was clocking in to start work I was already backed up to the point that I felt overwhelmed and stressed while the closing manager was expecting to leave at a time that I could not get to
good,"The manager of the store will destroy your will to live. "
good,"My biggest issue with working at Cracker Barrel was that I wanted to make advancements and work hard to get ahead but even after talking with the manager on multiple occasions and him making promises to me, nothing happened and I continued to stay where I was."
good,"Good place if you are just looking for extra spending money and have another source of income."
good,Inconsistent schedule and working more than my set hours was often and issue for me during school. I didn't love how management in store and from the district office would speak to their employees.
good,"Not much room for advancement, poor management, pay is less than stellar. Good side job or for students just entering the workforce. The employees were friendly and helpful."
good,This company can be difficult to work for. The expectation is high for little money. Keeping the place staffed is impossible when you are incapable of holding people accountable for their actions.
good,Mangers are absolutely horrible. If you intend on working here do not become a server. It is competitive and if you do make sure it is temporary. Becoming a server will not pay the bills and will not allow you to grow.
good,"You will never enter a restaurant job and feel like you belong. It is stressful and high tension. Management will always be on your butt over something, and you can never really advance or get the hours you need."
good,"Management was my issue here. I was fired for something I didn't do, and it was later proved that it wasn't me. Most of the co-workers here are amazing people. Getting to meet new people everyday was my favorite part of the entire job. I do think pay should start out higher."
good,"I enjoyed working there but the thing was that they shorted my hour and only had me working on the busiest days, so I’m working hard for less than end meet."
good,Cracker Barrel is not the easiest company to work for. They hire strongly from outside only. They don't really move up from the inside. There is always a demand for hours and positions so making your money is never a bad thing. But cross training doesn't happen much unless employee turnover is high. So once you're stuck in a position there isn't much room to move or learn anything else even if you want to broaden your horizons and see about making yourself more valuable to the company and team.
good,"Lots of hard work and fast movement for jobs assignments, everyone moves fast and expects you to move faster, no break for the rookies. Wouldn’t recommend working there as a first job but maybe second or third"
good,The managers there treat their employees like they don’t matter. The managers don’t like to cooperate with school events and family matters. I definitely would never suggest working at Cracker Barrel to anyone.
good,"As a Hostess, I stocked menus and silverware, seated customers, cleaned the restrooms, swept and did anything else I could to make sure the guests enjoyed their visit.  I really liked  interacting with the customers and the experience I gained working here. One complaint I had is that they delayed giving anyone employee reviews for advancement."
good,In a stressful work environment I made my interactions with customers enjoyable. I was top sales person for 7 months straight. I also enjoyed the company and working with my fellow teammates.
good,"Cracker Barrel is not a good place to work. High stress level. Does not have a team work environment. Expected to be alone in gift shop and do the job of 4 people.NO BREAKS, you have to dash to restroom and get back to sales floor and hope no one needs assistantace while you are gone, Under staffed so corporate doesn't have to hire the proper amount of people, There should be a least 2 people in and on sales floor every shift."
good,"Love the customers , I work all of the time I am never late I do not calll out I also have a 9 month old son, sometimes the managers don’t understand and don’t get me wrong it’s a wonderful place to work but in my opinion management suck . I work my tail off and barley get recognized in any way ."
good,Life balance cannot exist. 60 hour work weeks.scheduling issues. Advantage to grow is very long.training is in Tennessee for a month then you work at a training store until you finish your training
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Can be laidback and easygoing during downtime but when it gets busy it gets really stressful. If your easygoing but not very talkative I wouldnt recommend this place, people there can be a little harsh and portray you as weak and other toxic stuff like that. Other than that it was ok. Most people dont stay too long. Its just so stressful I would get chest pains and stuff. had a panic attack after I left. The gm has unrealistic expectations for performance so watch out for that. The other managers will let you know. If you can develop a good relationship with the gm then you might be ok but prepare to work your butt off."
good,Complicated and fast paced environment. No time for breaks. Poor management. You get stuck doing everything by yourself even when it's really busy. Low pay
good,"Overall, the job is good and the co-workers are amazing. However, the hours are pretty limited. Sometimes you can work over 30 hours a week and others you get 4."
good,"Cracker Barrel was a good place to work for the summer but as most restaurants do, business slows during cold seasons like fall and winter, holidays are an exception. Not enough money to get by alone or sustain a living."
good,"The management was horrible in multiple locations, typically they were not willing to work with you on your schedule it was all or nothing for them no matter what the situation was. Doctors notes meant nothing and there are many things that go on behind the scenes that management get away with."
good,"In the summer they will just about give you all the hours you want. When winter comes, I understand that you have to cut hours here and there, but keep in mind I have been there almost two years and I normally get my full 40 in the summertime if not more. I was clocking out with around 25 hours in the winter and they are not flexible at all. I know you're not expected to get out on time every single day, but they keep you 1-3 hours over every day which makes it hard to schedule doctor appointments, etc. Would not recommend working here at all. There are a few managers that will help, but most either have an attitude or are lazy."
good,"The manager was very moody and not very nice to the employees.   The retail manager has a great personality toward everyone and treats them fair.  "
good,The job at Cracker Barrel was extremely fast paced. The requirements for each individual employee was to high. A standard retail employee had to increase sales of each individual patron by roughly $20 this is after they already ate a meal.
good,Can't lie and say it was a good place to work when the store manager dislikes you for the hard work that you do and barely gives any recognition. Only reason I stayed working was cause I loved my family at the CB and it was the only income I was working for.
good,"Started with 35 hours a week and now they have everyone working 3-15 hours a week. It's a joke. They tell you they are figuring out the schedule but cut everyone's hours and are still hiring! The managers play favorites and if they dont like you, you do not work or they send you home.  The hours worked do not pay for daycare. More or less I have to pay to go to work. It sucks."
good,Never got help. Would be expected to do everything and then got my hours cut when the other back up cook lost their 2nd job and they weren't willing to train and give me hours in another position.
good,"At my store company policies are not enforced, the server schedule is rarely correct and no  one seems to know what customer service is. I want to always provide excellent service."
good,"The job is fairly easy and you can make pretty good money, but trying to advance/cross train is difficult and certain managers are inappropriate/unprofessional. I don't feel very welcome on some days and i'm held higher in expectations than some, so I am shamed when I call out sick or do less than perfect rather than some people are not shamed when they no call/no show. The hardest part of the job is sometimes you do not get out until 12 am, or you're not cut off the floor at the time that was designated. The easiest is rolling silverware if you are proficient at it."
good,The GM at the store I was at was absolutely mean and awful. Everyone felt that way. He was very unfair when it came to scheduling and things of that manner. Also very understaffed and extremely fast-paced.
good,"It is either going to be dead with only a couple people in the restaraunt, or there is going to be a 20 minute wait, there is rarely ever an in between and managers do a poor job scheduling people, and are way too lax when employees don't show up. If I ever called out at the last minute because I got sick or for family reasons they'd chew me out and make me come in if I couldn't get someone to cover, but if any of the waiters called out without getting someone to cover their shift it's all fine and dandy. Thursday nights are typically pretty busy, too busy for one host, yet they refuse to schedule anyone else. Oh and lunch breaks, or any breaks for that matter are a rarity, I've worked here for over a year with plenty of 7+ hour shifts without ever being given a break and this is true of most of the employees except a select few who can seemingly take a break whenever they feel like so they can go smoke pot. If managers would start firing people who continuously show up late or not at all it would be a much better place to work for, I've only shown up late maybe twice since I started and I am treated the same as people who repeatedly show up late or just don't show up at all. Oh and they will not give people overtime, even if its just an hour, I called in sick one day with the flu but the only person who could cover my shift would have went into overtime and they weren't letting that happen so I had to come to work WITH THE FLU JUST SO THEY COULD SAVE $3!! But thats really the problem, they can't seem to decide if profits or customer satisfaction comes first."
good,"I hated everything about this job. For instance; low pay, few scheduled hours, stressful environment, fast-paced, little to no support from management."
good,"Good place to work for first job, not much advancement, very face paced when busy, independent mostly, management was moderate, loved satisfaction of giving customers great service, memorizing what every food we have and what we can change on the platters. Friendly co-workers, learned time-management, cleanliness of restaurant, know how to handle certain situations with customers."
good,"The Gulfport Cracker Barrel is poorly managed. However, business is good; in a fast paced restaurant it’s easy to rotate your tables and make more money."
good,If you need a job right  away this is the place to go but I would advise to have a second job & not to get stuck... If you work there long enough you will definitely get the hours but servers are definitely unappreciated.
good,It's a good job if you're starting out but it needs a lot of work. Hourly pay sometimes isn't enough for what you're expected to do but the coworkers made it enjoyable.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,One of the mangment team opened my check and was talking to other employees about the amount of money I made and they general manger kept saying I was racist because I was from they south and continued to press this until I had to ask her what she thought she was doing because I felt she was racist against me because I was from GA.
good,"Many people say that Cracker Barrel would be a good first job, but the majority of the people that say that have not worked there before. People are constantly getting upset with you for stupid reasons and many of the mangers are rude. There is also always some sort of drama there. Working at Cracker Barrel taught me that you have to always be kind and rise above any of the negativity around you and to ignore other peoples opinions on you. The hardest part of my job is standing in one position the entire time you are there and only moving around to take people to their seats. I wouldn't say that there are any enjoyable parts to my job other than clocking out to go home."
good,"It can be a good job and you can make good money, but it’s very hard to move up and make more money as a hostess, and I had a horrible experience with overall management."
good,"If there are no customers walking thru the door servers are not making money and neither is the company. There are always slow times and busy times. Sometimes there are too many servers working therefore you feel you fighting for your money. Then there are times its just the opposite.  At one time a manger was there she was very hard to work for. She had favorites and talked down to people. This was not a great time to be there. After some time she was gone. Management changed alot while I was there. Its likly there were 15-20 different mangers in the time i was there. Cracker Barrel is a very hard company to work for for some people. The customers were by far the best part of the job there, making them happy!!!"
good,I only got to work two days in a week even though I was hired as full-time. I was in school but i could work everyday after school. They would even send me home like an hour after I got there.
good,This is a very stressful and fast paced work enviroment that is not for all people. It is not uncommon to be kept after your scheduled out time. Not much room for Advancement.
good,This Cracker Barrel was very picky about appearance. If you looked the part you would make more. I did not enjoy this job nor would I wish to go back. I did enjoy being a server.
good,The company itself is good to work for my only complaints were with the store management staff I worked for. The store manager creates a hostile work environment that I could not handle. I would suggest staying away from the Milford store. Try for any of the others.
good,"tough job, but it paid bills through college. Long hours, poor employee retention rates for obvious, yet not nefarious reasons. Work pride low, little room for career advancement."
good,"A lot of open ended promises to keep you around, but frustration sets in and it never looks like there is an end in sight. I traveled around for this company and that was suppose to help me advance but again an open ended promise"
good,"its a good environment, probably because of the customers, management is poor. hours were awful and not consistent. not a hard job, easy to excel in and really helped build customer service skills."
good,"This is a training store so people are constantly coming in and out of training and transitioning to other stores. The store is very busy and can be guaranteed that there will be a wait and a full dining room. The co-workers are an absolute delight however management is beyond poor. There is no holiday pay and they will work you like dogs. The don't hold everyone to the same standards and expect you to go above and beyond for everyone but will not reciprocate the favor. Not a bad company, just a bad store."
good,It was stressful didn't care if you were off they will call you in to work or have your stay longer due to poor organization and planning. Management doesn't really help as much
good,"Not the worst place I've ever worked, not the best either. When we got good people they don't stay long and the not so good employees seem to stay and get the hours they want."
good,Work hours suck because they hire new people all the time and the servers are rude. The scenery is beautiful but would not recommend working there. The managers do not seem to care about anything.
good,Expect to run around like a chicken with your head cut off. The moment things start to get stressful everyone gets panicked and rushes around making it very difficult to do things properly. Or at all.
good,"This company portrays themselves to be a customer friendly, family friendly, workplace, but in truth, are greedy, uncaring and racially biased. When I began training for them, I was elated by the thought of working for a company that believed in customer service, but after two years of working for them, I saw them for what they are."
good,I think this store needs a lot of help especially the kitchen long tickets times they don't be caring there's know sense of direction presentation of food is bad at time cooks are argumentive.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"its tedious and exhausting work"
good,"I worked for Cracker Barrel in two different cities but the typical day was the same. I was a cashier and at both places, we were required to suggest items and show an interest in the ""guest's"" meal ticket. ""I see you had the pancakes for breakfast this morning. Did you know we have the same exact mix for sale in the store? All you have to do is mix with water. We ever sell the same syrup!"" Seriously? This is what we were supposed to do all while blowing the line out so we could get as many people through the line as possible. Management sucked at both locations. Mostly incompetent and unwilling to help unless it deals directly with the food (again with being a cashier, you were forgotten about often). It was like the biggest deal in the world to get a manager to come up and help you or get you change, etc. I learned a lot in the two years I was with the company but I wouldn't go back. The old people a lot of times were really hateful."
good,"bad management in the retail "
good,I can be a good palce to work   but there is a lot of stress and people will yell at each other there is a lot of tenson   managers don't always treat everyone equal
good,"A typical day was spent washing dishes."
good,"While at Cracker Barrel, I enjoyed working there. I loved my coworkers, I enjoyed the atmosphere of the job. The only thing I didn't like was the management."
good,I started working for Cracker Barrel its was exciting to work for a company with family value. As always guest come first before anything. I think server are taking advantage of. Management expect you to be everything at once like most of people who help get push to max while others get away. Sometime they will understaff and it's hectic . The typical day is about  6 to 7 hour shift but you have to do side work and silverware sometime three silverware bin depend on how busy. management will make you  do more than expected.  Cracker Barrel like any other job it's quick money and some manager good and some are bad
good,"There is no typical day at CB.  Some days are busy and you can make money, other days are slow and leave us wondering.  I have learned great customer service skills at CB.  Our motto is Pleasing People and CB means it. One of the main things I do not like about CB is we do not have mandatory tipping on parties of 6 or more.  A party of 20 came in the other day and ran my coworkers crazy and only tipped them $12.00 to split among themselves. The greatest part about my job is when I have a guest that ask to sit with me every time they come in."
good,"This job as dishwasher is alright, can be fun and not. Sometime not busy and sometime very busy and it can be stress. It required team work and"
good,"Most work days are chaotic, so teamwork is necessary to give each guest a great experience. Cracker Barrel's guiding principle is pleasing people, so guest attentiveness among the entire staff is required at all times."
good,"Enjoy contributing individually, as a leader and part of a team in building the business within this restaurant daily."
good,"You will love working here if you love getting yelled at by all employees. The servers, managers, and cooks are all rude and if one person is mad at you the whole place is mad at you."
good,The company has all be stepped away from its culture and the managers are very unprofessional and unqualified to handle the stress that comes with managing a large corporation.
good,"I enjoy my job there, the people I work with are very fun and I have formed many friendships there.  The management needs some improvement, they need to be team players and not work against each other and the staff.  I have learned that not all people have the business in there best interest, just themselves."
good,"I enjoy crackerbarrel as a whole, but the specific location I worked for I did not enjoy. The pay was terrible (2.13/hour) and the management was biased. The easiest part of the job was interacting with customers, but dealing with management and fellow employees was frustrating."
good,There are too many favorite employees that cause others to get overlooked. The work environment is very selfish with each employee only looking out for themselves.
good,"I would prepare orders in a timely manner,measuring and following a recipe,Cooking several items at once time,Cleaning to company standards."
good,"I worked two jobs to give me any extras I wish to have in life. I found that after a year of working both jobs that the politics behind it all was not worth the work I put into it. I was a top 4 star waitress and did a great job waiting tables. I made sure the service that I provided to my customers was the same that I wanted as a customer. Over time new coworkers would take sections that they couldn't handle and would leave the experienced to help the new ones out without the pay. After speaking with management about this, and coming up with a plan that could actually benefit the company itself it continued to be an issue."
good,"I enjoyed the good food that was served on a daily basis, and socializing with my co workers, but the management team were very unprofessional, and polices have been violated."
good,No hours and barely get paid enough to cover gas. Management is decent enough they like to see their employees do well. The store I worked had a HIGH turn over rate.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"A typical work day at The Cracker Barrel consisted of serving guests beverages and food, making sure their needs are met, and making their visit enjoyable and pleasant. The management was constantly in transition, as the company had great difficulty hiring and retaining a general manager. The methods of operations were sometimes changed to fit the situations. Co-workers were on the most part hard working, helpful, and friendly. The hardest part of the job was the frustration of not having the appropriate tools and materials to work with. Ticket times often suffered due to human error. The best part of working at CBOCS was meeting the guests and getting to know the regulars and acknowledging and meeting their needs."
good,"The tips were okay, but stressing about people coming in night after night and relying on them for your pay for the day isn't worth it."
good,"At my time of employment the management was not that great. The co-workers were nice and helpful to other employees. The job itself was not difficult, but I was not happy with my hours. They do offer advancement and allow you to learn new skills."
good,great job but the pay isn't the best as a server. the food is great. very friendly environment. I cant live off the pay. hardest part about the job is learning the menu and table settings. very strict uniform policy and the real benefits don't kick in until you've been there a certain amount of time.
good,"Cracker Barrel was an enjoyable place to work. Fun, social environment. I have heightened my communtication skills at this job. Co workers were great. Management needs a little work. There was a lack of hours due to over hirement or poor scheduling."
good,"Lots of work, and it gets very repetitive.  You meet some great people and the staff is usually great too.  Management is really trying."
good,"I waited on tables, helped customer with order decisions. I took orders over phone. Many cleaning tasks, order entry, etc."
good,"fast paced work environment, you have to have a pleasing people attitude, management is decent, new employees need more training before being on their own, the stress of rush hour when food wasn't coming out fast enough for the guest/customers."
good,It was very fast paced but I didn't feel appreciated there. Never got breaks even if you wanted a drink you had ti=o ask permission or wait until we weren't busy.
good,I worked in the store part and it usually was just you running around trying to talk to each and every customer which could be 20 people at once.  Long days management wasnt great.
good,"If you don't have good cooks, good luck. You can only bring people so many drinks and bread while waiting before they walk out because the food takes so long."
good,"Loved the people I worked with and most of the customer, but hated the retail job, because being on your feet 6-8 hours a day, with minimal breaks was really hard, especially considering the pay."
good,not a lot of positive feedback employees. Would take a long and indefinite period to be promoted and management positions almost seemed unobtainable from cashier or server position.
good,"I worked here for many years, management thinks they know everything and do not want advice from employees, even thought we deal with customers more than them.but good service"
good,"Hard work and stressful. A good attitude goes a long way with this job. It can make or break your earning potential as a server. Not much room for thinking ""out the box"". Pretty much do as your told."
good,Most places require you to know what you are doing and do it well. This place rushed to open the doors and never covered the basics with most of the grill line. They berated the people on the line instead of showing them the correct way of doing things. Has the promise of being a great place to work but until they change the way they train I do not see that. Worked at another Cracker Barrel location and loved the time there.
good,"This is not usually a job I would seek. Management seemed to come and go, however we had an awesome GM. I did meet a lot of very nice people both co-workers and guests. The hardest part was being on my feet between 5 and 6 hours a day. Sometimes I pulled double which meant anywhere from 10 to 12 hours. Guess we could say that I enjoyed the people coming thru the door."
good,"I enjoyed working there, but the management is somewhat biased. One manager in particular is partial to young, skinny girls who allow him to flirt with them. If you do not fall in that bracket, you have it rough in that place."
good,"I improved on basis skills such as: being polite, working as a team, and what things are expected for me accomplish."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job were the everyday people....I thought of this job as if it was a Fortune 500 company making the top 10 Forbes list. It's how I gained employment at Claim It 4 U Services, Inc.(A regular guest)"
good,"Cracker Barrel employees are guinuenly kinda and respectful. The management has it's ups and downs. I've learned a good deal of work-place values as well as; the importance of time management. Most co-workers were very easily cooperative and help-ful at best. The hardest part of the job; I would say, especially for a new person is the feeling of belonging/ ""fitting in"" . But, as stated, they're an over-all decent company to deffiantely serve a purpose of an individual's first job."
good,"Cracker Barrell overall to work at can be amazing great tip money if you are at the right location, (one in a super popular city, off a busy freeway, ect.) but other then that I know for myself and fellow coworkers it felt as if we were just CB Slaves and that Management did not care about us let alone care about us as people! If you’re lucky enough to work at a busy local you can bank pretty big bucks but it also depends on if you have a great kitchen staff b/c if you don’t that can affect your tips greatly! CB does not really promote the “work as a team” type vibe so from my experience the kitchen staff hated being there and did not want to help us much and management made it clear that it was a kind of “Everyone for Themselves “ type mentality and CB company policy is “Performance Based Company “ (and management reminded us all the time) so it really made it very competitive and cut throat rather then teammates and teamwork friendly."
good,"They were willing to train new comers with ease. Typically once you get a schedule it is a fixed one depending on your position/department. Management was terrible though, cared more about numbers than employee health/morale."
good,It’s very slow it won’t pick up until summer time at Cracker Barrel they are flexing with hours but you won’t get more than 2 days will wait about 2 weeks to get a paycheck
good,Working at Cracker Barrel was okay the management had a issue with picking favorites and treating people differently then others sometimes all of my hours wouldn’t show up on my check
good,"Overall, it could have been worse. Most of my co-workers at the time were friendly and nice to me. I informed management about a situation and I feel like they could have handled it differently."
good,Things where explained very loosely as knowledge of dish washing to someone who had never done it before was expected to be common sense. Most employees didn’t follow guidelines such as sign in sheets for maintenance done prior. Bus carts and the floor it’s self where in poor condition. Two of the managers where very harsh to most of their female employees. Everything else was as to be expected for a dish washing position.
good,I wouldn’t work here again due to issues with management. Tips were low due to typical clientele. Must have thick skin in this restaurant especially. A good first job but nothing more in my opinion
good,Cracker barrel was the first job I had out of high school and I worked there for 3 years. The pay and benefits were both pretty mediocre I stayed mostly because of the co-workers. After awhile you feel like family at cracker barrel and I felt this even with management. But because of this comfortable workplace where everyone is so close things were left unfinished and other people had to pick up the slack.
good,I used to love working for this company but management started to change and favoritism happened and we started to lose people left and right because of lack of management and I dont like working in a place where I constantly get screwed with short staff and have to double the work and wont get a raise or schedule respected
good,"Cracker barrel is a decent company to work for, it just didn’t meet my needs as a company. The management team was amazing and my fellow staff was even more amazing."
good,It was an okay place to work for. Sometimes they had no care for personal issues but sometimes they were very understanding. Just depends on how they feel that day.
good,Worst cracker barrel in the region. Managers changed a lot. Good employees quit. I never got good hours. New people made more than me after I had been there for 2 years and they were only there 2 months. No insurance or any other benefits were given to me. No one could function as team. People broke down into tears or yelled at each other every day.
good,The work place is fast pace and the management is eager to see you succeed.  But there are many workplace practices that they don't follow.  such as training new employee for a week before demanding perfection.  Or making sure they are trained by the best in that job assignment.
good,"First of all the payment is low. Management is too poor. The store manager always talks to servers somehow and with attitude. Never satisfied and too controlling. Working hours are being given mostly to those, who are in favor. So even if you give them your full availability,  they would leave you with few days per week to work. And yet they always hire."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"When in being introduced to online clocking out managers intentionally skip though the ""side work should not last more than 2 hours after being taken off the floor"" and keep you as long as 3 hours after, being paid $2.13 an hour and being pressured to stop your side work and run food in the widow but will not allow you to leave until you finish the side work. During my time working there I was 16 years old and this was my first job. The managers took advantage of this inexperience and more than once had me clock out and stay until 11pm (after being taken off the floor at 7pm) on school nights finishing side work and I was constantly pressured to work through my breaks."
good,Good places to work really good food and benefits but occasionally managers ask way to much of the employees ima such little timing they want you to be able to work all jobs in a week of being hired
good,This is a great starting job for any young person. They allow flexible hours for highschool students and are very helpful. You can either make alot of money in a day or none at all
good,"At first, it was good but then, ofc I had to work with different kinds of people like we all have to in life but, they were talking about people there and they kept cutting other peoples hours."
good,"They do not treat their employees well, especially management. They throw enough money at you that they think it entitles then to treat you however they want."
good,"As a hostess in Cracker Barrel, I spent a lot of time working hard to not only meet customer demands but those of the management (who are constantly yelling hour stats into your ear). I found myself working double shifts often to compensate for the number of people who quit the job and was never recognized for the work I was doing. Management made it clear that servers held presidence over other team members. Along with this, I wasn't given any time to increase my Par levels (the stars on the apron), so therefore I wasn't able to get the raise that I would've benefitted from recieving."
good,I have put an availability sheet in multiple times and they are still not very good about scheduling me when I can and can’t work. I take college classes from 8-11 Monday through Friday and i have to be able to be at school.
good,"If you’re looking for some place to have a busy day and leave feeling like the shift flew by, this is the job for you. You’ll make great friends and cool memories."
good,"They gave very little hours, nobody cares, nothing was in order. Employees were ok but nothing else there was good at all.............................."
good,I understand working in a fast paced environment and teamwork... But its hard to do that when you are constantly working with 18 other servers when you could very reasonably have 12... Only 2 or 3 tables in a section and the hostess never rotated seating correctly. I made less than min wage after averaging out my tips. Even when people tipped generously.
good,Having to do these reviews is really annoying. Cracker. Working for Cracker Barrel is what I would call a hostile work enviornment because of how busy and how there is a very strong sense of urgency. I worked for this company for 3 years at 3 different locations.  I dont think I would ever go back
good,When we had to talk with the manger they wouldn’t be comprehensive with employee . Customer often got angry because mangers would sit in the offfice and not go to the right away . We had servers getting mad and angry with customers. But overall we got over it because we all needed the money .
good,Working at Cracker Barrel is great if you're very good at multi-tasking and a fast-paced learner. It is almost always balls to the walls busy and it is rare that you don't make good tips unless its the slow season during the spring.
good,"I really enjoyed working with the guests. I also enjoyed working as a cashier trainer. The working environment was usually interesting and fun. Basically, wages and work schedules were my biggest obstacle."
good,"They hold a mirror under your nose. If you’re breathing, you’re hired. They will hire anyone and everyone because they have a very high turnover rate."
good,6/10 for retail and 2/10 for the restaurant jobs. Servers are slammed most times and the have so many side jobs. They work incredibly hard and don’t get the recognition or pay they deserve at this location.
good,"very unorganized ALWAYS. Also, very poor management- none of the managers ever know what’s going on."
good,"As a server there is a lot more to it then mets the eye. i learned patience, better listening skills, and better communiction skills. I also learned how to multiask and deal with the work load under high stress. The management team is ok. They work with you on your schedule after being on them about it a lot. The most difficuilt part being  server is the money. You get paid based on tips. When the business is boomin then you make good money. If it is slow the money flow is isnt there."
good,"Started out as a great job, loved it, then new management came. Hours were taken from me to give to senior workers, definitely play a favorites game. It's so stressful to even get hours near the end of my time serving there. The general manager made me feel worthless, unappreciated, and like I could never do anything right. When asking for help, the majority of the skill trainers who are supposed to set a 'positive work environment' just treat you bad and make you feel stupid. I could rant about the small details, but even management did nothing to comfort my worries. My mental health has lowered significantly due to the stress of working there and just now starting to go up after getting a much more positive job that I love"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"extreme lack of teamwork, everyone almost always in a bad attitude, disrespectful managers when you call off, obscene work schedules- they schedule you maybe 3-4 times a week then call you in on all of your days off and coax you into cancelling all your plans or degrading you for not being able to take a shift"
good,"It's an okay work place, they say treat you like family and that's not really the case, the tips are okay, other servers are kinda rude, the others servers pretty much think for themselves and not others, some of the managers are nice but thats like only 2 out of 5."
good,Management barely handles employees . You will be yelled at and over worked or punished if they are not happy with you by giving you 1 day a week .Older employees get away with bullying and harassing new hires .
good,"Co-workers were helpful, however directions and instructions were unclear. Time was not always spent productively, and the position could be quite boring. Management took a long time to respond to any requests or questions."
good,Hardly ever listen or follows you availablility. Many of the employees are cool. But alot of the managers play favorites. So it eat or be eatten at cracker barrel.
good,"As a sever, the job involved a lot of movement and working with others in order to get task done. Our job consisted of greeting customers in a timely fashion. We also had to take and deliver their orders in an timely fashion as well and made sure their experience was an enjoyable one."
good,"Overall it isn't a bad job, there's just not enough money to be made. They have too many workers, so at best you're getting 4 tables. My hours combined with the small amount of tables I get are not enough money."
good,Flexible Hours. Pay could be better. It can be difficult to move up. Assistant Management and scheduling could improve. It is a face paced job and can be stressful at times.
good,My time at cracker barrel was a good time. Management did their job well sometimes teasing you. If the restaurant made their goal they would by the employees pizza.
good,So when you work there and if you are really sick so you would call in and they would punish you for calling in by taking away your hours I am a server and I get paid 2.13 an hour plus tips but only work 2 days out of the week I understand that I am part time and a college student but I still have bills to pay and I cant pay bills on the pay and little hours. I am so done with them and I don't even know when i get a different job if I will even put my two week notice in or not. Also there is a manager that treats everyone like trash even more so when she is in a bad mood. I really don't understand how she became a manager one time I was trying to help with a togo order and she bit my head off when I was just trying to help.
good,"I was never fully trained and got reprimanded for the things I didn’t know. There is a lot of favoritism to the servers and grill cooks and the back of the house was on their own and massively understaffed for the amount of work needed in a shift. Managers helped servers and grill but not prep cooks or back-up cooks until a disaster happens. Also, new workers are at risk of being lied upon and pushed out and when you try to talk to management about it they brush it off or act like you are just whining. I liked that I could keep to myself and do my job without interruptions but when the previous shift quit doing their tasks I couldn’t keep up because I didn’t know about half of my actual tasks for my position. If I didn’t hear a call-out for an order I got scolded instead of just making sure I was actually in an area where I could hear it. If there was a better communications system it could be a much better place but the management team has to be willing to try and from what I observed they just weren’t."
good,Its a fun place for college students or first time workers. I dont know what else to say because its been my job for so long that i have just kept my head down and did my job.
good,Do away with the favoritism and the phones being used in front of the guests by all and the tables being cleared off correctly so rotation can be kept
good,Great high school and college job for your first job but it is not a long term career and they don't give you enough hours to support yourself and call a long term career.
good,"I worked here during my first college summer and from the start it seemed very unorganized. I was interviewed by one “manager” but didn’t meet the actual manager until I got a rude phone call saying I didn’t show up to my first shift. I was told no one could train me by one manager, so he instructed me to wait two weeks to start  The rude manager called me on the days I was told not to come in saying that I should’ve been there and that they would count against me and I would only be allowed one more strike. After a confusion with my hours and me catching a stomach virus and becoming unable to come in I was fired."
good,wasn't trying give any of the retail workers hours would end up working once a week or every other week. if you were in the retail truck on Monday you would have to stay until all the items are stocked and when it's a holiday you can be there all day
good,"Love my job, love working with guests, management could use some training.  Need to find something that allows rest periods off my feet. Discount food for associates is not good."
good,Hours were less than 10 even though I requested I needed at least 10 hours. I get that its slow in the winter but they legit hired four new dishwasher in the winter while cutting my current hours.
good,"I was there for about 3-4 years and the job started out out okay but recently management has gone downhill. They seem like decent people at first but then you see how little they care about your well-being, schedule preferences, or general job satisfaction. They'll tell you what you want to hear, but back to their old ways the next day."
good,"I would definitely have to say that working at Cracker Barrel definitely helped expand my work experience. However I found that some of their methods as well as their management was lacking in the restaurant department. This I feel was only at the location that I worked at, not the whole industry. Anyway I loved the place as well as the people but I don’t think it was meant for me."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Restaurant work is grueling no matter what. You have to be the right kind of person to work in a restaurant. It can be crazy busy one minute and really slow the next. The customers can be extremely demanding and unappreciative but you have to continue to work with a smile on your face like there is no problem at all.
good,The company is great. I love how the main goal is to treat people like family. The kind air is great atmosphere wise. Plus the home office looks out for the smaller stores very well.
good,Is very stressful on Sundays the managers would arise the tables according to who they liked that depended on whether you made money or not if you're in The Clique.
good,Hours r wishy washy u could have a good 35 to 40 hours one week then the next only 10 there is a lack of communication in boh not sure about foh not enough hours to do the job they expect u to do bosses only help when they want to not need to then yell at u while there helping I do not recommend anyone to go there for work
good,"It was a fast paced work, always busy and on your feet but the managers didn’t understand the work/life balance. You get discounts and raises when you complete the “star program”"
good,a typical day as a cook at cracker barrel includes going through food making sure everything is labeled and ready to cook making sure all food gets cooked and served to the guest withing ten minutes of there arrival.
good,"I didn't enjoy it.  Would not recommend it. For the most part, the customers were great. Really enjoyed my regulars. Usually, you get around $5 a table depending on the size of the table. But don't count on it. Tips weren't' bad. Especially on Sundays."
good,Cracker Barrel is always busy and is always a fast-paced environment. The workers do not work as a team and the management only cares about customers and not their employees.
good,"Thinking it would be a great company to work for, only to find out that there is absolutely no support from co-workers  or superiors. Very secluded from the overall flow of business. Favors the cooks and keeps servers stressed by running the food late or too quickly. Lack of care for the guests and their overall experience. Making Host/Hostess liable for any backups the kitchen has. Runs the place as a fast food restaurant rather than a home like and cozy environment. No breaks and no employee meals because of time on clock. Major lack of support from any of the core group. Very controlled by those who have stock and managers. No care for the employees or guests."
good,"Most of the managers are very nice and relaxed, but the general manager is just a complete jerk. When he is in it is very stressful and if you do something that makes him mad like not getting food out of the window quick enough he will either scream at you, just ignore you for the rest of your shift, or both. Coworkers are usually very nice and awesome to work with, but beware if you are young then it will take a while for them to accept you, as most of the servers are older. Some of the cooks are nice but there are a few who will constantly mess things up, but as soon as you do it's the end of the world! Most of the time they will ignore the fact that you requested off and got it approved and schedule you anyways. As soon as you offer to help out and do another job other than serving, you will be expected to do that job from that point on every time they need someone. The job is very stressful some days and super chill and fun other days. (I had nightmares for a long time because of the stress) Most of the guest are very sweet and come in often. You will also be expected to sell whatever dumb thing Cracker Barrel decides they want to push that year, which is usually some stuff that nobody wants to buy. Overall a good job if you don't plan on staying a long time and you need money, but just beware that it can be very stressful and probably not your cup of tea if you can't handle being screamed at by the GM/coworkers/customers."
good,Not enough pay for the work load  and they promise to give more money or career advance but never happens and the work load is unreal and no one ever helps and the mangers never hold anyone accountable
good,"It could be better but it could definelty be worse as well, it’s all what you make of it. The pay was alright starting out but trying to move out on my own it’s just not quite enough."
good,I worked there as a host and was treated nicely by some workers and harrased by others including a manager. No one did anything about it and it has happened to other workers as well.
good,"Cracker Barrel isn't the worst place to work. The managers work alongside the minimum wage employees instead of hiding in their office. They offer flexible hours as they're open from 6 a.m-11 p.m. However, there are enormous problems when it comes to priority focus, favoritism, and labor distribution. The biggest issue is priority management, the managers will frequently do everything in their power to make sure that the front end problems (hosts and servers) will always have what they need, they might even help the grill line if they're really slammed. As a general rule however, the back end will go ignored by the managers. If the servers or grill line is unable to plate any food as a result of a dish pit back up, you won't ever see a manager put on an apron and start cleaning. Which also doesn't help that the dish pit is generally understaffed to the point where the number of people that should be the skeleton crew (2-3 people) is the norm. That's 5 different tasks that take people's full attention across 2-3 people, on a good day. Additionally, during the holiday season the hours flow like the Nile, but after January, the hours are as dry as Death Valley. Additionally, the managers could somehow maintain a repertoire of 30-40 servers, but yet couldn't hire new grill cooks or more dish pit workers. There were about 7 people for dish pit and 5 people for grill line."
good,"During my time at cracker barrel I have endured manager cruelty as well as cruelty from customers. It is a stressful job. Our management walks all over us and doesn't care about our well being. If we get sick, we still have to come into work or else we get written up and in trouble."
good,Fun place to work great staff  fun atmosphere opportunities to advance great employee discount flexible hours for the most part friendly environment dont count on any holiday off
good,They yell and have horrible requirements and pay for servers. They make you spend more time rolling 100+ silverware and doing sidework tasks then actually serving so you do all this extra hard work for $3.00 an hour.
good,Working retail at cracker barrel is a great first time job or second job for anyone who wants to make extra money. The shifts are not long and the managers will work with school/work schedules.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"This job was just a short term summer job, which I was very thankful for. The management was exceptionally rude and treated the staff with disrespect."
good,very fast paced work setting. be able to be on the go through the entire shift. You will have many rolls in your place of work and they are very big team players
good,The managers at this location was what ruined it for me. I loved my job and I loved the people I worked with. I worked in the retail side. Nobody cares about how the place is run or complaints. Completely unproffesional.
good,Cracker Barrel is a company that in my opinion has little concern about morale of employees.  The pay scale is not enough to keep family above the poverty level.  Company does not seem to question employee evaluations that are inconsistent nor in my opinion do they hire from within.
good,Oil from the fryers would linger in the air. Most of the staff would not follow the rules on proper hygiene. Working there has deterred my preference to eat out.
good,Demanding and very stressful to have to deal with rude management and rude customers on occasion. Its hard enough to have to be great at your job but it's even harder to deal with the other stress from management.
good,"There are no slow days; expect to be working from the time of arrival until the time that you clock out. Food service is stressful for an array of different work ethics, and when people are stressed it is best to not focus on the negativity and to just do your job. Management tries their best to accommodate their employees, but ,like most service jobs, they are severely understaffed for the volume of business that they receive. The most difficult part of the job is handling coworkers. For example it is not uncommon for the management to use profanity towards employees, or for coworkers to shout at each other; more often then not employees are more worried about who is correct in any situation than providing paying customers with the product they are willing to pay money to receive. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that the paycheck you received was well earned, and you worked to your full potential the whole time you were there."
good,"Although i liked Cracker Barrel and, the girls i worked with; i feel as if the management only cares about business and not their workers. I believe that in order to keep a good staff you have to engage in ways to make your workers feel apperciated."
good,"Cracker Barrel was the place to get service done quickly with correct pleasings to the customers. "
good,"Not a great place to be, but better than nothing. I did more manual work then anything, no thinking required. Furthermore the environment was not that great, mostly uneducated people."
good,"I make the job fun by interacting with co workers and the guest. Management is not consistent, unfair at times.  Work without manager supervision.  Close with no problems."
good,Do your job and pay attention to detail. Always discuss any issues you may have within the company whether its a customer or employee. Always smile and ask the guest to come again.
good,"The majority of positions are kept part-time and you're not allowed 40 hours a week to avoid providing benefits to the majority of employees. Kitchen staff and servers kept quitting due to disagreements with each other and management and consequently, checks ran long and guests became surly. Also, in general guests were very unpleasant. Dress code was annoyingly particular for a place mostly employing college and high school students part time. For example, no more than one set of ear piercings and no nail polish was allowed. That said, I loved my co-workers and manager. The teamwork and camaraderie in my section was superb."
good,I worked there for several years during college I stayed and advanced as far as I wanted to go. The open availability was a plus. Pay isn't great at all not competitive enough. The people you work with really tend to make the job. Added more responsibility without and increase in pay or labor hours.
good,"Cracker Barrel is a great company to work for. They expect a lot and it is worth it, however some of their policies are behind the times. Especially for the management staff."
good,"My tenure at Cracker Barrel was alright.  It was challenging to the body and mind,  however,  pay was limited and hours were just enough to not have to give Federally mandated breaks and lunches."
good,"Cracker Barrel at first glance seemed to be a great place to work. I was quickly promoted to Office Manager and Head Cashier. Upon the firing of my direct manager I was offered her position by the General Manager, we discussed pay and benefits and my start date. When the District Manager made a visit to the store he showed up with his own Retail Manager and told me I could continue in my old position or leave, of course I gave my notice and left retired my position at that store."
good,"Good place to work,however manager not strong in customer service.  Sales more important than going out of your way to.provide for guests needs.  I worked in retail and tending to guest needs for me was priority."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Coworkers complain about doing simple tasks, customers treat servers with disrespect, managers can’t agree on rules, no one wants to be there, always short-staffed. Unappreciated and underpaid"
good,I applied as a host and slowly moved up the totem pole. I became a server and a host trainer as well which was great. The only thing that really made me want to leave was the fact that I worked my butt off with little pay bump.
good,"It was an ok place to work. If you want to have a work-life balance, this is not the place to be. They will expect you to live there. The manager of IT there needs to learn more about managing the team instead of trying to be an engineer. To many politics there. If you like your manager always asking you what you are working on every second, then you'd love it here."
good,"So, one thing I hated about working here was the side-work. Any other job I've been at you just leave and clean as you go. Here you have an assigned ""job"" like cleaning the fridge or re-stocking milk or cleaning tea-urns. It wasn't horrible but sometimes time-consuming. At 4.25/hr for a waitress, if it took you an hour to do side work, and roll 100 silverware, you don't make much. Also, the tips SUCKED. I think rolling silverware should be the hostess job but that is just my opinion."
good,This is a place for young adults trying to start their career in working. Its not a place for someone who is trying to provide for their family because they wont pay you much.
good,"A place to work if you need a job. Not a very friendly neighborhood. the over night shift is difficult and unsafe, I had to work alone. The hours and strain i put on myself were not worth the pay or emotional anguish."
good,"Poor employee/management relations. Servers have no autonomy within the restaurant and must involve management with every issue that arises. Also, old / slow ""point of sale"" system causes performance/ service issues."
good,"cracker barrel is an ok place to work, and the management is awesome.  the only reasonm i have to leave is that unfortunatley we have been really slow and i am not making enough money."
good,"I love the guest I serve, but overall it is very stressful!  The management team needs to be improved, and the 2.5 years I have been there I have seen little improvement!  Overall, I have good days and there are bad days, but I am dedicated!"
good,"Very fast paced and hectic environment. They will overwork you and not listen to what days you have down that you cannot work. Overall, would not recommend to work there."
good,"Work was not bad, but not enough money or chance to advance. The hour were all over the place. The mangers were very nice and tried to work with you as much as possible."
good,Busy and upbeat place to work. Possibility for career advancement only if their is a place to advance to. Great job training and learning experience. Business focused but only on the money aspect and not on the customer employee base.
good,"Its fun to work there.Get to meet lots of people.management are awesome .Hollidays are a bit crazy,but it's fun helping people with there shopping.I  get good discount on retail items."
good,"Bosses not willing to train for advancement of others. Always finding things that are wrong, never a good job. Back stabbing, two faced workers, and showing favoritism to others"
good,After training it is best that you continue reviewing information that was given and ask questions when you are unsure or do not understand something.
good,management sucks and they are over staffed so you don't get good hours and there are a lot of minors. Working there has been a good and bad experience that I don't regret but I think caused me a lot of unnecessary stress.
good,"Severely understaffed but are expected to do the job of 3 people in a short shift and its just not possible. I am trained in many positions so I can help when needed but I'm expected to shift lead (which I love doing) but I'm getting my grill pay which is significantly lower. "
good,It's a nice place to work if everyone works together. Teamwork is a must when working in a restaurant. It is a fast-paced facility that can get extremely crowded during peak hours.
good,just not something to do for your first serving job. very poor management. very long hours. the people are amazing though i love my coworkers. just think about it.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,The managers when i worked there would not allow minute long water breaks. Literally would grab a water while walking and was told i had to take a water to the break-room. so i took a water to the break-room and bam. yelled at for being in the break-room. so i then developed health problems because i wasn't able to take my legally given breaks. I began passing out and having dizzy spells. If i had diabetes its quite possible i could be dead due to these conditions. i brought my concerns to a manager and was told that the one minute water break was more than that manager had had. Basically saying they dont care. do not recommend for those that need breaks occasionally.
good,Restaurant was unorganized. Terrible ticket times. Management not very interested in improving it for the guest experience or the waitstaff. Benefits dont begin for a year if i remember correctly.
good,"There is too many people hired at the location I worked at, so hours and sections are scarce. The morning shifts would go to a select few people that worked there and they were not considerate of the people would came on for lunch and dinner shifts. Everyone was a little hostile when it came to having tables. On top of it the sections were very small."
good,"I thought this would be a fun place to work with chance to advance . Should have read the reviews and done more research. They are only hiring part time which means very low pay, no hours and they control your life. You only have one days notice before new schedule is posted. Don't make plans with family or friends because they will change your schedule or send you home to come back later. "
good,Motto is guest experience will never be higher than the employee experience is hard to agree with in observations. too many hourly expectations from management.
good,I did not at all enjoy working here. My main problem was with my coworkers who were very immature and always causing drama. It was a very hard job and very few benefits.
good,Management could be a little more hands on. There's a lot of sidework that has to be done before you can leave. This restaurant usually stays pretty busy so you can at least bet that you will make money.
good,"Typical day included, cleaning windows and bathrooms. Checking in merchandise and putting it away. Checking out customers of both restaurant and retail customers. Co-workers were good to work with, but management were very difficult to deal with .Dealing with the customers is still the best part of the job"
good,My overall experience at working at Cracker Barrel was not the best job I had as far as hours or going up with the company. But it was great being able to meet new people and make their family dine outs a better experience.
good,"At the beginning everyone is really nice and seems like a positive environment to work in. No one voluntarily helps out, a lot of people will put their work off onto someone else and they leave early. When you start working as a server, its almost like you never move ahead. The most advancement I've seen for a server is to be a server trainer. You get stuck in a rut and its hard to escape."
good,Cracker barrel was my firat job ever as a cook the people there were great to work with the managers were really good the job its self was fun fast oaced job
good,"It used to be nice but went there recently and everything wwentdown hill"
good,"I like working at this job a good deal of the time, but things do get bad. The hours vary so drastically you can not have this sole job. The first few months most of the employees were working about 25-30 hours. Once the doors were open awhile and got a slight routine things changed and excuses began. I can easily say about half people working now only schedule a good 10 hours OR LESS in an entire week now!  Managers need to get on one page about: employees, scheduling, hours, rules, etc."
good,My time at cracker barrel was fulfilling in the fact that I learned a ton that has helped me in numerous jobs after this. The Management was the absolute worst management I have ever worked for.
good,I enjoyed working with my coworkers and having flexible hours. The job was easy and moving up was made easy for everyone. All the servers were there to help each other and make sure everyone got what they needed when needed. The hardest part of the job was the mental stress. People can be really mean when they are in a hurry. Working with college kids on a daily basis is also hard when they don't take the job seriously.
good,Loved it at first.  After a while it slowly starting to wear on me I was working as a line cook grill cook prep cook dishwasher busboy and prep cook . Management was awful people turn in their mean and lazy over time. It became a place where I no longer wanted to work.
good,Lazy workers.  No discipline Workers run the store. General manager just yells and stays in the office. They only work when district managers come in.
good,"This company promotes ""teamwork"" when it'sn ot true a tall. Management was so disorganized where I work and they were so hard to work with sometimes on scheduling."
good,"Cracker Barrel, like all restaurants, is not the type of place most people want to spend their lives long term.  Management is an option for a well-paying job, but is 50 hours every week (or more) of constant stress and, basically, garbage to deal with every minute of every day. They got free food and great pay and all that.  Regular employees don't get paid anything.  If you have the skill, drive, and most importantly ATTITUDE you can promote from any position to trainer, leader, employee training coordinator, shift lead (basically asst. manager), manager, gm, etc.  But it takes time, dedication, blind loyalty and PERPETUAL POSITIVITY, which most lack after a while.  Restaurants never run smoothly forever, bad employees always come along and ruin the team.  It's a hardworking, fast-paced, personally rewarding job, and is great for young people.  There are lifetime servers there that make decent money but they work long hours and fight hard for, and don't get insurance because they are technically part time.  They MAY make 20-30k a year at the most, but most don't make that much.  5-20 dollars an hour for a server depending on skill and the day.  Management all depends on the GM, they ultimately have power to promote or keep you down."
good,"Cracker Barrel is a corporate business which means that the most tables you are allowed to serve in a shift is 4. In turn, that means that   your pay is going to be on the lower end of the pay scale. However, if you are a people person you have a good chance of making some decent money."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"A typical day was we had to wash dashes and put them away, take out the trash and sometimes bus tables when were asked. The most important thing I learned from working here is that team work is also very important."
good,it was good working there until megan childers became manager. she jus made working very hard and uncomfortable. the guests was almost always nice and patient.
good,"Cracker Barrels atmosphere is very welcoming. It gives customers a feeling of being at home. As an employee at Cracker Barrel, you are welcomed and treated with the same hospitality."
good,"i worked long hours, no breaks, terrible management. i learned  a lot about the company and different position. co workers were awesome, only good thing."
good,"Expected work ethic is not present.Makeshift workers poorly guided."
good,Cracker Barrel was my first job so when I became employed I learned how having a job works. Other than that it was really an unpleasant experience. My coworkers and management were not very friendly or welcoming. The only enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I was caring for and pleasing our guest.
good,The hardest part of the job is dealing with the stupidity of the servers while trying to focus on getting the guests their food.
good,I loved working there just needed more hours.. the staff is great and customers are usually friendly! You will always have something to do. You can get along with the mangers and they are very flexible on your outside life but take into consideration how much money they need to make to run the business
good,I just wish some of the managers can be more friendly and understand we are all a team..Our store is a training store so we get to meet a lot of people
good,"It is my belief that every single person in the US should be a server for 1 month. Then they will realize how hard this job is and the difficulties server endure, There are many people who are servers their whole life. Bless to them!"
good,"Management made really awful choices and didn't care about pleasing customers or employees. Started hiring too many servers and everyone got 10-20 hours a week causing many people to quit. Tips used to be good but management ruined it, giving every server 2 table sections."
good,"For a minor, you had a certain amount of work allowed. Cracker Barrel only allow 5 hours a day for a minor and my retail manager was a pain and would give me 3hr and 30 per day which is crazy low. The hours suck and the pay is OK. The customers are nice but some do have nasty attitude when things get busy. Typically you greet guest and help them shop. You have to check up on the bathrooms every certain amount of time. The job gets really boring because their is usually only one person on retail and it gets really lonely."
good,"Short staffed, no breaks and the pay was not enough to make all my bills. I worked here while in school and this job gave me balance of self."
good,"the general manager takes advantage of everyone being very rude, disrespectful and only cares of himself and nothing more needs a new general manager"
good,"As a server you live off tips, so when you have a cheap menu you bring in cheap people; who already have a low bill due to the cheap prices, and then tip you cheap. so it can be difficult to make money. On top of the poor money and busy environment, they have the servers do the majority of the work outside of serving; such as making some of the food, busing tables, cleaning floors, ect."
good,"I love my co-workers, but as far as a career, I do not recommend choosing this restaurant. The benefits aren't good and it is poorly managed. I want a better opportunity."
good,"I loved all of my fellow servers, we all had each others backs and I never had a problem with any of them. The management staff is erroneous, they do a lot of yelling and they only care about themselves. There is only one manager that actually cares about people and he is new to the restaurant. Overall it was not a good cultured place to work. For a company who supposedly takes pride in ""pleasing people"" the management makes it hard by constantly putting you down."
good,A typical day at cracker barrel involved me coming in and having around 5 or 6 tables in my section. I learned how to carefully take orders and be respectful even when customers were difficult. The money was great but the management was terrible.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Very Very corporate driven no two stores are different.  The management has gotten better, but the communication between manager-manager and staff-manager is absolutely horrible"
good,a very hard place to work due  to way to many responsibilities for one person at the rate of pay . easy promotions all you need is to stay at your job and be able to read english.
good,Was the first job I had and it will teach you a few things to do. The hardest part would be on Sundays when it is at its busiest. On Sundays the dish room would be over flow dishes and no help would be given.
good,"I currently work the night shifts at Cracker Barrel. A typical night during the week is slow and not very steady. I average $20-$30 a night. On the weekend, I average 80 dollars."
good,"A typical day at work is hectic but easy to handle. I am a server so i have a great time meeting new people and making sure the food is too their standards.  "
good,"A typical day for me at the Cracker Barrel would include waiting on my tables, setting up trays of food and delivering them, cleaning tables and taking to go orders over the phone as well as checking the orders for accuracy and bagging and taking them to the customer when they arrive to pick up their order,"
good,"always busy"
good,"I open 3 days a week, alot of times cause of buisness i get sent home real early since im first in, advancment is very difficult and in most cases not worth it. gets hard never getting a break. Our cook crew is very close and very good"
good,Most people will never advance in the company because they usually hire from outside the company- so you get other restaurants rejects.  The rules and benefits change constantly and it is never to the benefit of hourly employees.
good,"while working at cracker barrel, it was my first job so I was new at everything. I learned communication skills and people skills very well. The management was okay, they weren't very good with scheduling. While working at First Response I learned a lot, like how to clean up asbestos, glove bagging, working as a team together."
good,"Clocking into work for a dish room shift, making every minute of work important too get the job done as neatly and quickly possible."
good,"Clean, stock, greet customers"
good,not enough hours ...to many people working. You have to do 2+ jobs of side work and roll 100 to 150 silverware. even if you have a 2 hour shift
good,"I've worked here 4 years, and it's pretty much the same as day one. Unfortunately the benefits do not outweigh the amount of work you perform. I feel as if management does not really care for its employees. Plenty of complaints that I know of have been sent to Home Office."
good,"On a typical work day, I was surrounded by other servers and a management. I helped prepare food in the kitchen and cleaned when needed. I provided customers with service involving food and good ole hospitality."
good,Paid well however I had to work 12-16 hour shifts without a break
good,"Once you came in for your shift you would be seated, supposedly in rotation.  Did not happen all the time.  I learned that I am a role mode, an extremely hard worker which often led to management relying on me more so than some co-workers who did not pull their weight.   Hardest part of the job is when there are conflicts  or problems with the food, lateness of food, etc.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers, hands down.  A lot of the problems were due to the newness of the store, I believe."
good,"Only a couple of my co-workers and the one manager are enjoyable to work with. Other than that most the time it feels like I'm back in high school with lots of drama, there is very little professionalism. The turn over rate is very high do to improper training and the lack of caring for employees needs."
good,"Taking care of all customers, setting up and running food, cleaning and restocking, occasionally assigning ""side work,"" floor plan, salads, soups, and deserts."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Fun group of people. Like in most jobs you are not going to get along with everyone, but as long as it is kept out of work everything goes pretty smooth. Management seems to come and go, so it takes a lot to keep up with the many different personalities. With every new manager you get new ideas and new requests from the employees, so after awhile you just keep your head down and just keep pushing through. I look at it this way life changes all the time, I personally just do what has to be done to get through all those changes without them making a huge impact negative or positive. With Cracker Barrel it always worked for a lot of us to just do the job we were paid to do and leave the rest behind."
good,it was an ok job to work for. i did enjoy the customers and alot of my co-workers. but as far as the management goes that was very unorganized and sloppy.
good,"I enjoyed my job here for the most part. My coworkers were alright, and Cracker Barrel has a great customer base. The only thing i didnt like was the way some of the managers treated some of the employees."
good,"its an ok place the pay isnt great, but the tips are very good."
good,"•	Supervise and coordinate activities of dining room personnel to provide fast and courteous service to patrons. "
good,"One of the worst places I have worked at. Not only is most of management unprofessional but they are RUDE!!!!! My wife and I told the manager we were married during our interview. He said it was okay. We started together and that's when things started to look sketchy. I was told that I was to start cooking immediately. I was fine with it until EVERY cook told me that they had to undergo training first. The training was apparently studying the menu and watching a couple of videos. That training would have helped in my opinion. My wife ended up quitting because the manager yelled at her in front of customers. After she quit, I was playing football and when i got tackled i ended up rebreaking my knuckle and the doctor told me i couldn't work for 2 days. He wrote me a doctors note and i took it up to work. They told me that i had better show up for work, broke hand or not. I ended up telling them that I would take one day instead of two and the manager reluctently agreed. On my day off from the doctors note i got a call from the hospital telling me my dad was back in the hospital and they didn't know how much longer he had to live. Of course i was going to see him. I called work and told them that i wasn't going to be able to make it because my  dad was at the hospital. The manager told me fine and hung up right then and there. No other words were exchanged. I get back to work and the GM calls me to his office. I already knew what it was about. He told me that my skills were lacking (ive only been working about a week with no training from them) and that my broken hand (which has"
good,"come to work clock in and go to your place and start work "
good,Working here was a great experience for me. I had a fondness for my guests and they would light up my day when they entered the restaurant. I do not speak for all cbocs stores or employees but the store where I worked had a tendency to drain the life from you. My interaction with the guest is what I looked forward to after about a year of being at my former store.
good,would not work with my schedules of working two jobs. poor management. no opportunities to move up past par 4
good,80+ hours a week. Bad GM. Not great experience. not much more to say.
good,"This place you were schedule a shift, but if u closed you had to stay until the very last customer was gone."
good,a typical day at work is serving guest in the resturant.
good,"I like the place just not my manager, and you don't get the hours you deserve or need."
good,I liked woking here. Although i felt a lot of times i couldn't keep up because i was pregnant at the time.
good,"This was not what I was expecting when I was hired. All in all though, a nice place to work. They provide a very supportive and kind environment  for their employees and customers."
good,Elkton crackerbarrel has really poor management. They overwork the servers. They expect a lot out of you. They are 25 servers understaffed and expect everybody to pick up shifts. Only good thing is that the tips are there.
good,"A typical day at work consists of selling merchandise after a guests meal. I have learned excellent costumer service skills as well as selling techniques. the biggest problem I had was the management, they didn't seem to care about the employees, their main focus was on the guests which isn't wrong but when an employee needs help they don't seem to care or help"
good,"What you should, and are trained to do is not what you are doing most of the time.  The managers care more about their bottom line and being fast over quality and their employees"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"When I worked there I had alot of guests compliments and got a decent amount of tips. But, I feel like the location I was at affected my tips. Because even if I would do everything right, food on time, good hospitality, informative etc...some people would only tip a dollar or two. I was overwhelmed if I had to many tables at once and I would do so good. I have anxiety so knowing that there were many guests I had to wait on, made me anxious and I couldn't think straight."
good,At first i didnt make good money but i stuck it out and then usually never went home without 80 a day in tips. The managers where rude and talked to me like i was just a number. But not all of them they also had favoritism and give them the best area. Also you haft to split your partys with another server and they will pocket the money with u know.
good,What I think it is is I lost motivation and it got tiering after a while and I just need a new job because thay hired way to many host to where I get 1 to 2 shifts so ya I am just trying to find a new job
good,"Management sucks, but it's an easy job. Many of the managers are new and don't have a clue what they are doing. Even though the job is easy if you are looking for a work environment where you can be creative, look elsewhere."
good,They hire way too many people and don't have enough hours to give people to live off of. Hours differ every week but there is a possibility that you will only get 3-5 hours a week.
good,"General manager is inconsiderate. Work is very stressful, several senior servers are not pleasant to work with. Many give attitude instead of helping patiently. "
good,This was definitely not the job for me. It is very slow paced. The managers want you to follow people around to see if they are going to steal. Rude management.
good,Raises are far and few in between. Must ask. Terrible scheduling. Bad overall management. Great part of job is meeting new people and communicating on common every day topics.
good,"Throughout the year that I have been working there, my excitement to work at the barrel has faded. The pay doesn't match up to the work that is expected."
good,"I wish management was better. It would have made things better. Customers are important but also the employees and if you do not treat them well, then they will not stay."
good,I’m not saying all Cracker Barrel’s are terrible to work at but the one I worked at was utterly horrible. The management seemed like they didn’t know what was going on and there were hardly any tips.
good,"While I personally feel Cracker Barrel as a company is a great company but as a place to work I would not recommend it unless that person is out of options. "
good,"They expect one person to run the dish room by their-selves when others don't show up or call out at the last minute. Mangers sit in the office most of the time and when they come out and see you need help, they just go right back without saying something. Also if they see you running the dish room by yourself they will come and say you need to speed it up instead of getting you more help."
good,After working there for 2 years I have noticed that management needs to become more involved in there job as well as with their employees. They dont see how things are going for new hires and they ignore consistent problems until corporate shows up or they fail health inspections. They treat their employees like they are belongings and not always like people unless they are one of their star people or goodlooking
good,Currently we are short staffed so we are doing the work of two people. You have to know what you are doing at all times or you will fall behind and it will affect your tips drastically.
good,I became a par 4 cook within 3 years worked there for 5. I only earned $1.50 in raises during that span which is pathetic.. Abt 25 cents per raise. I was employee of the month in May 2014 which was well deserved. I can say i did my part. If u work here expect to run run and run some more and have a lil fun in the process to relieve some stress.
good,"At cracker barrel, each customer is meant to be treated as family, but family doesn't always play nice together. While usually you are given tasks for the day, That can change at a whim and you may even have to go undo any work you've done at the drop of a hat. "
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel requires punctuality, proficiency, and a people-pleasing personality. A conventional work shift as a cashier/sales associate involves the facilitating of transactions, merchandising, and giving the guest a rewarding shopping experience. Management was relatively hit-or-miss, with a frequent rotation of different managers. Some were efficient, some not so much. The most enjoyable part of the job involved interacting with friendly, compassionate guests. The hardest part of the job was the inconsistency of hours and the lack of empathy from management for employees."
good,It's not a bad place to work if you have no bbn other obligations. Plus the food is good and about half the management is awesome. It's like any other restaurant job.
good,Often times employees will be scheduled on days they stated they could not and the pay is not enough to maintain stability. Alot of dysfunction within the work place.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Unless you are part of the “it” group you either won’t stay long or don’t talk to anyone. There a people who are favored by management and many times when management gets involved it’s unfair bless you are a favorite.
good,My hours were constantly inconsistent i would have 5 hours for an entire week then 20 then 7 for 2 or 4 weeks. Always feeling the need to prove my work ethic and capabilities.
good,"I hated it, most of the time I was scheduled for weekend mornings and afternoons and it would be too packed to move around the tiny sales floor. Weekday afternoons and evenings were terrible for the opposite reason, there'd be barely any customers and you'd have nothing to do because you can only fold and clean something so many times. Sometimes we'd get free food. There is a discount your supposed to get after going up from a rising star after a month or 2, but I my managers never sat me down to review my work behavior and push me up to the next level like they're supposed to in the 6 months I was there. Then there was a random 2 weeks where they didn't schedule me at all."
good,"Cracker Barrel used to be great, I loved coming into work. Now my hours are inconsistent, I am supposed to be full time and I am getting part time hours. It is good if you are in high school or college and you dont have a lot of bills to pay. But it is hard to get by with such minimal time."
good,Manager stopped giving me shifts and would not give me more despite telling me that he would. Acted like things would change to my face but then I wouldn't get scheduled for another two weeks.
good,"This was my first job, and I can say that I am happy I was able to work there. Although I do want to quit (Still currently working there and trying to leave), I have learned and gained many things from Cracker Barrel. One thing is patience. Most customers are old, tired, and cranky. Assisting this group of people helped me to learn to understand them but also gain patience to slow down and breathe. "
good,I enjoyed everyone there it was a meting pot of different characters. It's a very fast paced job and you have to learn all the positions on the line so that you can run it on you're own.
good,"Primarily responsible for providing positive interactions with our customers and serving our guests in an attentive, friendly, and efficient manner. Prepared tables, provided current menu choices including seasonal options and available deviations, and kept customers informed about food preparation status. Accurately issued meal tabs. Addressed all customer concerns immediately. Built relationships with customers which resulted in return visitors requesting me as their server."
good,"typical work day includes assisting guests on the retail floor, while cashing out tables, as well as restocking the retail floor. Very friendly staff, they will make you feel welcomed."
good,sometimes you're relaxed bc its so slow but the management kicks your butt when u have nothing to do bc you`re moving too fast. sometimes its a fast day and un cant keep up bc they are over flowing with guests.
good,"The company as a whole is still a pretty decent company--offering pretty good food at a (mostly) great price.  But having worked for the company for nearly 14 years, I have seen changes that have not necessarily been for the better--primarily with regards to employees.  It's not that Cracker Barrel treats its employees poorly--it just doesn't really do anything to make Cracker Barrel feel like a company that actually cares.  Benefits are not that great, and it can be very frustrating having to ""prove"" eligibility for benefits every year (since benefits are based on full-time employment, and each year, employees have to hit a certain number of hours to reach that full-time level).  In addition, some of the perks the company offered to employees have gradually been taken away (such as funding for a Christmas party, giving end-of-the-year Cracker Barrel gift card bonuses to all employees, and even the advantages of ""leveling up"" in the PAR system have been rendered null).  I have not worked as a server full-time at other restaurants, so it is difficult to make any comparisons.  But even with what few perks I feel I have left (vacation pay and pretty nice gift options at every 5-year anniversary mark), it is not worth it to me to stay with the company, especially since I am not interested in management.  It has helped me pay bills, but only barely, and I need better than just that."
good,"The first year and a half I worked there it wasn't that bad.  They did a great job at working with schedule to make sure I got good enough hours.  But the last 4 months of me working there, they were only scheduling me once a week for 6 hours.  I went to management about it and asked why but no one could give me a straight answer.  So I went out and found me a new job where I got hours I deserved to work."
good,"Great job for extra income. Flexible Schedule, good team environment. Fun and fast paced. If you are looking for something to help with your Christmas or Vacation fund i would recommend this company."
good,nothing really to say bout it other then the low pay the job was actually worth working there plus it was close to home and next to a hotel and sometimes if lucky you get a tip and free food for lunch
good,"Management wasn’t the best. I learned how to host, bus tables, take order, Togo’s, and a little bit of serving. That’s what was best about working at Cracker Barrel."
good,"A place you should work temporarily to help you reach goals for future investments. Company was friendly and inviting. home office is great! The advancements within the company internally are not as great as advertised specifically Emerging Leaders. "
good,"I was at work on time"
good,Management treat you fairly. The pay is not good and not much room for advancement. Employees were nice and helpful. Excellent with working with your schedules.
good,When busy you would have to be quick. Sometimes only one person would be able to seat the people. The enjoyable part was the people i worked with we all tired to help each other out.
good,"Work there for 20 years it was a good place to work for a long time I was a server ,hostess, cashier, and prep  like being a server the most I left because needed better benefits and insurance"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Promised a great work/life balance- didn’t happen"
good,"it is a great place to start out at for a first job. I loved my job & working there on account of the hospitality from my co workers & customers that came in. It was easy for me to pick up & learn my duties & responsibilities. absolutely loved the environment, just didn't appreciate how rude & hateful the scheduled manager was when my job was ""terminated"""
good,"I loved my job there but then when they brought in a new manager she started to really pick on me. I got yelled at for other servers mistakes. "
good,"Cracker Barrel was a good experience on showing how a cooperation works. "
good,"The company often catered to the aesthetic of ""southern comfort"" and as  a person of colour, working was not easy. Management did not help and often caused much issues. Otherwise, it would have been a very great place to work."
good,"Some managers were good and others were rude and sucked. You'd be polite or ask a question and get your head bit off sometimes by one. The people you work with are decently nice, but the customers are horrible and rude to you since it's basically all old people. Would not recommend if you're looking for a  job that you want to last for a year or more."
good,"If you are looking for something that is temporary, this is the job for you! On fast days you make great money, but on slow days you don't even make federal minimum wage."
good,This was a temporary high school job. I was paid weekly. The job was easy if you don't mind working behind the scenes. The culture was okay. I liked talking with the customers.
good,"I worked here when I was 16. I made minimum wage yet was constantly given extra responsibility. Due to being a minor I was required to take a 30 min break every 4 hours. They refused to do this and were afraid of coming close to 4 hours, so would only schedule me for 3 hour shifts. And yet I was expected to complete the same amount of tasks as all the other employees that had 6-8 hour shifts. I was denied a pay raise from $8.20 (minimum wage) because my manager felt I was ""making enough for a girl of my age."" Oh and the place was so dirty and damp that mold would grow on the walls in the stock room. So from time to time they would have us go clean the whole room with bleach and chemicals with the doors kept tightly shut and no masks."
good,"learned how a restaurant runs efficiently"
good,management controlling and does not do what is best for the restaurant. Never properly staffed with efficient people so other people have to pick up the slack.
good,A restaurant that makes you feel right at home. Great comfort food and southern hospitality. Good restaurant to go to for people with dietary restrictions.
good,.Fast paced. I never had been made to feel like I didn't know what I was doing. Managers would ride you constantly. I really think they enjoyed making you miserable while I tried to get my work done. They would stop you from doing what I was supposed to be doing to do something for them. It was the most disorganized place. Yelling all the time. It was pretty bad. I wouldn't want to go back there to work even if I made 200.00 a shift.
good,"Due to the type of business they do not give you breaks unless younger than 18. my typical day started at 7am and usually ended whenever the work pace would slow down, around 3 to 4 pm. No breaks and one or two trips to the restroom."
good,"My ex husband was a DM for Cracker Barrel and the culture has changed dramatically since then. Sadly the mission statement ""Pleasing People"" is no longer there primary mission, is has become more corporate based, make money at any cost."
good,Anything other than a management position at cracker barrel is a good first job or a stepping stool for someone in college who may want to get into the food industry but it is not a financially stable job.
good,"It’s alright, the money is good on certain days! The management is cool, some of them are! Just depends on what day & how they are feeling & if we are busy that day or not"
good,"While the process of getting the job was fairly easy, and the hours are great in the beginning, slowly, overtime, the younger workers begin to receive less and less hours and because you're paid weekly, your checks will start being $14-21 dollars if you're still in school or under 18."
good,"I'm a workaholic, but thankfully I also have enough sense not to admit it to managers, because they will shamelessly take advantage of hard workers. Lax and/or lazier workers will be tolerated and at times enabled by managers in circumstances where a mere warm body in a position counts as a co-worker."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Work / personal time ballance is very difficult"
good,"Scheduling was a mess when I worked there. I requested a certain shift and made it very clear I was unable to work on Sundays and always managed to be scheduled on Sundays, but never the actual times I was available."
good,"After working here for a number of years, I have seen this company go from an enjoyable work environment to a place that doesn't care about their employees."
good,"A typical day at work as a server consists of greeting guests, taking food orders and making sure the food gets delivered to the correct table. "
good,"Pay is good, but management is not desirable. Long hours are expected with little or no breaks. If you aren't working 50 plus hours a week for them they don't care about you."
good,"I was not prepared for standing all day with little to no breaks, it would be normal for me to work a 6.5 hour shift with no water and no bathroom break. The small chance I would get to have one I would be lectured about how I needed to stay in my spot because there wasnt anyone else to sit watch the station. If the managers would communicate better then things would run a lot smoother."
good,It would be a great place to work if it didn't have poor management. Great leaders lead by example and this does not happen here. The managers do not like working with you.
good,depending on the day of the week; it was busy over the weekends and slow during the week. Holidays were extremely busy. Constantly had to restock. Dealing with customer complaints.
good,"Everyday working there something always was broken or was going from bad to worse. I dreaded going into work because you never knew what you were walking into. The servers and cook were great people,but the management team, which the exception of a few, were just running the place into the ground. They made all the employees jobs so much harder than what they had to be by being lazy and not wanting to do their jobs."
good,"Cracker Barrel is an ok place to work and meet awesome new people. It has it's ups and downs, but my only concern is making money & getting through week after week."
good,"Although the management is super fun and extremely laid back, Cracker Barrel is not the job for me. I enjoy the staff and my coworkers, but I am looking for something with higher pay and more hours."
good,"Very redundant, The company is large and you feel expendable every day. When I was a manager I felt that they were going to come in and take my keys at any time. Your worth is only good in the moment. As soon as its easier and cheaper to replace you (anyway necessary) they will."
good,"This place was designed to always have the customer right. The customers who frequent here are aware. Handouts, walkouts, tip stealers..... everything mentioned is your fault. Your replaceable not vauled at all."
good,"The manager flew off the rails if you even thought about quitting, and hours were so inconsistent. if the manager decided she didn't want you working there anymore she would either schedule you too much or too little. And by god if you even dared to take more than a two minute bathroom break."
good,Long hours. Good pay and benefits. Plenty of opportunity to advance if you can tough it out. As a veteran of quite a few restaurants I can say Cracker Barrel is not like most of them. If you are not a morning person don't even bother. If you do your best work before 1pm...go for it!
good,"Do not work here. Its a tough job to do. They leave you with no help with the amount of dishes you are left with. They under schedule and under staff dish-washers. It is the most disrespected position to work. So if you want to work your up to become a manager do not start off as a dishwasher nor a server. Dish-washing seems easy, yes but you have to go at a fast pace for about 5-6 hours at a time usually more. There are no breaks for you, so if your out of steam you are out of steam. Also it is a very discussing job to do, you need a thick stomach for the amount of garbage you see."
good,A typical day at work consists of taking care of guests needs keeping drinks and caddying stocked.. busting tables for a quick turn over. Maintaining a smile.
good,It can be slow-paced most days except sunday. Retail shop is stressful. Corporate/ chain company has a lot of online classes and required behaviors that can be overwhelming.
good,Good employees and great guests. Trying to advance in the management position takes too long and the money for the hours worked are unfair. I really like working there but have been wanting to become a General Manager for 6 year's. Hires outside the company at a higher pay rate
good,"Have enjoyed the staff and guests that enjoy the culture and food at Crackerbarrel. It has been a great learning experience for a manager that was 'hands on"" as far as production, operations,and general crackerbarrel standards. I have grown so much for the experience and training of delegation of duties. This position has allowed to learn different meal preparations and the ability to work with a large volume of staff."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Working at the barrel was just like ever other job, they get you through. Most of the managers you can talk to but, it doesn't actually change anything."
good,This was a great starter job for me. Just enough to get my foot in the door to get experience. The managers cared about us and would make sure that we had everything under control.
good,I was a cashier and didn't receive tips. The management was not very friendly and you worked all sorts of different hours and only for 4-7 hour shifts.
good,Food production in a quick moving environment. Working along side managers and coworkers alike to provide meals to patrons. Communication is key to providing great customer service.
good,"A fun place to work with most of the coworkers, but realy hard to work with certain coworkers and the managers. Not a terrible place to work, but not the greatest."
good,"Corporate restaurant, don't think that you'll make a difference. Ok place to work, policy provides for plenty of training, it's up to the store managers if you get it all though."
good,It's not like when I first got hired I use to love going to work but now it's real stressful and the general manager is something else they favorites at Cracker Barrel
good,"None of my experiences here were surprising to me. Sometimes the management didn't have your back, sometimes customers and co-workers alike would be irrationally upset over various things, etc."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. While some can be rude, most were enjoyable and would hold conversations with you. If you're like myself and have a bubbly personality then this job would be a great experience for you BUT the rudeness becomes taxing, yet manageable."
good,"Most co-workers where fun and friendly.  Only main issues where favorites shown in work place witch is slightly unprofessional. Other wise worked well on request put in,but holiday's where rough."
good,Always have something to at work..variety of things..Get good hrs in beginning then they drop down..Never can get off work on time..Good food and get to meet alot of guests
good,"The job is demanding, you have to have a quality of life in order to be happy, the job has great benefits, and you have room for advancement its all up to you"
good,The management and staff were never rude or racist. On the other hand some customers were very rude and racist. Being an young educated black women they made me feel out of place and unwanted.
good,"Report to work in the scheduled time, complete quality check on your tables.  Keep aware of your tables for new guest for dining experience.  Check all supplies need on the expose line  for food trays preparation. Deliver completed food order to the correct area.  Bus and refill drink orders as needed. OSHA rules and regulations for safe food temperatures.  Management completed their job as required by the front office.  Had  employee turn over which changed the workplace  on daily basic.  Not knowing the amount of money there was to be made on a daily basic when you working for tips.  Workiin with guest  I had the pleasure of meeting on a daily basis  and to also see the guest that came back daily to see me. The people are great."
good,Managers do not always back up their workers. Some also do not give near enough hours in a week. Too many people may be hired in one area for this to happen.
good,A typical day is organized chaos. I'm only being scheduled 3 days a week due to this being their slow season. I'm unable to pay my bills successfully. I previously worked here from 2010-2013 but I was a full time employee. Management has improved tremendously. The hardest thing about the job is trying to work around at least 20 or more servers at a time and remain organized. The most enjoyable part of the job is everyday pay.
good,This is a fast paced environment. The job training is great and helpful to your success. Cross training is encouraged depending on the manager. I would say if your are working while in school this is a good place to start.
good,The co-workers were always about me me me. When you want to get something for your side they tell you to stop taking from there sides and the never helped unless it was for themseld
good,This job was alright. It wasn't necessarily spectacular and it wasn't anything horrible either. There were some days where you'd love it there and some days you'd just want to walk out.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I love working here but I just don't get enough hours. There are too many people who work at my location and I've been getting 10-20 hours when I need close to 40.
good,being a hard worker at cracker barrel; i worked to this company more than a year. I worked with different kind of people. i had good and bad times at this environment.
good,"Cracker Barrel was an okay place to work for. Hard to get any hours most of the year and out of the three different cracker barrel locations I worked for, most of the management was not very good. The sad thing is they have gotten so big that you're really just a number to anyone above your direct managers anymore."
good,The amount of work for Dishwashers and Prep Cooks is unsuitable for the amount of pay. Management shows no interest in forwarding the business in a monetary or moral aspect. Most of the non-management employees seem to get along with one another extremely well as they all share a mutual distaste for the majority of management.
good,Hi paced task overload. Systems are out dated. No local offices. Truly a different company. not very family orientate. would not recommend my friends or family to work there.
good,It's okay sometimes. I enjoy mist employees some don't know their place and try to boss people when it's not their job and some managers don't do anything about it. On the other hand some managers are understanding and really care. But everyone has their days.
good,In the beginning I adored working at Cracker Barrel. As time has gone on I am more and more upset with them. They constantly don't listen to request for days off and are not always very kind when family emergencies pop up. I have just found their management can be somewhat unstable and unreliable.
good,I think Cracker Barrel  as a whole is a wonderful company to work for. However the location I work for could be improved greatly. Management has been over turned many times in the five years i have worked there.
good,"It's a nice place to work - great co-workers, semi-good hours.  But Everything is about making sales - the company does not seem to care if the guest does not want to buy something.  And if you don't make metrics, you can get in trouble.  They pretty much want you to push the guest, annoy them, to the point where they want to strangle and yell at you.  They say be nice about it; but honestly, there is no nice way to do it."
good,"Pushed by management for sales. Unfair and very bias workplace with hours depending on how well your sales are. (Wasn't informed during interview or orientation). Opportunity to cross-train to a different position available only to certain associates. Very late on evaluations and raise not given upon passing exam for evaluation. Lastly, guaranteed 20+ hours a week, have worked less than 10 every week since 3rd week of work."
good,Hard and fast paced environment. Not a career. This is a job. There is a ratio for full time that is like 100 to 1. If you are in school or are working another full time job this is a great place to make some extra cash.
good,I really think the management team needs some work. They don't know how to communicate with their employees they are to touchy feely with some of the employees including myself... There is good food and the customers were very friendly its just not a place I would ever work again.
good,Was a very enjoyable workplace.  Always interacting with new people.  Must be able to multi-task well and be able to work at a vey fast pace.
good,This job is great for college kids who need to make some extra cash but long term it isnt very ideal. The workplace is very friendly with decent opportunities for advancment.
good,The management was a mixture of good and bad at times. They wanted you to be available 24/7 and if you weren't you were punished but not getting hours the following week. From my co-workers I feel like I learned more just from working with each other everyday and that really helped me move up in the company. Within a year and a half I got two raises and got the position of Merchandise Handler for the retail store. The most enjoyable part of the job though was getting to talk to many different people throughout the day and showing them the unique items we had to offer for them and their families.
good,the management to loaded down with running both a store and a restaurant. the store is very hard to move in with very little walking space but has a wonderful charm with all the old time products. the food is also very good.
good,"Job is fairly easy,  you make decent money and management is pretty consistent. The environment is relatively friendly and it's a decent place to work. Good teamwork"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"The pay was ok, but the staff and management were just awful, I was constantly harassed by 5he server for the food and the management was incompetent"
good,"The overall work experience was standard. But the consistency of the management was not it was very disorganized. The store in Henderson, NC had a high turn-over rate."
good,"My life in the food service industry entails many ups and downs. On any given day my schedule may change from early mornings to late nights. I enjoy the people I work with although its upsetting on the challenges placed before me when it comes to advancement. I do love my job though, really its the customers who make my job what it is."
good,Employees are nice and get along well. Management is horrible. Just here until i find something new. Nice discount in the retail shop for christmas or birthday gifts.
good,"Hosting at Cracker Barrel is generally easy and relaxed, but managers make it much more stressful and unenjoyable. Managers often schedule all employees for times they are not available and expect employees to work around their lives to come in anyway. If you are sick, managers often ask for doctor proof and will not believe you were really in the hospital even if you do give proof. Some managers talk down to not only employees, but also to customers. It's highly inappropriate and uncomfortable, but if an employee were to speak up, they would be yelled at or otherwise punished for arguing. Mistakes are often brought up constantly the same way your bitter wife mentions you forgot your anniversary one time 20 years ago. Due to a hostile environment, it's hard for employees to get along unless they're discussing the terrible management. There are good managers at the Papillion location, and they are wonderful and kind all around, but the few bad apples do make a significant difference. On the other hand, actually hosting is a great experience and at Cracker Barrel, there are frequently regulars who will chat and get to know you on a personal level. The general hosting environment is very enjoyable, and Cracker Barrel itself is an enjoyable place to work at aside from the few grumpy managers. Several coworkers that transferred to other Cracker Barrels are much happier at the other locations than they are at the Papillion Cracker Barrel."
good,i would seat guest as they would come in and be sure that their needs and preferences would be met. maintain a clean work station and finish daily task that were given to me.
good,Not a typical retail environment.  You must meet all metrics in order to feel rewarded.  Everyday is a different day.  You meet alot of different people.
good,There was a lot of variety in working at Cracker Barrel. I learned to order stock. The most enjoyable was meeting new people and helping them find that special gift.
good,"I previously worked at another Cracker Barrel for two years that was also in a college town in Georgia. The managers were upbeat, positive, friendly, and easy to work with. A year ago I moved to Statesboro and transferred to the Cracker Barrel here and boy, was I in for a change. It was very easy to make new friends and get along with all my coworkers, the hard part was readjusting to my new management team, especially my GM. They are all inconsistent, and 2 out of 4 are just ""okay"". My GM is the laziest, most inconsiderate, disgusting, and rudest person I've ever had to work with in my life so far. The mood completely changes when he walks in the door (3 out of the 7 days a week he comes in), even a manager from Pooler (I-95, Georgia) has commented on. He yells at us, treats us like we're poo on the bottom of his shoe, and you can't even understand what he's saying 85% of the time. He is the kind of person who makes Cracker Barrel look BAD. We recently became a training store, and as a trainer I dread it mostly because of how much worse our GM, and even our ETC, have started treating us. Almost everything we do is wrong (except, not) and our employees have gotten written up for the most excusable reasons: a belt that a sever forgot, a tray not being carried on the floor, a shirt that a manager deemed ""old"", etc. I know this is a corporate business and my comment may be overlooked, but for whomever may be seeking a job in Statesboro, GA, I do not recommend you apply to Cracker Barrel. Not as a server, hostess, cashier, cook, and definitely not a dishwasher. If you are not a"
good,typical serving positon. I enjoyed being a server here but felt like the business and managers were very unorganized. when I first started working there some of there severs that had been there a while were very rude and unapproachable.
good,"Restaurants are difficult environments as is, which is why I had chosen to work solely on the retail side of the store. The managers did poorly responding to customer complaints and calls for help at the cash stand, and the retail manager was constantly breathing down our necks and picking favorites among my coworkers and I. I ended up having to leave the job because it became a strain on my mental health. "
good,"Cracker Barrel is a pretty good place to work, i love coming to work and meet new people , specially the ones in the late 60's 70's. They're so loving , ad friendly and sometimes a pain, but its only because they expect to receive what they ask for....."
good,However when first starting if you need hours you don't get a lot. I need another job to be able to afford my baby. They are friendly and understanding but you don't get enough hours to support a family if you have one.
good,"Assist customers with excellent customer service answering question, asking questions, and selling based upon promotions. (Multitasking). Talking to others to convey information effectively. Trusted to access confidential accounts for customers around the world. Increased customer loyalty through making decisions based on the customers best interests and Assisted with transferring phone calls"
good,"Cracker barrel is a family owned business that welcomes guests and employees alike. I enjoy working for them as a company. It's awesome to see antique candies, toys and sometimes apparel."
good,"When scheduled for opening, i go in at 0600 to just get ready to cashier. The mornings arent bad for guest until it hits noon or late evening. Theyve run out of food a number of times and when the guest is paying their bills, we have to listen to all complaints and i always apologize to the guest and offer to call manager to speak to them and most times they are too busy to come out. If im a hostess for that shift, the busers arent cleaning tables. I have to carry a wet cloth to wipe tables as im seating them. Im constantly apologizing for dirty tables. If the servers can take time to pick up their tips, then they need to take another minute to clean off the tables if no busers are on. We have to be checked out to leave our shift by a manager to make sure we are not taking things thats not ours. Ive waited as long as 15-20 minutes for them to make time to check me out which takes all of 5 seconds. To go orders when called in, guest still have to wait close to an hour when they arrive to pick it up."
good,"My typical day at work involved running around and frying hamburgers, chicken, and French fries. I would have to periodically check the food warmers to make sure that the food hadn't gone."
good,"Customers were always nice, but the staff...be careful with what you say. If you do not want people talking about it then do not say anything! Girls wear that lipstick, the boys like it."
good,unfair work place lazy workers nicer staff stressfull place to work sometimes un fair need more training never got breaks
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Exciting postion with a descent work life blance.  Just no opportunity for a dvancement in the near future due to turnover at the Assoc Manager position.
good,"In the beginning it was a wonderful place to work and I loved the management. "
good,Great environment for family but very low income to support one.  Great shopping area but horrible and dishonest management!
good,"Showed up for my shift and began the usual chores given daily. Helped customers when i could, learned to use their registers. Coworkers were everywhere in every category."
good,I learned how to work with a culturally diverse staff as well as how to handle hostile customers in the service industry. I had excellent managers that worked along side me. They were understanding and supportive to me in my time there. I had many great co-workers that turned into long term friends I still keep in contact with. Hardest part of the job was working late hours sometimes and how much money you make can be based simply on what day it is.
good,"The only good thing about working at Cracker Barrel is that the customers rock. If you get a job here expect to be screamed at, belittled, and your availability blatantly ignored. But, hey, they have paid vacay."
good,"I loved being able to see all the daily customers. I loved the work environment, very old fashioned. the management was very flexible with you and were very professional. I loved being able to decorate the store during different holidays."
good,"A typical day as a server at Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, consists of straightening tables for the following guests. Keep area clean while waiting for guests to arrive. As guests arrive, keep a positive attitude, while taking drink orders and food orders. Clean tables off as guests finish their courses. Make sure guests are happy while dining at my table, and have them leave happy with my service."
good,Was good enviroment. Hard for advancment in company do not promote within store staff was awesome management not so much t
good,"Took call in orders. Packaged to go orders to customers specifications. Set up prep bar daily to ensure proper rotation, freshness and safety. Setup Grill, turning on all equipment, filling all coolers with fresh product. Stocked and rotated thaw cooler ensuring no out dated product. Made salads and desserts to guests preferences."
good,"Cracker Barrel is a good company to work for, but I will quote that it can be very frustrating at times. Overall it molded me into the great server that  I am today."
good,"I had very odd shifts. "
good,I made sure all my supplies in my area were stocked and ready for my shift. Had to make sure I had the correct promotion items and daily specials on hand.
good,"Never had a dull moment on any shift, we had fun while we worked and made all or customers as happy as I could. I worked this job while putting myself through school and it was awesome meeting new people."
good,"A typical shift at Cracker Barrel started out by counting my register drawer under supervision of an on-duty manager in the back office. They would escort me through the building to the front register counter. The rest of our shift was spent behind our registers, all in a row, unit we had a scheduled break. Co-workers in the gift shop were friendly with the cashiers."
good,A typical day as a server at Cracker Barrel consist of stock and preparing the food stations to make sure everything was available to help make shift run smooth. Preparing and serving food to many different types of customers. Cleaning and organizing the kitchen and dining room. Giving spectacular customer service to everyone that enters the doors. The management was a bit unprofessional. The most enjoyable part of the day was making people smile.
good,A lot of interaction with upper management and co workers. Fun working environment but not a lot hours sometimes. Management tries to work with your flexibility.
good,"One week you could work 20 hours (which was a RARITY even during busy season) and the next week you will only work 8 hours. The management staff was great, aside from a couple grumps, but in no way is this job stable enough for anyone who is not in high school."
good,"arrive work "
good,I learn how to master my skills and be more efficient with my work.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"I loved the interaction I had with customers and coworkers. On the other hand, the management was flat out poor and at times discriminatory. One manager, in my opinion was a racist."
good,I learned how to be patient and being selfless while i work. I make sure all the guest are happy and give them service.
good,"Very stressful place to work. A lot of employees, A lot of attitude from employees and managment, loud. un organized working routine"
good,Like most any other food establishment ive worked for. normal back of the house work
good,Taking food and drink orders.  Delivering food and drinks to the table.  I have learned repeating back an order can make your day go a lot smoother.  Your guest are happier and tips are better.  I enjoyed my job because you had  a chance to meet people from all walks of life.  The part I didn't like about my job was you couldn't depend on how much money you would bring home from week to week.  Management was ok you had a lot of managers above you.  Some were really fun to work for.  Some of them were not so very nice.  My co- workers were  great team players and a lot of fun to work with.
good,"When I started, the management was in control and had every thing handled. When I left, they had gone through a number of managers and all wanted to fix the schedule. As a result, hours were cut and people were upset."
good,I learned how to cook good ol country food. Very delicious plates.
good,"I have spent 5 years started as a college student now I'm ready to move on. I have learned how to deal with attitudes of all types and still be productive in Please People the goal of all team players at Cracker Barrel."
good,not eligable for much benifits because the managers do not schedule employees enough hours to be qualified for them. i work 9 hours a week even though i am available everyday of the week and am a good worker as well as my coworkers. managers favorite employees
good,"Working at cracker barrel has made me very diverse in all aspects of reastaurnt opperations. I learned things such as scheduling, team building,front of house managing, marketing the business,bottom line,and budget targeting."
good,"An irregular schedule comes and goes and if you're a planner, don't be. There is no way to plan even a week in advance, but if you want time off, they are quick (not happy) to give it to you. If you're looking for stability, look elsewhere."
good,"Assist Retail Manager with Inventory Control, Shipping/Receiving, Sales Training/Development of staff, Merchandising and Presentation, POS/Marketing, Guest Service and Cashier duties as"
good,"Great place to work,Retail Mmanagement hard to get along with"
good,"You come on your shift, make sure that you are set up for the day,pleasing people is the motto. Sometimes there are benefits like free lunch, no side duties and /or no rolling of silverware.I liked working with people who like doing their job it makes it easier.Dealing with freeloading customers that don't like to pay for their meals. The co-workers the day goes so smooth and of course the money>"
good,its very busy and they have great food. most co workers are ok but some are hard to deal with and also the quest are the same way.
good,"I worked at Cracker Barrel twice in my career. The work was challenging with long hour, but the only reason I left was because my wife was promoted to a new city and in this economy there wasn't an opportunity to transfer"
good,I have nothing to say about this company as I did not enjoy working there
good,"The days could be fast or slow. It was fun to serve others, yet could be a challenge."
good,working for cracker barrel wasnt bad but they just didnt give me enough hours to work and I go to church and if I needed a day off for a chcurch function it was an issue but other than that the co workers were friendly
good,Overall a mediocre place to work at. Great staff. Great clientile. Poor wages.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Pays well but gets too be way too much work and not enough appreciation. Good job if you don’t have a life outside of work. Expect to work 80 hours a week to be effective.
good,As long as the guests are happy you’ll be fine but when they get upset about wrong food or something they usually treat you like dirt even though all you did was deliver it to them.
good,"The opportunity to work here was great because of the wonderful people you'll meet as a server, and the opportunities to cross-train are there.  However, they are always hiring new servers, shortening the shifts of other servers who do not deserve that, such as mothers."
good,Ok place to work .servers are friendly and management is layed back but have to work daylight hours to make any money and if new ot takes awhile to work ur way up to daylight
good,"Really hard fast working job, will push you to limits. I have learned I can handle alot of pressure put on me as a hard worker I stayed calm and tried my best to get everything done"
good,Long hours and quality of life sucked. Was treated poorly by DM and was bullied to the point that I quit. Harassment and being berated daily in front of employees and other managers was insulting and uncalled for. But corp didn't seem to care so I quit. Hope others have a better experience than I did
good,When i first started there it was amazing. Great hours money and people. Onve they brought in a new gm she no longer cared as much about the guests as she djd about her numbers.
good,In the beginning working for this company was OK.After a while displays became so stressful they expect for you to devote all your time to them no family time whatsoever.And they do not work with anything you have going out side of work
good,Workin at crackle barrel was fun at first but then you realize the people there are really mean and don’t pay no mind towards your feelings. If your black or Muslim I wouldn’t work there honestly.
good,If the managment team was better the turn over rate wouldn't be so high. The employees are great to work with but with no leadership and guidance the job will fell either way.
good,Well like any job it has it’s ups and downs the staff is amazing in my opinion very friendly and professional management is the issue some times in the staffs opinion as in mine the lack of hours giving to employees is also a problem and that they keep hiring new people when the people who have been there for awhile are still complaining about hours is where I fee a lot of the issues come from
good,Glad I no longer work there. Stressful!!! Too many Chiefs and not enough Indians. Would come home exhausted. Frequently asked to stay longer. No breaks.
good,"If you are someone who is okay with having unstable wages and therefore difficulty budgeting based on tips, then the wage and tip compensations in a restaurant like Cracker Barrel would be okay for you. It was nice not having to tip-out other employees or share tips with other servers, especially since there was a clear difference in work ethic with certain crews on a shift. It got to the point that other co-workers/managers would take advantage of someone's good work ethic and then in one shift only 20% of the workers would be doing 85% of the work! Being a personable, hard worker myself was noticed by a lot of my ""regulars,"" my repeat guests, and they were very generous with tipping but even then the bill totals here would still be small enough that the clientele gave very unpredictable tip amounts. You can make decent money at this restaurant really by ""turning and burning"" the tables through the rushes, so it created an even more pressurized environment on weekends than a restaurant that has alcohol and where people spend more time at the table."
good,"For a part time job, you have too many responsibilities with inadequate time to complete and you are not paid according to your actual work load. They don’t give you raises when you are supposed to receive them."
good,Even Tho this was my first job craker barrel is aye great place to eat from and enjoy games go to aye gift shop even by rocking chairs old fashion and your kids and elderly would have the time of there life
good,Average management but unorganized with shift times. The managers did not get along quite often so there was a lack or respect. Working with the right servers provided a great work place.
good,"it was okay , just problem with getting more hours , management was good they are very understanding and it is friendly for the most part i never had any problems."
good,The customers were racist and would complain about small things. The management was mature other than one manager who got fired and the staff did their jobs without much pushback or laziness.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,The place was not very well put together and the management really only cared about a check. I wouldn’t recommend working there no matter how desperate you are for a job
good,"cracker barrel was my first job and it wasn't the best. i was referred to the job and thought it would be a good experience but they treat employees unfairly. if you are not a managers favorite, you get treated horrible. very poor management and if you are under the age of 18 you get only 5 hours per shift. the job itself was fairly easy, just the job culture overall was not great."
good,"Makes good money for serving and stays pretty consistent, but is a very mediocre job and you will not want to go into work. Pays well though but a lot of the customers are old and obnoxious and incredibly rude."
good,I was a dishwasher and It was a stressful job because it was always busy.A lot the time especially in the summer when it was slow would get sent home.
good,"I didn't work at the restaurant.. I worked for the service station, but it was an experience also, you never know who you're going to meet, and how they can advance your lifestyle"
good,The place is great and the coworkers are super nice but the kitchen managers are not that nice. They yell and don't appreciate anything you do. They are very disrespectful.
good,"working at cracker barrel in midland texas was not the greatest experience for me. the management was not the greatest, and the environment was also not the greatest."
good,"I actually love Cracker Barrel, from the food to the decor to the family friend environment. However management with either make or break you. I feel poor management brought down the restuarant. If I was offered a job in another location, I would take it."
good,"My fellow employees were fun to work with,and the mgrs for the most part were also."
good,"The company has many benefits that are of use in a typical assistance package 401k matching etc, had issues with management, experienced a change from good to bad. Priorities are skewed quite often."
good,"Crackel Barrel is a great first serving job. They work with your schedule, they also take the time to train you well. They will put you on the floor when you are ready and will continue to help you."
good,It’s tough to be a server in a fast moving process. A lot to learn in all positions that could be over whelming. When you finally get the hang of everything it’s smooth sailing.
good,No free meals reall boring mangament is not right they dont care about nun you thinks they be playin witb your hours they resturant i was in was nasty
good,"Cracker barrel was too bad, I  liked  most of the works. Sometimes working is confusing( for example one person say do on thing and when you do it another person say it is wrong and do another way)."
good,"Don't apply if you don't have tough skin. Guest can be a little mean and disrespectful to servers. Managers love to overwork their servers making them pick up the slack from which others are lacking. For instance, we have bussers and dishwashers but when they are falling short on their duties it is left up to the servers to pick up where they are slacking."
good,"Restaurant managers ALWAYS arguing in kitchen and over radio, retail manager schedules against availability, gets very busy and sometimes restaurant managers have to come help at cash and have an attitude and act like they’re too good to be doing it. The job itself is pretty fun with cash and stocking but the managers often make it difficult to work"
good,"I worked there and loved my coworkers, but coworkers can only keep your spirits up so much. Some managers were wonderful but they weren’t always there. In the time I was there managers that were always on shift with me most of the time treated me and others like garbage. We had over 10 people quit in the time span of three weeks. I loved the guests, the coworkers, and the small memories. I just can’t take managements  that doesn’t care. I tried transferring and the GM in Loveland wont even answer the phone for the GM here in Florida and it’s super unprofessional."
good,It is a good job at first. But they will soon take advantage of you and will no longer use your availability and schedule you on their behalf. They pay was good but the management was  chaotic.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I barely get scheduled even though I’ve called multiple times for them to schedule me. When I do work it’s only for about 3-4 hours so I don’t make as much money as I should. The workers there are nice though.
good,"Cracker Barrel that i worked in was the worst one out 600+ stores, they were never able to get a tough general manager that had a back bone to get the store in order, i spent 85% of the time there working a position because we were always short handed with a huge turn over"
good,"I liked the job description but the co-workers made it awful. Everyone always called out and the managers would scramble to put people on the spot to cover, and many workers were rude."
good,"A typical day at Cracker Barrel involved interacting with many different people. Usually days were fast paced, especially during lunch hour. I learned many different areas of the restaurant, including hosting, to go, cashier, and back up cook."
good,The management sucks I was harrassed and discriminated against by 2 managers and the others didn nothing about it. The par system is flawed I worked there 2 years and still have 2 stars. You get good pay but hours suck and there's not much advancement opportunities for me at least. I worked in both sides and both sucked for me.
good,"pretty much you go in go to the dishwashing room and you put this water proof vest on and you begin working you don't get any breaks, its very very hot"
good,Very stressful and uncooperative. Other employees were very rude and there was no good flow in the afternoons or night shifts. very hectic. Morning shifts were smooth but very busy.
good,Working in retail versus back of the house makes all the difference. The management and communication changes accordingly. Your coworkers will become your friends.
good,"During my time working at cracker barrel, I noticed a lack of communication amongst the manager to new employees. When I attempted to get more hours he wanted to give less hours and it was not satisfying the time I was willing to put it in. For being fast paced there was only a few workers at a time which would allow me to work more but was denied."
good,Not a friendly place. The workers often fight behind the scenes. People Ofer fought or argued over hours and shifts worked. I was promised a certain amount of hours and was now worked them.
good,"The only reason I stayed for as  long as I did were for 2 reasons. One the co-workers, they are on the struggle bus with you so they understand. Two flexible scheduling, however if you are a college student that needs a flexible scheduled it can work but it will bite you in the butt. Favoritism is real."
good,Working with my specific Cracker Barrel isn't the best but isn't the worse. I do not see a career coming out of work everyday. Only get 4 hour shifts.
good,There is too much going on there. Most of the people there are rude including workers and the guests. Nobody honestly respects you. It just isn’t a good environment.
good,"Long hours, understaffed, low pay. I often would be the only employee managing the entire dish area. Most of the time I wasn't given a break and worked non stop on 8 hour shifts."
good,Working for cracker barrel was a very difficult thing to do. We were not giving breaks we were expected to work at a fast pace at all times so that we could provide better service for the customers. Even though this was the case I still really enjoyed the work and people I worked around.
good,Zero work/life balance for management. Managers are not valued like the hourly employees. The environment is very stressful and hectic. I would say that hourly employees are more respected than management.
good,It’s a good place for high school students who need a part time job for fun to work at. I would not suggest it to any adult looking for a serious job to pay for bills.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I feel Cracker Barrel under pays for the amount of work they would like a employee to do. They are unfair to some positions but over all it is a acceptable job.
good,The pay is good. Management is decent. Very hectic at times and hours vary. Some weeks you may have 4 days the next week 1 day. I would recommend this job but not as a primary source of income because hours vary.
good,The customers are rude and not many of them tip.  The people you worked with would steal your tables and/or tips.  The management did a pretty good job of keeping it going
good,"Cracker Barrel was a good restaurant to work for with good morals.  Customers were friendly, staff was helpful.  Most of the managers were great to work with, others not so much."
good,Fast pace work place. Have to deal with rude customers daily. Poor pay but good tips. Bad management poor communication between co workers. Would recommend the food is tasty
good,The co workers and guests are nice but the managers take advantage of you and it gets very stressful if something goes wrong and the are no health benefits
good,"Its not management per say that makes the work experience intolerable.....it's the people they hire...people are trained correctly and then do their own thing. I think we should be retrained every couple months just so doing it the Cracker Barrel way becomes a habit. Majority of the servers are rude to the cooks and demands to much extra food when a mistake has been made on their part. Servers will also throw cooks under the bus to customers using them as a reason why the food is cold, late, or just wrong. I'm not saying us cooks don't make mistakes but the food is supposed to be checked by a third party before it even gets to a table."
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel, I experienced, poor management, little to no benefits, inconsistent hours, mistreatment and overall unsatisfactory working conditions."
good,"Unfortunately, the pay scale could be better, and hours being offered are only part time. There were times when there were issues with other employees, but our Retail Manager was easy to get along with and always had a solution. The hardest part of the job was not enough hours to get the work done. We also had to deal with new hires not showing up, calling out and just quitting. The cashiering part of the job can be stressful when it's extremely busy and you are supposed to answer the phone on one ring. Customers found it rude to start with cashing them out and having to answer the phone at the same time. Another issue was the layout of the cash stands, it was always crowded and didn't flow well especially when you have a take out sign by the cashiers and customers tended to walk up and cut in front of people. Storage was a HUGE issue, smaller stores had very little storage and only during the holiday did we get a storage unit."
good,"management is very poor, and not considerate of employees. The only concern is the business, even if it means making employees and guests suffer. Lots of coworkers are hard to work with and will not help when you struggle or even help by running someone else's food. There are some benefits, being that servers do not tip out bussers or anyone, so you keep 100% tips."
good,The company has a focus on its resturant and retail areas while maintaining a sense of southern essence even nationwide. The management has changed since I've worked there.
good,the people were great but the managers were a joke DID NOT WORK WITH SCHOOL. but serving was great and the environment was great. obviously some drama but not to crazy
good,Different from the time when I started till the time I ended my employment with them. But while I was there we always had a good team and good management. Always given the opportunity to move around and work different jobs
good,"if you don't mind doing all the work then its for you but if your looking for a job where there is an abundance of team work, appreciation, and fair managers then Crackerbarrel is not for you."
good,"i dont think this is relevent to trying to find a job,  the job was miserable to strick not fun at all,  management was lacking never involved and sometimes to much work for one oerson"
good,"Go in, clock in and get to the pit. Bring the bus tub carts from the front kitchen, clean the carts and refill with clean tubs and send it back. Breakdown dirty dishes from the tubs, stacking, sending dirty dishes through the dishwasher, and work the 3 compartment sink. My main job was running clean dishes throughout the restaurant and regulating dishes and glasses. Learned a few things about the kitchen life and about certain chemicals and their uses. Management were like hawks, nothing gets thrown out unless broken and rarely any orders were wrong. People of all races and background worked there as well as eat there. Hardest part was running the whole dishpit during lunch rush by myself, but I did it 5 days/nights a week. Most enjoyable was basically being my own boss and being the leader."
good,Hours are not stable. Always hiring and cutting long time employees hours for new hires. The amount of side work is a lot for server pay. Breaks are very quick and some days unable to take
good,"Job started off great.  Loved working there.  When the first retail manager left is when it started going downhill.  Would have a hard time getting another manager to bring up change if I needed it, hours got cut by the new retail manager was not given explanation.  When I left for that reason she stated that she didn't know that I wanted more hours and that I could have more hours if I wanted them.  She had my availability so she knew what I could work."
good,"If I am to be honest, I would say that my experience working with Cracker Barrel was alright considering this was my first job, and I was surprised that I stayed employed with them for so long. There were times in my job that were slightly difficult and it was decently stressful, but I'd day that it was a good experience overall."
good,"Working for Cracker Barrel for 10+ years was interesting. I had a love/hate relationship with the job. I enjoyed the work but not always who I worked with , some of which seemed to try to make your job harder but I suppose a lot of places are that way. I was given the opportunity to move up in the company and was given a push to excel."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"A day at Cracker Barrel is very easy. Normally you are either the cashier or assisting guest on the retail floor. This job is mainly about guest service and pleasing the guest. I've learned that the guest is always right, no matter what. The hardest part about the job is doing the retail truck and floor moves. It can be very difficult if you do not know what you are doing."
good,"Personally, this was not an ideal job for me. The customers consist of an older, bitter genre and are quite discriminatory in terms of race and ethnicity."
good,As a high schooler Cracker Barrel was great but as some one trying to live on their own it wasn’t terrible but could have allowed us to work 40 hours.
good,"Lots of rules, procedures and policies for every department. Servers are required to take a lot of computer training and test to be able to stay employed. If you are a 3 star or below you do not get the preferred shifts or hours, management only lets their favorite people pick up shifts given up"
good,"The days very on position. some work a mere 3 hour shift while others work 9-12 hour shifts. The pay is decent for a starting job, or a job that isn't your soul source of income. Management is virtually non existent until something is done wrong. The days are usually very stressful for most positions. I have definitely learned how to work quickly and how to keep management and costumers happy. There are no scheduled breaks and employees are only aloud one biscuit per shift, but are aloud all the water, tea, and coffee they can drink."
good,I started working there and within my first week I got sat with 8 tables by myself. I was running around clueless not knowing what to do to be able to give my best work ability. I asked for help from Co workers none would bother they just said sorry. Told a manager and still had no help.
good,"Over all a good company to work for.  Discounts are fair, and half off your meals.  Good opportunity if you want to go into Management.  You have to fight for it, but it is well worth it."
good,"I clocked in and served for about 5 hours a day, did my sidewalk and then went home. I learned good social skills and learned a lot about money. management wasn't great but they still care about employees. I loved meeting new people, but hated the hours."
good,go in stay focus on your job.
good,I loved working here but I'm looking for something different and more flexible with my school schedule the mangers are great and the cracker barrel family is amazing and I will miss them dearly but it's time for new beginnings.
good,I really enjoyed most of the managers they love to joke around and are supportive. The reason I’m leaving is there just aren’t enough hours to go around.
good,"The training provided was excellent, as was the possibility to advance ones career. The management at my particular location yelled at the employees a lot."
good,Servers are not cared about and overworked. So many irrational tasks servers have to do for only 2.13 an hour and mostly old people come in and the average tip is about 3 dollars. Coworkers are great bc everyone agrees it’s awful
good,"Due to poor management we keep losing employees. I've worked there 8 months and we've lost a cook in my position every month I've worked there. And those left behind are forced to take up 12 hour shifts, often without time to break, to keep up with all the lost position."
good,As a former worker I would have to say that the management is not very good at all at cracker barrel. However if given the opportunity i would not go back.
good,Most days I enjoyed working there. Management was inconsistent but the team was great. The training manager was amazing. She worked with u every step of the way. Her and my team were my favorite part of my job
good,"Your work experience has everything to do with which store you work at. I came from the Pensacola store which was wonderful, to the Columbus store which I absolutely hate it."
good,Very fast paced job for those who like to keep busy. Room to advance as long as you are willing to remain dedicated to the process. Hours can be an issue at times.
good,"I would only recommend it if the local economy is strong enough to support a generous tipping attitude, otherwise you would be better using this as a side job to make a little extra cash"
good,"To sum it up cracker barrel is a performance based company and they will expect a lot out of you and belittle your hours. If you want respect there the managers have to think you are the best possible. It can get busy, uncomfortable, and very stressful, especially every Sunday morning. The management (at my store) were targeting and treated me unfairly and poorly. They would leave me to clean up after others messes."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,The jobs got stressful when the dinner rush or lunch rush would happen. Sometimes understaffed and managers would have a short fuse. Most of the employees were very nice and the work place had a nice atmosphere.
good,"A typical day would just be waiting on your guests, rolling silverware and side work. I learned that people will never cease to amaze you. Depended very much on which manager was on that day. the result would affect your section, your money and the stressfulness of that day. The co-workers are the best part about this place. Hardest part was trying to explain to management that your customer walked out, but their business model is set up to allow people to walk out without paying very easily. Best part was it was decent money and they are very flexible with a school schedule."
good,"I was led to believe the pay would be higher than it has turned out to be, so I am disappointed; I also expected time and a half on holidays, but didn't get it. I also think the company has a low opinion of the trustworthiness of its employees."
good,"Fast paced work environment with heavy demands on key staff members, which take a toll long term. The from scratch cooking was cathartic but the duties expected from one person was unrealistic."
good,nice place to work if it will be your first job or a college student. Far as an career no room to grow at all wonderful management always very curtious
good,Working at Cracker Barrel provides many opportunities to learn & apply various skills that pertain to food service. A wide range of culinary & communication skills is exemplified.
good,Cracker Barrel makes their money by pumping out low cost food in high volume with a classic turn and burn mentality. They work management 60+ almost every week and sometimes more than 70. They are expected to work positions and do hourly tasks to control labor.
good,Just wasn't the job for me. Managers were jerks and the benefits were lacking. They made it very hard to move into different positions or up in the company.
good,The job requires you to be quick on your feet and it helps to have a good memory as well as awareness about your environment. It is ok if you need to make quick money.
good,"typical day consisted of cooking and cleaning. Management was lazy.  Half the staff were fairly friendly while the other half had the ""you're not part of the crew"" attitude. Hardest part was getting slammed while manager sat in office or was no where to be found"
good,"Very stressful, fast paced work environment. You don't always get treated fairly, especially by certain members of management. The discounts and fellow workers are nice but management leaves a little to be desired."
good,Got along well with all managers and co-workers. There were times it was very fast paced and stressful. Other times relaxed and enjoyable. Get to meet people from all walks of life. Servers make very good in tips.
good,Followed my daily routine and executed my duties daily. I enjoyed the variety of skills I had with this employer. I enjoyed jumping around and helping out where I was needed. I made long lasting friendships with co-workers and customers :-)
good,"Cross trained in everything. Hostesses pretty much do everything from cleaning the bathrooms, bussing tables, getting drinks, seating people, carrying food out."
good,I left the company after 21.5 years of service and no one in upper management cared to ask me why. the company was actively trying to remove its long term high performing and highly paid managers.
good,A typical day is usually easy going until we start running red checks and the managers get angry. Iv'e learned to multi-task and gain a lot of patience.
good,"The company has a great motto, ""Pleasing People"". Everything they do revolves around that concept. But the problem with how they use this concept is they cause the employees to suffer because of it. No matter how much of an inconvience a customer is being, no matter how rude they are being, you cannot make them feel like a burden. We have regulars here who are disgustingly rude to our servers and management is not allowed to tell them to not return because thats not Cracker Barrel's motto. My store is a huge mess with management who don't know how to manage. They only order things we need when we're at the point that we can't continue for another week without those items. I have notified management several times about several items and they never order them, or don't order them until it's an inconvience for the entire restaurant. I do think this is a great job for somebody who's never had a job before. I don't get paid enough as a dishwasher and the way they have the system setup, its not like any other restaurant. The servers dump all of their trash into the same bustubs that they put their plates and food. We have to personally dig through all of that to get plates, silverware, and whatever else was placed in them. We have to always keep an eye out for when the bustubs get full and run down the server aisle to pick them up and replace them. This part however is not management itself, but how crackerbarrel itself operates. Dishwashers aren't allowed to wear dark colored clothing but we're expected to go out and bus when we're needed without looking filthy. That isn't possible"
good,needs better organization and better management. a great company to work for and love the product if you love working in a fast pace restaurant that is always busy this location is great for that..
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I liked this job but the pay isnt very good even for a server. the people that visit cracker barrle do not tip very well and so as a server i would go elsewhere. The gift shop side was much more fun and the management was pretty good on that side.
good,Cracker Barrel is not a secure place to work. As a server in many establishments I never have made this little money. The management is rude to guest. The guest then takes it out on the server.
good,Cracker Barrel is what you make it out to be. My experience has been one of a kind.. You must be strong minded to work in this type of working environment.
good,It's an okay job if you don't have one. Never make it your last job. Very stressful and very demanding of your time. It's so hard to get benefits there.
good,You must be ready for hard fast work you have to be train for a week after that your on your own and must keep up or the mgr and coworkers will ride you. You take test on what you know about the company. Pay is ok
good,"Corporate rules are intense, you cannot go outside once you punch in for work. You cannot take your break outside and if you smoke this is a horrible rule. When you leave the building you are treated like a criminal and searched and if you don't get this done they will reprimand you for it. Also, even getting a break around there is like pulling teeth, if you don't stand up for your rights they will run all over you. Me personally insisted and even though they didn't like it, here in Kentucky its the law people. Basically work you like a dog for horrible pay and atmosphere."
good,"Working for this company is okay, but the only thing I dislike is as soon as they hire new people they start to cut the hours of the ones that have been there working the longest very badly. The stores never really keep managers too long. The company usually ignore your valuable opinions about things that really needs to be changed. The managers likes to use the employees at some point and never like to reward or acknowledge you for doing well in the position you may be working in."
good,Working for cracker barrel is a good place to work if your looking for that hard resturant experience. They pay there back of the house employees decently and there is room to advance if you want to. The only downfall about this job is the fact that they are constantly busy. Not a whole lot of down time.
good,"The cracker barrel that I was employed at was wonderful at first. But after we got a new general manager the whole company started to go down hill. Management was awful, the food wasnt being cooked until 45 minutes later. It was not a good atmosphere at all."
good,"At first, I enjoyed Cracker Barrel a lot but then the management started declining. I would ask for time off many days in advance but still be scheduled. This happened to a lot of my coworkers as well."
good,For the most part it's okay at Cracker Barrel. I have had a few problems with the place. The management tried their best to have a good working environment.
good,Cracker barrel is a very busy restaurant with lots of food. I was always starting my shift never knowing where to start and what we were left with from the night before so i had to create my own prep list. I started with the food that was highest in demand. I would go about cleaning and restocking my prep station after i finished the high demanded food. The job was rewarding however i was doing the work of two people and did not enjoy the demands from servers at times but every job comes with its own kinks.
good,Working at Cracker Barrel is a fast pase job yet very easy to lean. I mean a usual day to work there is I have to jump on to the line. They try to move employees up as fast as they can.
good,My day at cracker barrel consisted of doing other people jobs. Dealing with terrible management. Management was bad in the sense that they did not run the store properly. But they did work with my school schedule and I was able to get off when needed.
good,"A typical day at work could start off calm and go to chaotic, vice versa, or entirely of one. The management can be bothersome at times, but for the most part they are good people. The employees are very vibrant people who are not afraid to help you, and overall it is a good job for acquiring money and personal growth."
good,"I don't see them being fair , I get paid less money than my work partner and I bust my butt everyday while he rests a lot. I also don't see there being much advancement as advertised."
good,"Cracker Barrel was my first job so I like getting paid, but the management was not the best, and I felt like the coworkers were not there to help anyone else."
good,"While I enjoyed most of the managers, my immediate supervisor was a bit unreliable.  She eventually left before I did.  I was to have been hired in as full time but I never received a full 40 hours a week.  Sometimes I would only get 26.  I noticed that many times the hostess on duty would work for 2 hours then they would send the hostesses home only to have them scheduled to return in 3 hours.  I might have still been with the company if I would have received the hours I was promised."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Working here has its pros and cons the management is not so bad but they put a lot of work on one person to service large amounts of tables and sometimes by your self !
good,"A super busy work place with no communication at all, the job is not hard but managers do not work well with anyone there are few things that should be ran better.."
good,"The management team seemed to never take any less than perfection, which is great, until you overdo it as a manager, which I feel happened in this particular work experience. Overall, though, I was satisfied with the pay of the work that I did."
good,though i loved what i do. the gm made it very hard to enjoy it any further. very rude and unprofessional. made me start hating what i loved to do. i miss a lot of customers but i had to go where i felt appreciated and wanted
good,I was a prep cook / dishwasher it was very hard work with hardly any breaks at all constantly makling food or washing dishes . The store was always busy and closed only one day a year
good,"I would greet and seat customers, clear off tables, wipe them, seat the tables as quickly as possible and other responsibilities. I was a grill cook with getting food out in a timely manner and at the same time, stocking foods and many more."
good,Get to work clock in put on gloves hair nets and see wat need to be did and start on my work helping out making everyone job around me easier because the dishwasher plays a big part.
good,the gm played favorites too much food was ok it wasn't very clean. the district manager was the gm's best friend so he let him do whatever he wanted including hire a girl who under qualified to be out etc
good,"Nice coworkers- only worked part time  they give you minimum hours Management was nice but getting hours was hard ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"
good,"Its very highly stressful. They try to work around schedules as much as possible. Although, i did learn alot more about stocking and trucks working here. Management is awesome except the retail manager. She is very hard on you and to be honest extremely rude at times. She has told employees she does not like them and actually made co-workers cry. The job isnt the easiest its alot of on your feet without breaks but the shifts are usually around 4-6 hours so its not that bad. However, the co-workers are AMAZING. The team feels more like a family and have all became my friends. We are a very close group that work together like a well oiled machine which actually makes the job worth doing."
good,"there need to be changes in the back house cook area in stead of on cook there need be to cook. to much or overload on one cook"
good,Great place to begin in entry level cooking. Nothing complicated or overwhelming.  Bad place to work when seeking advancement.
good,"Ok place to work, better be fast and strong at your job to keep up! Managers were very good, always helpful and nice. So many co workers, you didnt know them all. Decent pay compared to other restaurants in the area."
good,Working with a great team of co-associates and Guests. Being able to solve a guests problem or issue with any sale or performance was satisfying even though management was not quite where it should have been according to guidelines.
good,Need better management  on schedule always short of workers on Sunday which is our busy day of the week. they really need to learn to appreciate the dishwasher more.
good,Very consistent structured enviroment. Most of the managment were friendly and helpful. Team work is completely nessesary working in a job like this. Good opportunity to advance your career if wanted.
good,"Cracker Barrel was overwheling being one of my first server job, it was very fast paced. The management were incredibly helpful and the team was pretty solid but being such a big work force, there were some loose ends. Overall, this job showed me the benefit of having thicker skin in an intense service job. I definitly grew from this job, matured, and realized you can't have a good day, everyday. I appreciate this job more than the rest, it taught me a lot about a real work place."
good,Management needs a major reality check when it comes to how to treat employees. The dress code is waayyy to strict to feel original or confident doing a job where you deal with customers all day.
good,"Usually fairly laid back but can get rough during the summer or around holidays. I learned how to steer conversations toward a desired outcome and how to keep a level head even when dealing with unruly customers. Co-workers tend to be very positive and outgoing. In my experience they are generally either very young and starting their first job or somewhat downtrodden and getting on in years, there is little in-between in terms of age or behavior."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,This place would be a great place to work if you have the right team. Usually the workplace is professional and quality but one bad egg can spoil the experience. In other words sometimes management is not entirely up to par. Parts of it at least
good,I don't have anything bad to say about this company each manager had a style and character of there own. All in all very professional. there were nights they were so buzzy you did not know which way was up and some nights you could hear the seconds tick on the clock but all in all it balanced its self out
good,A typical day is fast paced and a lot of multi-tasking.  The management team could be a little more helpful.  The hardest part of this job for me is to accept that not everyone works as hard as I do.  I get frustrated with the amount of people that are just there to make a paycheck and not help out and do their part.
good,"Overall it was a great place to work, Management left much to be desired."
good,Greeting customers and helping them with their needs. Suggestive selling. Running the cash register when needed. Stocking merchandise in a proper manner. Keeping everything clean and welcoming for the guest. Hardest part was being on my feet the whole time. Walking was better than standing. The most enjoyable part was meeting out of town guests and engaging in conversation about where they live and what brought them to this area.
good,"Multi- tasking"
good,"I learned that cashiering is more than just dealing with money, it also encompasses building lasting relationships with guests, and helping on the retail floor when needed. I had a great team to work with and great managers who were always very encouraging."
good,Management wasn't very well but the General Manager was great. The lower level managers were huge micro-managers and would worry about things that weren't necessarily important to job success (like the color of your socks).
good,"Loved the people!  Loved the managers over the kitchen area.  The retail manager -- not so much.  Being a cashier was VERY stressful - all for the bargain price of $8 an hour.  The kitchen managers were very helpful with helping run a drawer when the line backed up around the corner - quite responsive. Long, long, long hours on your feet - standing in one spot.  HATED that - never really could take a break at all .... took a huge toll on my body.   I ultimately left due to the retail manager.  SELL!  SELL!  SELL!  SELL!  Really?  What about YOUR people on the floor who are NOT selling - and that's what they are there for!  Cashiers are way too swamped to stop and talk to guests on buying extra merchandise. She was very biased to certain people and it was quite evident.  I couldn't stay due to the long hours on my feet and having to deal with the retail manager.  Not for the low pay!"
good,"It was very difficult to move the restaurant in a positive direction.  Employees  were held accountable for the lack of company standards, but the General Manager would not get behind the Management Team.  The training at the Corporate Home Office was great,   but the gap between the training at Home Office was much too extensive"
good,"A typical day at Cracker Barrel is greeting and seating guests, organizing tables and whipping them down. From this job I learned that first impressions are key and how to stay calm during the peak hours of the restaurant. Management at Cracker Barrel could have been better, they need to work on how to communicate better with the employers. I have made some life time friends during the time I worked at Cracker Barrel, I like the diversity because I learned a lot about different cultures. The hardest part about the job was learning how to stay calm during the rush hours of the restaurant. Many people who are traveling come into Cracker Barrel so it was important to learn how to present to the guest that you have everything under control and are trying to get them in as fast as possible. The part I enjoyed the most was being able to work with some of the greatest people I know today."
good,It was a good place to work the people was nice and really enjoyed it but didn't stay long enough to learn a lot but i did learn how to make a lot of salads
good,"Cracker Barrel is a good place to work for young adults and some students, but some like to run their mouth more often than work. Servers work much harder than most other restaurants, and we don't get treated the nicest in return. Most customers are friendly, but some are extremely rude and ungrateful."
good,my job is good. it can be a bit much at times you just have to put yourself in place not to fall behind. you can get help if you ask. everyone is welling to help. but everyone is also busy too. I just try to work hard and do my very best. i have a lot of servers to make food for.
good,Work in the back of the kitchen cleaning pots and pans used in cooking the customers meals. Also have the dishroom clean and straightened up before closing time
good,A typical day would be ringing customers up and for me occasionally going on the floor of the gift shop and helping customers. Since this was my first job it was enjoyable and I met a lot of new people and loved everyone I worked with. Definitely a good first job!
good,Upper management changes made this job unnecessay in my life. We had great employees that worked extremely hard with no productive feedback from upper management. Moral was at an all time low when I left.
good,"Chaotic work place, but the guests are the most enjoyable part of my job. The unorganized management seems to have awakened a low employee moral. The hardest part is staying focused when everything is becomes chaotic because people are  trying to pull you in several directions at once. I have learned that that being a leader, or an example you have to abide by the same rules as you teach the new hires, not to teach them and them do something completely different."
good,"Its an ok place to work but if your in the dish room then be prepared to be short some people because either they call off or management didn't schedule enough people. You also have to bus tables and clean up any messes right away whether your backed up in the dish room or not. Being A prep Cook isn't bad if your fast with your hands cause you have to make a big tub of salad mix and have to weigh out carrots an cabbage. you have a list to do such as make so many pans of lemons, slice so many onions and tomatoes, Slice roast beef or corned beef. slice cucumbers, oranges and you have to do that while you keep potatoes baking and making salads and desserts. As a Backup you have to get breakfast, lunch and dinner on the grill line by a certain time. You have to measure out ingredients and make sure that there is plenty of cornbread and biscuits in the hot hold for servers to grab and when there is that is when you need to make dough for dumplings, roll them out, cut them out and start cooking them. As soon as you empty out a kettle you have to clean it and put something else in it right away or you will get behind and sometimes you will have two or three things that are suppose to come out of the kettles at the same time."
good,"didn't accommodate to any maternity needs"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Definitely a decent job. The managers are decent people most of the time, but the pay for waiters is low(and the tax from any tips made is taken out of the hourly wages, leaving next to nothing coming in besides tips), so when the days get slow, you can walk home with $17 dollars for 5 hours of work. Of course, the opposite can be true as well, where I've come home in the same amount of time with over a hundred dollars, so it all evens out. They tend to hire good and honest people, so you don't have to worry about people stealing tips, and they can create a good environment. Work is hard, though, especially if they know you'll pull your own weight. All in all, it's a medium-of-the-road job."
good,"I work at the store in Grapevine, TX. The company is wonderful however this particular store is a disaster. I am a server there and my typical day is unmanageable. My job is to insure prop service to the guest however though we are so short handed with dish washers and cooks that my drinks and food come out late so my tip goes down. Don't expect to get out after thirty minutes you get cut because your going have to sort and wash your silver ware so you can roll four bends. A bend consist of four rows with fifteen in each row. That is the management solution instead of making sure everyone rolls so you will have five people who will actually sort and wash and roll and the rest claims they did.  When I first worked at this store I would be able to come out with hundred dollars or close to it and now I barely fifty dollars if I am lucky. I have to wash my own dishes to give to our guest because we are always out of the little plates and frozen mugs and glasses (which we advertise in our menu that is how we serve it). I always end up having to tell my guest after they waited for ten minutes on there food that we are out of the product and it could be our dinner special. I understand it can happen every once in a while but this is everyday. The reason why we run out of food products is either the back up cook didn't put it in (in their defense they are new and they were not trained properly) or the management did not order enough supplies because they want to make food cost. The reason why they want to make food cost is because they want to receive there bonuses. The managers at"
good,"A typical day at work was walking in, clocking in and going straight to work. I was never properly trained, I learned to do everything myself, because my first day I was left by myself without anyone training for 4 hours. I asked the mangers about stuff I wasn't familiar with, and I learned to push myself and try new things that I was afraid of. Co-workers were very nice, mainly they were all servers but they knew some Hosting and they trained me as well. Management was good, only thing is miscommunication. Personally for me, the hardest part of the job was communication, and what I enjoyed most about working at Cracker Barrel was that I loved peak periods."
good,"Stock the sales floor, organize the storeroom, do inventory of the  storeroom after product delivery, Check the sales of revenue and compare to the previous year."
good,Co workers and customers that came in were a great and everyone worked hard but i was told when at the interview i would be paid a different amount wage then was i was getting paid
good,it would be a great place to work but the management sucks. they treat you horrible. the other servers are fine but the management are awful!
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel isn't so bad.  The managers are mostly friendly, and the coworkers are all pretty helpful.  My main issue is the hours.  When I accepted the offer, I mentioned I needed at least 20 hours a week.  8 months later I still have NEVER gotten over 15, and that is even with me having had a very open availability.  If you only need a few hours a week, a supplemental income, it's not a bad place to go.  If you need to be paying the bills, best look elsewhere."
good,Learn many aspects of the retail industry.  Am glad for the information and skills learned while employed at Cracker Barrel.
good,"I am an easy person to get along with, but some of my current co-workers really upset me and I feel like I cant go to management and talk to them about it because they pick favorites."
good,"I was never pleased with their scheduling. When I had the hours I wanted they called me in on days I couldn't come to work, then my hours were cut and they only had me in for 2 days a week, and the one thing I didn't like at all was the way the schedule was presented, it was always different and would be shown on Thursday leaving no time to plan anything with friends or family."
good,"Good job for people needing extra money, worked well with my school schedule.  Wish there was more benefits. Advancement is an opportunity for a select few."
good,Not happy with work life balance. Most hours are extended seven to nine days before receiving a day off. I  work swing shifts that change everyday and weekly.
good,"It was a good place to start working, but if the restaurant was busy you wasn't going to be able to take your break. Sometime just because they tell you to stay you can easily work 12 hours without a break."
good,"Cracker Barrel in itself is a great company to work for, but I have been there 5 years and the most I get paid is 9.25. Management is horrible on the restaurant side, very poor communication, my retail manager is wonderful though, knows her job thoroughly and communicates effectively with the team."
good,Working and enjoyment of the job really depends on the management and how they treat people.  I was discriminated against by one manager and it really upset me.  I would rather work for a company who does not discriminate against others.
good,turn on grill let it heat up to 350f then as the tickets come throw cook what is on the tickets
good,to slow paced for me need more to keep me busy. store life was better then food industry.
good,"Crackerbarrel got me through college and I enjoyed socializing with the guests and my co-workers.  The job had it's ups and downs but overall I would not trade the experience.  Great job for young kids looking to get in the work field.  Management was decent and most of the managers were fun to work with, fair, and encouraging."
good,The job gave plenty of chances which was good. A discount during the holidays discount in the gift shop.  Employees not to close.  Management  not willing to help on busy days.   My hardest part of my day was when not enough servers where scheduled.  Running out of a product. The best part of my day was seeing my regulars.
good,the job was an ok job but I never got the hours I wanted. Bosses weren't the nicest of people
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,All Cracker Barrel's runs the same way. At Cracker barrel I help customers with items in the retail shop as well as cash guest out. I also wait on customers as a server.
good,I worked in retail so on a daily basis I would greet customers and tell them about our products to sell them. I learned most of my customer service and information on retail at this job. I had a huge problem with management. They didn't let you be a person. They are very strict. The hardest part of the job was just that. And the most enjoyable part was taking on new projects and talking to the customers.
good,"I cook any time of day. It is not a hard job, but it can be a busy and hot. This job has help me to be able to commucate better and more able to be prepare for business. the Management is okay after getting use to their style of management. Most of the time the co-worker are friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is trying to get everything done and cook at the same time. I think the best part of the job is the people you come in contact with."
good,"A normal day is about 5hrs of continuously cooking, cleaning, and restocking your work space. I learned the importance of team work and how I play my part in customer service even though I'm not directly involved with guest. Management is ok, but has difficulty juggling helping employees of different departments and their task as managers. Some co-workers are extremely unprofessional, but work is still productive. The hardest part is hearing other co-workers standing next to the dish room. The most enjoyable part of the is doing quality checks on side dishes through out the day."
good,"Typical day at work included pushy sales"
good,"My coworkers were very nice to me, and helpful, especially when I first started working there. My manager was exceptional, until he left for some unknown reason. The only reason I wasn't asked to come back after Christmas is because the place went under new management."
good,"Very good training, not much room to grow unless you can move to the backwoods of america"
good,"I as a server at the restaurant was trained through computer work, micro work, and shadowing a par 4 server. I made sure to give customers great customer service, ensuring their experience as my guest was impeccable. I worked hard and kept busy by helping other with their guest as well, I pre-bused and fully bussed my tables and others sections. I made sure my side work was always completed right, my section clean and tidy, and that I rolled the correct amount of silverware for ever shift."
good,"Some manager know hoe to treat you and some don't. I was a cashier It was fun to meet different people, the employees some were friendly and some were not. If you ask questions they did not want to answer."
good,"While working for Cracker Barrel, I learned what it is like not to care about one's own job. I do not refer to myself, but to that of my immediate manager. This is a woman who, instead of being on the sales floor, would lock herself in her office and peruse Facebook. e Often she would schedule interviews and neglect to show up for work on those days. "
good,"Depending on the location and managing staff, Cracker Barrel can either be an extremely fun learning experience, or it can be a waste of time."
good,Guest that come to Cracker Barrel know the best homemade food so we welcome them with a house warning attitude and a smile.
good,The management was the least favorite part of my job. I enjoyed my co-workers the most.
good,I waited on customers in the dining room and helped them with all of their eating needs.
good,I will clock in to work and then roll silverware. It will take about a half hour to roll because while rolling you have to run trays for other people and then help the guests if they need it. Not a problem if the managers did their job and helped us but they just yell at us and expect it to get done.
good,cooked food per customer order in a timely manner while being able to present a quality product. I learned how the company structure worked in their requirements for each position. Some coworkers were good to work with and some were not. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the stress during the busy times when a lot of customers came into the restaurant. The most enjoyable part of the job was the friends that I made while working there.
good,"There very flexible working around hours, but they will schedule you 10 hrs a week. And not the best in management. Some are very rude!"
good,A typical day at work was pretty laid back. Enjoyed my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people and kids all day.
good,"No I wouldn't work for Cracker Barrel for I have been their for 13 years every sence they have been their. A new manager took over 2 years ago where he gave me a 15 raise in Jan.2012 and the next week he came back and said he had to take 5 hours off of my salry each week because I made to much money and he could work 2 people for almost what I make, he has now cut me down to 5 hours a week. I guess he's trying to make me quite because of my age and with less payroll he gets a bonus. you only have to have 24 hours to work and get insurance each week but the last 3 monthes of 2012 I had to beg to keep my insurance. I was to recieve a raise in July of this year but did not get one and after taxes came out of my check I have not made 5000.00 dollars this year for he keeps cutting my hours. For the last month I have only worked 5 hours a week unless someone called and asked me to work for them. They have called me in to work but when I got their the other person cane in last and they will send you back home and not let you work I have only missed about 5 times in 13 years and always gave a week or 24 to 36 hours notice that I had to be out. I used to work about 40 hours a week and made about 17 to 18 thousand dollars a year"
good,A day at Cracker Barrel would be laid back and a pretty much speedy environment
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I was very busy at work most of the time fast paced environment being able to work well under pressure.I enjoy working with people helping others makes my day. The hardest part of my day was once you have work a 12 hour shift when someone call out your stuck at work all day. My co-workers were very friendly.
good,My employment with Cracker Barrel was rewarding and an excellent learning experience in customer service.
good,"The GM was a very angry, unfair person. It seemed as if the higher your pay raise is the lesser hours you will recieved.... working there just sucked."
good,Great place to work if your looking for a flexible schedule but the whole workplace is unprofessional and the pay is even worse.
good,management here was good. They train you very well. Good opportunities to move up to server/trainer or assistant manager. 
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was that I had the opportunity to interact with all types of people with different cultures from all around the world.
good,it was an experience that i am glad to have experienced. the job itself was very good i learned a lot of things and i also had a great time doing so
good,"This is the second time that I worked for cracker barrel. The first go around it was a great place to work with managers that cared about their employees. However, this second time, I find the caring managers lacking and hours are hard to come by."
good,they was doing the most one my least favorite jobs they worked you and didnt want pay what you was worth and they always hard new rules and wasnt fun or nothing
good,"Its a restaurant, not a whole lot but nice people to work with."
good,always busy at work
good,A typical day at CB was very fast paced. Benefits from the company are very good. hourly employees seem to really like the company and most are 12+ year employees.
good,"A typical day at work for me I would gather my cash drawer from the office after counting it. I greet customers when they come in, I aslo ask them how their meal was while they are checking out. I learned a lot from my work here, especailly from repeat customers. The management was great. Everyone at work got along like a family, most of us started when the resteraunt first opened. The hardest part of the job was not having any benefits. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
good,overall a nice place to work. like working with many people and in a fast pace environment.
good,The co-workers were great. Management was difficult...hard to get breaks and go to the restroom as needed.
good,Started working for the Cracker Barrel as a way to assist in paying for college courses. Still working as I search for employment more suited to my education and goals.
good,"Cracker Barrel Old Country Buffet. I would like to say some nice things about this place but I can't think of any. The first few weeks weren't all that bad. I didn't mind coming to work even though we was treated bad, Most people when they get behind or someone calls in, that person gets a little help, At Cracker Barrel we was on our own. They wold rather yell at you to pick up the pace rather than help out."
good,"Great people to work with, great benefits if you are full time. For a student i would not recommend this company."
good,"Started great, made decent tips and hours per week. Management started changing, rules started changing, customers were getting worse by the day. Not the best work place, especially for servers."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I worked at Cracker barrel for almost 5 years and first I enjoyed my work and wanted to become an manager eventually but I realized that I wouldnt enjoy as I enjoy cooking food. I especially enjoy cooking food from scratch and fresh.
good,"I enjoyed working with everyone, but there was some employees made it difficult to work with. "
good,Do not expect the quality of life unless you are going to put in a lot of hours. They say 50 a week but there are not very many times when the labor guide lets you do that or get out on time.
good,"This position is a great part-time job. It's not difficult, and it's customer-oriented. You learn how to provide the best customer satisfaction. You obtain cash handling experience as well."
good,The line is very fast paced and organized. It is difficult to uphold the company standard for ticket times. Managers are very friendly and helpful when they are available.
good,"The people I met there were really nice, however the scheduling did not fit my personal needs. They provide good training, but not a lot of hours if you want lots of hours."
good,I loved working for Cracker Barrel I had good  relationships with the guest that I waited on everyday some of the guest where more like family to me it was the mangers that made the job hard and stressful
good,I enjoyed my job but had a problem with not getting enough hours for the drive I had to make each day and paying child care it wasn't worth it unfortunately.
good,A typical day at work was just going in and taking care of guest and making sure you did all of your duties and you would go home with your tips. Thats all
good,"It was my first serving job, I love trying new things. It was my favorite job out of all of the jobs I ever had. I have worked a lot of retail. Hard work, constantly moving and fast paced but totally worth it."
good,"I would not work at the one in Middletown again but that does not mean there might be a better one somewhere else in Ohio, the management was terrible and the amount of stress level for the job was not worth it because the pay was poor"
good,"For a first job it was great.  Management worked with my schedule, and they are willing and patient with those who are still learning.  As far as a serving job goes, it is a pretty good place to work.  Tips are fairly good, but there are certainly other restaurants where it is possible to make more."
good,Good place to work by if you don’t count on it to support yourself   I didn’t make enough money to feed myself or my cat I had to borrow money my parents to eat  looking for another  obviously
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to have fun with the guest."
good,Working At Cracker Barrel Was Just Temporary. Working For Cracker Barrel I Realized The Managers Did Not Communicate Well With Each Other Or The Employees. It Was Frustrating.
good,"Overall Cracker Barrel is a great job, they have good benefits, paid time off, and etc. but the management wasn’t very helpful, but the employees made the job more enjoyable"
good,"If you like fast paced environments and you're willing to work hard, the is a lot of room for advancement in the company. They do offer a lot of benefits if you are with them long enough, and they are willing to help you transfer if you move."
good,I loved it the first year but the last 8mths I was there it was a toxic work environment and there's a lot of favortisum and there were a couple servers that were just rude and disrespectful to me or other employees. It just wasn't a positive work environment anymore and managers aren't the nicest or appreciative for things they should be.  b
good,"I've worked at Cracker Barrel just over 1 year now. I have cross training in a few different areas just so I can get hours. This store doesn't normally schedule more than 20- 25 hours a week, unless you work doubles all the time. The team is pretty driven and can be fast pace."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Not having a retail manager can make other people feel as if they can tell you what to do, although some are allowed to do so! Other than that, I enjoy working here."
good,It was an okay job. I worked everyday and never got the credit I deserved. I’m glad I don’t work there anymore but I did make good money while I was tbere
good,My managers were very respectful but the atmosphere and the way the other employees treat you is not right. It’s different everywhere but in my personal opinion is wasn’t healthy for me
good,Store manager tries to micromanage too much causing more stress than needed in an already stressful work environment. Also has a tendency to be-little workers rather than build and complains about job far to often.
good,"I was a host at Cracker Barrel. I served people to tables, acted as the busboy once the guests finished eating, and handed out menus for people to look at."
good,Very fast paced work environment that was understaffed. When it was staffed there would be workers that do not want to do anything and just assume someone else will do the work for them.
good,I worked 7 years at Cracker Barrel. I was a model employee everywhere I worked and was always on time and came ready to work. I had many different positions I did there
good,"This is a good company to work for if you have good management. I had to be honest about my experience, so I could not say all positive things. When there is a rush, a manager should help the staff. The management needs work. Servers and grill cooks are left to fend for themselves during a rush."
good,The people who have worked there the longest get the easiest stuff. manager at the time was very nice and considering of my pregnancy while on the job. you may have been scheduled till 3 but don't expect to leave until 4 after all side work and silverware has been rolled (150/200 sets)
good,"The job is very fast pace as a server, can be stressful have to be well disciplined great memory. You must manage tables, and also be able to deal with tuff decisions in small amount of time."
good,I enjoy working at Cracker Barrel there are some really nice people and they let you keep all the tips which is nice. Managers try to help you when they can and if you can’t come into work there are always servers ready to pick up a shift. Only downside is they give you a ton of sidework that you have to complete before you leave plus you have 100 silverware to roll and inspection of clean tables. This causes servers to leave two to three hours late plus managers won’t even let you off on your scheduled time. Plus feel like I’m always chasing managers around if we need something important. Also Cracker Barrel is always running out of food during busy times and they tell you 20 minutes after the order was already submitted or in the window.
good,"Manager training not good. Quality of life horrible. Lots of ego at the top. Preaches that the guest experience never exceeds the employee experience, but treats management poorly which trickles down to the employees and guests"
good,"This company could be alot more organized with better communication skils.. This company tell u alot of good things in orientation that they dnt hold up too such as plenty of hours, reliable staff and etc.."
good,"I've been an employee here for almost one year next month. I have proven time and again that I am a wonderful employee and still receive 4 hours a shift, barely even 20 hours a week. This job is too stressful, the management on the retail side is wonderful, the management on the restaurant side is very all over the place. When I asked for more hours, my manager did not even consider the idea, yet gave more hours to another employee who did not end up showing up for the shift and I was called in anyway."
good,"A high volume breakfast crowd. Short staff, often, yet still seem to make it through shifts. I noticed a real shortage in the dishwaser department. I saw many grill cook ,servers and managers go as well."
good,"Manager told me to get over the death of my mother, however he is no longer the store manager there. When I worked there, there were no breaks, and i was usually only scheduled to work about 4 hours a day and was lucky to get more than three days scheduled. This was ten years ago, I am not sure if it still the same, I don't feel comfortable reviewing this store."
good,Cracker barrel is a very busy environment.  They are taylored to center everything around the customer.  Customer service is suppose to be top priority
good,I would not tell someone to work there if they enjoy times with family on holidays this is not a match for you.they do not allow you to be your own person as far as hair color or nail color.
good,"Busy, not enough employees scheduled during peak periods of the day, learned lots about working under pressure and urgency with a purpose. The management  does not work well under pressure, and are only kind when giving constructive criticism, yet if they are stressed out then the whole team is stressing out. The most hardest part of the job is getting hours since business has slowed and there are over 100 employees in an out of a medium sized restaurant/ The most enjoyable part is getting along with my coworkers and working hard side by side with some friends that I know our friendships will last a lifetime."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"A great restaurant with great food , pay isn’t the best and sometimes it’s a bit overwhelming but overall an cool place to work while in school or as a part time job ."
good,"Started out working at Cracker Barrel as seasonal sales associate for the holiday season of 2012. In January, my manager wanted to keep me on for part time. I continued working weekends while I was in high school and then nursing school. I worked anywhere from 15 to 25 hours per weekend. They were fairly flexible with time off, but with a more conflicting nursing school schedule with hospital clinical hours, I had to resign from my retail position. The dress code for retail associate is strict - down to the stitching on the pants pockets and buttons on the collar of your dress shirt. The manager would be very strict about you reaching sales goals each hour of your shift even if it was a slow day and you were forcing things down the throat of your customers... You were still expected to sell a certain number of items. Kept time passing by, by organizing items throughout the store, cleaning windows, and chatting with customers on their dining experience."
good,"I wasn't getting the right pay that I should have, so this is why I plan to leave in the near future. On the day-to-day you will stock, actively straighten and organize product, and work the cash register. Being friendly, outgoing and talking to people is a BARE MINIMUM. It is absolutely necessary to have those people skills. Manager is nice, however there is a lot of pressure to sell. Sometimes I feel like a used car salesman trying to script products and make the day in sales, which can be overwhelming at times. Pace varies based on day and time, but usually fairly busy during peak periods. Must be willing to learn and adapt to new and different things. Overall 6/10 job but make sure to ask for a competitive pay during the interview and set your hours/schedule in advance to get the most out of this position."
good,favoritism at its best unfortunately. certain managers have certain people they favor so those certain workers can do whatever they please and still keep their jobs.
good,"I didn’t feel I was trained well enough, and just thrown into it. Always did others jobs, plus mine due to being understaffed.  "
good,"Coworkers are elderly women who can barely operate the computer systems, so the responsibility falls entirely to younger employees, of which there were very few. Management was concerned more with their own benefits and hiding in the office, instead of working with employees. It wasn't uncommon to have one particular manager scream at employees in front of guests."
good,Was allways on the move I just need more in my life then what they could offer  managers were friendly teamwork orientedthe company would be nowhere without teamwork
good,"I worked as a prep cook, made fresh biscuits and corn muffins. Worked with kettles. Fast pace, try to keep up with the demand. I liked my co-workers. managers were nice"
good,Everything is great but it could be better at least the pay for other roles. Waiting tables isn’t bad! Management is getting better but it’s a college town.
good,"I wish things could work different, it was a great place of work. Only one manager was absolutely the best and I hope they realize that. I advanced quickly though jobs and had fun being able to help when needed."
good,"Very stressful now. Hours are not steady. New management is not working well, very unorganized. No increase in pay but demand in increase of work. Does not fully change new employees now"
good,Cracker Barrel is a demanding company. But there is a lot to learn and take with you. Other restaurant concepts have a lot of respect for experienced Cracker Barrel employees because they know how much is expected of us.
good,The job for me was pretty great. A lot of it depends on how good your DM is. The relationship between restaurant and retail can also affect how smoothly your day is going to go. You work at least 45 a week and say goodbye to most full weekends.
good,I liked my cracker barrel job because of the relationships I built with my co-workers. It was a fast paced environment and I enjoyed my time working there.
good,"Dress code is very strict. No visible tattoos, no more than one ear ring per ear, certain style pants, and colored shirts. Days that are requested off are not always given."
good,My job consisted of greeting and assisting customers . I learned the meaning of hard work and customer care . The hardest part of my job was the pay and hours. I enjoyed the people that I worked with and getting to know my customers.
good,The people at Cracker Barrel are so friendly and the training was extensive and covered everything you could possibly imagine. There is room for advancement however the pay is extremely low.
good,I have been with the company for almost 7 years now and have been promised career advancement. I have been “promoted” to to-go lead. But the pay is not what I need in order to be where I want to be in life. I am way too overqualified for my job position and it is time for a change
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Good place for teens but at store #536 it’s a lot of drama if you want some pocket money this your place if you looking for money to life off of then this might not be the place
good,long hours but fun place they have you do things that do not make the guest better just the share holders. they have you do thins company wide that need to be store specific but all it does is hurt the store and the guest
good,Went for a full month with only 20 hours a week this was done to lessen the warehouse workers bonus which increased managers bonuses. Following months we had to go in early and work 55 to 70 hours to catch up
good,You get a good discount after you reach a Par 4 status.  Most guests are very friendly. I enjoy interacting with the guests.  The food there is absolutely great!
good,"Management played favorites which was very noticeable. The workers were okay, the benefits were great, however the hours were ludicrous and odd every week"
good,The store wasnt run well. Some managers are nice others not so much. Loved working with the original staff but as more new people arrived and the old crew was gone it became miserable.
good,"Food was always good and the customers were always friendly but I felt we were underpaid and the tips were never good enough to survive on. the kids at that time were always nice yes, I do love the restaurant and the store was always my favorite part. Wonderful place but not the best choice to try and make a living working as a server."
good,"as a salaried mgr with crackerbarrel , given job requirements very difficult to maintain a healthy work/life balance . required to work 10 hours per day, always ends up being 11 to 12 ."
good,Good money long hours perks not worth it.  It’s a job. Demands are high.   Corporate does not stand behind managers.  Budgets not  realistic.  Raises and promotions are a joke
good,It wasnt enough hours nor days to work enough on my salary. Some days the people were really rude and other days they were okay. It was stressful at times
good,"This is not a particularly great place to work, but it's also probably not the worst. The most important thing to remember is that your hours are a precious commodity, and if you're looking for full-time employment, look elsewhere."
good,This was my first job. In less than three months I had already managed to work in three different stations and tests were provided in a timely manner. Sadly it is very difficult to receive enough hours and benefits.
good,"I was there for 2 years, enjoyed my time. The managers were very aggressive and hard to deal with. Other than that the company is alright. Very good job security and rehire potential."
good,It started off alright and fun.  Then some small things went down between me and some coworkers.  I did not intend to start anything. Things happened and one thing led to another.
good,"Typical day included serving tables in a designated section of the restaurant, relaying orders from the guests to the kitchen, prepping the food once it was cooked, and running food trays from the kitchen to the guests tables. I learned how to be a team player and how to treat people with respect. The workplace culture is easy when its not busy but overwhelming when it is. Hardest part of the job is having to take on so many tables at one time by yourself. The most enjoyable part of the job was making friends with co-workers."
good,I have been working for Cracker Barrel since I was sixteen years old. My overall experience there has been helpful in developing all of my work place skill sets. I have learned a lot of tips and tricks for succeeding in the costumer service industry. However it can be unrewarding and highly stressful at times. Also they have a tendency to over work their kitchen staff and therefore have a high turn over rate in the back of the house. This makes it harder on the rest of the kitchen staff causing us to burn out.
good,The staff was amazing.  Management was ok. It was the regulars and the staff that made it work going to work . I gained a lot of regulars whIle I was there.
good,"Loved working there in the beginning. But as I got older and life got more expensive, I asked for hours and pay compensation. The manager over a period of 8 months said I would get what I asked for. Never happened till I had enough and quit."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,The job primarily is working with mass amounts of the public in a quick paced environment.  Food issues are resolved as well as selling in the store....
good,"Servers have a crazy work load. You never get off when you’re supposed to because of sidework, tables, and rolling silverware. Most positions get paid $9-9.50 an hour. Servers make $2.13 but people don’t really tip well at Cracker Barrel because the bill is usually fairly cheap and we don’t serve alcohol."
good,The job is good for people that would like to meet people with a diverse background. It even better for people who looking for side jobs or attending school.
good,"management is on the low quality side, mainly due to corporate pressuring. all qualities of Cracker Barrel could be greatly improved if the corporate administrators would be more open to listening to employees"
good,I  it became a family and a great support system while working here for the short two years.I was able to pick up shifts in the gift area when they needed help. The managers took great care of us and offered us overtime before asking others. It felt like family and friends.
good,"I was a hostess, and it was fine, but waiters were always down my throat to seat them more often. My managers were flexible with my hours and were generally kind."
good,"As a manager you don't have have so much of self development, every decisions that  you make must be approved by the area director and the GM even the little things that has to impact on policy"
good,Shortage of management per location. Long hours worked. High turnover of management and hourly.Not systematically set up like training facility. Managers not giving good training to hourly
good,The environment is.... strange. 
good,"I started as a host and cross trained to server"
good,"It was a very good work place to work, The people that I worked with were very nice and made me feel very welcome on my first day, amd every day after that, I loved working there it felt like family. I didn't want to resign because of how much I loved it there. I didn't make enough money. The hardest part of the job was when we got rushes, for example, when 20 people would come in."
good,"No comment"
good,"Cracker barrel is more of a slow working job. It is pretty relaxed, the busiest I remember getting would be on Sundays during lunch. Luckily the retail part of the store was there to keep you busy."
good,I asked to work during the week since im able to after school. But even though i wrote it down on my schedule paper i still did not get my desired hours till after my two weeks notice on my last week.
good,A typical day would be selling gift shop items I learned how to communicate with people management was just okay the culture was good hardest part of the job was the cleaning enjoyable part of the job was that I got to meet people
good,Working for this company taught me so much that I can carry on to other careers.  I enjoyed the challenge of meeting sales goals and helping on the restaurant side of the business
good,Some days fast paced other days slow and relaxed. Never sure how your day would wind up. Possibility of making really good money and other days not making a lot.
good,This was an learning experience for me. This job helped me to a better team player. You have to work with others and thats what i think made a better co worker
good,"Not a bad place to work at times. Though it is expected of anyone to do more than what one person can do. The employee turn over rate is high. We have had employees work a day, a week, or even a couple of hours and quit because to much is asked of them to quickly for the pay. You are expected to figure out what ever position your put at in a couple of days before you are left on your own. Hours vary during the slow and peak seasons. Slow season you may get 30 hours but they do offer other things to do to allow the employee to get more. Peak season can run from 40 to 60 hours sometimes more."
good,great atmosphere. they expected 12 hour plus days. if you went into work they were always trying to get you to stay much longer than you were scheduled.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"I was fortunate to work for a intelligent and fair retail manager. Our retail team worked well together creating a friendly and comfortable atmosphere. Unfortunately, hours could be limited and pay was low. In addition, some restaurant managers were not team players with retail and does not support the front with guest service issues. It provided a hostile work environment throughout the building."
good,I liked being able to meet need people everyday.It was a great place to help cusotmers find a new items or enjoy a great meal.Some mangers were a joy to work with because they were willing to help in any way they could.
good,Fun coworkers and guests. My managers are pretty good about letting me have days off if I have to be off work with my son for a doctor appointment and schedule changes.
good,"Very fast paced, don't expect to make a lot of money. Large menu, and overworked management.  Best for short term employment, high turnover.."
good,"During the time of grand opening it was a lot of people hired; so, the hours were scarce. The pay for the work required wasn't fair. May be better now."
good,Cracker Barrel is a family orientated company. I disliked the fact that there weren't enough employees scheduled to complete tasks in the kitchen area in a timely manner.
good,Cracker Barrel was a typical cookie cutter manager mill.   They paid well but worked you alot whereas you did not have a good family life.   Good for single person as compensation was very good but really had not enough time off to enjoy it
good,"If you want to move up at Cracker Barrel you have to suck up to the right people. If you don't do your job and the managers job then you are considered a mediocre employee. The managers expect you to do everything, they want to keep as little people scheduled as possible and they will take advantage of that if you are a good employee. Corporate doesn't allow enough hours for us to have enough people to get the job done. So in other words you are expected to do the job of 3 people."
good,"Not the best place to work. Poor management. Either too many or too few hours. No one seemed to get along. Sometimes very dirty, and many broken health code violations."
good,"Very honest staff and very efficient work environment. Every customer that has came in has been so sweet and understanding, even on our most busy day, the food is always so good, and the management is half bad either."
good,Fast paced friendly environment. Great staff and managers that actually cared about fellow coworkers. You also had the option to work in different areas of the store to be a team player and get more hours.
good,I just moved to Iowa and looking for a job that meets my criatura. i am a very hard worker and I learn fast. I get along with everybody. I always have a smile on my face even when I feel under the weather.
good,"The company culture was not for me, It festered annimosity between managers and staff never trying to builkd a team, Looking for robots to lead with out thinking."
good,"Last store I worked in had assistance managers quitting left and right to get away from the General Manager. Same for all of the employees. Terrible policies."
good,management lacks respect for employees. the relationship with the main office is nonexisting. only great thing was being able to make my own hours and money.
good,Cracker Barrel allowed for me to gain customer service experience. I had difficulty making enough tips to fund my first semester in college. Management was unwilling to work around my class schedule in college.
good,it was overall alot of fun working with this company. did't too much care for certain manager there. beside him great place to work. great customers very friendly people.
good,"It was busy especially during weekends. They have a lot of people working for them, mainly part timers. It was boring during week-days, It was very active during weekends."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I saw alot in the 6 years I worked for Cracker Barrel and for the most part the experience was a very satisfying one.  HOwever in the end it seemed that the company was trying to become too much like a fast food restaurant
good,Cracker Barrel is a tough place to work. Especially if you want to work in the restaurant. The hard work pays off in the end but you have to be willing to put in the hard work
good,"Rarely get off on time. Overworked and underpaid. Some of the managers are rude and seem to not care about your personal life or anything you have to do outside of there. A lot cleaning like scraping gum from under tables and chairs, scrubbing walls. Things that are not listed in your job description while interviewing you. The pay is not so good and the benefits they offer are lousy"
good,Wouldn't work for the company again. The general manager was great but the people he had under him were unprofessional and poorly trained. They didn't treat employees equally.
good,"They add people to the schedule without telling them so that in the future they don't have to give you any benefits, they just find new people. They set you up to do a no-call no-show."
good,As a Cracker Barrel manager you are expected to work a fluctuating schedule.  Some days you are scheduled 5am-3pm while other days a scheduled shift will begin at 1pm and end at 12am.  The work/life balance is terrible.  It is also a labor intensive 10-12 hour shift.
good,The day is usually busy and lots of fun meeting new people. And seeing smiling faces all day. Management could definitely use some work! It is comfortable and easy to do your job when things are going smoothly. The hardest part is dealing with grumpy or unhappy guests. Best part of the day is meeting new faces and the money you leave with at the end of the day.
good,"Cracker barrel had the potential to be great, in the right hands"
good,"fun people, okay food, family based clientele. Management can be too much with a total 4-5 per store. But having that dynamic means you're likely to have at least one personable manager."
good,I like my job just want something new! I been with this company for almost three years this is a great place it just time for me to move to better things.
good,"I loved working there, I worked there for tree years, then went on leave and came back. when I came back management was worst than when I left and I just could deal wit it any more. I love the support managers but their GM does not need to be a GM."
good,"I will be honest, I only worked here a month. At my particular store, the managers were awesome, the trainer was awesome, the job was pretty easy and straightforward, and my coworkers were pretty good at working together. It just seemed very impersonal to me, as well as overstaffed a lot of the time, which was a big change for me and didn't mesh right with my personality. "
good,Great place to work under the proper management. Flexible work schedule sometimes angina depending on management.  You are required to work every holiday.
good,long story short it was a great place to work tell they got new managers who tried to take over everything and change it too fast. due to this i found working there unpleasent and confusing so i had to find a new career path
good,"Cracker Barrel has it all figured out! the have systems for everything. It is a very well oiled business. From a management stand point the down side is that the retail manager is over the assist Restaurant managers, however the restaurant managers are responsible for retail and assisting cashiers when the retail manager is out but the retail manager isn't allowed the run registers and cannot manage the restaurant. So you answer to a manager who doesn't know your job???? "
good,"Great place to work but can be hectic at times, especially weekend mornings with over 20 servers staffed at once and only 4 computers to use. Staff can be fun majority of the time though needs some improvement."
good,Came into work and clocked in then went straight to the host stand. At the host stand I seat and great customer with silverware and menus. After my shift I clean and clock out.
good,"Its a ok place to work but they have thier favorites, which doesnt give you room for advancement and very hard to pay your bills on time. If you dont have a flexible schedule you wont get hours."
good,"It is busy at times, which makes it productive. Management was helpful most of the time in situations that arose. A family oriented place to dine and shop."
good,My years at this restaurant were productive and I learned a lot. Managers were very strict and sometimes more than they should have been. Customers sometimes walked out without paying and wait staff were held responsible which was not fair.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"I am very dissatisfied with my experience. As a high school student, balancing school, extracurriculars and work, it isn't easy. With that being said, my manager did not support my school responsibilities and in fact cut my hours shorter when I started needing a few days off for sports. Though I needed the money, school is always a priority over a job as a teen."
good,"Working at the cash register dealing with credit/debit and cash transactions either with food or retail merchandise in the store."
good,"A great company to work for, But very little time for having a normal life. Very demanding hours and have to always be on call."
good,learned you will like some managers and hate others because they try to get you to do bussers job even when it is busy. mandatory to work sunday orthey take you off the schedule
good,"A day at Cracker Barrel on the weekends is a wonderful and exciting place to meet new people, it is one of the days I get 8+ hours and it is non stop, I love a fast pace work place it makes the day go by faster. I enjoy the different people that I have meet, my regulars that come in every day are wonderful to me. My co-workers are wonderful and supportive"
good,Cracker barrel is a good place to work and a friendly environment. The customers are very pleasant and the managers are easy to work with.
good,"Decent money, Decent benefits, Decent hours, Mixed environment(Sometimes fun, sometimes incredibly stressful), and you need to be personable to work here."
good,"It was a pretty standard waitressing job. Lots of lifting, carrying, taking orders. Interacting with customers and staff. Running food expediting orders."
good,"You are required to work every single holiday, no matter what. you'll be lucky to get your vacation time approved even if you put a request in 2 months in advance. the only thing they provide is an apron, you have to purchase the rest of the uniform yourself."
good,"This is a restaurant business, with expectations that people will show up on all holidays and not to expect much time off. The tips are good and there's no tip-share which is nice. Management can get very stressed and crazy if a shift isn't going well. Coworkers are the best part."
good,"Cracker barrel was my very first serving job,and overall I felt like that this company gave me the fundamentals on becoming a great server. I learned a great deal skills that I use to this day in my current serving job. "
good,Strong focus on guest service. High employee turnover. Average management team. Retail employees pushed very hard to drive sales and complete redundant daily paperwork based on a variety of sales metrics. Wide variety of employees ranging from teenage entry level to seasoned and experienced. Restaurant actually very clean and relatively efficient.
good,"I learned that hard work is OK but team work is important, along with organization and a good attitude. I can perform my job well and enjoy the other employees as well."
good,"I love my co-workers, but the management is very inconsistent to say the least. I would prefer to have more communication between managers."
good,Work here was slow and ultimately did not provide enough to keep me on-board. The culture was familial and friendly. Customers were as well.
good,Cracker Barrel was a fun environment to work in and I learned a lot especially about sales. The restaurant management just did not seem to actually care about the store side of things. Other than the management it was almost like a second family.
good,"You work very hard and the money is not that good. A lot of young teens that does not want to do their job, and they have a big turnover."
good,"Great co-workers. Great place to work. Extremely high stress. Consistent with menu, and great quality food (for the most part). I was a closer so I worked long hours with no breaks, but made decent money, so I stayed. Benefits are great, with one week paid vacation, and insurance options. Greeted guests, took drink order, brought drinks out to table, took food order, and put order into the computer system for the kitchen to start preparing the meal. Teamwork a must at Cracker Barrel, ran food and drinks to other tables, checked out fellow servers at the end of their shift, carried out closing procedures. Answered phones, took carry out orders, entered take out orders into the computer system, packaged carry out orders, etc. Excellent customer service skills at all times."
good,"The only reason I stayed at Cracker Barrel was for the flexibility.  My school and clinical schedule often changed.  I was very displeased with the compensation.  After not receiving or asking for a raise for 2 years I was denied.  And, the insurance is a joke."
good,I sat at a desk all day and had a meager amount of responsiblities. I enjoyed welcoming the patients and making them feel comfortable. I got decent hours and was compensated well for my work.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"i did not have a great experience working here, one of the manager clearly played favorites especially when i was pregnant with my now two year old"
good,I enjoy working with my co-workers. For the most part management is fair; however lately there has been lots of favoritism shown.
good,Cracker Barrel is a good start for someone before they jump into their career (I believe) or a good part-time job. I've met some genuine people during my stay and have seen how a restaurant works. At one store co-workers and managers were a blast to work with but at another store they were horrendous.
good,I loved some of my co-workers. but had to leave too to rude people in the back and bad management.
good,A typical day is full of team work and positive attitude.  A lot of times I over see and assign shift work and make sure our stations are ran smoothly.
good,"The Hagerstown Cracker Barrel is a high volume store, and as such, one can expect the days to be very busy, but to pass by very quickly. It's a challenging job, but ultimately, it doesn't feel very rewarding. Most employees, as well as managers, are an unpleasant lot. "
good,"-typical day is cashiering, to sales floor restocking, to greeting all guests, to helping the kitchen and restaurant staff as needed."
good,I have a steady customer base that allows me to have a steady income.  I have learned to adapt to a changing work environment.  Its so busy that management does not have time to interact with employees.  I have made several friends and we have a great working relationship.  It does not change much.  It can be a very fast pace place and the work can be physical.  Meeting new people is the most enjoyable part about the job.
good,I have learned that everyone mostly needs to be a team player there is some people who puts there all in the company like myself.  The managers need to be on the same page and treat the employees with respect.
good,I belive this place is great to get your started in any state.  It's flexible hours and I worked with very nice people.  On the downside you need to watch for Management as they do underhanded things to get your fired if they don't like you espeically of the races.
good,"As a first job it held a lot of value. Great teamwork, friendly environment.Each day was a new lesson. Whether it was responsibility, people orientations or work ethic."
good,"A typical day at work was on a steady pace. Not much business but enough to keep the day occupied. I learned a lot of things about the job itself such as menu knowledge, and not double seating the servers. The hardest part of the job would have to be when the rodeo is in town or when the fair comes business is very crowded and sometimes it could be overwhelming but I still kept a smile on my face and did my job with no hesitation."
good,"A typical day at work you will not stop going. I learn something new about my job everyday. You will have some customers not happy and then others will be thrilled. Hardest part about the job is the customers, and the best part is also the customers."
good,"This is a fun place to work, the managers and other employees are great. It's quite a drive to get to work though and I am not getting as many hours as I'd like."
good,I loved working here. I did everything I could to move up and make a career out of this company. I graduated college. I learned all the positions needed. I became a shift leader. I even trained others. At the end of the day they told me without experience I would never be a manager. I gave them three years and did everything they told me to get promoted. I was disheartened but I left on good terms. I still love Cracker Barrel and I would go back to be a manager today. It was a good environment and a great people first atmosphere.
good,"A typical day at Cracker Barrel for me would be walking into work and my other co workers greeting me saying hello, how are you? Sometimes I can walk into the kitchen and nothing has been done from first shift and it frustrates me that they get out without doing any of their side work, tables and their silverware that we have to do and be checked off before we can leave and receive our tips from that work day. The new servers don't want to do much so the ones who have been there the longest have been trying to motivate them so that we can get the food ran and whatever else needs to be done. Some days we are slammed some days we are slow. We have nights where everyone works together and it calls for a smooth night. I'm a friendly person and I get along with mostly everyone I work with. The hardest part of my job would probably be when i get triple sat and  trying to greet all my tables get drinks and orders that can be frustrating at times but I handle it."
good,i enjoyed meeting the public  you never know who your gonna meet or see
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"greeted guests, seated guests according to rotation chart"
good,"As manager of the retail side of Cracker Barrel, I was responsible for day to day operations. I  hired, trained and evaluated the retail and cash teams. They have an extensive training program for all levels from which I greatly benefited. I enjoyed the variety of the day in that we had both travelers and local traffic. I also enjoyed the visual challenges involved in the almost daily floor changes. The hours were long, as in most management positions, working 10 to 12 hour days. I enjoyed being a training manager and mentoring newer managers as they progressed through their first year."
good,"Liked my coworkers, they would always help me out if I did need assistance. We all worked as team players. Management I could not get much help in, seemed like they may have needed to add another supervisor or two. Over all liked the customers and the regulars and the job."
good,The most enjoyable part was interaction with all the different people who came into the retail store.
good,"I learned a few things while with this company that will last me a life time, so good some not so good. But overall a fair company to work for with great people behind the wheel."
good,I learned a lot about the company and how fast pace they are. i moved from dishwasher to prep cook. The food is great though
good,"I enjoyed helping customers, but the waitressing industry is such a hard industry to make a living."
good,"Cracker Barrel  is a family restaurant of country cooking. Management was for the most part good. The store worked well with college schedules. It was easy to pick up or swap shifts. Although it was difficult at times, it helped develop management and leadership skills. Top servers would list the daily work duties and assign them to the employees, along with training the new employees. I learned the advanced computer system they used. One must know the menu and daily specials. One learns to multitask, be able to work under pressure while keeping the customers satisfied."
good,I enjoyed the Job just not enough hours to support the family
good,Fun place to be but without customers in the store it's dull.  The management of this particular location are kind & understanding.
good,"My co workers are great! We all work really well together, management on the other hand is not so great."
good,The scheduled varied by time and day.  The customers made it worthwhile. The management worked with you when you needed off of work.  I prefer a Monday thru Friday job..
good,"Company is in a state of change."
good,This company operates just as any other corporate restaurant. Sometimes had long hours but the tips were good. Management was always helpful and friendly.
good,"Prep All Foods,Knock Out the Regular Rush,"
good,"A typical day as a grill cook is hard work. I have no problem against hard work, however the management team makes it worse. The job is fairly simple. As a grill cook, i cook and prepare the food that the customers order. Sometimes it is hectic due to the high volume store. Most the the co-workers are great, however there are some bad apples at every job. The management to is unprofessional. They do not communicate well with each other and they do not handle issues professionally."
good,Overly uptight corporate policies.  Wages are too low for the hard work expected.
good,"A typical day changes from day to day. I learned that they don't keep promises. The management is very good at times other days it sucked. The co-workers are fun people to work with,."
good,"Cracker Barrel was a fun place to work becuase of the uniqueness of the store, but there is a very high sales pressure."
good,"Waiting on guests, putting in their order, making them feel thatthey were the only people in the whole place that I was taking care of."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"A typical day at work is busy, very busy. I learned organization, staying on task, and getting things done in a timely manner. The management is ok, they could be better. My co-workers are alright. The hardest part of the job is keeping up the pace they expect you to for the amount of pay they offer."
good,Serving in a fast paced enviorment
good,"Run like a typical restaurant. They are very busy some days, not busy others. Management is a little weak."
good,cracker barrel is a fun place to work at but the managers dont know what they are doing. co-workers are fun to be around.
good,"It was good pay and you could move up quickly, but that was if the management at this particular store would actually be honest about the wages you were put in to receive and kept their word."
good,"Flexible hours, cross training oppurtunities, fun work environment"
good,"Responsible for ensuring guest satisfaction, our motto is pleasing people. Also taking and repeating back orders. Delivering hot food and cold drinks, and making sure that each guest has a great experience at Cracker Barrel."
good,"typical day was unloading truck and getting merchadise out to floor, some of my coworkers were great and others we not."
good,For the most part the management is awesome and most of the people you work with are friendly. A typical work day is pretty steady but the money you make serving is just not what it used to be anymore. After 30 days you get a discount on food and retail items.
good,"I like the guest we had and training new servers,sometimes had to pull double shifts due to poor management.Overall liked the learning expierance."
good,"I like the general manager, she has a good attitude for people."
good,"Didn't work there long due to maternity leave, but during my course of employment, it was great. But after I tried to return after my maternity leave,I didn't have a job any longer because management didn't know how to fit me back into the schedule."
good,i learned how to be a team player and how to enhance my people skills.
good,Every day is a learning experience. You learn more ways to interact with many different people from guests to co-workers. You also learn new ways to problem solve and work in a team setting. This job requires flexibility so there isn't much that is hard about it. The most enjoyable part of the job is selling people what they love and assisting them with saving money as well.
good,"It was pretty easy overall. I was only a hostess so I only got to seat people, but I met many great people in my time there. Being a hostess at somewhere like Cracker Barrel can be very busy though, and you have to be fast"
good,Everyone was so nice and helpful when doing training. The interview was fast and easy although they asked the questions they needed to in other to hire me .
good,"It's a great restaurant it has a variety of food breakfast and lunch ,they give you the option to buy their products from their store along with other things like clothing candy,and furniture"
good,"It’s crazy busy and tips aren’t very high. It wasn’t terrible though. Other employees were very friendly. Management was 50/50, half were great, half were terrible."
good,The way they treat there customers & They way they don’t treat or reward their employees in the payment way of having to do everything to theirs precise
good,It was a very fast environment to work in. It got very hot in the back while making biscuits. There was not a lot of teamwork. The only bad part about working there was having soaking wet shoes that made your feet hurt.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Not too bad, not too great. They are generally pretty decent in terms of pay, hours, etc. Not my first choice, but certainly not my last. A little simpler in all aspects of the word."
good,It was great when I first started to work and then it was fun and to stay up all night to clean the store and keep everything nice and then I got hurt when I was working there
good,I was an sales associate/cashier at Cracker Barrel I enjoyed the customer interaction and overall environment.  I however did not enjoy the management.
good,"Really want to know your menu to avoid wasting unnecessary valuable time because the final ticket prices are not very high, correlating with a lower tip as well. Get guests in and out while also providing good service!!"
good,Good place to work just the overall hours did not work to be able to support a family. but the place was clean and good order of business was good and not to hard to uderstand
good,As I was working at this job I have brought up certain concerns and a certain manager told me my job is not to ask questions and get back to work so that to me is a concern
good,"the coworkers are disrespectful and the managers demand you to do things. tips are okay, but the hours suck now. not talking down on the company just that one work environment."
good,"Working here has its ups and downs but it was enjoyable for the most part, management was organized and cared about the employees, workplace was safe and diverse."
good,"It was pretty good. The management could have been better but as far as the workers there, it was decent. Everyone pretty much got along. The scheduling could've been better as well!"
good,"After working here for 2-3 years, I recommended they hire my younger brother out of high school. He learned how to cook here very quickly, and loved it. Like me, he got a sense of satisfaction in preparing a quality product in volume with speed and precision. We enjoyed the sense of camaraderie among the kitchen staff: a ""band of brothers"" type bond. He went on to work at a much nicer BBQ restaurant just 18 months later. Now he's training under a 5-star chef, at a place for which most people go to culinary school first. Cracker Barrel was a good preparation for him, and a fun job if you don't mind getting pushed around for a couple years."
good,"There is rarely a day in which you aren't running around, trying to do more than you possibly can. The management make an attempt to assist in some aspects but are generally preoccupied with other matters."
good,"Must able to deal with people who are mostly there to enjoy the food. Overall was a great first job experience for myself, I learned a lot about working with people and working in retail."
good,People were friendly but the sheer work load was tiring. Under staffing was generally an issue on the busser and server side of the business. It definitely could have used more people
good,Just like any company there are things that people do and don't like. Training could use some work and people should treat everyone with respect in the workplace.
good,"years of being at this workplace there are some bad and some good , and managers that really care, and times will be unorganized but the guest make it worth wild to come back. I love being around people"
good,A day at crackle barrel could be calm or hectic. The kitchen was disappointing how dirty it was. I liked the people I worked with but very in professional. There was one good manager the others were rude and didn’t know how to talk to people.
good,I think they try to work around your schedule for school is very nice. But it's not a job that's good for a career. Its a job I'd recommend for college students only. If you want to financially stable then this isn't the job for that.
good,"Management is definitely the down side. They are over worked, not qualified and over all miserable  to be around.  There are exceptions but only a few."
good,My childs babysitter called to let me know my child was sick and they basically told me if I left I was fired. They do not care about the employees or their families.
good,I don't want to work there anymore because retail members are not appreciated. You would be better off working in the restaurant because then they will listen to you.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"I liked it. The holidays were awful. It was very fast paced and the hours were unteal. Always short staffed. But, the benefits and discounts were awesome."
good,Worked my way up from being a bus boy to dish washer to being a cook at Cracker Barrel. My work area was always cleaned and team work is very important during work
good,My overall experience there was good. I had a lot of fun being a waitress. You had to be on time greeting the tables and getting the food out to the guest. My co-workers were friendly and very helpful when I needed help.
good,"It was a nice place to work, but management was very poor no people skills, they treated their employees poor.didnt care about their employees or employees needs.they treat their employees unfairly."
good,"Included several opportunities for advancement was a good place to work with great benefits. Had a horrible work life balance, and overworked employees. would recommend for single people with no family or friends willing to relocate."
good,A great beginners job! If you want to get good work experience that helps you grow with you’re communication skills this would be the place to do so! Just be aware it is a restaurant job so you deal with upset customers as well as messes
good,"Our store here in Sanford, NC never kept a retail manager very long, which was both a relief and an annoyance depending on the manager. We had one manager that would rearrange the store DURING the busiest hours of the day, down talk employees, etc. We had an awesome manager after that that truly cared for us, but he didn’t stay very long. My last manager was one that cut everyone’s hours because she over hires. It’s just irritatingl."
good,Cracker Barrel was a high school job for me and they worked with my school schedule. The coworkers were great and everyone liked to joke around and have fun.
good,Cracker barrel interview process was easy. As many hours as I wanted. Worked days. Made good money. The management at Cracker Barrel saw potential in me and wanted to develop my career.
good,Basically a good company but it does depend on who your coworkers and district manager are. Communication and teamwork are hard to come by but when it occurs things go smoothly.
good,"Unloading order truck every Monday and have great Customer Skills."
good,I loved it and it was great . Great people great guests .. not  great people  and management could be better . But over all I loved the people there and
good,working in a restaurant is always stressful. Cracker barrel is not an exception. It is a good job to have if you have experience in the restaurant field but not if you don't
good,"Good place to work . Good people to work with. Not enough hours to make it worthwhile.  The store has too much stuff. Customers have no place to wait comfortably except on porch. It is terribly crowded during holidays or rush hours. There is no drive thru or  upstairs for big gatherings of family or business meetings. The atmosphere needs to be more relaxed and not so much a ""selling"" place. When I worked there there was no retail manager so we had to wing it on our own. And honestly...that worked much better!!!"
good,100 percent tips is great but the pleace isn’t what it once was. The money is there if you really want it but it can be a struggle. Old tiny place feels like home
good,"As a hostess I often worked evening dinner shifts with another host. I worked with the same person a lot and we got hired in the same week. When we worked side by side he stayed on his phone for the majority of our shifts, took long breaks, and was often rude to customers. He had told our manager that he was going to quit and he got a raise for it. After working a couple months working side by side he had gotten 2 raises and I had gotten none."
good,"I was hired as full time but only recieved part time hours. I am an adult and the only source of income, and my managers knew this but some of the minor employees still got more hours than I received."
good,Cleaning waxing etc. Taking out trash moping floors sometimes we help others when needed we break down boxes and unload trucks and load them also with products
good,A normal day at Cracker barrel is stressful. I worked in retail and there is a lot that has to be done in the short period of your shifts. Overall it's a nice place to work.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"I worked in retail and had a great manager. Most of my issues came from restaurant management. Overall good starting job, maybe not a career. I would recommend it."
good,"Working at cracker barrel was... an experience, I was barely given any hours and when i was given hours for my shifts they were really bad and it was hard for my parents to find a way to get me because of conflict with their work schedule to my work schedule. And was treated like a nusience by staff and fellow workers. The only good part was that i was seasonal and after the seasonal period i decided to leave and never take the full time position i was offered by my boss."
good,"It isn't a bad place to work for a first job. Most managers are nice and effective, other coworkers though aren't as friendly. Haven't really run into any guests as I work overnight, but they seem pleasant and polite."
good,"It was typical retail associate work, everything was fast paced and alright. I recommend someone to work there if they are looking for a steady paycheck."
good,"The managers here change way too often. I was lucky enough to have one good manager, but even they were way to harsh sometimes. The first time I ever cried at a workplace was here. I was yelled at so many times for stupid things, such as leaving the kitchen without a tray. This ""Christian"" company has no honorable values. The tips never match up to the work you have to do, and unless you're one of the ""OG"" servers, everyone ignores you and never helps you. You have to be part of the clique to fit in. To make a long story short, don't work here unless you're desperate for mediocre pay."
good,I didn't work here for very long (less than one year) but my experience was that it was fine. Just a job I had in college. It paid better than minimum wage.
good,Working there was okay but I needed more hours than I was offered so had to leave for a different job.  The job I did was enjoyable but again I could support my family very well.
good,I got fired right after I got out the mental hospital so it wasn’t my fault I got fired but I completely understand why they did they are fast pace restaurant so if you have really bad panic attacks I don’t think you should work here
good,Clock in prep food Check and see if anything needs done time went by fast because it’s a fast paced job you hop around and help who you can at the time
good,It is a great company to work for. Great training.  It will keep u busy. You definitely need to be able to multi task.  Remember there is also a retail store inside of Crackerbarrel.
good,"Fast paced work mainly around lunch, other parts of the day were slower. Training is mainly on the computer so when you are put on the floor you're left learning as you go on you own. Staff was friendly, customers were overall nice."
good,all the coworkers and team members really help to make the environment easy as a result work shifts go very smoothly. it is very comforting to know that those who work alongside you will always be willing to help
good,I like that Cracker Barrel is  quick paced and professional.  Customer service is number 1 within the company. Benefits anf future advancement is one of many benefits.
good,The job was very fast paced but it was very nice and fun to work at. I was a dishwasher and we where always continuously moving on our feet. It was hard work but we made it fun.
good,Its a friendly feel at home restaurant with great a gift shop. Love to go and smell all the different smells and see the different themes. Great gifts for all ages
good,"If you have customer service experience, this would be a great job, but if its your first job and you don’t like people, I wouldn’t suggest it. When I worked there, I only got paid 3.15 plus the tips, and on a good day, I only made 70 dollars while others made 300. It all really depends on what kind of work you like and how well you work with people."
good,"They do train pretty well for retail but often things you learn are what you learn while you're working, coworkers and guests for the most part are understanding if you make a mistake."
good,Busy restaurant with many challenges. Long hours and hard work. Great discount for employees to be used in the store or restaurant. Fast paced. Hard to staff.
good,"It was great working with the people (sometimes). The management has been improving. The customers of Cracker Barrel are usually not accepting of POC but if you can handle that, go for it! They did not pay me well for the job and barely gave me hours. The atmosphere and friends are what makes the difference."
good,Employees were treat unfairly in my opinion. Mostly when it was a managers fault we would get the short end of the stick. They also never gave many a lot of hours.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Hopefully just the location where I worked...Absolutely the filthiest kitchen I’ve ever worked in. I’m not sure how they passed their health inspection.
good,Manger will try to get u in trouble for any little thing that u do wrong and if u don't sell what they want u sell u get a wright up even if you try ur hardest
good,Cracker Barrel is an ok job. They have weekly pay and pto. The hours are crazy but a job is better than no job. There world wide so you have options to transfer
good,"The fellow employees are all great people and very fun to work with. However, management could be better. Hours are very inconsistent and the fast paced environment can be stressful."
good,This is a fast paced environment with little to no down time. I learned to get along with all kinds of people. Also that effective communication goes a long way towards avoiding misunderstandings. I learned to be self motivated. Management was inconsistent with regard to policies and practices. The hardest part of the job was the physical toll of the non-stop movement. The most enjoyable part was interacting with guests.
good,Good place to work nice people good food great service and just a great place to work managers are very nice and very reasonable I would recommend working there
good,"I don't know how accurate this is now, but at the time of my employment there was a manager that would always yell at the employees. It didn't matter if you were new or if you had been working there for 5 years, she would get onto you about something. Again this may have changed since 3 years ago, but if that is any indication of the people they hire, especially a manager, then I am glad i left."
good,"It was a good place to work at for my first job. I enjoyed working with the people I worked with , they made me feel comfortable and like I belonged. I just wasn’t getting the hours I needed."
good,"Cracker Barrel"
good,There are times where it's so slow but there are other times where it's so busy and stressful. I would recommend working there if you can handle lots of stress
good,"Typical day at work, starts off slow in the morning and around lunch time it picks up typically. A lot of servers don't like to clean tables and will leave them dirty for a while so if you get busy you typically have to clean them yourself. Management is good for the most part but should lead by example. They tend to get mad about things and aren't very professional in handling it. Everyone kinda does their own thing, they don't like to work together as a team which in the end makes the shift bad. Your coworkers for the most part do become like family, that's what i think would be the most enjoyable part, we have the ones we aren't really fond of and not everyone gets along but it is kinda like another family in a way."
good,"the store i worked at was always busy and understaffed, they pay decent and provide regular raises but you have to decide whether its worth it or not."
good,At times you could become overwhelmed with projects but once you know what to do its doesn't take you more than a hour or two. You get good hours and they work around your school or other job schedules.
good,It’s a decent job at first til you grow tired of the same setting everyday for the retail position. It’s easy to move up in the company by taking test to get more stars on apron. Get paid weekly and I believe full timer employees receive many benefits
good,"Fun and easy place to work, nice people to work with, and good customer service. Great communication skills, and you gotta make sure you put people at the right table."
good,It is pretty slow during the week. On weekends it is high paced with rude people every where. The retail manager is the best thing about the job other than that it is just average. Do not give many hours so you can not make much money
good,"It was fine working there, my coworkers were friendly, but the retail manager caused many problems for all of the staff, not just the retail side. She was rude to her employees, sometimes in front of guests."
good,Cracker Barrel wasn’t the worst but it wasn’t the best in terms of management but that could’ve been the one i worked at. They do pay fairly and I would work there again if needed
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with and the people I met. I was frustrated at times with the management bc they seemed to be poorly organized. I also didn't like that the majority of my co workers were anywhere from 16 to 19 yrs old.  Cracker Barrel as a whole is a great place  to work.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Financially strong company. Lots of moving parts and challenging because it is a store attached to a restaurant. Never a lack of traffic coming into your store as compared to the mall.
good,"It's really a great place to work at if you enjoy a business where teamwork is a major factor, you will be treated like family and will also get chances to get more money by ranking up to other positions. For example, food prep, chef, assistant manager, etc."
good,"Management is kind of poor in the restaurant side. Not all of them are kind and have bad attitudes most days. Retail managers have always been nice and understanding, but you do have to deal with restaurant side too. It’s fun and easy but people can really ruin an experience for you."
good,"In 31 years of public hospitality service, mostly foods, I have excelled in every position, some Management, that I have accepted. I have decided to move on to other areas of occupation."
good,It was overall a fun workplace but they didn’t give me many hours and When I requested more they would call me in when I was unavailable. I had heard great things but was disappointed
good,"The managers were good with working around peoples schedules. However, if people called out or did not show up, nothing happened to them. This made us short handed many days because people did not show up a lot of the time."
good,"I would say the best thing about Cracker Barrel is you really enter into a family. At my store, everyone helps everyone ( for the most part.) Management could be better simply because some managers tend to have favorites. I'm sure that's anywhere you go, though. The hardest part of the job I think cam be pleasing people honestly. When serving, you have people who come in looking for a problem, and there is no way to solve it or fix the problem. You just have to smile and serve them as you would others."
good,"A decent place to work when staffed and managed properly, which was not often enough and descended as time passed."
good,The staff are very rude unless you use your time to help them. They always expect help waiting their tables and when told otherwise they keep a nagative vibe the whole shift.
good,Family type of workplace. They help you out with any time off. Always striving to improve employees. Holidays may be mandatory to work. Management has a quick turnover.
good,Liked most the people there but managment did not follow through with requests for availability changes and pay raises were not enough for the cost of living in this area.
good,The company started to take away benefits and started focusing on the numbers more then the people.  The pressure and thing they add dopnt work for older stores and they company just keeps moving on iwth half done ideas put into action with the prorper knowlegde and training with it
good,Very busy store. Didnt like not being able to move around. Its just not for me. I worked there because I had to. I would never want to be a cashier again.
good,It’s ok i guess I mean it could be better really for those who like it an gets  beat down by the stressful doing I would say because Cracker Barrel is a nice place don’t get me wrong but it’s lack of consideration an control Cracker Barrel ways needs to be put up for debate
good,It gave me what I needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was the schedule.  I was able to learn how to work together as a team.  Management was ok to work with.
good,I still work there but the mangers are great and help with task if need. Very steady work and environment. There pay is very low compared to other in my position and not able to move up unless your are prefect and very loud. Rules have to be followed but have some room to go around. I recommend working there only if its temporary.
good,"It really wasn't that bad of a job since I was not a server. As a host, I was tasked with bringing parties to their seats. Sometimes there would be complications with how busy we were. If we were super busy then the host became the second table busser and it made you have to go at super sonic speed in order to satisfy the customer. It was a really difficult job because it's not easy to hit every customer's wants and needs but you really just have to try your best and smile along the way."
good,"* Typical day at work have to short through the menus."
good,"I get to work, clock in and immediately I have about four or five tasks that are apart of my job that normally aren't done before I get there. I have to light the lanterns, restock the menus and seat the guests as they walk in. As well as lower the lights and blinds. It'll be like this routine of seating and checking the floor for about 3-5 hours either with another host or by myself."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,This is the type of job that will run your life if you don’t get control of it. The pay is great but the quality of life sucks. It just depends on where you see station at.
good,If you work here you will need a 2nd job because you won't get 40 hours a week I've been here for 5 years and I still haven't gotten 40 hrs weekly some managers neglect and don't help most of the employees some new inexperienced employees get more hours than the more experienced ones
good,Very loud and chaotic atmosphere. Very high paced and yelled at a lot by other co workers or managers. Not a whole lot of advancement opportunities unless you like being a bully and bossing people around
good,Was a great place to work for yrs now its management is so bad the place has went down hill.they exspected  u to do other jobs without payin u more instead of hiring more people to do the job
good,"A typical day at Cracker Barrel is at from opening time in the morning from 6-9 am is busy, from 9-11 is slow paced, from 12-1 is rush hour for lunch so it is fast paced, then again, from 1-4 slow paced, and lastly fast paced from 5-8. I learned that during rush hour for lunch and dinner or supper that it is fast pace, and that everyone does not work up to a fast pace environment, some servers work at their own speed. The manager are quick to assist in time of need, at any position at Cracker Barrel and very knowledgeable too. There's not too complicated about the host position, but collecting and piecing together again the menus, and the what's enjoyable about this position is being able to interact with the guess and giving the guest maximum satisfaction."
good,Working at cracker barrel as a Dishwasher/busboy is a very stressful  job with little return. The shining light is that with time put into the company you can choose what position you would like to have and all you have to do is complete the respective training on you're own time. Before I relocated to college I had finished my training to be a server but didn't have a chance to work a server shift before I had left. Overall it's not a terrible place to work but it can be stressful on busy days.
good,They were a very good job to start serving at. I came in knowing that it was temporary but I did get attached to the employees of the company. Overall it was a very okay place to work.
good,"A typical day working at Cracker Barrel was pretty simple. I'd clock in, walk to the host podium and just get to work. Sit at the podium and wait until guests started coming to be seated."
good,The typical day was semi busy the weekends were the worst. The busiest and everyone got stressed and angry. But after it slowed down we all calmed down.
good,A typical workday was stressful but interesting. I learned organizational skills and how to work in a fast paced environment. The hardest part of the job was keeping customers happy.
good,I mainly got a job here because I was In college and needed a little bit of money for gas back and forth to school. It was a fun place to work it just wasn't long term.
good,I like that cracker barre lets children eat there.  They even give them their own menus and let them sit at the tables with the other guests.  Treated them like part of the family.
good,"-slightly stressful"
good,good days are good bad days are aweful if there was just a little more organisation i think things would turn out a lot better than what they are currently
good,"This place was okay to work at. I was a prep cook, and its fun but demanding.  It becomes too much for one person.  The inventory can be wrong and food comes in late all the time, but fun work family."
good,"I’ve been a server for the past few years while I’ve been moving., it’s given me perspective on different restaurants. Overall I like Cracker Barrel as a restaurant. They have good ideas and they try to provide a good working environment. However they fail in some important areas, I feel partly due to the location of my store and the poverty level of that location not warranting better standards. The dish washing machine is faulty and inefficient, leaving many dishes dirty. There aren’t enough dishes to accomidate the rush times. And most importantly the majority of employees get paid a minimal wage to do very fast paced, demanding work. There could be more organization in in scheduling and in management. They could educate managers in a proactive way to handle problematic situations better. There are lots of opportunities to climb the ladder, and decent benefits after years of employment."
good,"Working in the retail department was an interesting experience. You get to see a lot of different types of people and can have great interactions. The only downside for me personally was their idea of jumping down a customers throat, following then around, showing then different items that could match what they were looking at, etc. I like to be left alone when I shop and I certainly wasn't comfortable being so intruding on someone else's shopping experience."
good,"busy  very tired after  3 hrs  tips  for servers   hire   lots   of  Mexicans   one of them  yells  and I  don't speak there language"
good,It is very strenuous work. Tips are ok. pretty sad that Kentucky is the last state to bring servers up to $3.65 per hour wage. There is A LOT of competition for tables and it gets annoying.
good,Great staff and management at this location. Other locations not so much. Didn’t like where I transferred and enjoyed my time when I got to come back and work at this location again.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Cracker barrel wasn't the best job but it's perfect for a first job or just to get out there and get the experience in the work world. The pay isn't the best but if you get the hours you can make OK money.
good,The company was average.  There are things in the kitchen which could be done better.  Sometimes cleanliness was an issue with kitchen equipment which I brought to management's attention several times.
good,Working at Cracker Barrel was a good first time job but it is now the time for me to move on and find a job that is more consistent with hours and is more in my field of interest.
good,"This place mentally drove me crazy. The men here do not know how to stay in their place. They will mentally & physically abuse you. Not only that but the managers are completely rude and allow cruel things to happen , but they just laugh it off."
good,"I just want to continue improving my profession under environment IT and technology, I enjoy Cracker Barrel has been part of my career as well But I want to apply my knowledge in other campus"
good,"i was a dish wash at cracker barrel, there were to many dishes to wash, but i needed the job so i stayed there intill i found something better. just a job"
good,"""paid vacation"" is after 7 years, bad management, pressured into selling expensive merchandise, no health benefits what so ever, took a month and a half to get an employee discount, dirty break rooms"
good,Working at Cracker Barrel had it benefits. Management seemed to care about life outside of work such as school. Weekends were extremely busy and usually did not slow down until 3-4 in the afternoon.
good,I like that the job was fast-paced and organized. I learned to multi-task by seating tables bussing tables and filling customer  request as needed. I loved working as a team.
good,I'd recommend this job to anyone looking for a flexibility work place. It gets slow in the winter but is busy the rest of the year. Nice work environment.
good,"Fun environment, but the crew on any shift can make or break your day. This lack of teamwork can be taxing over time. If you are ambitious, and don't mind picking up slack, you can make decent money (sometimes upwards of 30 dollars per hour)."
good,Worked this job over 30 years ago. I think some things may have changed. So I am not sure. I remember hours were a little hard to juggle. It did help me with work ethic though.
good,"I was not happy working here, even one of their former employees said ""I'm so glad I'm not working here anymore"" during one of my shifts. I was never given a formal 15-minute break during my shift and management they became impersonal and they only focused on their retail sales and crunched numbers."
good,"My crackerbarrel experience started off nice I liked everything about working there from the discounts, to the managers, to just coming into work. As months went by management changed so many times you never knew who was a manager and who was temporary. My hours got cut I was making less than $50 a pay check. I would recommend this job to someone but be prepared for the changes."
good,While I’ve enjoyed working at Cracker Barrel I do rather not enjoy that I have not worked in the pastes two weeks because they keep hiring people when there are too many
good,"-Good opportunity to work with people"
good,Working for Cracker Barrel was beyond stressful since day one dishes were always packed to the gills and even with a machine you still couldnt wash dishes fast enough
good,Very poor management. Manager in retail is unbeileiveble rude to her employees. Coworkers act as if they’re better. GM is very very sweet. He assisted me in everything I needed with no questions asked
good,Any day you work it's gonna be busy at all times. People love coming to eat there an they bring large number of people at each table. I learn how to move in little space an work with ppl that are moving quickly. I also learned how to be nice to people even when they are being very disrespectful. it's hard but I learned that it's a time an place for everything an at work it's never the time or place to act like your not working for a business. the management is very good they were good people an always showed respect an made sure everyone was good at all times. Hardest part of the job is the paste a little mistake could leave you with alot of work.  But the good thing about it is that you will enjoy the people an the food.
good,they play with your hours and I am a high schooler and I am also in a career prep class and I have to get a min of 15 hours and they are only giving me 3 hours a week
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"I enjoy working at Cracker Barrel because I enjoy my coworkers and the customers there. The money is pretty good for a part time job, and the schedule is very flexible for students."
good,"Overall cracker barrel old country store, is a great restaurant/store. During my time working there I gained the skills of customer service and also making a public place feel at home. There wasn't much advancement but its definately a place where you can gain professional skills."
good,"serving tables, customer service, cleaning and side work duties, teamwork. not a bad place to work, they offer insurance and paid vacations. they take care of their employees."
good,Working in the restaurant business it is a very fast paced environment. you had to be quick on your feet and able to stay on a positive side of things even when the events become stressful.
good,I always talked to  everyone. I learned to be aware of my surroundings. Management was a little shaky. The culture was always changing. The hardest part was not dropping trays. The most enjoyable part was meting new people.
good,It was a nice place to work..management a little harsh..dont know if I would go back..wpuld have to be difmanagement in the building..coworkers were awesome
good,"The checks for each meal at Cracker Barrel are always low, so tips per table are low, however there is a high turnover rate. People tend to only stay 35-50 minutes here. The job culture is great, everyone is expected to work as a team. However, theres been a lot of manager issues the past year or so and it makes for messy shifts."
good,Good people BUT not worth the stress. I worked as a dishwasher and a busser and my co-workers would leave it a MESS until I got there to clean EVERYTHING UP!
good,I enjoyed working at Cracker Barrel. It was a great atmosphere to work in. The workers fun to be around. The guest were always friendly. The management was also good.
good,Working at Cracker Barrel was never boring. Sometimes stressful as the holiday time gets really busy but it was always fun. You would meet new people every day . And the experience was a great time
good,Cracker Barrel can be fun and very stressful . It’s all depends on you as a person how you can handle things . I’ve been employed with Cracker Barrel since 2014 I’ve seen employees and management go. The strongest serve. You also have to prove to management your worth keeping .
good,"My year at Cracker Barrel taught me more than I will ever be able to express in a review. However, the hierarchy of the Cracker Barrel management can put somebody at the bottom of the food change in a bad place. I made friends I will think about well into the future and Cracker Barrel provided me with so many opportunities to learn and understand the world that is the restaurant business."
good,"I hated working here. If you're a hostess, all the servers are rude and yell at you. I have had more panic attacks working here than anywhere else. They made me cry."
good,"Its my opinion that one of the best things is there flexible schedule. They work well with other obligations you may have and allow you to trade shifts with others of equal par. Good working environment, while fast-paced there's lot of help available"
good,It is a great place to work if the right managers are in place to train the workers. I enjoyed working here. I met some amazing people and customers. My life has changed for the better because of cracker barrel. I developed relationships that have outlasted the job.
good,it was nice to work their but then we got a new guy that started to get all the dishwashers hours and that is why i left they cut too many of my hours for the week out. but other than that it is not a bad place to work. if you want to work their work harder than working anywhere else because the pay is not the greatest .
good,I worked in a Cracker Barrel and I ended up getting migraines most of the time because of the stressful environment. Although it’s a good place to eat as a customer it’s not a good place to work
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Flexible hours made it easy to work around home life, allowed time for education/college, and created some room for advancement if you wished to proceed"
good,This place served great food and my co-workers were nice and polite. The interior and decoration of this restaurant resembled an old country store and even had a real fireplace.
good,Best come prepared and be ready to work hard and different hours as required. The restaurant is always packed and full of customer experiences for you to enjoy and be part of.
good,"Cuisine  American, Vegetarian Friendly, Vegan Options, Gluten Free Options"
good,"The hardest part about serving is having to do it without the right kind of help. Customers can be a pain but if you don't have the right roster in the kitchen, you will be set up for failure. Working in any restaurant is a team effort and requires uniform respect and communication throughout. Any given day could be great or terrible and much of that depends on your manager(s) and coworkers. At Cracker Barrel, it's usually a good time but like most places, the busier it is means the crazier the back of the house gets. That's when anything goes."
good,If you want a small part time job then it’s for you. Serving jobs are better than working in the retail store. Management could use work but I worked there 4 years ago so it could’ve changed
good,"Needs improvement in certain areas, but overall not a bad place. They have great benefit options after a certain time period. The most enjoyable part of the job are the co-workers"
good,"Clock-in"
good,I haven’t worked there in years but when I did the managers were not good at being involved or helping. There is too much side work at the end of your shift.
good,"It was my first job. I learned a lot about the food industry and they have great training. their staff is always so big, youre bound to make a friend."
good,managers aren't always respectful and allow some employees to do whatever they want while others pick up the slack. The store is super busy and I made good tips.
good,"While employed at the Cracker Barrel, I sharpened my customer service skills and my ability to work well in groups to accomplish goals individually and collectively."
good,This job is simple. Very simple . But you also have to be kind of quick on your feet because u will constantly have dishes coming to the wash room . So you don't want to get to far behind on the dishes.
good,given that cracker barrel was my first job it was very fast paced but also a great learning experience . they teach you every thing you need to know and more .
good,Fun place to work if you like working with the public and you can handle the stress of fast pace job. Good tips if you give good service. Great training program.
good,At first the shifts were about 4 hours and you knew exactly when you could clock out.  Then the other dishwashers quit and I would be stuck there until 12:30 at night with no break.
good,food was tasty most menu items were processed and sent packaged but cooked on premisis.  Bicuits were most liked by cusstomers because they were fresh.  Most managers were nice except for one who acted like a baby.
good,"*cooking, prepping, and serving meals"
good,I do recommend this place if you want a little extra spending money. This job is not meant to live off of unless you are in college or maybe high school.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I would recommend working at Cracker Barrel if you had the morning breakfast shift that's when they do about ninety percent of their business. But it's a decent place.
good,There really was no work life balance on the management side. 50 to 60 hours was the norm including almost every holiday.  Managers tended to wear out frequently.
good,"A typical day consisted of cooking, cleaning and prepping food for the next day. I learned to not rely on the managers at all. I would never see them unless we ran out of food for the customers or they needed me to do someone else work. The work place was very demanding and stressful because not only did you have to make sure you had enough food for your shift but you also had to do the next shifts work otherwise you would come into no prep the next day."
good,I enjoyed working at Cracker Barrel because of my coworkers and the guest I got to wait on. The tip were made on how hard you worked. I did notice that they hire Young people which can be a good thing because it gets teenagers feet in the door for the work place.
good,"I worked part-time. Flexible time was difficult, most of the team was great to work with. Management wasn't the best I've experienced, but was fair."
good,Friendly staff to work with. Gets the food out steady and correct. Helpful when you need help. Good customer satisfaction. Great sales in retail with seasonal products.
good,It was a very nice environment to come into and work at but the pay is not that good for the hours that you may work. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the toys and the children that came into the store.
good,"It paid the bills while I was in college. I met some people that I still talk to today. I wouldn't go back though. Never had any horrible times, but never any great ones either."
good,"Every day is very stressful. I learned a lot about customer service, though. The general manager is great but a couple of the assistant managers are either rude, or disorganized. Engaging with the guests and your co-workers is great and makes it worth it. If you can handle stress and pressure to be perfect, go for it."
good,It a nice work flow but I dknt like seeing workers use there bare hands to pick up raw fish then plaxlce or on grill AMD then go crack eggs worh fame hand then go take back AMD sauge same hand it nasty management need to do better
good,A typical day at cracker barrel was very fast paced with a big friendly smile. You always wanna be on top of your game for all the costumers that walk through the door and to be the best employ you can be!
good,Provided the work experience i needed to apply to grow within the company. Don't really have any thing else to say about the company i'm still learning new things everyday.
good,management wasn't very understanding and over work you. also had to do things that weren't what I applied for. I had an immediate death in my family and i still had to work my double shift also the days i said i could work were overlooked.
good,"The atmosphere in cracker Barrel is amazing! i had met so many amazing co- workers and customers in my time working there, the only problem with the job is it is not enough money to live off of."
good,They do not give enough hours despite how long you've been with the company. The work atmosphere can be stressful and mentally exhausting. They don't show appreciation to their employees.
good,It was fun but poor management. I liked the people but there was literally nothing to do almost all the time. Way too boring. You get yelled at for sitting on the job.
good,"Cracker Barrel in Fairmont, West Virginia is all about their guests. They strive to provide the best food and retail experience to all their visitors."
good,"Had a great experience but was looking for something more along my career objectives. The management was great, they provided extensive training, and had a very welcoming environment."
good,"Being a server is not for everyone. It is very fast paced and just working for tips isn't always worth the pain."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Management is not friendly. fast paced environment. server get paid off of tips. customers are mostly the elderly. competitive co worker. multi taskin
good,Working here wasn't the best .They were hiring people but couldn't give hours. Management took over 3days to respond to a call or voicemail. It seemed as if nobody was on the same page.
good,"Come in 15 minutes before closing and make sure all customers are out of the store before starting to clean. Set up all my cleaning products and clean the dinning rooms the Retail store and the Kitchen,coolers and freezers."
good,Very stressful. Management has poor system. Lack of organization. Very unbalanced energies. Payroll does not match the amount of work required. Employees treated unequally.
good,"Clock in"
good,"The size of Cracker Barrel leads to inconsistency. I had the opportunity to work at more than one and the comparison of the two what quite grand. However, Cracker Barrel cares for their costumers with compassion and speedy service."
good,"Cracker Barrel has been a good first serving job for me.  It is stressful at times, but many restaurants are.  The major stress is that the store is short staffed and has hired a lot of minors, which means they have more labor restrictions and this is a good thing for a restaurant."
good,Cool job get breaks for 30 minutes discount on food and other things works withe your schedule take classes to enhance skills at work earn stars in apron
good,Good upbeat enviromnet i loved the people i worked with but SOME of the managment was unfair and unprofessional. It was always busy and quick paced really enjoyed the culture here.
good,Serving customers as in any restaurant. Over staffed and usually only get 2 tables on busy weekends. Makes it very hard to make good tips if you have people sitting ling periods of time.
good,"I worked here as a server for many years while in college. Any restaurant job will come with its share of ups and downs, but overall I felt like this was a decent job as far as server positions go."
good,I’ve had a good experience working at Cracker Barrel. The employees are nice and willing to work and management is good at what they do. The job environment is pretty relaxed.
good,I had this as a first job. I got employee of the month within 2 months of working there. Management changed a lot and service could be poor a lot of the time. They had me working more hours than I should have been able to for my age. It was stressful.
good,Everything was upbeat and fun except for the one person I had to work with. She kept me from being able to learn all that I needed to learn and hindered my process at almost every turn. Management at the time did very little to assist.
good,"working on the display floor is fun, you get to put together displays and greet customers when they enter the store. management is different from when I worked there. trying to juggle keeping the store clean and stocked while customers come in is a bit challenging."
good,Working there was ok but sometimes they had me working to late an they would. Call me in on my days of if someone else didnt come to work an I did not like working that much
good,"this was an unneccesary waste of time. im not sure how many times i can rewrite that this is a waste of time. this isnt required for another job so why is it required here. wow, how aggravating to have to waste time doing this. must suck WASTING TIME TO DO THIS"
good,"some managers sketchy,some very nice, real hectic,had managers constantly on you,and having to hear customer,s complain about their orders,or attitude from servers."
good,If you need or want a job in a restaurant then Cracker Barrell is as good as any other. You just have to meet the fast-paced demands of the restaurant  industry.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"My experience at Cracker Barrel was very poor. I worked here during the first few months that the restaurant opened in Sanford, so I understand there are going to be hiccups in the beginning but the managers in charge made working here unbearable between yelling at employees, inappropriate relationships and lack of compassion for employees or customers."
good,Working for Cracker Barrel was very stressful at times.  The work is hard and you have to be a multitasker.  I enjoyed meeting the different guests and talking with them.
good,"Cracker barrel is a fine place to work, however its not a career job. You work in a fast paced service industry with quick turn around and changing management. Knowing that it is one of the best places to be a low end server."
good,A typical day at work with cracker barrel was sometimes very tiring and difficult but all in all I would have to say I enjoyed the 5 years I spent with the company
good,Cracker Barrel was a slow paced job but was also fun because the managers and coworkers always made our slow days go by fast. I also enjoyed having the star system it always made you want to reach better opportunities.
good,"I worked here in 9th-10th grade as my first job. I barely made enough as a hostess to pay for gas, food, etc because you were not allowed to work over 8 hours unless you were 18 or older. I quit here once I got a higher paying job. Again I worked here as a high school student."
good,Fast paced in getting guests order to the table in a timely fashion. Greeting guests with a smile and friendly attitude. Food discounts and retail discounts available
good,Working at cracker barrel can either be very fast paced or very slow and boring. we often only get two to 3 tables in our section and are tasked with rolling a ton of silverware before we can leave for the day. There is side work which is never too difficult. management is unprofessional and rude. I am often ignored when i ask certain managers for help or hit with rude comments. management doesnt care about working you hard i will be scheduled for doubles from 8 am to 10 pm and then scheduled to be back at 7 am the next day
good,"Clean dishes, kitchen, food preparation equipment, or utensils. Wash dishes, glassware, flatware, pots, or pans, using dishwashers or by hand. Maintain kitchen work areas, equipment, or utensils in clean and orderly condition."
good,Maintaining a healthy relationship with co-workers is important expecially with the servers. Working with large groups can be challenging at times. Things are old-fashion here and guests choose where they sit.
good,"Great place to work, would recommend for anyone. I liked the hours and really enjoyed the people I worked with. Time went by really fast I like the fast pace."
good,"You spend 90% of the time sopping wet and are almost constantly in a rush with every other staff member telling you they need you to hurry up. The managers rarely even take notice of the dish room and you'll often times find yourself having to make do with very limited amounts of soap or none of the equipment your meant to have."
good,Its a good place to work . I'm really looking for another job because of the fact I have children and a house hold to run and the little money I get there is just not going to get it .
good,"If you are looking for part-time positions or a first time job. CB is for you. They work with your availability. It’s a good place to learn serving, hosting, cashiering, retailing, etc."
good,pretty tough corporate environment. lots of meetings and stuff going on. good place to get started in your career but i would not stay there for ever.
good,"was a very stressful place to work, it will pay good if you put the work and time in. i would recommend to work here if you are a people person and peoples opinions dont bother you."
good,"I worked at Cracker Barrel for about a year and a half. "
good,"i asked for $12 an hour, they agreed upon it, then paid me 10.50 avoiding my salary questions"
good,Overall the company is a good company to work for.  The management can be very hard to work for.  Most of the customers will continue to return and ask for a particular server.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"It wasn't the best but it also wasn't the worst. It's if you can stand for a long time, but be prepared to do more than what your job description says"
good,"It's a hard job, but if you show that you care about it, and are willing to put in the work ethic, management will express gratitude. They have a promotional system, however it does not feel like it is taken seriously by co-workers, nor management."
good,I worked at Cracker Barrel as a secondary job for supplemental income; the management was very good about working around my schedule at my first job and allowing me to get hours as a secondary source of income.
good,"I had a prep list to Do and some times they would send the person home from the night before after i did the list and filled everything up"
good,it was fun to work at u just had to go in there with a smile if u wanted to make good tips the employees were great to work with the managment was awesome
good,"Customers are rude and managers are inconsistent. The general manager was my favorite person on the job; he was the only person with good people skills. Few hardworkers, chain of command needs help. Hardest part is coworkers not doing their jobs/poor scheduling. Best part is decent money."
good,"Have to seat customers to seats , wherever they want . Give our menu and silverwear . Servers request a lot of customers so it becomes a lot sometimes cause you can’t seat to many customers to one section."
good,"General manager is arrogant and difficult to work for but other than that everyone is very friendly and easy to work with, like a big family. Also good turn over rate and money is decent"
good,"Cracker Barrel is a complicated company, often caring more about their profits than they do their employees. It is a very stressful work environment, regardless of your position. I would recommend working here part time or temporarily, but definitely not in a long term situation."
good,on the weekend it can get real crazy in their with a lot of people coming in all at one and everybody want their food at the same time the some days its nice and easy.
good,"Although the pay and management were not the best at Cracker Barrel, the customers and tips were phenomenal. From time to time, my co-workers would come together and do excellent with team work, and other times, management got to them first and but almost everyone is a not so good mood. I heard there are all new managers now, so hopefully things are ran much better."
good,High Turnover because of the area. very stressful because all the burden can fall onto on or two peoples shoulders. then many people get treated bad and it causes them to leave.
good,They were great with working with you when you needed off or had an emergency. there was team work with most managers loved getting paid daily I worked and weekly
good,this is an ok place to work. you have to be fast pace if you want to stay working here. it could be made alittle bit more fun to work here. wages are not that great for the amount of stress.
good,"Great place to make friends and have a family feeling to the work environment. Everyone helps each other to make the customers happy. Little drama or workplace nonsense. Safe, friendly, and recommendable."
good,"The only consistency in working at cracker barrel is the customers. The management tend to be self serving and irrational and only know how to promote sales through forceful advertising and taste testing, the are not focused on the actually relationship between customer and staff. But the money and hours are consistent."
good,I started working at cracker barrel at the start of the year.It started out really good that once I was a few week some of the employees were just plain rude no respect what so ever.I tried being nice but once people cross the line Im done I go back at them.Most of the waitstaff are very friendly but some could care less.My hours started out good then weny way down bad enought that I cant pay any bills.I let the managers know that I had  bipolar depression but I guess they want me to work around that.I try to get along with people.I dont see why things have gone this way.I have worked at other restaurants and its the same thing.Im no trying to bash anyone Im just being truthful.
good,good place to work overall.  Can be stressful at times.  Decent management.  Good food; pleasent experience.  Nice casual dining atmosphere.  Many good people.
good,I was in charge of both front and back of house. having a gift shop attached next door was quite different combining retail and restaurant concepts. management and employees worked well together as well as the retail shop
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"With the new Retail manager, you never know what your supposed to do, she is all over the place with her duties for her team. She also keeps hiring and therefore the hours that were earned by the employees were having to be cut back on hours with some having one day a week. The job responsibilities are not expressed correctly leaving it a stressful environment and difficult to keep up with the everyday process."
good,working for Cracker barrel was and experience in itself. Long hours and a ability to grow. Management needed better appreciation for workers work culture was ok
good,Being a server just know that you make money off tips. Servers also perform more task than any other position help at Cracker Barrel for the least pay.
good,It was a decent place to work.  The pay could have been better.  The benefits was alright but the working conditions and management could have been better.
good,I enjoyed my job at cracker barrel most days however there was days that could be very stressful. Some managers would have a very bad attitude at times yelling and cussing. Lots of busy days where you would get in trouble for taking even a five minute break no matter how many hours you worked. Always expected to work over regardless of circumstances.
good,"If the management is poor so will the workplace be , it was just a close job near home that's walking distance. Maybe if they improvement management maybe it'll be a less difficult place to work to in."
good,I enjoyed the job. I learned a lot about organization and the retail requirements. I found it difficult to adjust but eventually caught on. The management could have been better but the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to put a smile on the faces of the customers.
good,I made many many good friends working at Cracker Barrel. The job itself was easy enough if you can keep up with the fast paced. The management was alright if you stay off their radar and do your job well.
good,"While management was the absolute saving grace in holding a position for a year and a half, working at cracker barrel was not enjoyable. The guests make working here even harder because after 5 minutes of not receiving their meal they would complain that the service is slow. Customers have knowledge of a kitchen rule at cracker barrel in which no ticket should go over 9 minutes before it is finished and served. Peak times are busy like they should be but every other time isn't. There are good and bad shifts to be given out and experience is prioritized when given these good or bad shifts thankfully."
good,Come in to relieve the morning shift and pick up where they left off. Greet guests with a smile and proper manor and ensure that we care about their wants and needs.
good,fast paced. all the time. you have to costomers who drive you crazy and other who are as sweet as pie. discount is good for holiday times and birthdays.
good,"The environment is very sound due to providing excellent guest service being the top priority in the company. The managers did they're job, but did not care for they're employees well being. The benefits are amazing, but it takes years to gain such privileges."
good,"very demanding but rewarding.  very challenging, but team spirit can be quickly damaged by poor leadership.  benefits were available but very expensive health insurance"
good,"I wouldn't work there again unless I had to. The pay was decent, but the work was ridiculous. There were a lot of double standards, which is not okay."
good,Hardest part of job unless you have a good memory was remembering all the recipes and times in which to cook everything.  Also all the proper temperatures.
good,"very long hours, the pay is not that great, bonus structures continue to decrease. no room for advancement, they've earned all of their bad reputation"
good,I had a very bad experience  with My direct sales manger. Treated poorly will be happy to explain in person. The company does not need to suffer due to one person like I said I loved the job part of my job.
good,"The management is not the best. A few of them are, but others not. The money is good for the most part, you have your good days and your bad days. The environment of people you work around is good. All of your co-workers are friendly and helpful for the most part. A good job for someone just starting out."
good,Cracker Barrel was a decent place to work at. They were very strict and set a schedule for you. It was hard to have time off. You had no benefits as a part-time worker.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,You have racist guests and some managers are mean and some employees don't know their place it's very stressful  and  not the job for a person who has panic attacks
good,Worked there for about a year. Decent pay and somewhat okay hours. Most of the managers are very kind and understanding but there have been a few in which they only care for business and not the workers.
good,It’s great company but I feel like it could be a bit more organized if they chose to listen to the employees overall it’s great company to work for I’ve been there 3 years
good,Very stressful for the pay. I learned a lot from Cracker Barrel. I learned customer service and how to properly host. I also trained other hostess and host.
good,I worked as a retail associate in the front store area. I received only 3-6 hours of work every week I was there. the manager hired too many people and didn't want to fire anyone either.
good,"Guest friendly environment"
good,Typical day at work. Cooking homemade recipes. Hardest part is making chicken and dumplings. Most enjoyable part is learning new things and working with people who enjoy there job.
good,Cracker barrel is a fun fast-food paced job. The employees are friendly and the customers are great. Not to mention the food is delicious. There are many roles to fill at cracker barrel but luckily everyone works as a team so your not overwhelmed.
good,"Waitresses were crabby about the tables being cleaned fast enough, the dishwasher would constantly breakdown.  Management would at least come and help when the restaurant would get busy."
good,Team oriented clean friendly environment. The managers were very good at maintaining a great place to work. I enjoyed everyday I worked there. Everybody helps one another.
good,Out of all the jobs I have had this was the most unorganized and unprofessional jobs I have had. The management was horrible and very unprofessional..
good,"Overall, this is a well organized company.  However, the people in the management at this location preferred to hire family and friends which left me with little hours and getting sent home on many shifts.  The company, however, is a good one and solid."
good,I will say that me working at cracker barrel is an awesome job but as for me working there as a trainer dishwasher just too low of hr rate cause of the economy situation is on a high.Trying to raise a family wife and 17yr old as well plus starting a kid soon I hope just trying to pay bills lkike everyone else is. Its just har sometimes cause dont get the pay that u need top do anything with. Under paid!!
good,"Good company to work for very flexible hours managers are decent and the pay is great also. Double shifts are no fun, you have to actually work all fourty hours in a week to get great checks"
good,Employees are overworked and underpaid. Bathrooms are dirty and management is inconsiderate of guest needs. The lines are always long and most of the time they run out of food without letting the customers know that what they ordered will never make it to the table.
good,"I worked hard, really wasn't appreciated. Immediate manager was over working me when he was able and talked down to me almost yelling at me. No courtesy or respect for other employees."
good,I enjoyed the people that I met while I was there. Being a grill cook gave me some insight into the restaurant franchise side of the business. There were just certain management things that I couldn't agree with.
good,It just a simple job moving big boxes and unloading trucks full of merchandise. I didn't really care for it all. The only thing is that you had a discount on all the products.
good,It’s a good company to work for. as Long as you do you job to the essential job functions you will preform well. We do have on the job training to insure that you are trained for your position
good,The environment was very face paced and you have to make sure you're comfortable talking to people. Overall it was a good experience and helped to improve my communication skills as well as being comfortable in situations that require you to be on your A-game and stay focused.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,A typical day at work would be very stressful and busy. Employees rarely did their jobs and customers were sometimes unhappy. I learned to greet and be polite and the hardest part of my job was dealing with rude and unhappy customers.
good,"really busy so money can be good, but grill line struggles which makes guests upset."
good,A typical shift consists of greeting & assisting guests on the retail sales floor. Operating the cash register system which is computerized. Answering incoming calls.
good,I was a high school student working after school for holidays.  I enjoyed the interaction with the customers and helping on retail displays.  I loved decorating and being creative
good,"Many of the people who came through the doors tended to be very nice, occasionally their were those who were hard to deal with, but you just smile and bear with it. The employees were very nice, remembering certain customers that came in more often and knowing the things they liked. It's fast paced, hundreds of people coming in daily, long waits for dinner and lunch hours."
good,"The people are generally nice and managers are fair. That being said, often times bad employees are given more advantages just to keep them from causing trouble."
good,This company was extremely flexible with my changing school schedule and worked with me as I completed my degree. It is a very fast paced work environment that provides you with great time management skills. At times the management is more worried about their labor then running the business but at other times they are extremely helpful and caring for their employees. It was understaffed at times and peak times were the hardest when we would run out of food. The most enjoyable part was when the guest appreciated the work you had to do to make their experience great.
good,"Very fast pace,busy enviroment,a lot of customers. Always nice to customers and staff. Friendly work area. Work a very long time with no break or did not get break. Being out in the public."
good,I enjoyed my time working at Cracker Barrel. Work was easy. Employees and managers were friendly and helpful.I would gladly work at Cracker Barrel again.
good,"Overall, I've been working at Cracker Barrel for almost 2 years. A typical day at work is a breeze. But, on the weekends it gets very hectic. Every employee and manager is running around like a chicken with his/her head cut off. During my experience at Cracker Barrel, I've learned to always be prepared for what's coming your way."
good,It’s not a bad job to consider. You make between 50-100 per day on average. Managers are really nice and want you to achieve your goals at work. Winters hours slow down.
good,"Job can be very stressful. Lots of busy and you will burn out fast. Feel like they could have paid me better, but they didn't. Definitely not friendly flexible hours!"
good,Great for socializing and making quick money.  It does offer good discount on meals and merchandise.   Just more for a young energetic person.  But there are advancement opportunities
good,"Job was not terrible, just very unreliable pay. Lunch breaks are non existent even when working a double shift. It was nearly impossible to be able to eat."
good,"It was a complicated job at first but when you got to learn it it got easier. You stocked merchandise and organized the store, you helped guest with items and things like that."
good,"Management did not care about the employees. They only cared about the money. They will follow breast feeding and pumping guidelines. However, they make it known that it is a disturbance and inconvenient. This establishment has also lied to their employees as well as played favoritism within the work place."
good,"Cracker Barrel is a great place to work if you don't want to advance..I was never allowed to cross train to any other departments..The insurance is VERY affordable.."
good,The job was fast paced and included a lot of customer service expertise and on the job learning as well as online exercises. The job itself included greeting and seating guest and planning seating arrangements.
good,Cracker Barrel is avery fast paced company. I enjoyed that about it. I didn't like living off of tips. I want more of set hours and a set amount that I will be making.
good,"employees care about each other"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Cracker Barrel was okay for what it was worth. I usually worked the night shift, so I dealt with a lot of younger people. Some were good workers, some were not. I will say that once it was time for people to be cut, they would get lazy and not assist those left on the floor. I enjoyed my co-workers as people, but not so much as workers."
good,"I don't get enough hours to make anything off of. Some of the co-workers are too competitive with other coworkers. Also, the management treats their employees differently than others."
good,on a daily basis you needed to manage the call outs. You constantly worked hourly positions. The employees had so much leverage it was difficult to manage day to day operations
good,Working at Cracker Barrel was fun but the biggest issue I had with it was that I never knew how much money I would bring home for that shift. It all depended on tips and I needed a more stable income.
good,Overall this was a great job. As with any job there will be ups and downs. Somedays the environment  was stressful and others it was extremely relaxed. The harder you work and over time you will be rewarded.
good,The general manager we had was awful. Literally awful. The rest of the job wasnt so bad. I never liked eating there as a kid so it wasnt ruined for me like a lot of my coworkers
good,"My experience with the cracker barrel I worked at was not the best. I was there for a year and barely worked 8 hours a week and when i asked to cross train to be a server, They said they would let me so it ""soon"" but soon never showed up."
good,"Everyday was Different. It has it up and downs Quick paced place with a low pay but tips make up for it. Nice people, Holidays were amazing. Management listens very well"
good,This was a fun and fast paced place to work.  The challenge of running a restaurant and store at the same time was fun and new for me. As a manager it challenged me.
good,"helping customers"
good,"Good for a second job. A good job for teenagers or someone not looking for a lot of hours. The staff is pretty cool and helpful, There is usually no conflicts."
good,"Some people I worked with honestly enjoyed their job. However, I could not see myself there for longer than a few months. It's just a very boring place."
good,Its a good place for money mangement is horrible they do not care about there workers. Do not let them believe its a tem friendly atmosphere because it is not
good,"Not a bad place to work a little uptight but still not bad, it was my first job out of high school so i kinda sucked and didnt really like working so my fault not theirs"
good,I love working for Cracker Barrel company itself. It's a wonderful company to work for especially when for long term employees. I love that you can move up in the company the only thing that I have a problem with is the management of the store I'm currently working for.
good,Great environment to work in! But the management were rude and very disrespectful! I loved all the customers and the atmosphere. I would have worked there a long time if the manger wasn't so mean!
good,"You love talking to people. In fact, you excel at initiating contact, engaging them in conversation and communicating in a friendly, professional manner. Naturally, you take great pride in doing your best, whether it's pricing and stocking sales items, setting up a display, maintaining order and cleanliness, or simply talking to guests about various store items."
good,"I met and married my wife at cracker barrel."
good,Great work environment with friendly staff and management. Work was fun and easy to come to every day. Great staff and room for growth and career advancement.
good,the job was decent and the tips were good if you knew what you were doing. customer services skills are a must if you plan on being a waiter/server at any restaurant.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,This was a great place to work. It was filled with many opportunities for advancement and great benefits. I would consider going back to the company in the future.
good,"Cracker Barrel was not my favorite restaurant to work in but I had a great time with the people I worked with. Elderly people don't seem to understand the concept that servers make $2.13/hr so tips are smaller because of bill sizes. If you can turn tables quickly and you enjoy working the hours that you choose, then you would love it here."
good,"The hardest parts of the job for me is thinking quick on my feet, being flexible with the changing atmosphere of the environment, working well with difficult personalities, being a member of a team with spotty teamwork capabilities."
good,It's a good job if you get a decent amount of pay depending on what area you work in. But the stress cause by the actual demand of the job and by the other people that you work with could make you break
good,"Very busy environment, working in various depts. loved dealing with patients, very diverse. Loved the atmosphere, a lot of team work everyone works together and communicate"
good,I worked here seasonally and it was an ok seasonal job but it would have been better if they paid more attention to what was going on in the shop. They didn't train their people very well and didn't pay well at all. I never got a break for lunch and they said if I worked more then I would get a discount on lunch and on merchandise.
good,"I loved working at cracker barrel is was very fun at times. My only issues were management. Management kind of treated their employees unfairly The workplace culture was very diverse, but was very enjoyable due to the different cultural groups and personalities, but overall a wonderful place to work."
good,"A well run, busy, fast paced environment. Excellent training and instruction provided. Long hours on your feet. Steady, flexible, reliable hours and income."
good,"Not the greatest place to work because business has been slow for awhile. Management is okay, but some can't wait for you to screw up so they have a valid reason to be on your case. The customers and co-workers are great, very nice people."
good,Not a good paying job I want to make money and this job only gives me like 10 hours a week and I wanna work more and not be cut hours  the half off meals are okay but only if you get a break and you can't leave there.
good,Your day as a line cook starts with the station. You go to your station and cook to order. You will cook all types of food. The managers are fair and are excellent cooks.
good,Management is not good there. Managers yell and are mean to their servers. Coporate was called on them at least 4 times since I'be been there. They play favorites and treat them better.
good,"Good money but over worked and unappreciated. They expect much of you but dont expect much from them. When dealing with their corporate office good luck as well, in their eyes the managers are never wrong and employees are recyclable"
good,It was great job for learning how to serve. The management team did really well molding young inexperienced individuals into fast paced yet calm and collective workers.
good,"they have great training to make sure all the employees are on the same page, i trained for about 2 weeks and it was great because i knew a lot about the register and food."
good,"not to hard just doing the same stuff, the hardest part of the job to me was working on the weekends the management is cool and the employees there are friendly to"
good,I can say when i worked at this store I had a great general manager and I was gracious to get this job and learned about customer service and how it works in the restaurant industry
good,"The job is very simple, just so long as you know the menu, and are quick to get your orders in. The management and team were extremely helpful. The hardest part of the job was managing your time to get your tables, side-work and rolling silverware done on time, during busy times. My favorite part about the job was knowing that if I ever had any questions, I could always count on my co-workers."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Worked as a server. offers excellent training. flexible with schedule, benefits are good.Employee discount is applicable to gift shop items. rooms for advancement."
good,"This job was pretty good for the most part. I had a very strong position, and the hours were relatively stable. The bad part was that I felt like the managers didn't do all that they were hired for, and pushed a lot of the responsibility onto one of the few reliable lesser employees."
good,A great company to the work for in the aspect that they care for not only their customers but you as an employee as well. The only downfall is the the maximum amount of hours that they schedule any given individual on a weekly basis is shockingly low.
good,Cracker Barrel was a great company to work for until the economy went through a slight depression in 2008.  This forced management to not be managers but work position like there employees to keep cost low in labor.
good,You dont make the money you deserve after all your hard work and they are not good at scheduling. All in all I think it would be a good place for someone who has more time to work full time rather than part time.
good,"It's quite a monotonous yet stressful job, however the management and co-workers are very nice for the most part. It's nice that you're always busy, however, too much is often expected from the cooks."
good,Field staff members are overworked and have outrageous expectations placed on them...it wasn't always like that at cracker barrel.  The new executives have no interest in the quality of life of their field staff members.
good,Too many servers on the floor. People don't tip enough these days and servers mostly had two table sections and people that may sit at the table for an hour and only leave two dollar tip which made for a terrible nights pay
good,Cracker Barrel Old Country Store had many instances were service was damaged by  lack of communication and manger intervention. Many problems that had risen over my employment was due to a lack of management communication
good,"The food and employee discounts are great. The room for advancement is not a wide as they tell you in their mandatory videos during hiring. Managers are treated far better than the hourly employees that help them earn their bonuses. Waitress only get a couple tables a piece but could handle more, an in turn, make more money with less staff."
good,"Cracker Barrel overall is not too bad. It's definitely not a dream job but it has its perks. It also comes with its cons too. At times, I feel like some of the major rules are overlooked, like when it comes to breaks. I also think that the my specific job, a retail associate, has too much to take care of for being paid only $8.50 an hour. I cashier, clean bathrooms, stock the store, clean the store, have to move various large items through the store, answer the phones, and so on. But overall, I am glad I work there. It's definitely more of a good job than a bad one."
good,"Great place for employees, but if in a management position, it is very demanding and managers have little control over employees. Manager work 10 plus hours a day and are very hands on. Then required to complete administration duties after cooking for most of the shift"
good,This was a very family-friendly place to work they provided lots of family activities and family discounts management was very fair-minded and look out for these staff
good,I really love the people that I work with . Its NEVER a dull moment with them.  They someone on your shift will make your smile or make your day no matter what kind of mood you are in.
good,There is always something to do so you stay very busy which make the time go by fast. It gets hectic in the kitchen at rushes though so you have to take a deep breath and take nothing personally
good,This particular store had some serious management issues at the time. Lots of favoritism. Getting raises or promotion within their promotion system was a pain in the butt. Not enough hours given to make it worth coming in for really.
good,"overall an ok workplace, A typical workday is not very long, Hours vary and can range from long to very short. There are a lot of goog co-workers, but management could be better."
good,"A decent place to work, if you are ok with inconsistant hours, no benefits, and working weekends.  Great for a person with no family or a college student.  A very fast paced work environment."
good,"the cracker barrel that i worked at was highly stressful and the managers were all passive aggressive. However, the other employees made working there more bearable."
good,"Liked working there, felt under paid, could use better managers, learned how to grill and dip out items in a timely manner, learned the basics of a restaurant"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,The managers was not reliable but the hours was good during the season of traveling.  Guest loved having nice and caring people to make sure they are taken care of.
good,If your not a fast learner and quick on your feet then this job isn't for you. Some of the people that work for this company are amazing and others are just there for money and could careless about you as a person.
good,"A day at work began with cleaning the dish tank, changing the soap and cleaner for the dish tank, cleaning the dish tank out, washing dishes so that the food and can out to the customers."
good,They make you feel like family everyday at work. Yet they cut your hours and days randomly. They all of a sudden they will give you more again. They are not constant about hours. When you tell them you need more they act like there listening but there not.
good,"Open/mid/close shifts, handle cash, production charts, food safety walks, managing front of house, back of house, guiding employees, helping in retail store, ordering, interviewing, hiring, training, open and closing of the building."
good,I liked working there. It was one of my favorite jobs I had. The co-workers were nice and easy to work with. The reason I left was because I moved and didn't have transportation.
good,"Come in and find out section working in. Check the tables to see if they need restock for customers. Receive order and place to kitchen, deliver food, check to see if customer is satisfied with meal. Clean section and side work when done."
good,I stayed at the cash register greeting the incoming guests. I also took phone calls and answered the questions the customers had. After the customer had their meal I asked them about it and took their method of payment.
good,this restaurant is 100% quality first.  It is extremely hard to be a manager there because the standards are so high.  The upper management is always concerned about there product as well as there bottom line.  This is a restaurant that believes in people first.
good,"i really olove this job it just didnt pay enough for me to make my bills, but for someone looking for a part time job its a great fit. wish it payed better and offered more hours"
good,Work there if u want. Most managers are ok to work for. Pay is ok. Sometimes not worth it. But for the most part. The job is ok. Pay weekly which is good.
good,This company was ran really well by the managers. I was a college student working here and they worked around my schedule on a weekly basis. The food was also good.
good,"I worked often with the handling and exchanging of money. I also welcomed and greeted people into my cashier lane as I scanned and bagged their items. In addition to my cashier duties, I had the responsibility to sell additional items near my register."
good,if your a dishwasher its hard dirty so if you don't like getting your hands dirty the job is not for you a lot of un eaten food trash is what you have to deal with and you have to work fast and not get caught up.
good,"Can take a lot of mental stamina.  Are expected to come in if called.  Great benefits.  However, doesn't do well showing the appreciation of the employees.  The culture is somewhat welcoming."
good,"A typical day at work for a cashier was ringing up customer purchases. Management was ok, some were good and some were not so good. Cracker Barrel was fast paced sometimes and other times, it was slow. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers."
good,"I would escort patrons to their seats,  tell them the feature of the day, help other team players when they need it.  Keep work station clean and organized."
good,Great place for familys to eat for a good price. Always hot cooked food. Ive always kept myself busy with guest. All guest come first to the company an the workers.
good,"busy not stop once you clock on "
good,They made sure you got the hours you desired and more if wanted. They had vacation benefits and worked with they employees and any needs they brought to company. Always friendly
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Workplace culture is not as diverse. However I did enjoy working here but there was too much racism towards me and i couldn't deal with all of it. Managers have lots of favorites, and do not stand up for their employees."
good,"Okay for first time job, got really tired of depending on tips to feed my family. Hours can be flexible , CO workers are alright sometimes.  It just depends on location in guess"
good,I learned that cracker barrel may issues with health violation. People have heard or seen in the news which went viral in Hillsborough county. Most employer thinks that cracker barrel would run out of business.
good,Cracker barrel was decent but found myself juggled around management too much to the point where it was difficult to get a clear vision of exactly what was happening
good,"A reasonable work environment. The servers, cooks, back-up cooks and prep cooks all make sure you day is nice. Management isn't so friendly. They butter you up with a smile and a ""How's your day going,"" type of question. If you become a dishwasher be prepared to receive absolutely no help from them and expect to be ignored."
good,Not worth the time I spent there to be in management.  There was always something wrong.  The mtg had horrible attitudes toward the workers.
good,Fun and friendly staff. Freedom of time. Convenience of hours. Dealing with many different people day in and day out was rewarding and challenging at the same time.
good,"this job is high volume,fast paced and demanding. they have a leveling system that I didn't think was fair....but it did work for some."
good,"Flexible schedule. Training is easy and fair. Great way to introduce anyone into the world of serving/restaurants. Experience and work environment was different at each store, but always high paced. Small sections."
good,I've learned what and how I wanted to be treated when out at a restaurant. I think my hardest part of the job was the unsteady pay and hours. Great experience.
good,good atomosphere fun place to work the  customers an other friendly server make it a blast .. the managers are very help an nice
good,The day at work was exhausting and it was always a rush. But I soon learned to adapt to it and the job became much easier. The people were friendly but was super needy. The hardest part of the job is every one asking you to clean their mess and trying to take advantage of you. But I enjoyed the tips I received when I did my job well.
good,Good place to work. Learned general cooking skills. Plenty of hours available. Meet a lot of different people and was able to network into my position that I stayed at for 2 years.
good,Helped me work on my people skills! I loved getting to greet every customer as they came in. The people I worked with were very nice and welcomed me immediately.
good,Cracker Barrel is a good company and very  strong  financially. Decent Management structure and room for advancement. Strong Home office communication.
good,"Very fast faced and stressful workplace. It can be nice when you make friends but until you've been there over 6 months the management won't care about you. Nice place to make decent money with plenty of hours, always hiring, but prepared to get yelled at."
good,"New owners, trying to learn business and develop relationships with customers, vendors and employees. New owners trying to do a lot themselves."
good,"i pent 2 years at cracker barrel. I did dishwasher prep cook and back up cook. thanksgiving and Christmas they close early so i was usually off by 5. We got paid weekly. My issues were there was no team work within departments, dishwasher against servers, line cooks against back-up cooks. If the servers broke a glass they would just throw it in a buss tub and not say anything, I have a few scars on my hands from that."
good,It was an overall enjoyable experience. The food is good and the people are friendly. Work is always organized and they keep customers satisfied.
good,"Clean, Loving Coworkers, and supervisors, everyday customers sometimes, great music, Great food , good discounts, nice employees, good sales, and etc."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Good work environment. Bad management. Long and stressful weekend hours. Pay is hit or miss and no paycheck. The guests are very generous and heart warming most of the time.
good,"Usually any day I  worked, we were late getting put on the floor, the managers would wait for someone else to step up instead of just doing something when it needed to be done. We were always out of some type of food."
good,"Fast paced environment, gained knowledge in hospitality and customer service. Management team is very professional. Co-workers are okay some are petty while others are willing to help."
good,"Overall, its a good team player workplace, but the management needs some help. We are always running out of products, or out of our special sometimes before 5pm! Instead of spreading hours out for all employees in the winter time, they cut everyone down to 10-15 hours a week, and continue to hire more servers!"
good,"Great place just wasnt for me. Managment  needs some work."
good,"busy. but not bad"
good,"cooking cleaning, learned serv safe, co workers were great management not so much, it was a fun enviroment and i love to cook, lots of long hours opening and closing shifts"
good,"Very nice establishment, All the employees are very freindly. My only concern or disliking of the job was that I was told it was full time but only worked 2-3 days out of the week"
good,it was my first time for being a server and it was the worst job. they didnt give me time to learn they rushed me and i would get in trouble for things that i knew nothing about.
good,"great company to work for . many different job opportunities , each location has their own special way but all seem to follow the cracker barrel brand"
good,"This job is really dependent upon if you enjoy retail and the restaurant life.  You were given more hours if they thought you were good and if you weren't, your hours were cut.  The online courses were super annoying though.  It was like going to school all over again, but you had to do that if you wanted to get a raise.  Just to secure the job, there were courses that, depending on how you broke up your time, it could take you a week or eight hours in a day, like me."
good,"Work was easy, management did not have your back and did not care to keep you. It was very difficult to keep or train a team member when they where either fired or quit."
good,"Very good company to work for, usually very busy. Advancement is a bit hard because of the systems they use to gauge your readiness for advancement..."
good,"Fun and fast paced working environment and family oriented co-workers tend to work together and assist one another , work schedule works for college students and promotionsare made in company"
good,"Great place to work at, great atmosphere, and management is great. You can expect team work out of all the employees. hardest part of the job that it is fast paced."
good,The management expects employees to go above and beyond their job description. Rush hours are productive. Coworkers are fun.
good,"Cracker Barrel was a fun place to work. I definitely enjoyed my time there. Working dinner rush was awesome, my co-works were very helpful and the families i met was friendly."
good,It was a very high volume resturaunt. made me learn to move quickly and effectively while still maintaining a positive attitude. I learned also how to buss tables.
good,its was a good job but stressful and haves its ups and downs but wouldn't work as a long time job. good part time job. the people are okay but rush hour could be overwhelming could make u quit
good,"Family setting, serving fast food fast, keeping customers happy. Hardest part in my opinion is have to constantly carry food tray that weighs 25lbs above your head so that you do not run into children"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Cracker barrel is organized by guide lines to insure everything is maintained and consistent which makes working easier as the days go by and eventually becomes routine. Working environment is average while my personal opinion with scheduling is based on favorites and not performance like it's supposed to be.
good,Saturday and Sunday are normally really busy. Monday- Thursday do not get busy until 12pm. Co-workers attend to be grumpy but only when busy.
good,"a typical day at work for me depends on the amount of people that come in that lets me know how busy it will get "
good,"It had it's up and downs. The Management was disorganized most of the time. They would immediately help out the kitchen, but would never help out the wait staff. My fellow servers were great to work with, and the food was pretty good. I really didn't learn anything that I hadn't already learned from previous experience. The hardest part of the job was having to make your own salads (side salads, and entree salads), answer the phones, and take care of your own tables while helping out your fellow co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my fellow co-workers."
good,"On a day to day basis, you never know the amount of money you will make. They aren't very considerate and tend to pick favorites. Good for anyone starting out in the food service industry though!"
good,"Mostly I was responsible to wash dishes.  Occasionally, I was required to bust tables and clean the bathroom and dining sections of the building.  "
good,"A typical day at work was very busy, but fun, being able to deal with many different people on different levels. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to serve people and give someone joy just by smiling and being friendly."
good,The food industry for me was relatively new. I had chosen it shortly after relocating to NWA. I have really enjoyed meeting new people on a daily basis. Have gained much knowledge on the hard work it takes to maintain. For me the hardest part of the job is no matter how hard you try you really cant always please everyone. But I have established many dedicated customers that come in weekly and always asked for my station.
good,Hostess job was fun and interesting. Very busy on weekends. Greeted and sat guests. Coworkers were pleasant to work with as well as management. I had to memorize table numbers.
good,Good management and pleasant coworkers. Good place to work. Cons are at times over staffed and at times short staffed. Pros are shifts are easy to pick up and management works well with availability.
good,"I am a hard worker, people person, enthusiastic, positive mind, helpful, willing to work extra hours, etc."
good,"A typical day at work is very busy and demanding, depending on your job role.I definitely learned better communications skills. Although the management could be better, my co-workers are great to work with."
good,"Cracker Barrel is a combination of both dining and shopping.  My work experience is with the retail/shopping.  I have received computer training along with personal guidance which has given me a great deal of quality knowledge in retail operations and customer service.  My Manager is Top-Notch and I enjoy being one of her valued employees.  My co-workers are carefully chosen to ensure that Cracker Barrel will be able to deliver a consistent and a pleasurable experience to its Guests.  The hardest part of this job is interacting with the operations in the restaurant.  This store particularly has had a difficult time maintaining restaurant managers and it has put strain on the employee experience overall.  The most enjoyable part of my job is our Guests, the merchandise we offer, and all the ""behind the scene"" work I play a part in."
good,The company had southern values when I worked there.  The food was comfort food.  Was an average job.  The hours were good if you are an early morning person.
good,working at cracker barrel was very exciting. cracker barrel is a fast pace work enviornment. very challenging but it was really fun.
good,"Greet guest"
good,Cracker Barrel is an ideal place to work for anyone wanting to take a step from fast food to casual dining. It's very fast paced and you can learn a lot about timing.
good,This company allows for employment potential with both retail and/or server experience so its great for students or adults looking for supplementary income.
good,"I have only worked for the company for about 7 months and so far its been okay.  The management team is very helpful, they are like coworkers because when the going gets tough they jump right in with a smile. The entire staff work as a team so we are usually a well oiled machine. I have learned how to get in where I fit in so to speak because when working in a fast paced environment like that you cant always wait in line for what you want. The hardest part of the job is trying to leave because of the silverware rolling process. The most enjoyable part is counting your money at the end of the shift."
good,It was an ok place to work and it was kind of cool but it was not that fun. I would like rather work at like target but cracker barrel is kind of cool.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I have no complaints with cracker barrel. It was a pretty good job. Being a cashier was easy.I am writing this because this computer is making me do it. I actually want to go back to cracker barrel
good,"great place for a college student to work "
good,"i enjoyed this job it made me realize that i love working in the restaurant industry. the days here were never the same, but overall i really enjoyed it,"
good,"As an employee at Cracker Barrel it was just like any typical job. The work place was very relaxed, management was not as good as it should have been. The most enjoyable part of work would be getting to meet new people everyday."
good,Cracker Barrel does not pay according to skill set everyone starts at a set pay and it takes forever to get raises and move up within the company.
good,"I love working at cracker barrel, it is a fun and loving place with lots of great workers. The management is fun and stern, a great mix in a country restaurant."
good,"Rules and regulations are ridiculous. You are typically abused verbally by the guests. However, I learned great retail and cash handling practices. The knowledge I learned was exemplary vs. the environment."
good,its a good job and also a friendly environment to be around. The customers are awesome and the employees are hard workers and really friendly
good,"I most cleaned and sat guests. I would also try to help sell certrain products, and get guests drinks. Not much to it, was just an easy job for school"
good,people that work there are good for the most part.  the managers kept in contact with all employees and at times it was fun to work there. dish room can be very messy at times.
good,I loved working for the company. Each day was new and exciting. I loved working with the various customers and my co workers.
good,"I worked in the retail in the store part, and helped customers and did stock work. The job over all was not difficult and it was nice getting to meet new people."
good,Job wasn't the best but I needed a part job as I was still in high school. It was the best I could find at the time in High School.
good,"I enjoyed working here quite a bit because of the advancement opportunities, however I occasional felt under appreciated due to the lack of sensitivity of my health. I enjoyed coming into work and having the option of choosing which position to work in sometimes however it was not fun when I had to work several positions in one shift because of the lack of employees. This was the first official restaurant I worked at therefore I learned a good amount of how the restaurant industry works. Such as food cost, better customer service techniques and also how to manage a fast pace environment in a calm and cool manor. The management team was very interested in advancing people however were sometimes so caught up in one project they forgot the employees who they were managing therefore we were occasionally made to work with no break on 14 hour shifts. My co-workers were extremely enjoyable to work with. However the hardest part was being able to make decent money as a regular employee. I did enjoy the opportunities to learn other positions because I enjoy being versatile in the workplace."
good,"Cracker Barrel was a very different restaurant than I was used to working in. I was used to fast paced, late nights, hostile customers, and lots of other things you encounter in the restaurant industry. Cracker Barrel made it were you were not responsible for the money that a customer owed. They paid their check at the front of the store before leaving, We just collected out tips and kept waiting tables. They had a star training program which gave employees incentive to move up within the company. Before I left the company I moved up at a 4 star trainer within the company in a very short time. The management team was very laid back and worked with me. They would tell us that if we work hard for them then they would work just as hard for us. They did that daily."
good,"Management was unorganized and lacked effective leadership skills. My co-workers were enjoyable to work with for the most part and were always willing to lend a helping hand. The hardest part of the job was feeling as if I had no one in management positions to rely on  because they were neglectful of the people they were supposed to supervise and often times were difficult to communicate with. The most enjoyable part was the southern and ""homey"" atmosphere that most Cracker Barrels exude. I learned a lot about self-teaching and relying solely on myself to complete tasks to the best of my abilities, and the value of accepting that the hard work you put into a task will not always be recognized and continuing to work hard anyways. Overall, my experience working at Cracker Barrel was a pleasant one that taught me a lot about working with others and working alone."
good,Roll required silverware for day. Obtain meal orders from guests. Deliver meals to tables in restaurant. Assist where needed.
good,In my position I would say a typical day at work is a bit stressful due to management.  I get along fine with all my co-workers and are pleasant to work with.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Mostly like any other restaurant. Good and bad Guest, management is pretty ok, If you are a good worker expect to get a lot of hours. Cool co-workers"
good,"Just passed my 5 year anniversary and CB is an ok place to work. I love most of my co-workers and most of the managers but unless you are the best grill cook who gets away with anything or the server that's been there for about 20 years making $25/hr in  just tips it's a pain to get the hours you want or need. If you have nothing else going on in your life and can deal with the random shifts then go for it. In my personal experience, working here has been an uphill battle since day 1"
good,"My work experience at Cracker Barrel wasn't as I expected. The first few months were better than the last few months. During the summer, their were better tips; during the winter, not so much. A typical day at work was steady, somewhat busy. I made friends with a few of my coworkers. They helped me throughout the time I worked there, as did the managers. The hardest part of the job was getting through the day without getting frustrated at difficult guests that made multiple requests at different times during their stay. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting great tips for working hard for each guest that I served."
good,Work is very fast paced and loud.  Servers are dispensable and often blamed for everything.  Management is very pro back of the house.  I LOVED the customers.
good,Cracker barrel was a good job when it came to the coworkers and some of the managers were good as well but most of your management team was not all that great. managers would talk bad about you behind your back but be nice to your face. the food was good though.
good,"Gives no breaks, poor attitude from management towards employees, great coworkers who work together to get things done."
good,"Was not the ideal job, knowing how little my workspace was but it was not bad for the pay that i was receiving. I enjoyed the atmospher on any given day."
good,a lot of hard work will go into that place. the strong will survive and the weak will crumble. if you love a challenge work the back of the house as a back up cook.
good,"While it was fast paced, I only worked as a Hostess.  The hours were irregular, and there was no room to move up.  Only worked there a short time."
good,"Work experience can change from great to terrible depending on the General Manager. In the time frame that I've worked, experience took a steep dive after a General Manager change. If you keep to yourself you'll be fine, but you won't enjoy your work."
good,"Work experience can change from great to terrible depending on the General Manager.  In the time frame that I've worked, experience took a steep dive after a General Manager change.  If you keep to yourself you'll be fine, but you won't enjoy your work."
good,Typical day is hectic depending on how busy it is.  I learned how to be a great manager of personal time and efforts toward collective goals as well as training new employees.   Management there was friendly and courteous.  Coworkers there were fairly nice and friendly and for the most part willing to work together.
good,It's a job. It helped me pay the bills but the bosses I worked for didn't control their employees so there was constant fighting over silverware and tables.
good,"good flexible hours, management can be a bit rough. decent on rules. not so easy to get along with customers or coworkers at times."
good,"Everyday is entertaining. Always busy, more so on Holidays. Management is very involved to make sure everything runs smoothly. My coworker where exciting to be around. Everyone helps each other, its a team effort."
good,Fun place to work that focuses on personal growth and development. The most enjoyable part of the job is working alongside my colleagues and learn from them.
good,"Advancement availible,great co-workers, innovative ""PAR"" system that tracks progress of employee's progress and workplace regulation retention."
good,I enjoy working here and knowing that I contributed to an enjoyable experience for the guest. This is a fun place to work.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Cracker Barrel is known for excellent customer service and if I learned anything there it was how to provide excellent customer service. I still have not yet worked or ate anywhere else that provides customer service like they do. Manage is rotation so that is a bummer, because you could have a really good manager and then get a really bad one."
good,the store was a new store it was great t be able to help open it. I've learned to have patience with customers. the management team didn't know how to communicate with their employees.
good,I really enjoyed making food from scratch....co-workers become family. Customer service always a plus when u deal with people.
good,Room for advancement within the company. Management are very well trained and can solve problems that arise on a daily basis.
good,I like the training program cracker barrel provides for the employees and the par system. hourly wages could be more compatible with other retail stores.
good,"a typical day at work would be clocking in and getting the workstations set up to execute business. Checking your section making sure up to par for your guest. All the employees worked as a team, and we all as co-workers got along with each other. I enjoyed my job."
good,"Typical restaurant job. Nights, weekends, holidays, they work with schedules and good tips. I liked the coworkers and management was good."
good,"I worked with Cracker Barrel for my time in Highschool, they are very good with developing your people skills and have a good management staff in the restaurant. Not so much the retail section."
good,"The managers are more concerned with meeting goals than their employees sometimes. Breaks aren't scheduled, its more of a ""get it while you can if you can"" deal. Hours are usually good.  Overall its not a half bad place to work."
good,"Fun workplace when everyone is communicating and being ""team players"". Communication with in the employers and management could be improved quit a bit. I've always enjoyed serving people and bring smiles to their faces, and hold conversations with each other.  The employment there started to go down hill as well as the management."
good,"A typical day at work included answering the phone, assisting guests with retail purchases and restaurant checks. Helping check the restrooms, keeping cash area neat, and helping price merchandise. Some days you can get sent home early, due to slow business. Don't always get breaks."
good,Cracker Barrel started off at a faster pace than I was use to. Their main point to get across day after day was to fast paced at all times. Try to stay busy even if it was a slow day.
good,Very strict management. Not a very enjoyable place to work. Not great pay for the jobs. Restaurants in general aren't neccesarily a great place to work.
good,"Gave me the experience to learn how truck, stock, and inventory works. Also they thrived me to do visual displays which was an asset of mine. This made work enjoyable for me because I got to build my skill in my creative side. Cracker Barrel gave me the privilege to be in charge of a lot of important processes. I was able to learn how to do paper work, take responsibilities to close the store part on my own, and gave me the room to do displays on my own. The only down fall with Cracker Barrel was that it is greatly divided. Also the managers were unaware that their was a particular lady that would come behind them and ridicule on the employees and also get them into trouble so she could become a higher position."
good,Management did not schedule work hours. This resulted in loss of job due to no scheduled work for me. Co-workers was not helpful or friendly.
good,"Work was enjoyable at time, a lot of running the floors with carts for the residents. I learned how to communicate with people the proper way, management was very fair was me. My co-workers were fun and very business oriented."
good,"this place was clean and everyone worked there for a long time."
good,"As a host and server, my job was mostly concerned with the guests experience.  I learned to handle situations in face to face interaction with guests and make sure they are satisfied with their experience.  Teamwork was a big factor in getting things done around the work place."
good,"Management was not encouraging."
good,"it's like a family. I look forward to growing in the industry by learning all aspects in the restaurant. I began by working in the dish room, now I just completed training on night maintenance."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,When I first started working at cracker barrel I thought my people skills with large groups of strangers was proficient but i was corrected. After working at cracker barrel my people skills greatly improved over the 3+ years I was there.
good,A typical day at work entails management of tender.  Delivering an high level of customer service.  Physical labor is prevalent and problem solving is active. Co workers are mended together more like a family.  The hardest part is timimg for accuracy.
good,"I loved being a host. It is a great social job and very busy. Makes your day fly by, and who doesn't love that? The staff are all wonderful and exciting people who are willing to help with whatever you need."
good,It could have been a lot better if they would have  had better management and employees. I love working there when we had the right people who wanna work.
good,"-Never truly learned the micros system"
good,"Any restaurant is going to be hectic but I did enjoy my time at Cracker Barrel. It's a bit strict, but once you get the hang of things it isn't so bad."
good,"Working as a server is fine when it comes to the customers and tips ,but dealing with management was a pain here. Most of them were forgetful, didn't pay enough attention to the customers or their employee's needs, and were lazy. It seemed like they were way more prepared to hand out punishments for small mistakes instead of trying to actually help and understand their employees. They were way more concerned with what you were wearing rather than getting food out to the customers in a timely fashion."
good,"This job required long hours occasionally resulting in 12 or more hours worked in a day. It is a busy and fast-paced environment which was exciting at times, but could become very stressful. Management was typical of a restaurant environment where they were apprehensive about giving raises yet constantly ask more from you. The hardest part of the job was managing food waste while not running out of food by the end of the night."
good,"a typical day a cracker barrel is like visiting grandmas southern home in the south, sitting on rocking chairs, and dinning with family. I learned to have great hospitality skills and learned to connect with costumers on a personal level, making them feel welcome. the management was a bit unorganized but everything else was ok. the hardest part of being a hostess at cracker barrel was the long hours and the pay rate starting off."
good,Would come in at 5:00 in mourning to prep the food. Then I would get the kitchen ready to be cooked on. Then I would cook. While I was cooking I would make sure that the line was stocked and ready for the next group that is coming in.
good,"As a cashier at cracker barrel a typical day would be greeting customers, selling merchandise, and assisting customers with there every need. Being friendly was our goal."
good,I would go into work and right away started working and picking up tables. Getting food ready for the costumers and making drinks. Greeting costumers with a smile on my face. I love meeting new people and communicating with people. Most importantly I love having a costumer go home with a full stomach and a smile on their face because I know that I did my job.
good,I learned how to receive/ship store items. I got a great amount of customer service experience (one on one).  Management team was supportive.  Co-workers were a delight.  The hardest part of the job was not getting enough hours each week.  The best part of the job was the customers.
good,A typical day can include strenuous loads carried onto one person because they require a lot from you. Some days it can be easy when it is not busy.
good,Working at Cracker Barrel in the Retail area was a ball.  This position was the first fast the guest saw and the last face as they left. This position was the first impression the guest received when walking into your store.
good,"Great people"
good,"A typical day would include servicing customers, keying in orders, and ensuring accuracy. working at Cracker Barrel has definitely helped me organize my tasks and manage time better. Managers always ensure guests are satisfied and well taken care of. I enjoy working with others and I feel the same about my co-workers at Cracker Barrel. Dealing with unreasonable and angry guests would be the hardest, and guest satisfaction would be the most enjoyable."
good,"Cracker Barrel has been a great part time job. Now I am ready to start working towards a full time career. "
good,Through Cracker Barrel I gained customer service skills. I also learned how to effectively work as a team member with my coworkers. The most enjoyable part of the job was making my customers happy and going home I did a job well done.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,when you work here your day goes past fast you can get in get your work and get out of there feeling good about yourself the longer you work the better discount you get
good,"I start the day with making pancake batter, normally end the night with making pancake batter. this place just kinda stayed the same the whole time."
good,Cracker Barrel is not a job that you would not want to stay long term. Cracker barrel is a great job to first start working.
good,I had many jobs and the management team relied on me because I was so dependable. I gave 110% every day like I do any job. I enjoyed working for them but they needed to hire more help.
good,"At a typical day of work I would stand at the hostess stand and take people to their seats, I learned a lot of patience, customer service skills and many other things from this position. The management was very nice and cooperative and it was very nice. My co-workers were awesome and some of us are still friends. The hardest part of the job was that you are on your feet all day or night and knowing that it may be difficult to move up positions in the company. The most enjoyable thing was keeping the customer happy."
good,"Little cooperation and teamwork between co-workers, influenced by weak leadership of management. The store is a ""tester store"", meaning corporate uses certain restaurants to try new policies and promotional items, before releasing company wide. Most new policies were unorganized, and often involved a large amount of hours deducted from the employees in specific departments. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the lack of teamwork. I would feel obligated to go beyond my own responsibilities, because tasks would go incomplete that can be dangerous in a kitchen. I truly enjoyed the family-like atmosphere that Cracker Barrel aims to deliver. I gained personal friendships with my co-workers and guests. I had the opportunity to meet wonderful people."
good,Worked weekends at night. Sometimes the waiters would get upset if you kept sitting them 1-2 people tables even though you were following the rotation.
good,"Very fast-paced with friendly co-workers, for the most part. Management isn't the best, so it makes the job a bit harder, but it can be fun. There are opportunities to try different positions."
good,"Needed a stable job through college and cracker barrel provided that. Very easy to transfer and move around with the company. Environment is as bad as you want it to be, but again I only viewed it as a temporary position for myself, not a career."
good,greet customers/handle retail purchases/busy/meet new people
good,"Enjoy working here, just inconsistent scheduling.  Clock in and check out shoppers and/or diners."
good,"Fast paced, customer service, on going training, quality food, managed 80 to 150 employees, long hours, lots of admin work"
good,My normal work day consists of taking orders for food and making sure it is delivered promptly and correctly. I feel I work well with both the mangers and my co-workers even when I don't always agree with what I am asked to do or what my co-workers are doing. The hardest part of the job is carrying the heavy trays. I would have to say that I enjoy the interaction with my guests more than anything else. Day after day they are the best part of my job.
good,It was fun working there. I loved the people I served and worked with. It was very stressful but I always had fun doing it.
good,"can be blamed for things you have no control over, depending on what job you are put in. But coworkers are great! some managers will go out of their way to help you, other will go out of their way to ignore you"
good,"	Worked in high paced workplace and utilized abilities of strength and agility to perform tasks"
good,"Working as a cashier at Cracker Barrel was fun, but they were to stingy with the hours. They expected me to come in for three or four hour work days and gave me as little as ten hour weeks. I had no choice, but to quit."
good,engage all guest with product and service and always guest before task
good,Great place to work. Tips were good. Restaurant was busy. Co-workers were great
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,i did not enjoy working at cracker barrel the employees were always very nice to me but the management was always rude and was not very alert to their employees and what problems they mite have going on when it came down to health reason
good,"This environment was fast paced, but had a homely family fun feel.  As each shift progressed if the family couldn't work together the dining experience was not smooth for the restaurant nor the kitchen.  There is plenty of advancement available if you are willing to work for it."
good,"Training is a good program, somewhat short, throwing new hires into an intense atmosphere, but has great foundational principles."
good,"It's a serving job. You can't expect much from it. However, if you are able to get regular customers and build relationships with them, it makes working there more pleasant."
good,"I worked at Cracker Barrel as a hostess during high school. It was a simple, fun job. Management was friendly, as well as coworkers. The hardest part of the job was staying organized during busy hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was working together with other staff members and management harmoniously."
good,Prep food for the day. Have to follow recipes to the tee. Love working at my own pace.
good,"love to eat there ,don't pay much to there employees. work you alot ."
good,"Ok place to work , management was decent. Co-workers where helpful.The most enjoyable part of the job was going home."
good,Good Place to work. Management was good and employees were friendly and did their job.
good,"I set up the daily plans at the beginning of each week.  I know the goals and have them divided each day and each shift.  Work with each team member to allow their potential to shine.  We have floor moves to do I put the best person in that position that I know that we will get the best results.  I pair my strong employee with a weaker employee to get the best combination.  I work with 4 managers in my unit.  My General Manager and I set the tone for the management group.  We are positive and have coaching moments often to help our management team to grow, and bring home the results that we need.  Working with part-time employees and trying to mold them to the Cracker Barrel Culture, help them have a how can I help attitude. I enjoy the public.  Meeting 1000 of guest weekly is by far the best part.  Getting to know my guest for years and follow them through out our lives for the past 10 years."
good,"it's a very hurried environment,very much so a hustle and bustle kind of place that will keep you on your toes."
good,The sections were normally too small and the management can be a little hectic.
good,A stressful job and labor intensive. Requires ability to multi-task and prioritize. Must have good communication skills between customers and staff.
good,"Waitressing is a very stressful job, and you learn a lot from doing it. Cracker Barrel was an enjoyable working enviroment and taught me a lot about customer service."
good,hardest part was never knowing how much money u was going to  make. co-workers were great. management some didnt know how to speak to there employees
good,"A typical day at work would be spent mostly behind the counter at the register cashing people out and offering our different promo's of the month. I learned how to be persuasive in sales to get customers interested in buying. I don't have any complaints on management, other than having my hours cut suddenly. Otherwise, they were very understandable, polite people. My coworkers are some of the best I've ever had. Very helpful and extremely nice. The most enjoyable part of my job is hearing how wonderful our service is and how satisfied customers are."
good,"My Typical day at work was to interact with the customers and promote sales."
good,It was a great place to get started but management was not as well as it should have been.
good,Good food but the managment needs to be more on the same page. I learned how to be a part of a team and deal with people who are not team players and not let them get me down.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"This place has tried time after time to make a recovery and it's just not gonna make it, I don't see this establishment making it in the next 15 years. Minimal benefits, half of the staff is unfriendly and doesn't want to even be there, and the managers will talk about you behind your back. Give it a try!! We are hiring....we are always hiring ALL POSITIONS!!"
good,"This is a good part time job, but nothing to make a real living off of unless you are in a big city and it is really busy."
good,"As an employee at Cracker Barrel it was just like any typical job. The work place was very relaxed, management was not as good as it should have been. The most enjoyable part of work would be getting to meet new people everyday."
good,"A typical day at work is non stop, on your feet, barely get to use the bathroom, or get a drink. Tons of teamwork. The GM is understanding."
good,I felt to many people to advantage of the good servers. A lot of bias going on especially at closing. The greeter would sit everyone in one station and slam that server right before closing when three where on shift
good,it was fast cash for a college student. managemnet was great!
good,"A typical day at work is long hours on your feet and the possibility of no breaks in between your shift. It is a rewarding and fun job, you get to deal with all ages of the general public. Great management and co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to all different ages of people and getting to know them in a personal way that makes them feel like a special guest at your restaurant."
good,"The job wasnt for me, it was too far for me to go to, the work conditions werent that great for me."
good,I loved working here. I was opened with welcomed arms into the Cracker Barrel family. Very customer oriented job and a lot of coworkers. Very fun managers and co workers.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of general kitchen duties including:  making biscuits and all food that went into the steam table.  I learned different cooking techniques with speed and accuracy.  Management was good, co-workers better.  The most difficult part of the job was keeping up during peak times."
good,"management is wonderful "
good,"Greet customers, help customers find items for purchase."
good,It is an upbeat environment to work in. The downsides are when dealing with unsatisfied customers and the lack of respect and courteousness for the employees from the manages
good,"I personally didn't get enough hours as I should have, I only got 6 hours a week."
good,cracker barrel was a very fun and busy environment meeting lost of people and staying very busy with work I loved it
good,The people are friendly and the pay varies. You work with people and learn to serve food
good,"not worth the sacrifice you make, you are not a valued employee"
good,This opportunity taught me responsibility and time management.
good,"A typical day of work consists of checking guests out of the checkout line, labeling new products and merchandise, hanging or folding new apparel, and sometimes making samples. I've learned how to efficiently check guests out quickly while still paying attention to details and asking about their specific meal service. The management can always find something that needs done when we are at our non-peak times. My co-workers are helpful when working together or individually to ensure all of our tasks are complete. The hardest part of the job is when there is something you need to do or get but you can't leave the cash stand and nobody else is around, it makes it difficult to do your job when you're doing somebody else's also. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing familiar faces as well as new ones that have smiles that stretch ear to ear."
good,I always work the morning shift for breakfast and enjoy seeing people start their day. My co-workers are very entertaining and help each other if needed. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the busy morning rush.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I took care of customers and trained new employees. The  management changed often.
good,"As a server, you definitely get a chance to interact with costumers more."
good,"* A typical day is full will (let make a difference) and a mindset of making it happen (bet your goal)"
good,The company is very workable for people looking for a good job with flexible hours.
good,"A typical day at work consists of following up on production and proper set up for the shift. Have to spend a lot of time in positions due to poor labor standards, which of course takes you away from impacting the whole operation. Most enjoyable part of working in a restaurant is the interaction with people and working as a team."
good,"This particular Cracker Barrel is probably the worst one you could ever decide to choose to go to.  The Jacksonville NC location has many issues.  There is no sense of professionalism in this establishment.  The management is terrible, and their leadership is not efficient.  I worked on both sides of the restaurant, retail and serving customers.  The restaurant probably has the retail store beat in the way of management.  They don't appreciate their employees and the work they do for them, and the like to take advantage.  I'll never work at another cracker barrel again because the experience was so awful.  I would never recommend someone working here because I can assure them they will without a doubt be miserable.  I worked on the retail side before I was crossed trained and the retail manager made it perfectly clear that no matter what you did it wasn't good enough.  What finally broke the camels back was when I told my manager I needed to get a second job because I couldn't afford my rent anymore on minimum wage, she was upset and took me off the weekly schedule.  This was right around Christmas and I was her only merchandiser.  About a month later I told her I needed a Sunday off because my family was coming to visit, she told me she would not schedule me and when sunday came around she had me on to work a double that day without even informing me.  After that I quit and didn't look back..  If you want a stable job where you don't have to worry about walking around with a  knife in your back this is not the place for you.  I would never recommend somebody I knew working"
good,"Very welcoming enviroment."
good,Management is very understanding and of coure the most enjoyable part of the job is cash tips!!
good,"Hours are subject to the need per shift. I learned a lot about changing pace based on customer flow and working well with others. All the managers are respectable. Coworkers are good people, and very hard workers. The hardest part is dealing with such varied hours weekly. The best part is always staying busy. ""Par"" system achievements include a raise each subsequent level."
good,lots of dishes. management is sloppy but i still take orders good and do what im told. co workers are lazy. hardest part of my job is busy days which includes a lot of heavy lifting and constant moving. enjoyable part of my job is im making money to keep my fiance happy and leaving work is enjoyable
good,Good work/life balance. Management was up to par and good with keeping your schedule how you would want it.
good,"A typical day of work at Cracker Barrel was going in and knowing your job responsibilities. I had to know the floor charts and what I was doing that day, like seating people or taking names. The management team was good, they definitely were leaders and made sure everything was running smoothly. My co-workers and I got along and worked well together. The hardest part of the job was dealing with upset guests that felt like they had waited to long to get a table when it was busy. Also, in Cracker Barrel, they have the fire place. That was difficult to stand in front and wait to seat the guest because it was so hot! Overall, I enjoyed it."
good,"I would serve customers in a friendly manner. My co-workers where noisy, rude, and stuck up. Customers where cheap. Working environment was dirty, UN-organized ciaos."
good,it was fast paced but my co-workers I did not enjoy working with them at all
good,Was a host here for about an year. Was not given the raise which was promised to me at time of employment. Co-workers were great though.
good,The point of the store is to be old fashioned but in today's world I dont believe that will sit well for very long. That is just my personal opinion.
good,"Average work place, managers are demanding, ticket is ridiculous."
good,"For the most part, working at Cracker Barrel was alright.  The managers were amazing along with most of the co-workers.  The only problem was the pay compared to how much work was always needed to be done.  It also seemed like most of the work in the restaurant rested on the waiter's shoulders and not as much on the workers in the kitchen.  Outside of these problems, Cracker Barrel was a pretty enjoyable environment to work in."
good,Through this job I have learned patience and how to provide great customer service to even the most bothersome and upset guests.  I have also learned how to work as a team player with over a hundred employees in all different job types in order to provide a great dining experience for the guest. The hardest part is maintaining calm when dealing with an unhappy guest who it is apparent will not be made happy no matter what you do.  The most enjoyable part is having guests leave happy and knowing that you had a part in their happiness.
good,"My boss and I got along very well. As a novice in the restaurant kitchen business, I was guided through the process of preparing some simple dishes and quite enjoyed it. The maintenance part of it required the usual kitchen clean-up. The entire staff was friendly and eager to answer questions, if any."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,It was okay. Made a lot of money however management was poor and coworkers were not friendly.
good,Great place to work either part-time or full-time. Very friendly staff.
good,"•	Bussing tables"
good,"Cracker Barrel is one the place I miss being employed.  The people, the food, the guest encounters and experiences you have are one of a kind.  Management was almost perfect and your co-workers are the craziest people you'll ever meet.  The hardest part of the job in my opinion was being on my feet so long while I was pregnant but the guest made it all worth it."
good,A typical day at work consists of working with the public and restocking the shelfs. I have learned customer service and organization. My management and co-workers are amazing and hard workers. The hardest part of my job was lifting the boxes on inventory day and unloading them. I loved working with the public.
good,I cashed out guests after their meals. I learned the rules with handling foods. The management was nice. The coworker were helpful when needing help. The hardest part was making sure the to go orders where correct. The best part is making guest happy so they will come back again.
good,"Very stressful, 10 min ticket times! Always under pressure but felt very professional."
good,"cleaning tables, helping guests, seating. assisting. its a good first job for beginnersgoing into restaurant business."
good,"Not a bad place to work. Management isn't bad. You get hours as long as you do good work. Your co-workers are pretty friendly. Sometimes there's a bit of a rush, but it's manageable."
good,It depended on your tips on how much money you made so the pay wasn't stable. It was a fun place to work
good,"Great place but work but they have trouble scheduling hours, and wait until the last minute to change schedules. Management is poor along with values."
good,I enjoyed the guests and seeing them leave with a smile on their faces.
good,Being a dishwasher here is like being at the gym. It's a workout. The incentives are nice but its a stressful job when the place gets busy.
good,"A typical day consisted siting guest when the dinned in at our restaurant"
good,"For the most part, working for Cracker Barrel was enjoyable, especially around the holidays. The hardest part of my job was making to the mandatory meetings when I was supposed to be in classes. I enjoyed a majority of my coworkers."
good,"This job is particularly difficult for me because it requires me to be on my feet for long periods of time. Other than that, the job isn't bad except for one manager that has a tendency to make girls cry. I had this happen to me and pushed me to decide that I needed a different job."
good,i feel that if a person was content on staying here then it would be best if they liked minimum wage but not for a person that wants to move up the clinical ladder
good,good job dose not give you lots of hours they lie to you they tell you they will give you hours and you get none! but the people you work with are nice and pleasant so are most of the guests  
good,"custom cooking to order,food handeling, state tests and exams"
good,too many servers on floor no hours but generalyy friendly guests
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"We would prep the dinning hall, clean, make sure we had enough menus. We also sat guests and welcomed them into the store. "
good,"Waiting on customers, training new employees on all aspects of our job. Cleaning our resturnant. I learned how to waitress to the best of my ability. Which in turn let me move up to a server trainer pretty quickly. We had four managers all but one of them worked well together. Which let our resturant run smoothly for the most part. Sometimes there was some disagreements between our managers which cause some problems for the resturant but they always got resolved. The hardest part of my job was dealing with one of my bosses ( the same boss that the other managers had trouble with also) he just got after me and all of us servers for every little tiny thing we did wrong. I understand you need to do your job and do it right but he could have went about it in a better way other then yelling at us in front of everybody. My favorite part was my customers. I love working with people. It is very rewarding. Yes trying at times but also very rewarding. "
good,"A typical day at Cracker Barrel included constant communication to co-workers in the kitchen in order to keep everything running correctly and smoothly. It also included plenty of cooking, cleaning, and preparation. I learned how to operate all aspects of a complicated kitchen including all standard operating procedures for each individual station. Management was very busy and appreciated as much help from the supervisors as possible. My co-workers at this job looked up to me and came to me with any questions or concerns. They were confident and worked well together. The most challenging aspect of this particular job was the extreme multitasking that was required in order to maintain a steady and successful work environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was the quick pace and the ability to talk and laugh openly with others while at work. "
good,"good work,learned how run dishwasher and cleaning products, management easy to get along with. co-worker fun an interesting. the hardest part of job was carrying dishes to put away and keeping up fast pace in rush hour. getting to experience working with other people."
good,"Busy restaurant. Guest order and receive food quickly, allowing servers to turn tables quickly. Must be able to stay focused in high stress demanding environment. Many regulars and servers that have stayed for years."
good,its a good job but it all depends on the management who runs the show on how well the company can succeed.
good,"I enjoyed this job. It was a bit routine, but overall enjoyable. Management was strict, and did not let us get away with much. The hardest part of the job was balancing the cash register because if the drawer was short more than $2, it came out of your paycheck. Fortunately, that did not happen to me very much."
good,"Very busy from 5 a.m until closing different foods cooked according to recipes. I learned how to grill, fry, and cook to order, FIFO and temperature holding foods. Co-workers were respectful & friendly, the management changed very often. Hardest part was waiting for the next cook to show up on time to relieve me from work. The most enjoyable part was cooking and the guest enjoyed the food and compliment the food."
good,The job is real slow. It was not really what i was looking for which would have been a face paced job with high customer interaction.
good,"The people you meet and people you work with is what makes this job worth while. I have so many new friends because of this place. However, managers tend to care about themselves and what makes their pockets bigger. For instance, in order to get good scores restaurants like to get ""one stop shops"" (meet and take order at same time) this speeds up the experience for the consumer, but also gives better table turn around. Making our team appear as excellent among company big guys. But managers cheat during this process. Instead of allowing servers to perform at their own pace, managers will steal or allow other employees to steal your tables during peak hours. Some times we get the tables back, but others times it only causes feuds between employees that would be avoided if otherwise directed differently by management."
good,"Very fast-paced, but also very fun. Employees are very sweet and helpful to new employees"
good,"Most work days consist of handling accommodations and meeting guests' needs and dealing with large groups of people and sales. I learned to communicate with guest efficiently and develop good rapport with guest. I also learned to work as a team with my co-workers. It wasn't always the easiest to work with my co-workers, however it was always manageable and getting along was effortless."
good,"Cracker Barrel is pretty good about working around your schedule: school, family, other jobs, etc., and they are good about letting you trade days/hours with coworkers. They only pay at a start of minimum serving wage for servers and max your pay out after 20 cents worth of raises. Tips at this restaurant do not compensate for the low serving wage."
good,Some of the management is not always willing to help the employees that are in need. Some of the co-workers do not always want to help either. I learned that some older people can be mean and do not always show thanks to their servers. The hardest part of the job is keeping a smile on your face when things start to get crazy. the most enjoyable part are the guests that walk out with a smile on their face and a good word about the food or the server.
good,Same thing everyday.the management don't help out.i learned how to cook better food.the best part of the job is getting paid every week.
good,"Retaurant was clean and the coworkers were friendly, however for a high school student the part time hours were still a bit too much since the restaurant closes late."
good,"Fun job, but not enough pay to stay alive. Stayed busy, not enough hours, wasnt making enough for travel to and from work and schoo."
good,Enjoy my co-workers
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel, I thoroughly enjoyed. I enjoyed the people I had the honor of meeting from all around the world. A typical day at Cracker Barrel I would clock in about five minutes before my shift. Once on the clock, I would check to see what tables were assigned to me and serve the people at my tables. If anyone else not at my assigned tables needed help I would assist them also. Towards the end of my shift, I would get cut from the floor. Once I got cut, I would get started on cleaning my tables, and my daily duties and mac duties. Once this was done, I would roll my silverware and I would be ready to clock-out and get my tips from credit/debit cards."
good,"I was a cashier and I also suggested items to the customer on what to buy as they came though the check out line. It bothered me because I am a diabetic and that was a common item to push. Cracker Barrel caters to a lot of the senior citizens. That is not a good thing because I get annoyed when I am asked. I don't think there is enough accountability on management about money. I had one senior manager, and about two managers asked to leave because they were taking money. I also had a Supervisor that took my hour from 25 hrs a week down to 4 hrs and never told my why. I finally had to quite."
good,"I learned how to deal with different types of people. Hardest part was dealing with those people, however."
good,"A typical day at work is coming in getting things in order for the shift to start, so we can be prepared to handle our shift for the day. I have learned how to interact more with others and developed leadership skills. Most of the management is very helpful and my co-workers are a pleasant to work with. There are really no hard parts of the job to me everything is self explanatory. The most enjoyable part of the job is going to work making money and having fun getting alone with everyone on shift."
good,Hard to get hours and hard for skilled people to advance. I was not able to advance fast enough to keep me engaged because I couldn't keep working for the low wage they were offering and not letting me have any hours could only work less than 30 and wanted to be at 40 or more fast tract.
good,"multi-tasking is a must, enjoyed working there, great chance to meet new people"
good,"Perhaps it was just the people I worked with, but it was a hectic, unfriendly atmosphere for me as an employee."
good,There is no value on work/home balance. The management focus a lot of lip service towards manager retention yet makes no changes to the balance managers can achieve.
good,It was very hectic during Christmas. Some customers got very upset if I didn't wrap fast enough. The staff and management were very distant.
good,interacting with each guest was always an experience. this job taught a lot of patience and taught me a lot about how to handle various situations.
good,Great Job to work at. Steady work environment and great place to learn how to cook and get the experience of cooking.
good,It was very fast paced when busy. You have to be alert! The managers were pretty fun and the coworkers were the best. There isn't much downtime so you usually had to sneak food if you wanted it.
good,A typical day at work would be getting there around 6 am getting the store ready for the breakfast crowd. My co-workers where wonderful people to work with.
good,Some days are slow and I only work an hour or so then sent home. Other days on weekends busy and stayed longer than supposed to without being ask half the time. Never switch schedule around so I lost my weekends.
good,"constantly on my feet, washing and storing the dishes away"
good,Typical Day:
good,"Many opportunities so you may pick your best area to work (sales, serving...). It can get a bit hectic but that's what I love about it."
good,"A typical workday is not too demanding, though I like to be challenged. I have become much more of a people person through this experience and I look forward, for the most part, to going into work everyday. The management is very laid back and easy to talk to on a personal level, but they certainly have their ""favorite"" employees. Though I enjoy the people I work with, they are not all the hardest working. Few people go above and beyond their job duites, if even accomplishing them at all on a daily basis. This job is not difficult at all, at times you may come into contact with an angry customer, but there has not been any challenge I haven't overcome."
good,Cracker barrel was a tough and challenging job. You definately had to walk in the door open minded and leave all your personal issues at home. The toughest part about this job was dealing with management and rude customers. I was a waitress so you had to smile and be friendly no matter how your day was going or how rude your table was.
good,"This job was not like I ever expected. I did not know that I as a cashier could have an impact on customers, co-workers, and the business as a whole. As a cashier, my main duty was to maintain customer satisfaction. I talked to the customers and got to know what they liked and the things the store could do to improve as a whole. I realized that with communicating to the customers you are giving them feedback. It does not always have to be about purchasing items but more so of how their day was impacted by our character and presentation. When customers are satisfied by their service at any restaurant, doctors office, clothing store, or any other business they continue to come back because they know that their presence is appreciated. I was always proud to have given these customers such satisfaction."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Ok if you just need a GET ME BYE income. It makes a good tempory position for a part-time job, but not good for a career job."
good,"working there wasn't horrible customers where. min for servers is 2.13, but getting more money and more stars are easy to do."
good,This place was not so great. You have to do a lot of extra work here as a server and you don't make a lot of money. The people who eat here tend to be an older crowd so the tips aren't very high. Lots of work and not much compensation. The managers were nice but not very helpful during busy times. Very big on the customer is always right so you may take a lot of verbal abuse from a customer or guest before a manager will be willing to step in.
good,"CB is pulling out all the stops to find the way to increase restaurant traffic and retail sales - most of all, improving the guest experience."
good,"i love the food, i didnt like the management so much. I like how you go a raise evry test you took"
good,"i worked for this company for 5 years during and after high school. it was a good starting job for me, the company offered advancements and had decent benifits for people just starting out the pay was decent for the area working in food service. the company also offered decent health benifits that had coverage in the local area. great work envirnment as well as good management,"
good,"It was very chaotic working as a server at Cracker Barrel because there were a lot of demands and sometimes we were short staffed, so it was a very high speed environment. However, there are coworkers going through the same struggle as you who are very encouraging and you guys work as a family."
good,Amazing job for a student/ someone looking for a part- time job. The GM wasn’t always patient/ compassionate about his employees but overall I enjoyed working there
good,The management wasn’t all that bad but it wasn’t really the best it could have been. The main reason I left the company was because I wasn’t making enough money.
good,A great company that has a well focused. Good for a person starting out that doesn’t have a family yet.  Fair in compensation and benefits. A strong company
good,"I like my job duties, I was tricked into thinking this job would have permanent full-time work for me with great benefits. This turned out to be part-time cant even pay gas hardly to go back and forth to work let along provide for my family. I am disappointed that it didn't turn out the way I needed it to be and that they aren't giving anyone full time with benefits."
good,good job for those wanting a fast work environment and ok pay if you like serving people in a competitive environment and having fun this job is for you hours can be changed depending on situations that may come up
good,"It was a lot of training and a lot was expected of the stronger workers. The managers did a great job at training and keeping energy focused. Hours were long and tedious, depending on ability."
good,"I was really excited to start this job, and had hoped for long term employment.  However, it's not what I'd hoped.  The main issue is the attitudes of fellow servers.  As a whole, they are unwelcoming of new hires, poor team effort, two faced behavior, and seem to be greedy, and in competition with everyone."
good,It was a nice family an friendly environment but I wanted a career change. The customers made it a at home vibe along with the coworkers. It was a fun experience while it lasted.
good,They expect you to do alot more then you can get done by just one person. Most managers were great and helping. As long as most staff would help also. Over all good place to work.
good,"When I started there ,I didn't have any experience in running dish room. I had experience in bussing table. I got my 4 stars within a year. Cross-trained to cashier and got my 2nd  star. Got cross-trained again to night maintenance and  got my 1st star ,didn't got my 2nd star due to the GM at that time. I walked out on Cracker Barrel in 2008."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,when i worked there it wasn’t the greatest mx there were some good times but it just seemed like everyone was there just to make money. the manager didn’t really care about any of the employees. they do have new managers now so i’m sure it’s different
good,Working at Cracker Barrel has been a great experience. I’ve been there on and off for two years and I can honestly say the company has remained exactly the same
good,They have way to many servers on the floor.  Sometimes you would only have two tables at a time and it you get people who like to sit and chat for hours than you are not making any money.  Managers have to walk you out when you leave for a shift because they don't trust you to walk through the store without stealing.
good,"It is probably the best job I’ve had so far, but I’ve been forced to pick up so many extra responsibilities as a server. The Togo  situation is insane and they never schedule a certain person to deal with it it’s always just one or two servers having to get all the to go orders ready while they’re juggling their own tables. Also the management is way too strict about overtime. I understand maybe a cook who’s getting paid well hourly but I’m only getting 2.13 and hour is it reallly that big of a deal?"
good,"If you want a serving job that is very streamlines and  scripted, then this is for you. It lacks a more personal experience with customers, but runs smoothly."
good,My first serving job and it was a good experience. I love my fellow employees. Management there is different than I've seen anywhere else. They really need a class or something.
good,"I loved the environment of working here; the managers were easy-going and showed they cared about their employees' wellbeing, my coworkers were fun and helpful, and the restaurant usually ran smoothly. As experienced servers have left, managers have gotten more stressed and react poorly to situations more often than before, but it's still a decent workplace."
good,They always did their best to accommodate my needs! Getting shifts covered is a little tricky but overall great experience. Flexible schedule and overall good management team.
good,"I have been at Cracker Barrel 2 years. The pay is better for a server than what you might think because guests come in and out very quickly, especially in the morning. Despite low food costs I typically make about $10 per hour in table tips plus the $2.35 I get in server wage. That's with an 18-19% average tip. It can be very demanding in high volume periods especially if a server calls out."
good,"A normal day for night maintenance is just cleaning the entire store (kitchen, bathrooms, dining area, outside) . On some days they have special tasks that need to be done but they are pretty reasonable. The job itself is not hard but it is based on how clean your coworkers are. Weekends were always hard because more customers means they have less time to clean under tables and after themselves. But weekdays were pretty simple. Best part is you can listen to music since your mostly by yourself and the faster you move the faster your done and you can rest."
good,"I work Hosting and To-go’s and for the most part I got along with everyone. Management is good for everything except that they hire new people very often and don’t give hours to current employees. They schedule me 3-10 hrs now, so I’m definitely looking for another job. Guests are nice, but many of the older guests can be very rude to younger employees. I did however have some problems with men in the kitchen, but my managers handled it really well."
good,This isnt a job if you are looking to support yourself off of it early on. You can get raises quick enough to stay afloat in today's cost of living. But great staff and employees I do enjoy my time there.
good,"I have been working as a waitress at Cracker Barrel for almost 3 years now. It’s an easy job if you allow it to be easy. It can also be hard. However, most jobs are like that."
good,a typical day usually went by very fast fast as there was alot of work to do. managers were kind and always helping out. i learned to have a sense of urgency and as well as maintain a clean environment.
good,"If I wasn't as nervous of a person with very fast pacing serving work, I would have probably stayed a lot longer than I have. I enjoyed meeting new people and developing coping skills with my social anxieties. My fellow employees (servers, hosts, and cooks) worked like a big family and looked out for each other. The only other reason I didn't stay besides the job not being a good fit, was the amount of over scheduling they did. I came into the job as a part timer and a overly full time student. I told them before I couldn't work more than 20 hours a week, but they regularly scheduled me 30 or more for several weeks."
good,"This company used to be one of the best jobs I had ever had. However in recent couple years their profit increasing measures have severely lowered many of their standards, work life balance, employee appreciation, and general atmosphere. While I have strong relationships within my unit I can no longer support a company that does not support their employees in any more than words."
good,Meeting and greeting tables as I take the order and then bring the food to the tables. Cleaning and restocking tables for the next set of guest. One thing that I learned is to take one person at a time and it don't matter how many people you are serving by taking it one at a time you want miss one. The turn over rate in the management was bad we would get a new GM every 6to8 month. I loved working there felt right at home. Not getting the order right the first time and the table have to wait. When someone remember how well u took care of them the last time they was there and u made them want to come back.
good,Helpful with many things always connecting with the guest and employees when needed . Strong team when it comes to busy times. Job wouldn’t upset you.
good,"The store I work at is very fast pasted. I learned to prioritize the workload. Management is good, they give their all. The culture is stressful, must be able to work under stressful situations. Most employees try to work as a team."
good,"Working at Cracker barrels I picked up everything pretty fast. I knew what need to be done without being directed, and even did jobs that weren't in my job description."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"The servers like to talk about every little thing, the cooks messed up orders, the dish team was probably the best set of people there. Everyone else slowed them down honestly. Aside from that their benefits were nice, paid vacation you could cash in whenever you wanted, and half off meals throughout your shift."
good,"Very fast-paced work environment as it is an EXTREMELY popular restaurant, especially on weekends/holidays."
good,"Consistent food from one store to another.  Long hours changing from day to night shift often.  Learned great Management skills, while working at 2 stores in Ohio."
good,Cracker Barrel is a nice place to work. We have great co-workers who are nice to be around and we almost instantly become friends. It is a nice place.
good,still a good place to eat with good service. They hire hundreds of employee's and run through them when it's clear your hours are way less then agreed when hired.
good,Good place to work overall.  Health insurance available only during open enrollment period. We get discounts on food an d retail items .We don't have to share tips.
good,"As a Retail Manager you are required to work closely with the Restaurant Managers.  In my experience most of them were condescending, rude and dismissive.  I actually resigned from my position due to the lack of respect from the Restaurant Store Manager.  My GM and my Regional Manager were GREAT!!"
good,"It was very fast pace, and food was cooked according to who ordered first, staff was friendly, customers were polite mostly for this area, people tipped better either for breakfast or lunch usually."
good,"A great place to work, easy and helpful with transferring and relocating. Room for advancements and your work ethic and motivation sets the bar for earning potential."
good,"When certain managers are on the shift everything can go perfectly under the busiest of conditions. But when you have other less skilled managers that freak out under stress, things go downhill very quickly. Basically the only recommendation i have for management is that your employees for the most part are not incompetent, don't treat them like they are. Also for the most part your employees know how to do their job, don't start interfering with their work or telling them what to do unless they ask for your help or guidance."
good,Cracker Barrell is a pretty decent company to work for. You meet alot of great people. Co-workers and guest. I enjoy the environment and the homemade food.
good,"Great money, great benefits, lots of long hours. Ideal for single person. Work to life balance sucks. Basically glorified babysitter. Work positions a lot, as help is hard to retain. Great for entry level management. There is room for growth, if you so desire."
good,"When I first started working at cracker barrel, I liked it, till the found out how old I was and wanted to work me longer shifts I couldn’t do cause of school."
good,I have learned a lot of great ways to deal with cusmoter from all walks of life.  Yes I still work there but the pay isn’t great I need a little more money.
good,Currently understaffed. Dread working most days because of no kitchen staff. When we're fully staffed runs great. Be prepared to work hard. All positions rely on teamwork. As long as you're willing to work hard it can be a good place to work. If you want to get by with doing as little as possible this job isn't for you. Only for motivated people. We need kitchen staff badly. I love my coworkers. They are fun people to work with. Management changes fairly quick. GM gets mad and either yells at everyone or just plain won't talk to you if checks are running over 20 minutes.
good,I learned how patience I was with customers. Very fast paced environment but with messy back of house area. Learned how to properly greet customers and seat them at assign tables.
good,"It was ok for a temp job. A little fast paced.Had good retail items. It was a small area in to get around in , the retail was all crowded. A lot of people in one area gathering ."
good,"I have worked for this company for almost 19 years.  First as a server and then as a grill cook for the past 16 years.  It is fast paced, stressful, and oftentimes it feels as though you have ran a marathon after clocking out.  This job will ruin your body if you do it long enough.  Coworkers at my store are awesome.  The kitchen is a rowdy place, but it can be ""fun"" if you have the right attitude.  Managers come and go, and there will always be bad apples, but for the most part they are in the trenches with you trying to meet the unrealistic expectations from corporate.  I'm guessing that is typical of most full service chain restaurants.  The managers at my store are very understanding and willing to work within availabilities and requests for time off.  My beef is with the way this company does pay raises.  I have been doing this job WAY too long to only be making a dollar more than new hires.  It's wrong!!!"
good,"other than the coworkers, it was a pleasurable place to work. i liked my managers, but them being too nice resulted in me quitting due to my coworkers bullying and nothing being done about it. I worked hard and did my best to make everything run smoothly, but unfortunately, my coworkers pushed me out."
good,I like the people that work there. I also enjoy my job because the people know I get the job done the right way. I also know the managers like the job i do
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"During the week, it's slower so not as stressful. Certain managers get stressed out very easily. Usually during the weekends (mainly sunday mornings) we would go on a wait and the managers would try to do anything to not go onto a wait. The other employees are fun and great. Some servers might try to rely on you for certain things if they're too stressed out. Make sure you're a team player and the job will be fun."
good,"The job was alright. They didn’t have enough employees in one department so it put a lot of unfair pressure and stress on the other workers to do more than what we could. There were really no breaks... you just go when there’s slow business, which was rare.  However the people there were always positive and kind."
good,"Most days at work were fast paced and had a very early morning rush, which typically lasted until after lunch ended. This was my first serving job and they teach you how to be a great server from the ground up. Management was probably the worst part of this restaurant. There was a lot of favoritism on sections and cuts that was unrelated with work. Hardest part of this job is getting used to the fast pace. Most enjoyable part of this job was a paid vacation as a server... almost is unheard of."
good,"For a hosting position, this was as bare bones as it could get. All you had to do was take guests to their table and clean bathrooms. No busing tables, no fetching drinks no nothing really. Just stand at the podium until a guest walks in, take them to their table and get glared at whenever you were on a wait"
good,"decent, but could have been better, management. minors could only work four hours a week. Mean service & slow paced at times. hostess always had to clean up after servers"
good,"Never revived a lunch break low hours. "
good,"There’s many good and bad things but overall. I enjoyed working there, coworkers were always nice, most guests were nice people, just pay and hours were a bit hard depending on position"
good,I really like the managers for the most part but a couple of them are very two faced. I do not think they pay well enough and they do not give long enough shifts.
good,Meeting new customers and socializing with all types of people is great for bringing you out of your shell; and also a great place to gain skills for future jobs and experience for other restaurant careers.
good,job would be okay if the treated employees LIKE humans anf actually followed polices. And if action was taken when people still money from coworkers. I feel like as long as they made goal hours what we make didnt matter to them
good,"It was my first time ever to be a food waitress. It could be very busy at times especially on Sundays. On those days you are moving, lifting and serving food non-stop, while also dealing with people, sometimes very picky about food. As long as you take your time with the order when you first take it , instead of writing it down wrong and finding out the food is wrong on the delivery. Many times it will not  be you that delivers the food to the table that you took the order from.  If an order is wrong it can slow everybody down on a busy day and also effect cooking times and of course your tips."
good,Good work place with good people just under paid. I would recommend a high school student or college student that doesn’t have tons of bills to work there. But if you plan on living on your own it will not pay enough
good,Complicated advancement procedures due to training manual designed for entry level managers. Being a multi unit mgr had to start over due to DM change
good,"Working at cracker barrel was a fun very fast paced position, in which you learned customer service skills very fast. I enjoyed the people I worked with, management was at times not so good though. when I was in school, however, they did work with my schedule very well."
good,this job was amazing! I made lots of friends met really friendly guests made good tips. when season is over it gets extra slow not good for tips. management is bad and unfair they don't let u explain ur side of the story they go by what they want. half of the time they got the wrong story.
good,Typical day at work consisted compensated time to take license. stationed at the dishwasher all the time I was there learned about different chemicals how to keep and store as well as helping in the refrigerator. Restroom cleaning back kitchen area. The company took care of its workers in personal disaster relief and even gone as far as funeral assist good people to work with.
good,"Being able to bring home money everyday is nice, but the management sucks there, and it is very stressful, when it is busy. Drama occurs everyday, and isn't the job for me. Currently still working there, but ready to find a new job."
good,I worked there for six months and for the first three months everything was going good but the last three months I was in getting paid much and I wasn’t given enough hours even asking repeatedly if I can be able to work more in they Just ignored my wishes
good,Management is okay here but the hours and coworkers aren't that great. The schedule is constantly changing and they do not inform you prior to changing so its important to check it everyday. You will never get off at your scheduled time. You will work at least 30 minutes over.
good,"Working here you go through very fast paced hours where you are non-stop moving for 30 minutes at times. It can get very crowded on the weekends and holidays, so being a talkative person can help you get through working these times. It is overall a good place to work with awesome co-workers and you can meet interesting people."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"The management was great but,  I only got one day a week and for 4 hours and thats not enough to support yourself especially if you are a server.  I was a good server too but since I had not already been working there for years I didn't get the hours I should have."
good,"Although I realized that I did not like serving, my time at Cracker Barrel was much more valuable than I realized before I left. While working there, I met various interesting people, and learned a lot about morals, and how food service and retail workers are really treated by the general public. I also learned how to confidently answer phones, and how to work on a team, while also balancing four other customers on top of that."
good,"At first I really liked my job there, but then I started getting fewer and fewer hours. The people are great to work with, and they have very nice benefits, but the hours are not consistent."
good,"Cracker Barrel, like many restaurants, has its slow days and its busy days. Whether it's busy or slow, you can expect to work for your paycheck. There is always something to do and it is worthwhile if you put effort into advancing your career there. You can learn customer service, computer programs, and teamwork through Cracker Barrel. It can occasionally be a bit unorganized but with hard work you can help get things back on track."
good,I've been at cracker barrel for just over a year. It was fun at first but over time the managers stop working with you and never help when you feel stressed or need help. The only reason I have stayed was because I needed the money serving and because I made good friends.
good,Hours were limited at times only getting 13-20 hours a week. Makes it hard to live and pay bills. At times hours are very scarce but then at times i could get up to 30-40 hours. The loss and gain of hours hurts the wallet for sure.
good,a fast pace place to work and easy to make quick money in a short amount of time. the most enjoyable part of the job is meting new people and getting to know people from all over the world.
good,"I made a lot of friends there, meet a lot of people and I would recommend for someone else for employment. My manager was very nice and understanding and I enjoyed working for him."
good,Love my job at that time I was there. Was Shift Leader had the keys to the store when I was working. Did food / supply orders. Check in trucks/ inventory / cashier.
good,Gossip gossip gossip!! Everyone at this particular restaurant loves spreading rumors and management joins in and talks about other employees with employees. Everyone wants to know your business and there quick to share it.
good,"They are more concerned with the bottom line than their employees. Expectations and rules change based on who you are,where you work and who likes you"
good,"I made amazing money as a server there, but it was not a place about teamwork as its advertised whenever you're hired. It's a very sink or swim type job."
good,I enjoyed working there at first .Then they went through some financial cuts and Ceo and home office people and reconstructed everything.It was confusing on what the expectations were and very limited resources to a achieve them.You were the only RM so you had to use your hourly associates wgich was fine as you worked on developing them.I lrft due to the fact my Father was in stage 4 Cancer ledt to care for him.
good,Great management staff.  The GM recently won GM of the year.  Lots of chances to advance but only a few are willing. Training is in depth and follows a logical order.
good,"Some of the people I worked with were amazing, and some of them were really hard to get along with. The server atmosphere was sometimes really competitive."
good,"There's a lot of teamwork instilled in the company training which is better than most serving jobs. Everyone is pretty friendly with each other and the company as a whole has a great working/life philosophy. The only downfall is two table mandatory sections on Sundays, the regular overstaffing of the floor and the lack of cuts made on slow days; it's hard to make money in that scenario. I've worked at another location and made three times the amount of money. A typical day involves running your butt off to deliver any food that comes up, keeping things stocked, trying to roll silverware  to get the heck out of there and a decent amount of side work."
good,The job was not bad. Typically very busy and rushed. No breaks or lunch times. The hrdest part of the job was dealing with the intensity of the rush while keeping quality to standard. The biggestnegatives was the attitudes of the employess during rush times. There tended to be a lot of bickering and yelling. The most enjoyble part of the job was the actul cooking.
good,"High expectations and demands for the amount of money paid hourly.  Availability isn't always followed, scheduling conflicts."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Working here is a very good experience, certainly a good starter job if you want to get into the restaurant business, there is plenty of opportunities for advancement based on performance."
good,"The staff was rude and very clique-ey. they were rude to all new employees, not very helpful, and not welcoming not so ever. the management however is awesome. Its a well run place, but the employees are one major reason people quit."
good,"on at typical work day, I'd come in wash hands prep food and jump on grill line, store is typically busy so there is lots of tickets. lots of serves yelling but that's not a problem it was still good communication. best part of the job was always the other employees, we had great staff."
good,"The company doesn't seem to care much for their servers. Servers are over staffed, while other departments are under staffed. The store I work in seems to be going down hill. Servers are forced to pick up slack in other departments (make salads, sort and wash silverware - which must be rolled in order to get credit card tips at the end of shift, work in dish room, and seat guests)."
good,"In this work environment you have the opportunity for advancement not only in the company but also within personal growth. A fun, family oriented workplace."
good,Very demanding managers. It's not a fun work environment. It's hard to go to the managers with any problems. You're expected to work crazy hours usually doing the job of 3 people.
good,Way too crazy and the managers expect you to do everything even when you have no time. They always are under staff and expect you to carry all the weight.
good,"Its a nice place to work, but with any restauraunt its not a steady income. I love the people I work with, including management. I'm just looking for a more reliable job"
good,High stress fast paced environment with the only real benefit being that you can walk out with money in your pocket. But that's only if you work your butt off and don't have a mental breakdown in the middle of your shift which is fairly common. If you can make it through the first few weeks you can get better and make some real money but I would not recommend serving at Cracker Barrel as your first job.
good,"I really don't have much to say. My coworkers are really what made the job for me. Hours sucked, pay sucked. The customers aren't always good tippers."
good,"•	Served individuals in town and lots of travelers and their families"
good,"You work hard but they pay well, employees are great and the job itself is not bad it is just very stressful and you are at work a lot. I feel like I never see my family."
good,I feel alot of improvement is needed.  Employees take advantage of management.   Alot of times over staffed kitchen on weekends attitudes are awful they act like they are in charge and treat servers aweful but on the plus alot of the employees become family and build friendships which makes it hard to leave
good,Basically this job is physically intensive and at first they'll only give you 11 hours or so a week. After you've advanced to Par 1 they let you work more but if you do start work you till you're burned out and hate going to work everyday. If you can last they have excellent advancement opportunities and after 260 days you can get benefits but only if you work 30+ hours a week. Overall good job if you need something part time nor full time
good,This was my first job I worked as a hostess. The store that I worked at was very busy all the time. The store opens really early in the morning so I would usually work 8 hours every shift.
good,Great place to work especially if you need a more flexible schedule. Staff is pretty laid back and customer's appreciate the good food and down home service.
good,"This is a very fast paced environment, which I enjoyed. I was a hostess, so that kept me on the move constantly. This just wasn't really enough money to work."
good,"Bad management, decent work place culture, tips were decent, and those floors are pretty rough on your feet and knees. Hardest part was the silver-ware and the side work."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"flaws exist with every job and Cracker Barrel is not eximp. "
good,The only reason I left was that I has to relocate to fort Smith to be close to my family the company is a great place to work and I learned so much and would like to be able to work in a place like that again
good,Clean and well organized work place with lots of help from other workers. Everyone really nice and willing to help. Lots of training and test to make you better at your job at hand.
good,"I have worked with store 731 since they opened.  It was nice at first, but the managers seem to have favorites. I have been struggling with receiving the amount of hours I requested, but they do not meet my requirements."
good,"Serving is tough work, but overall my experience was positive. I learned how to deal with difficult people. I appreciated how well they worked with my schedule."
good,A typical day at work was busy but nothing was ever in order the way it should've been so it made other peoples job more difficult.
good,The management definitely shows favoritism and only a few of them actually help servers or cooks when they need it. The employees typically focus on themselves and it isn't a well ran train.
good,"Waitressing was something I have never done, but It was a great experience. Every work place has pros and cons and being a waitress you relied on tips so you had to make sure you satisfied yours customers. My normal work day was greeting people and making small talk while I got there orders, drinks and food. Management was great there , they were very friendly and super helpful knowing it was y first time in this type of work zone. Everyone chipped in to help when I had a question."
good,"Well if you have ever worked in a restaurant, this is about like the rest. Fast pace, messy, and overwhelming sometimes. Not a terrible job but not one of the better ones I've had."
good,"The management was okay for the most part. They scheduled people in accordance with how hard you worked so a hard worker got more hours than a bad worker. The job is difficult and at times overwhelming which is a reality of dishwasher jobs at any restaurant. Holidays are especially overwhelming."
good,"Cracker Barrel is a good place of work, offers vacation, no tip sharing & a friendly environment. I would recommend this job to who ever wants to start serving and have none to little experience."
good,"At first its great. but later on, it felt like it was dragging and the management takes advantage of you and your schedule. It starts to annoy you when you don't have any work hours And your still expected to come in because they need you."
good,I personally did not enjoy my time as a Cracker-barrel employ. The management was sloppy and the jobs themselves did not make you feel vital to the job at all.
good,"When I worked at Cracker Barrel a typical day for me was waiting tables, running food and making sure my guests were taken care of. Management was good and the co- workers were fun to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to make new relationships with people."
good,"Some days at work I felt unwanted by the other co-workers, the manager's were great at listening.  The hardest part of the job was working retail and cashier at the same time."
good,"-It was mostly busy especially being a cashier"
good,"I enjoyed working for Cracker Barrel, and their many opportunities for advancement. For the most part, they treat their employees well, but management grew to working 80 hour weeks at the end with no day off for over a month."
good,a very good good place I really enjoyed working there and as a result it helped me with my family and friends and my social life
good,great job. flexible  schedule. pay is slim until many many years in this position. would have worked this job forever if pay equated work
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Cracker barrel has been a good start for me. I worked here the whole time I was in college and they always worked with my schedule. The job itself is not difficult but management is hard to deal with at times. The idea week is a about 12 -15 hours with 4-5 hour shifts.
good,The employees are great and I love doing my job. They dont work around your schedules very well. Since I work in retail we are expected to sell and our sales indicates our hours. its very hard to sell stuff to people who just ate and want to go home. the manager pushes you to sell too much and expects you to able to do it.
good,"Wasn't guaranteed hours.  Might get 28 on one pay check and 25 on another unless there was a holiday."
good,Cracker Barrel is a good just for a college student. The shifts are generally short but there are always shifts to pick up. Not a lot of opportunity for advancement.
good,Offers a week paid vacation and 401k to all employees after 3 years this changes to two weeks paid vacation. Very flexible with schedules and staff is often very friendly.
good,"I don't like the hours I am given, as some weeks I get none and others I have many. There are very unstable in regards to scheduling. Apart from that, it's a very enjoyable work place. The training is not the best, depending on who is in charge, etc."
good,"I have been a waitress at Cracker Barrel for over four years now. There are great benefits for par 4's including 35% off food and items in the gift shop, paid time off, and flexible schedules."
good,"Strong company, can be fun & enjoyable. high expectations & work days are long.  Salaried for 50 hour week, but realisticly 60+ every week. Staffing is a challenge due to low pay grids.. The majority of staff works well together, theres always the few that are in it for themselves, company prides its self on the employee experience, which is great for hourly but fall short on the managers experience."
good,"I enjoy working at Cracker Barrel. The staff are very team oriented and good people. The customers are demanding and you are expected to fulfill all their requests in a timely fashion. There is a lot of sidework as well. Sometimes you can make good money, other times you won't get much, it is a bit inconsistent. All in all cracker barrel is a good place to work and the staff and managers make the trouble worth it."
good,cracker barrel is a good place to work for someone who is looking for alittle extra money but im really looking to get out of the food business i dont really like to work in a restaurant
good,"Cracker Barrel was my first job, so I was there a lot longer than I should have been. I was scared to leave because I didn't know anything different. All the management cares about is turning tables, get them out fast so they can get more in. Which is okay because that's how the servers make their money. They don't sell alcohol and have really good deals so checks are usually cheap which means tips are cheap. So getting as many tables in is number one. The food was usually good but the kitchen could have been a lot cleaner, and the staff could have been a lot nicer."
good,"Great for 20 years. Over the last two  years had some differences could not work out."
good,"its a fun filled place to work, meet new people and a wonderful opportunity. had a morning shift, woked well with my co workers. the managment was kinda off a little bit but at the end of the day we all got along. the hardest part of my job was dealing with co-workers who slacked on there job. everyone get paid to work so i feel everyone should do what they are paid to do.the most enjoyable part of my job was seeing and making everyone smile"
good,The workplace was very friendly and enjoyable. It was also clean and well managed. It was hard to get hours though as a new employee and I was not able to keep the job due to relocation.
good,"The GM played favorites, I was not a favorite, so my opinion is probably different than most. I busted my butt 6 days a week here, slow nights were slow with little to no money (oftentimes they would send you home upon arrival). The sidework was meticulous and sometimes took 90+ minutes. I did learn excellent customer service strategies and how to work quickly. Sunday mornings were terribly busy and resulted in quite a few tears from many servers. The money wasn't the best but that was probably due to being so close to Saginaw, MI."
good,I enjoyed my fellow host but the management changed very often and it definitely had an effect on the culture. Overall it was a good experience but I was ready for something new.
good,"cracker barrel is a very busy place to work with people traveling year round, there's never a dull moment. guest come and get the at home feeling every time you come in. from the gift shop to the food everything is just so pleasant. I learned a lot about multi-tasking because that's what you have to do once it gets busy it stays busy."
good,"A typical day of work at Cracker Barrel seems to always fly by with the high volume of guest that visit the establishment requiring all employees to work at a high-pace while also accomplishing a variety of tasks. While working at Cracker Barrel I have learned a great deal about customer service, food safety, sales techniques, and developed a better understanding of the financial perspective of operating a business."
good,Not a bad place to work you can expect to be a grill cook at least half of the time though if you are not willing to put in more then ten hours a day you will be not looked at a good manager
good,"Cracker Barrel provides excellent job work life balance with incredible flexibility in scheduling.  I have been a student the entire time I have worked for Cracker Barrel and they have always been able to work around my school schedule.  The pay is average in the restaurant industry, but being a server the tips are general good because of the customer loyalty to the brand.  They have some of the most strict rules and procedures I have seen, but they have these in place in order to protect the brand."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Staff became close friends, Co- workers helped each other with our responsibilities. "
good,The coworkers were always really nice and fun to work with.  We learned how to meet the guest's needs.  The management was great!  They were always having fun while getting the job done and they always kept you engaged.  The hardest part of the job was getting guest to buy what we were currently sampling or had special sales on.  Especially if they were grumpy.  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to wear the new clothes we were displaying and sampling the foods.
good,"I love the people that I work with. That's it. I don't appreciate the way the managers treat you, the guests that think they can talk down to you, and the pay."
good,"You reach pay raise limit quickly capping out when you make par 4 . Not much room for moving up , but easy to move around to different to jobs within the company.Fight for weekends off or even days off in a row . Work holidays."
good,-very stressful with overcrowded work areas.. Coworkers were rude and  management was callous. Favoritism was rampant.
good,"I was always busy learning their way of doing things.Cracker Barrell is a good company and the food is great.I was impressed with my coworkers in the back kitchen,alot of hard work goes on there."
good,A typical day at work would be to greet and assist the guest. Run the cash register. I have learned how important it is to make the customers feel like family. The management at CB is always evolving. My co-workers are very friendly and hardworking. The hardest part of this job is the turnover of employees. The most enjoyable part of this job is the flexibility .
good,"Its a good company to work for. Really nice people their, good atmosphere restaurant management is good. I liked getting to know the regular customers, they would always come in stop and see you at the cash stand before walking over to the hostess stand."
good,I enjoy working for Cracker Barrel. They provide a lot of amenities for their employee's. The store that I work at is a very up beat environment. We are very busy on the weekends and in the summer time.
good,"Adapting to the needs of guest, co-workers, and management. The hardest part of the job was staying positive and patient with everyone, even in situations that I did not like to find myself in."
good,"The work was good. The hours were very few and you would get sent home early often. Daily I was yelled at by a co-worker who would take my tools. This same co-worker was known for yelling at women. I reported him to management and they said they would deal with it. His behavior never changed. I became very concerned when a male co-worker told me that this same man had been yelling at him and throwing food items at him in the freezer. I reported it to the management and again I was told, ""it's just ___ being ___. You get used to him after awhile."" I left the day that same co-worker started throwing things at me and was kicking the garbage buckets at me. "
good,"A typical day of work here would include unorganized moments, management would always get upset easy during busy hours as well as not giving the proper persons emergency call notices. Co-workers where easy going and helpful most of the time. The hardest part of the job was trying to help everyone as well as properly take to go phone orders when someone had a really long to go phone order. The most enjoyable part of this job was getting money everyday."
good,I enjoy working here. Have been with company for a long time and they are awesome people to work for. I would tell anyone to work here.
good,"Paying the restaurant and retail guests out, while offering guests targeted sale items. "
good,"The most difficult part of working for Cracker Barrel is the fact that you feel easily replaceable. The managers are all great and the trainers do their job, but the constant flow of employees was intimidating."
good,It was busy and I learned a lot about good customer service. Management worked with my school schedule. I was treated well and  my co-workers would teach me things as well.
good,Nice place to work. Learned a lot about people. This company strives for excellence and provides an excellent guest and employee experience.
good,"no real growth with company, dead in job, no work life balance"
good,"Overall, this is a nice place to work. Some guests are regulars and it's nice to be able to get to know them by name and vice versa. The managers are friendly, understanding, and they listen to you. Although I do not know everyone, the coworkers I work most closely with, I have never had any issues. "
good,I learned a lot in customer service and merchandise. I loved dealing with the truck and organizing the back! I loved changing the store around it made it interesting.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,A typical day at work is fun and outgoing. You get to meet new people and make new friends. The work enviornment is great. The managers are okay. There are some that have favorites and treat other employees better than one another. They also cut hours when it gets slow. The hardest part of the job is dealing with people who are mean and angry. The most enjoyable part is being able to meet and interact with new people and make them happy.
good,A typical day being a server at Cracker Barrel is stressful. You want to do everything you can to make each and every guests experience a great one so they continue to come back and eat again.
good,"At Cracker Barrel I am making a good amount of money in tips, but the management lacks motivation and there are not many hours available. The training is unorganized and running out of popular entrees on a daily basis makes for a stressful environment."
good,"Cracker barrel does keep you busy to pass time during the day but drama seems to be an issue when hours come in the picture, if one person complains about you not working a certain time then you are to work that time and they no longer do and your personal life doesn't seem to matter much in the matter."
good,hardest part about this job is customers and trying to keep them happy. the managers do not want to go out and talk to the guests if something is wrong they want to sit back and let you do all the work. I love the people I work with but the people who have been there for forever try to push you around and tell you what to do. the pay sucks my check is never over $10 because they take taxes out of your tips and you can actually end up owing the company money!!
good,"My work here simply entailed seating guests in an orderly fashion, making sure they were aware of any daily specials, and that any needs they had during their dining experience were met. My job also consisted of making sure that the dining room areas and restrooms were clean, that any guests needing assistance in any way were taken care of in a prompt and thorough manner, and ensuring that the serving staff is taking care of the guests to the best of their ability. My experience here has taught me a great deal about communicating with coworkers, superiors, and guests. I have also learned a great deal about meeting deadlines, and training new employees. The most difficult part of the job is making sure that every guest has the best dining experience possible each and every time they visit. The most rewarding and enjoyable part of the job is the opportunity to form relationships with guests and coworkers alike that do a great deal to enrich ones life."
good,"Start out slow, but move into a very busy day or night. I learned that I can do anything I put my mind to. The management was stern. My co-workers were reliable and hard working. The hardest part of my job was not to over eat. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the co-workers."
good,Working at cracker barrel is fun. Working in the back of the house is a great place to work. Front of the house is interesting.
good,"Great co-workers but managers show favoritism at times"
good,"While I enjoyed working here, the advancement did not work the way I was led to believe. I worked hard and met all their standards but was not properly promoted."
good,Fun and productive environment with enjoyable co workers.
good,busy during the morning and luch shifts. management was very helpful in feedback about server's performance. co-workers were somewhat friendly and welcoming. co-workers were also very helpful. hardest part of the job was the way the restaurant wanted servers to carry the food trays. most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know my guests
good,A normal work day for Cracker Barrel starts with stocking up the coolers on the grill lines. The rest of the day is filled with keeping checks under 10 minutes and getting quality food to the customers while keeping your work area clean and sanitary.
good,A typical day of work for me consists of washing dishes as well as helping out sometimes in the grill worker.
good,"Deal with people from all walks of life."
good,"Can be very long days. "
good,"I was advanced twice to a Par 2 server. Enjoyed the management team, co-workers, and guest."
good,Its a great place to work. The managers and employees are all great. The money just isn't stable and most of the time didn't make enough to take care of my family.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of always looking neat. Anticipating the customers needs and staying busy. I learned that the customer is always right and that a good attitude goes a long way. The management team at Cracker barrel were always on top of things and made sure employees were staying productive. The co-workers at cracker barrel were for the most part negative and didn't seem happy where they were at followed by lots of complaints. The hardest part of the job for me was explaining to the guests there food has been made wrong or the kitchen is just taking a while, it always made me feel bad for the customer because I knew that it was not there fault.  The most enjoyable part of cracker barrel was being able to interact with such a diverse range of people. I loved seeing people satisfied and loved I helped them feel that way. Also I enjoyed the compliments I received from many of my guests."
good,"I would clock in, prepare the grill for the day, and do other preparation steps. I would cook the orders sent back to me and get yelled at by the servers if they were having a bad day. The hardest part of the job was not getting breaks/lunches while working. "
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I was a hostess here which I liked a lot. Some days if we were busy I would clean off tables and even serve them.  I also on some days did the retail store and would set up displays and at night would unload and put away the truck.
good,It was always something new and exciting going on. I was never bored. There was always so many cool stuff to get people attention with. It really show me how to become a great retailer and how to improved my customers skills.
good,Everybody gets along with each other and there is good teamwork. The thing I do not like is that there is a lot of favortism.
good,"The work day there was always busy and hectic but sometimes would slow down, but would be drama. I learned how to serve my customers and train new hire's. The management there was terrible and always took sides of people that were there longer than others, and had favoritism. Made some friends along the way but a lot of them would yell and cuss at me and treat me bad just because there were older than me. The hardest part of my job there was putting up with the rude co-workers on a busy day and never got helped out. The only thing that i enjoyed was making some friends along the way and getting close with some of the regular customers."
good,A typical day at work starts off pretty slow depending on what shift you come in for. I always learn new things like how to handle certain situations and different people. My management team is not the best some are better at leading than others. The hardest part of the job is trying to stay positive when we get over worked or just extremely busy trying to continue being a team player and making sure all of your guests have what they need and are satisfied. What I enjoy most about my job are the many friendly people that I encounter on a daily basis you never know who you might run into.
good,"Managing your time as the night passes making sure all work is complete by store opening. cleaning under the fryers is the most difficult part of the job, having to throw water under them and get on your hands and knees to check. nice when working alone."
good,"A typical day at work is sometimes stressful depending on the days, I learned working as a team is very helpful than working alone. my coworkers are like family at work. They can lighten your day. The managers have their days. the hardest part of my job would have to be during lunch time when lots of people come on for lunch trying to limit their time & we don`t have enough tables. Also when they come in as parties. The best part of the day is seeing the children & seeing their smiling faces coming into work."
good,I would come in and stand at the host podium until someone would come to be seated I had to seat in a specific order. I learned better customer service. The management was good. In order for them to remember a lot you had to ask several times. I was there for about two years before I got a raise or promoted and even when I was promoted I wasn't scheduled a lot of shifts and when I asked why they never answered. My co-workers were fun very business oriented. The Hardest part of my job again would be the rude customers when I would seat them somewhere they didn't like they would get really aggressive with me. The most enjoyable part was my regulars they always were able to put a smile on my face.
good,"New experience for me, but it is a very warm and exciting place to work. I have learned a lot about restaraunts since I started here. Co-workers are awesome people and we all work as a team. The hardest part is kepping the dining room balanced and on a rotation schedule."
good,"very friendly employees , and you actually have someone training you if you new in the kitchen where i was working ."
good,"The company does pay employees well, actually above average. It gives clear defined career path for hourly employees to advance to store management. Very good at giving bonuses."
good,"Cracker Barrel is a company with very solid values, but on a small scale is incredibly political. The management team does more to prevent promotion than to create promotion opportunities and any promotion opportunity is not done in a timely manner. Certain workers are valued over others not by skill but by job description: i.e. grill cooks over servers. So, if a grill cook and a server clash, chances are it's the server's job on the line just because servers are easier to replace. As a server, it seems like you're attacked from every side: If the guest isn't mad for having to wait for their food, the grill cook is mad you asked for the food; It's a very dog-eat-dog position to be in. The hardest part of the job really is getting it done: There are seldom shifts that are smooth or enjoyable, and it seems as if there is not money in serving."
good,"A typical day as a server consisted of constant cleaning up and preparing for the next ""rush."" I learned how to mingle with all personality types/walks of life."
good,They never promote from within and barely pay minimum wage.
good,This company is deliberate in training employees and accomidating the guest. Cracker Barrel is a place that will help individuals aquire absolute customer service relational skills and develope communication.
good,The have a great par test that helps you work your way up. Managers come and go and are often not the best at their job. Cool people to work with. Easy tasks.
good,"Friendly atmosphere, teamwork, family oriented, advancement opportunities, benefits, paid vacations, work schedule flexibility, various positions available"
good,If they like you  it’s easy. Personality matters. Work life balance requires you to voice your opinion about schedules and even requesting weekends off to get them from time to time
good,"The management is okay at times. They make a lot of things confusing and then yell at you if you get it wrong. The customers are pretty good. Sometimes they can be extremely rude and change tables without asking first, so it messes up the whole process."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,A typical day at work would be very messy working in the dish room. the smell was horrible and you never got a break unless you worked 5 hours or more.
good,Going in setting my station up greeting tables waiting on tables doing closing duties which consist of being cleaning rolling silverware mainly 100% people pleasing .Being team players was always a big thing to me. Greet others tables if the other couldn't get there . Try to stay positive all day it was very hard all it took was just that one that could get everyone in a uproar. I learned to be responsible and revery responsible and dependable and a lot of times to bite your tongue e
good,"I worked as a dishwasher and it was a very physically tasking job with little reward or acknowledgment. If you aren't a manager or a waiter, you basically do the majority of the work and reap barely any of the benefits."
good,"I've worked here over a year and it's been great, but I've come to realize that the managers really make or break your entire job. I've had people just walk out because they hated it so much. I've almost gotten there myself. Retail is a great place to be chill and kinda bored the whole shift, but work with a good manager. Restaurant has tips, more stress, and managers that may or may not have any sympathy for you at all. It's a gamble, but you may like it."
good,"come in and sart on dishes"
good,Very fast paced environment on weekends and holidays. Good tips most days but very stressful and managers are demanding. Very loud and hectic in the kitchen.
good,"The staff is pretty friendly. The management seems to lack good communication and have poor scheduling occasionally. A couple don't treat the staff too nicely, but the others are more understanding. Working at Cracker Barrel can be a blast; it just depends on who you work for."
good,This is a good place to work if ur not looking for many hours or much money. They have a lot of servers on the floor and u receive no more then 3-4 tables a night. Not a good place to work if u have a family to support
good,I enjoy working here but the management SUCKS. Unorganized and rude. They don’t make you feel appreciated as an employee. They gave new hires all of the hours this week. The general manager is good and one of the assistants but the other two think they’re above everyone and that they run everything  also the servers that have been there for a while treat you like you’re stupid.
good,"Everyone has the same amount of work. Promotes teamwork. The worst thing was taking out other servers trays that are incorrect, etc. Cooks won't give you the correct sides without re-ringing the order, even if it's their mistake."
good,Current employee. I love my job because I love being a server . Very fast paced job. Money is definitely worth the hours you work . Very flexible hours .
good,"CB was an interesting experience. Upon being hired, you are flown to Lebanon, TN where you spend a week put up in a hotel and commuting via provided shuttle to the home office. Following one's first week, you then get to go  spend three weeks in a training restaurant which may or may not be in your home state. At the end of the time at the training restaurant, you are flown back to TN to spend two weeks back at the home office. The dream of becoming a General Manager is painted with a salary of $100,000. Unfortunately, the three locations that I was in did not honor the mission of the brand, the cultures were broken, and the expectation to work 70+ hours per week was omnipresent. I would not recommend this employer."
good,It's okay as a job but not for me as a career option. The communication with the management team is not to be desired. The employees get away with things that they should be terminated for.
good,Cracker Barrel was an easy place to work except it was hard to live off of the wages. Servers did not make that much so it was difficult to make ends meet sometimes.
good,"As a full-time student and just need a job on the side then it was a good option for me. They work around your schedule and most of the managers were pretty amazing. Was able to learn from this job, they're a great company.  The only downside is having a discount to use all my money on."
good,You work without breaks and most managers are not understanding or receptive to the needs of their employees. The guests are usually pleasant and the discount is really good.
good,"Cracker Barrel of Cookeville TN was a good dependable job. I learned a lot about cooking and preparing food. Customer service was a must,as well as cleanliness."
good,"It used to be really great working here and I would have never thought about quitting. It truly was great and everyone felt like family, but this past year management has been poor and even with a family feel it can make the job miserable. Only two managers though. They don't treat you as you should be treated and are only out for their needs and don't compromise well. "
good,Managers didnt care much about cleanliness. Lazy staff. Team members dirty habits routinely sickened me for lack of clean procedures. No teamwork apparent. Constantly hiring young kids with no work or life value
good,"I began my first real serving job at Cracker barrel earlier this year. I learned a lot about the job industry both in and out of work and Enjoyed the culture of the business. The hardest part of the job was completing the side-work in a timely manner, but the tips were pretty decent. Management did a pretty good job, given that during my time with Cracker Barrel we replaced three different management positions, with no end in sight. I taught myself about how having a strong work ethic is crucial to succeeding in life. Cracker Barrel was a great first job, but i'm ready to move foreward and begin on a more permanent career path."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"As a server of many years, and also supporting myself. I need to make money. Cracker barrel has good benefits, vacation time, however, the money is not good. If you can stick it out a couple years you will actually get good shifts and sections and make ok money, I only worked in one store my management was a revolving door of people who were mostly inexperienced and terrible but that's all corporate restaurants. You can take time off unless its a holiday then you need permission. receive awesome discountst at the store."
good,It’s not all that bad I was a dishwasher and I just didn’t like it I wanted to do something that I would do for the rest of my life till I retire and enjoy my work experience.
good,Was ok but i worked i 7 hour shift once without a break extream heat the whole time above the 400 degree flattop  pay was decent tho they should take better care of there employees
good,Cracker Barrel was a fast-paced kitchen with largely corporate values and cooking techniques. The kitchen and the serving staff had a consistent amount of mishaps and confusion about food but overall the restaurant worked as a well oiled machine
good,Your co workers are great. It feels like a family. If you work hard you will receive the hours you deserve. Paid weekly is also great. Managers push you to work hard
good,"very busy, and constantly moving work place. all teams members great to work with. Management staff very knowledgeable"
good,"Some admin"
good,My experience was less than desirable. I never received the health care I was told I would qualify for nor was the pay adequate. Over all I think that this would be a great job for younger kids in high school or those who won't depend on it as sole income.
good,"What I learned from the company "
good,"Probably the weirdest, busiest restaurant I've ever worked at. Most mornings you are on a wait. Servers cut hosts off, steal tables, harasss hosts. Management fails to intervene.The GM is kind of petty and only staffs appropriately on days that she works."
good,"It is a great job as long as you have good managers, the food is good, a majority of the customers tip well and are fun to talk with. As long as you and the other servers work together when things get hard it is a very good job."
good,"i really loved working at cracker barrel, only downfall is the boss favored employees who been with the company since they opened. so there was favoritism. if that is something you don't care about you can go in make your money and  go home."
good,"I would go in for my shift, communicate with the previous hostess on what still had to be done such organize the station, bring more silverware, or check restrooms."
good,"It is a great company to work for, but as a hostess it can become hard sometimes because the servers can get rude.  The servers don't understand how hard other positions are and think you are there just for them."
good,it was a very competive  job and if you were not even semi decent you were not paid in full. From past management if you were not liked your hours were cut down very short.
good,"The management at Cracker Barrel truly care about the needs and circumstances of their employees. I occasionally suffer from panic or anxiety attacks, and management are quick to either talk me through it or to cut me off of the floor--even during a rush--if things are too much for you. Hours are flexible and my co-workers were wonderfully cheery people."
good,"I loved being a server, but not at Cracker Barrel well this particular Cracker Barrel rather. The co workers were very rude and disrespectful. Though I loved my managers."
good,It is a family styled restaurant. you are given a flexible schedule and you get to take all your tip home (cash or card). there wages are very competitive.
good,The management is sufficient and the coworker relationship sufficed. It has an order to it but comes with many unpredictable problems that are easy to tackle as long as you have great people skills and a tremendous amount of patience.
good,It's was fun learning new things and meeting new people. Working g for them was great but sometime they would try to take advantage of my kindness like trying to get me to do more than my job title.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Had to move back home where I had family and help. Very personal reason to why I had to leave. Management was not understanding to my situation so I was wrote as a no call no show. I did call but I didn't show up due to I was in a different state all in one night.
good,I did not really have any problems with Cracker Barrell.  I left because i moved to another state.  The food was mediocre and lacked seasoning.  The store inside sold things that were strange and overpriced.
good,"Very stressful place to work, seems like there is a lack of communication between management. Sometimes you work long hours without any breaks. There is time for advancement every 3 months but hard to get your reviews."
good,"Fast-paced job with great emphasis on customer service. In addition to the image that Cracker Barrel intends to maintain, many of the customers at my particular location were cancer patients who had come by for lunch after visiting the nearby hospital, increasing the importance of the customers care, comfort and services provided."
good,"I made really good friends with some of the people I worked with there. Most of the management was good and fair. The stress level is just too much though. Sometimes, it's like you and the crew just can't keep up with work. Too much is going on and there's not enough time or people to accomplish anything."
good,"When you start out as a host, they start you at minimum wage. Depending on what point in the shift, things will either be quite slow or quite busy. If you work 3 or 4 to close- it will be slow the first 2 hours and suddenly pick up. Before long you're running across the restaurant trying to get people seated, busing tables, and taking to-go orders if the servants are too busy. Once all tables are seated, we had to begin a wait list and sometimes they would stretch to be 45 minutes. We had to seat in server rotation, which potentially caused a lot of issues and tension between the host and the server if the guest decided they wanted to sit somewhere else or if a server was skipped for any other reason. Everyone was always going and there was a lot of gossip and drama in the workplace. "
good,"Non-stop dishes, back acing work. Collected and washed dishes everyday. The management was good and understanding. Had to wash a lot of dirt dishes, was not fun"
good,The 4 years I have been with this company has taught me how to please people with purpose. Also how to resolve a guest complaint with no problem. I've learned how to manage multiple things at once to get the job done. The management team is supportive on the decisions you make. They are capable of working with your schedule to what you please. A day at Cracker Barrel can be up paced and a constant motive to keep moving.
good,The managers are nice and understanding. You feel right at home working here. It provides great benefits and the people who work there are kind. Would recommend to a friend.
good,"good place to make money very busy at times, just needs better management  communication as well as more staff scheduled when needed. you meet all different types of people whom you get to know well"
good,"there were always call outs from associates.  not everyone worked together, the kitchen staff that is.  i worked in the retail part and dealt with the complaints coming from bad experiences in the dining part."
good,"You have free time to meet and talk to new people. For people who don't know how to"
good,Management staff is very difficult to work with. Advancement is very easy and almost required to maintain full working hours. Job security is a religion and over exaggerated. Hours are difficult in the Servers and hostesses due to overstaffing. Training is adequate and basic but not enough to cultivate strong skills. Job culture is run by those with experience and much management power is given to them in the case of a simple phone call to corporate.  Benefits are all offered to those who meet the fulltime requirements. Discounts are offered but very limited. My recommendation is based on the fact that it provides proper basic skills to be used to advance to a better opportunity. Many areas left for improvement.
good,"it can be slow at times, management is very understanding that life happens around outside of work. serving is very hard when you dont have an open schedule. more money can be made when an open schedule is available"
good,You are greeted warmly by the staff. Managers are somewhat helpful. The hardest part of the job is getting everyone to work together to get the job done.
good,I loved the discount I got so I could shop in the store. Flexible hours.  Managers are nice and work with you rather the watch you work. Team work is  The dream work they would always say. Great  atmosphere to work in.
good,Working there is fun but it doesn't pay enough unless you get the right schedules. Working for tips also means that you never know what you're gonna make. I could make 200 one day and then 100 on the same shift. Not consistent at all.
good,"seated customers helped with cashier. rolled silverware, was on call and helped serve food, swept, mopped and cleaned a lot. were very clean and organized"
good,"As a host, you stand in the front to greet guests, seat them, and organize menus. It takes a little bit of time to use the computer to seat our guests. The hardest part of the job is working during a rush. On Sunday, it'll stay busy for hours. When managers notice that their workers are having a difficult time, they offer to help with no hesitation. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with my employees and guests. Cracker Barrel is a friendly, clean, and cozy environment."
good,"The environment is okay about half the time, but certain days and holidays get insane if there is not more than 3 people working in the dishroom."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"As a merchandise handler you are a lot of how the store and stock room constantly looks. Heavy lifting, floor moves, over nights etcetera. Super low pay for this position."
good,"I worked at Cracker Barrel for 1 year and I did love it for the most part. The training is very in depth, and you don't go onto the floor before your ready to exactly as needed. The employees that I worked with were mostly amazing people, and Cracker Barrel promotes a family attitude towards fellow coworkers. My only complaint is the management. They started to bring in new managers to the Bentonville location and they constantly clashed with the managers that were there previously. This made it very difficult to do my job because I was being told two different ways of doing everything. The scheduling is also horrible. After a year they start to schedule you less and less until you have to beg for work and I did not like that. I saw them do it to multiple employees including myself."
good,"Great management. Long hours one day, short the next. Too many people with clip boards demanding things. Side work is ridiculous,  too many teenagers. If you are a server, and you get cut from the floor, it is at least 2 hours before you can actually leave. Servers have to run other servers food, plus their own, plus buss everyone else's tables. The dish room is disgusting. No one wants to answer the phone or fill the ice bins. I have worked as a server for many years, and this place is the hardest place I have ever served. If they would let the servers be servers it would be better, but we are expected to do much more than we should"
good,The management does a great job of running the restaurant but the people that came in we're very rude and the money was terrible I was actually happy to find a new job to leave this place
good,Good pay and a good place to work. Very fast paced and at times can be stressful. But any job is stressful at times. When I worked there management was fine but none of the managers work there that did when I was employed there.
good,"On a typical day at work I would be standing behind the  cashier desk and fulfill my job task as a cashier. I learned how to handle rude customers usually on a day to day basis. The management was fair but wasn't the best. The workplace culture was very interesting. a lot of information one could attain from the restaurant. The hardest part of the job was handling the customers. Most were nasty, rude old people who would treat the employees like they were worthless but then throughout the day you would have some that were nice. The most enjoyable part of the job I would have to say would be seeing the guest faces leaving out on a full empty stomach knowing that they would have to come in and come out to greet you and acknowledge  you on their was out, telling you about their experience!"
good,"Management needs a little work. There are things here and there that needs work along with it, but other than that I love the people there."
good,"The company in general really cares about their workers, but you really have to be willing to give up your family life. Also there is an extreme push to make all sales metrics, its almost a do or die situation. The stress may not be with the pay."
good,"It takes a lot for me to complain in a workplace, but this is one of the most unorganized companies I've ever worked for. Despite the heavy communication that's expected, the managers never seem to have a clue of what's going on, and additionally they have a tendency to be incredibly rude to their employees. I love all of my coworkers, and the family-oriented environment is great, but I wish that the management mirrored that ideal."
good,"Absolutely loved my co workers, super outgoing and we always got along. Managers were fun and good to work with, sometimes got hard on you.. but they were only making you better. I enjoyed the job a lot."
good,"I would come in to work and get greeted by all my co-workers, The ones on the clock and the ones going off the clock.All the mangers have an understanding upon things."
good,"Cracker Barrel is typically a pretty busy restaurant. You can make good money if you work for it. The store is located across the street from the mall, so it stays busy."
good,I loved serving for this company. Every Thursday I would get to meet newly graduated solders from Ft. Sill and their family's and just get to know a little bit about people from different areas of the USA.
good,"The job was usually tolerable, but you were lucky to ever get a break, especially if you were short on people. I was not well suited for the very fast paced environment in which the speed was set by people who broke regulations and did very sloppy work. Mandatory work on holidays without any extra compensation was also very unpleasant."
good,Cracker barrel was a great place to work at. The managers and employees were like family. The work place was always very upbeat and welcoming. Everyone there felt more like a family than employees. The only problem I ran into there was that I wasn't getting barely any hours when they were away that my son was soon to be born.
good,"always busy which i liked, advanced in level system, nice but firm management, sometimes forced into untrained position but that helped me learn on the job, hardest part was closing. lots of freindly workers and managers"
good,"Cracker Barrel of Greenville, TX is a moderate place to work if you are in high school or if you are currently looking to earn a little side cash.  It is a fun place to work at first, but the politics of this location get very trying."
good,"Consistently busy, Good hours for back of house, management is usually stressed and running around trying to get too many things done. At my particular store the general manager treats the managers unprofessionally, and is rude to the general staff, but that reflects our store not cracker barrel as a whole."
good,Over all a good place to work. The people who work there are good people and the guests are very nice as well. The food is really good too.
good,My favorite part about the job is that my salary was based on how hard I worked. I met many regular guest that changed my life. They helped me grow as a person. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry guest.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Im not completely satisfied with the way the managers treat the employees. I would have to say this employer does not show a very professional work environment.
good,Good place to work and fast paced. Learned great time management as well as teamwork. I typical day you would first check your tables and make sure everything was stocked. Make sure everything is clean and up to standards. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers.
good,"I have thoroughly enjoyed working at Cracker Barrel, the friends that I have made will last a lifetime, however it is time for a change. Dealing with some incompetent managers as well as with the public can be quite challenging and probably as difficult as the job itself gets. The money can be great as a server but for every good day there will likely be bad ones. I have had a great time branching out and putting my people skills to use."
good,"I don't believe in bashing previous employers.While I did make good money as a server there, working at this establishment just wasn't my cup of tea. That's all I have to really say about it."
good,The management/ owners were great people to work for. They stood behind their employees when sales were refused due to under age purchases.
good,"I started working at Cracker Barrel when I was a minor. I got quite a few hours while I was training but after that not so much. I worked once a week for three-maybe four if I was lucky-hours. "
good,"I have been with this company sixteen years.  I worked in three different stores and done everything you could possibly do at this store.  I quit at sixteen years.  I left three weeks paid vacations, and full PAR IV benefits.  I will tell you, you are only as good as your management team and team players in this business.  If you don't have a good team working together, you can just kiss making money good bye!  I have work with some of this best, and some of the worst.  I know!  Made allotta money though!  The most enjoyable part of  this job is counting your money at the end of the day!  The hardest day is Sunday!  Always the busiest. Co-workers come and go, but only the good ones last!  If you pay attention though this company will teach you how to make money, and skills you will never forget!  Best job training I ever had, and taught valuable skills."
good,"This is a great food/retail company if you wanna grow. They offer pay raises and more the longer you stay. They had a few managers which was nice, you were never alone. The hours were crazy long and there was always a constant flow, you never had time to sit and eat or even use the bathroom."
good,"Working for cracker barrel was okay they were kind of strict and didnt want to seem to want to work with me they actually started cutting my hours without ever really telling me why. I would go in and go 30 sometimes 45 minutes without a table. the people that work there with me, some of them were rude, i didn't care for this job except for SOME of my coworkers were decent and helpful to work with. i enjoyed the 'guests' though, the customers hakf made it worth it, for the most part."
good,"Duties include cleaning, stocking, food running, and tending to guests needs. Teamwork is important and you're expected to go above and beyond to help your co-workers and your guests."
good,I didnt like some of the policies in working for a corperate restaurant. i think people shouldnt have felt rushed. but i did enjoy my coworkers and the managers that that liked mking everyone feel important.
good,"getting a section, taking down food orders, taking out beverages, upselling different food products, delivering the orders, taking payment"
good,"The days go by fast with a lot to do. The work is not too hard but there is always something new to learn. The staff that you grow closer to is the best part. While the way employees are graded by managers is poor, the managers themselves treat everyone apart of one big family."
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel allows you to make money and still get an education. I like the way they put school services first, but they ensure that you are doing your job and tending to guests."
good,"The hardest part of the job was the sheer number of hours scheduled . 60-70 hours was not uncommon."
good,I host and set people. The managers are great and my co workers are very sweet.
good,"load the dishwasher, keep the area dry, overnight cleaning I would sweep/mop floors, clean kitchen, clean dining area and prep food"
good,"A typical day at Cracker Barrel was very busy, which was great for me I enjoy staying busy time passes by faster, I learned how to keep calm and still do multiple things at one time. The managers were great very involved when we got busy they would work the food for us. The co workers were awesome, everyone came together and worked as a team. The hardest part was making sure everything for my tables were taken care of, the most enjoyable part was meeting new faces everyday."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Typical day would be working with fun peers, even when it gets hectic and seeing all the regulars come in for good food and a smiling face! I learned how to work on multiple things at once when I started serving and in retail my biggest lesson was how to suggestive sale items in the store. My manager was amazing. She made us feel like a team and also made us feel like it was more than a job. Of course in a fast paced envoriment you are going to have tough times that stress everyone out but my co-workers helped a lot when I needed it. The hardest part was when someone laid out on a really busy day and we ended up short handed. But the managers always helped us wether it was running trays, making drinks, or helping clean the retail floor, which would have been the most enjoyable part of the job just seeing all the amazing team work! Also the Christmas parties!"
good,"Cracker Barrel Is a job that can give you mixed feelings. A typical day at Cracker Barrel involves doing what you are assigned to do for that day. At this job I have learned that sacrifices will have to be made when working and hard work will be noticed. Management in my opinion is very corrupt and greedy. Managers also play favoritism which is against company policy. Some employees will do whatever they want and management will let them. The co-workers are nice and friendly, some are impatient and inconsiderate. The hardest part of the job is when things get busy and emotions/attitudes are in the air. People tend to snap on each other when something doesn't go their way. The best part of the job is making new friends. I can honestly say, I have made quiet a few friends working for this company."
good,"My coworkers were amazing teammates. We all did the best we could to help each other during every shift. We weren't afraid to ask for help. I learned that helping others hugely benefits myself, both during shifts and off shifts, when I could remain friends with my coworkers. The most difficult part of the job was realizing I needed to find a more challenging workplace, where I can put my writing and people skills to a more fulfilling use."
good,I have learned how to multitask while still keeping a positive outgoing environment. Working with customers have taught me how to approach many different situations and personalities.
good,"Although there were many tasks and responsibilities, The compensation did not best fit the position"
good,Worked in retail and loved all the sales products offered to customers.  Worked with all kinds of people and mostly everyone is friendly and easy to get along with.  PAR level achievements were great opportunities to fine-tune and learn new skills and well as boost morale when you achieved a new star on your apron.  Samples offered to customers were always good.
good,the hours are short shifts so you may go in 6-7 days a week and work every weekend. some days may have to work two shifts with a 2 hour break so you really don't have time to do anything. the pay is not good for the amount of work required and are slow to promote after being a par 4.
good,"I have been an employee at Cracker Barrel for a little under a year and I have met all kinds of wonderful people, employees and customers. The scheduling is very flexible with my schooling. You can be eligible for great benefits including health insurance, 401K, and paid vacation. They take donations to help employees who have been involved in some type of disaster, the organization is called Cracker Barrel Cares."
good,I was a server trainer at cracker barrel . I never showed up late. I was a very reliable employee. I enjoyed the people that I worked with.
good,I would clock in and set up the host stand. Proceed to continue what the hostess on the shift before me did not complete. Then I would prep for the dinner rush and soon start my closing routine. By the time closing time hits I have already completed the tasks I am responsible for.
good,"I didn't work here long because I moved to another city, but it was decent. Management was great and my supervisor made me feel comfortable coming to her and talking about things. My co-workers were helpful and did what they could to assist me. The customers were great, however, there were a few who didn't like the fact that I wasn't the same color as them and gave me a little bit of a hard time. Other than that, the job was good. The hardest part was getting the food orders out to the customers with the right sides. The most enjoyable was when the customers would actually engage in little conversation and would make it enjoyable serving them."
good,"Work starts as soon as you hit the door, there is not much anything else you focus on except food, and orders and drinks. As well as cleaning up and rolling silverware. Work can be fun at times, but overall its a job that requires your undivided attention."
good,Nice environment not enough hours would like to keep working here on weekends
good,It is a good place to work and is overall ok. There is too much dis organization which makes things complicated a lot.
good,"Cashier /restail sales"
good,"While working at Cracker Barrel my main job was to welcome guest into the restaurant as they entered in through the retail store, and as they walked or looked around while waiting to be seated I would then inform them of the deals that we had on sales at the given time. At other times I would be restocking the shelves and keeping the retail store in order. I left Cracker Barrel on good terms; I left because I was eligible/offered football scholarships to many colleges. At Cracker Barrel I was submitted for rehire so I can go back to work there when their on the job hourly availability has improved and met my needs, and/or requires my employment. Management officials are the people who you want to avoid."
good,"*pleasant"
good,"Fast Paced work environment."
good,"A typical day at work is a very busy nonstop working environment"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Great places with great values. Offers a great place to learn how restaurant operate.
good,"washed dishes, mopped floors, bussed tables, cleaned restrooms, took out trash,"
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in, taking care of the tables assigned to me. I take care of my guests by making sure their food and drinks are made correctly, make sure they never run low on beverages. Speak to them very polite. They hardest part of this job is making some guests that are difficult happy but I enjoy being around such a ""homey"" surrounding."
good,"The management was spot on, they always followed correct procedures and were fair to all their employee's. The hardest part of the job was a few employee's that always came to work with bad attitudes and I enjoyed working there and the management and my co-workers were like family and always were on the same page/team."
good,"A typical day at work would involve taking orders, and delivering them with a smile. I learned about customer interaction, and how delivering good customer service pays off. The management was a little scattered, but created a good work environment. The co-workers were the best part. We were like a family, and that is where most the teaching took place. The hardest part of the job was knowing that there really wasn't much room for advancement. The best part of the job was the fact that if you made people love you, you would get paid all the better for it."
good,A typical day at cracker barrel is hectic. What i mean by that is that its a very busy and fast paced work environment. I have learned many new skill such as waiting on tables and new sale strategies and adding on to their purchase. As for management they are great at understanding needs and unplanned events. The co-workers are amazing. The hardest part of the job was trying to please every guest. I would have to say interacting and hearing the many stories of our guests was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,Nice place and nice people. Very down to earth. Just could not stand on my feet 8 hrs. a day for 5 days straight.
good,Working at Cracker Barrel taught me how to get along and work well with people of all ages and different backgrounds. It is more of a fast paced job but I would still recommend working here.
good,Working at Cracker Barrel can be hard sometimes the managers at my location are all understanding and it’s a well paying job. It all depends what job you’re going for.
good,"I worked at one of the NY State locations and was very shocked after seeing the turnover in management positions. The managers who stayed were the ones who should have been leaving. One of the mamagers would yell at the staff so loud tgat it could be heard in the dining room, even by other managers nonetheless. Such a shame, if it could be ran properly then it wouldn't be so bad."
good,Always meeting new people and helping them with their shopping. Management was fair when I worked there.  Employee's became friends.  Advancement every few months
good,"Once interviewed if they like you they will want you to train immediately, usually doing a few computer days and a few shadowing day before putting you on the floor. You start with only two tables but managers are quick to notice when you can handle more. Soon you’ll be closing and running whole dining rooms. The thing I love most is the ability to grow inside Cracker Barrel"
good,Cracker Barrel is a job that you must have a hard working and fast pace mentality being slow isn’t an option it also gives you chances to grow in the chain
good,"Cracker Barrel is a fast paced work environment. As a grill cook you are constantly cooking and restocking items. Now I have been there for about two months now, so I still a bit uncomfortable when the rushes come in. I do like how I get a 35% off of purchases and my managers are helping me little by little as I work there. It's not a bad job ,it's just something I don't feel it's quite right for me."
good,"It was a good job, but I have a family to provide for and I couldn't do that just on a waitress salary. It's a great environment,  and management was great, but I needed more and had to move on."
good,"If you can handle working constantly without a distinct break time, always on your feet, and constantly being told contradicting orders then this is the place for you! You don't really get a break here, just find time to eat a meal at half the normal price! (With a different server ringing it in for you)."
good,It's a great place to work fun environment  well mannered  people  and great public nice atmosphere  freindly people nice pay time off lots of opportunity
good,Cracker Barrell is a good company to work for. They offer great compensation and bonus packages if controlables are met and labor is met. I would work there again.
good,I had so much fun at cracker barrel and loved the job.i loved cooking on there flat top grills and the other employees were quite nice.they paid good and had good discounts for employees.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Employees (Cooks, Servers, Back-up Cooks, Dishwashers and Food-Prep) are allowed to clock-out at the end of their shift without fully cleaning their work-space; this is normal practice because ""labor-costs"" is more important than a clean and sanitary restaurant and workplace."
good,"Very fast and moving continent. Stressful trying to hurry.  Dishwasher Aprons had holes..."
good,"Very fast paced, very stressful. Don’t work here if you don’t know someone. If you do work here, have a goal in mind because some days it can get very unbearable."
good,This place has great people in management and mostly great staff. Those who have worked there for a long time tend to think of themselves as managers too and will be snotty and boss you around. It is a high intense job without much compensation. With the lack of appetizers or alcoholic drinks that really drive up the bill tips are relatively small and the main people who come in are old people and families that tend to sit there for forever.
good,Management is good the hardest part of the job is they closing because you have all the dishes and everything I in joy it couse it keeps me busy hours are good all the people  r fun to work with
good,"It was a pretty straight forward job. You came in you did your job and you left. Never worked more than 38 hrs a week. No overtime ever! "
good,"I enjoy my time here at Cracker Barrel but it lacks proper management and leadership. Low pay and hard work don’t call for a rewarding experience. No work-life balance. Great people. Night maintenance is great with consistent hours, descent pay and lots of peace and quiet overnight."
good,It was a fun job for it being my first. However like any restaurant job it is never meant to be long term. I learned a lot and absolutely loved my manager.
good,Working at Cracker Barrel over that time was a fun experience. Nice place to work day or night shifts. Lots of teamwork. Managers treat workers fair. Overall friendly atmosphere.
good,"The work was very fast paced at times and required a lot of social interactions. Dealing with customer complaints is sometimes stressful as they mainly come from the restaurant and working in retail I have nothing to do with it and often do not know how to solve it. But over all it is fun to interact with customers at work. The main issue I have with the workplace is that sometimes employees and managers struggle to communicate and it is often times hard to get a break,"
good,"Entry level job. If you want to be a line cook or server, then this is the job for you. In my experience, employers were fair and let you cross train departments. They are very forgiving, but CB is a fast paced food environment. I would work there again."
good,"It’s Cracker Barrel, the environment is homey and welcoming. The staff are thoroughly trained, and stationed well for their experience. Management is fair, as are discounts. The work atmosphere is really nice honestly. As long as you have served before, you’ll be in great shape. The only con is that the location I worked at was very slow. So tips were very minor and I couldn’t afford to stay."
good,I'm a very hard worker and very dependable and a team player  I loved watching pleasingly people and also making them smile I also love the part of my job done well we a server is trairnd right
good,Female Managers bringing in personal problems in the work area. Make managers talking about sport's teams instead of assisting the kitchen staff of need of supplies.
good,"It is currently a very stressful environment with a lot of manager hawking.  I have gained wonderful people skills, and I have turned multi-tasking into an art form. There are many wonderful co-workers at Cracker Barrel.  However, the workplace has turned more toward a  different generation of employees, and many situations are presently related to the generational differences.  The hardest part of this job is being able to perform so many tasks at the same time, but talking with people is very enjoyable."
good,Cracker Barrel has a productive and fun workplace. The managers are very understanding and willing to work with you regardless of the issue. It feels like everyone is family
good,A typical day at work is non stop business with only a few grill cooks because there’s not really anyone to work because of the type of business it is.
good,Very confusing moving checks from one rail to another then they wonder why checks are not complete no patients for what you need to do just total confusion at times
good,The money can be great here! Can be 800 or more a week depending on how many hours you’re willing to work and fight for tables. The workers are kinda psycho. I’m young so I worked here to get a little expierence so I could work in a place with alcohol and get paid a little more without all the u unnecessary stress. People often quit because of how awful it is. All in all it’s the resteraunt business so. You don’t have to tip out your money you keep all of it
good,"Not a bad place to work, and always busy. Just a lot of drama and the managers aren't very friendly, but you have to expect that sometimes. Good food though."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"This was my very first place of employment.  In learned most of my skills here.  Customer service, weekly cleaning of special objects, regular cleaning, scripting, staging a wait, food preparation, plate presentation, dressing in the requirements of a dress code, working on a computer system to put in orders and provide guest checks."
good,"As a minor, you are only allowed 5 hour shifts before needing a break. I almost always got scheduled for 4 1/2 hour shifts which would require me to clock out before the 5 hour mark. I could not sit in the back for 30 minutes like I was supposed to because I still have tables in the dining room that would need to still be taken care of which had me working off the clock."
good,"I loved the people you meet, atmosphere, and workers. The management just needed a little work with their leading skills. Also you must be comfortable asking people to buy things they do not want. This job is great if you have a busy schedule!"
good,"You can't just text or call your boss to handle scheduling issues, and the job includes so much unnecessary computer training and modules that are mandated by corporate. It's not bad money, but the corporate aspect of it is annoying."
good,This was okay. Nothing more more and nothing less. You have to work there an extremely long time to reap all the benefits for working there. I liked the atmosphere but it got really slow at times.
good,"Cracker Barrel was both a positive and negative experience for me. Most of the management was really nice and understanding, except for one who has now been fired. Coworkers are really great and helpful. I miss working there sometimes. Hours are awful and Sundays are miserable."
good,"I loved the people I worked with and my managers. I got paid a fair amount and the job I had wasn't necessarily hard. It was a great environment altogether, I was just being overworked. I ultimately couldn't handle the amount of hours I was getting on top of being a full time student, it started to affect my grades."
good,Fast-paced work environment / Restaurant TM's and Managers are somewhat overworked for their pay scale but Retail TM's and Managers have more work/life balance.
good,"Flexible hours to work if you have another job."
good,hours weren't great due to them over hiring. They are flexible about hours though. They also give a 25% discount which is good and helps you in a bind.
good,"Good coworkers, great customer care, sensible work environment, busy workplace, plenty of ways to get more work hours, not very flexible hours, late scheduling"
good,"Spite of leaving due to having dish duties, it was a great job. Had the opportunity to show my efforts, even if not successful. Management, specifically GM, as insecurities."
good,"I loved working at Cracker Barrel, I got along with everyone I worked with. I learned how to be a really good team player. My fav part was getting along with people all around me as we all worked together."
good,Cracker Barrel was a decent place to work. The managers were nice and schedule was very flexible. There were almost no breaks during the shift. The pay is low but can't expect more in a cashier position.
good,"its hard to balance work and home life.. its a great place to work if you dont have a family, the pay is good... but you work at least 60 hours a week. bonus isnt that great"
good,"In my interviews, I was promised AT LEAST 20 hours a week which was a bit lower than I wanted but I accepted. After getting hired, I was lucky to get more than 8 in a single week. The pay is okay if you're a teenager looking for a part-time job. From what I've observed, they hire people when they don't need to hire people, so hours are really scarce, even if you've been here for a while. I like the atmosphere, don't get me wrong but there were no hours to come out of this."
good,"This was my first job, so I really didn't enjoy it. A typical day at work would be you going in and out of the kitchen, cleaning tables, making sure everything is clean and neat, and carrying dishes"
good,The best staff I have ever worked with in all my years I've been a manager. Incredible team work and the hardest working employees ever. thank you for all the training.
good,they would not give me more hours and i got fired because the manager claimed i missed two weeks and i had only missed one day and they took me down from 3-4 days a week to one day a week.
good,"Working as a server you deal with all types of people. Most are nice however, you have a few customers that are jerks. Church people like to sit in you sections for hours after service and then tip you $2 and think the have done you a favor."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I enjoy my job and the people are easy to get along with. We have to move at a fast steady pace and make sure the order or right and plated perfectly for out customers
good,"Typical restaurant environment."
good,"I worked hard at Cracker Barrel in five work days between 8am and 2-3pm. I checked the dishwasher machine before starting to wash dishes, pots, and utensils. I cleaned it every four hours."
good,"Coworkers are nice, but very selfish and always talking about their personal lives rather than attending customers. It does well for the time being, but after a while it's not worth it."
good,I had an amazing time at this job until a new manager was hired that did not fulfill the basic requirements. It was hard to work with a manager who knew nothing about the job or establishment. I soon after got a better job offer and decided to quit.
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel is a fun time. You make a lot of friends and family there. However, it is a one track job. You hardly get to move up in this job. Management is awesome and considerate but there is no room to grow. You get stuck in this job."
good,it was a great work place the people were very nice and the older workers did their best to try n make me better myself not only at the workplace but just to be a better person.
good,"very fast paced environment. Management always wanted to focus on making all the serving sections ""fair"" but not realizing they were giving new servers more seats than servers that had been there for years. Got to be nearly impossible to make money."
good,A typical day at work at Cracker Barrel consisted of washing dishes and cooking in a fast working manor. Depending on the time of day or circumstances depends on quantity of dishes. Very frequent other workers would call off making the task a little more difficult but not impossible. Most of the time people having no personalities seemed like robots. The hardest part of the job is when i had to transition from grill cook and dishwasher throughout the whole day. At time having to do both just to keep the business afloat
good,"working for this company had its perks. Especially, During the holidays. Very low-key at times, but when the rush hits it can be quite thrilling. I loved working here and being able to work on my customer service skills and sales."
good,"I was a server and really enjoyed the customers and most of the staff. There was a problem with having too many servers and only getting 2 or 3 tables and not making very much in tips. It's hard work, not the customer aspect but all the side work you are required to do. And a server only makes $4.05/hour plus tips. Which some days is less than $20..."
good,I love the company and its values. Recently they are going through a restructuring which has caused pay cuts for low volume stores. Many people who work for Cracker Barrel have been there for 20+years. It really is a great place to work if you like a fast pace environment.
good,a typical day at cracker barrel is fun. I've learned how to be responsible. The management was very good. The workplace was a nice environment. There wasn't really and hard part. The most enjoyable part about the job was making sure the customers are satisfied and happy.
good,"co workers was fun to work with"
good,Working at Cracker barrel has been a experience. As a server we have varies of thing to do. The fast pace help we with my work speed in organization skills. the customer is my most favorite part of the job I loving people and learning different thing about people.
good,I left Cracker Barrel for a personal and non personal reason. The reason why I left Cracker Barrel is because of the workers were to lazy and some managers
good,"Management was very helpful, if you love people, music, live atmosphere, sales, and teaching, these would be a great place to work at."
good,"Today at work. I greeted guests, took drink and food orders, checked up on guests, swept and wiped off tables. Busted tables after guest left."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"I Learn to try to be fast, the co-workers are a great deal of joy to work with; Also, you have to be very fast, but not enough to cause a slip or a fall or anything to keep meeting ends met."
good,It was a new experience being my first restaurant job and I like being there because it worked with my school hours. A typical day could be a rough one or it could be a smooth one.
good,"Very friendly place to work. Management is amazing, they are always there and are more than willing to help! Always options to move up. Co-workers are great and easy going!"
good,"Great work place, with plenty of room to enjoy the atmosphere, depending on the manager present at that shift. I learned teamwork and good cooking skills. The management, depending on the manager wasn't all that great, as most issues were not addressed and they played favorites, depending on the relationship between your family and the general manager. The hardest part of the job was dealing with poor management but I enjoyed my coworkers and benefits of my job."
good,"When it gets busy, managers are nice enough to step in and help throughout the kitchen to get caught up. Good raises every year or so help as well as cross training option given to all employees. I worked in Dish tho so it gets backed up at times in which it is hard to keep it clean in the room so that is the only down side. They offer a good amount of hours if you give them the option."
good,I learned something new everyday The most enjoyable part of my job was the people I worked with and meeting all kinds of new people
good,I loved working here ! This place was always filled with people and great music to sing along to. Managers were very friendly!
good,"Everyone helped one another at Cracker Barrel, it was a fun place to work at and you were always meeting new and different people on a day to day basis."
good,"Fast paced environment, with many opportunities at leadership roles. Great teamwork value and management was easily available when needed. The best part of this job was interacting with the guests and giving them an enjoyable experience."
good,"A typical day cashiering at CrackerBarrel consisted of cashiering and answering phones. I learned how to work the register, greet guests, and answer phones. I loved working with my co-workers because they were enjoyable to work with."
good,A typical day at work was always fast pace. What I learned to manage while at Cracker Barrel was punctuality. Working along side my co-workers was truly awesome. I really can't think of anything hard about working at Cracker Barrel because I knew of my responsibilities. What I really enjoyed about the job was the teamwork.
good,"Overall fun, fast-paced work environment, yet little to no advancement opportunities."
good,"If you like country music then this is the right place for you. It is a nice, I consider it a, quick family casual restaurant. I would walk into the dish pit with almost seems like a mountain of dirty dishes. I would have to clean as fast as possible as to not get backed up again. I would also have to take out the trash even when I was alone in the dish pit."
good,"Typically work 5 to 8 hours each shift with little to no break, but have coworkers willing to help each other. I learned how to be confident in my abilities to provide great customer service in a fast paced environment. The management is very good and they are able to get things done while also being friendly. My co-workers are friendly, they work hard, and are almost always willing to stop and answer questions or help out others. The hardest part of the job is the intensity of the work for long hours with no break to sit and eat. With that, I often go several hours without eating. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to make customers happy and doing it well."
good,A typical day is usually very busy. As a cashier we have several goals to meet every day in different sells areas. Most of the managers are willing to help when called for assistance at cash when we are extra busy(buses or other large groups)  For the most part I have very good co workers. Team work is a must for a successful day. Hardest part of my day is dealing with upset guest who have had a bad dining experience.  If I can't make them happy I readily call a manger.  The most enjoyable part is when I  have done my job and I get a smile and thank you from our guest.
good,"Busy busy busy,  never stopped to breath.  They didn't even let me get all the way through training properly before they through me on the grill by myself.  You'll work at least an hour past closing and even later depending on when the last table leaves.  If you like that environment to work in then this is the place."
good,really fun job but cant expand... does not offer enough hours and i feel that i can do better when deciding on a career
good,"This job has provided me with a flexible schedule to be available to my family and pursue my degree. For that, I am thankful. The management team is satisfactory with a couple that stand out as true productive leaders. The staff is competent and friendly."
good,Learned much more about serving breakfast orders and preparing breakfast in general
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,They worked well with school and real life responsibilities. I only quit because I had to move I would definitely still be working there if I could. 5 out of 5.
good,It's a great place to start off working at as a teenager but eventually you will get fed up with not having enough hours. The employees there are the best.
good,"A typical day at work would be me seating guests, putting them on a wait when needed and conversing with them about their day and the specials of the day and ask how they're doing. The management could be better I think they are too lenient a lot of people call out multiple times and they are unorganized. The workplace culture is very comfortable and its surrounded with some of the nicest people. The hardest part of the job is having to seat everyone yourself when theres a load of customers and people called out that day. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be seeing the regular customers come in a lot and forming a relationship with them."
good,"Cracker Barrel is a fast-paced, team-dependent place to work. Advancement in the company is easily obtained, but a person has to put in their fair share of work. I was lucky enough to have nice and helpful managers at both locations I worked at. It is strict and adamant on procedures."
good,They never give enough hours nor extra hours. They only do part time job and they don’t give your full hours like how you ask them. You work more than what you’re getting paid.
good,"I don' t have a lot to say about working at Cracker Barrel, mostly because I worked about 5 hours a week during the summer. It probably would have been fine if I worked more and got to know the staff a little better."
good,Great place to work just not enough money and hour or giving so you really wouldn't be able to take care of your self if you where trying to make a living outta this job
good,"good place to work all u have to do is show up and work , don't be lazy , work ur hardest .. some of the people are good ..sometimes your asked to help other departments..."
good,"I learned great skills of commuicating with others, was able to provide great costumer service, there rewinding program was not the best.Due to it being a restaurant at times it can be slow."
good,"Customers are usually nice and staff is supportive. You definitely have to be outgoing and be able to talk to every customer in the store. Management is for the most part helpful, depending on who you go to. Hardest part of the job would have to be greeting and helping every guest while also trying to multitask with fixing the store up whether its cleaning or restocking. Also we usually do not get a break throughout the day. Most enjoyable part of the job is everyone helps each other staff wise. Most of the guests are local and enjoy coming in and having a nice chat before breakfast."
good,"I truly enjoyed my 2 years of employment at my local Cracker Barrel however, I have to admit my coworkers were a handful to deal with. No matter who left and didn't complete their job, you are the one who has to pick up the slack, regardless of how busy it gets. "
good,Some of the management is not respectful and is in dire need of correct social interaction and how to talk to coworkers. This manager does not know how to help out his coworkers; instead ge likes to take over the job and acts like he is better than everyone.
good,"i enjoyed my work here for the most part, had a few downfalls but every place does . as long as you come in and do your job there is money to be made, just got to be willing to work for it."
good,"Where I did enjoy my time working with this company, it is not a ""career"" choice. I was promoted to shift leader shortly after being hired. Training began right after to prep me for management. I went through almost 2 years of management training to ultimately be pushed away because we had a new district manager take over. They wanted me to complete training all over again under their supervision. This might not have been a problem if the pay was greater, but when you are receiving very close to minimum wage, this is an unfair offer. Staff was great to work with and the work was very nice."
good,A really great place to work.  The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to serve the public and getting to meet new people. I really did not find anything to be hard about this job.The management team for the most part was great to work for.
good,"Environment is great,need improvement on treating employers better. Pay is good and so r benefits management not good . home office goes back too far on background checks.they have great vacation pay."
good,"Cracker barrel had very good health benefits and really just a friendly environment. The hours were very long and work you overtime which is fine unless you have a tight schedule! The management was good but when busy they don't take time to make sure the servers are on top of it, I loved being a server a cracker barrel and connecting with the guests and making sure they left full, happy and satisfied! The hardest part about the job was the side work, so much side work for one person for example- rolling 100 silverware plus dumping and refilling salt and pepper every single day when cut plus a lot of other duty's!"
good,"I mean, it's not a bad place; it's really not. I actually like being there, considering the fact that I used to go there on a regular basis with my entire family to get breakfast, I typically felt like a place where I could fit in. Unfortunately, hours are slim; incredibly slim. I'm looking for a part-time job where I could do anywhere from 20-35 hours a week. I'm lucky if I get 10. Of course, I called off two days due to the flu and a hospital visit but other than that, it's typically been those workdays. "
good,"Good benefits, great people. Needs more regularity in every day rules. Most managers try to listen to your suggestions and comments. Needs to hire more back of the house employees and it would run more efficiently."
good,"A typical day at work was good , balanced . I learned a new menu , I learned how to move at a faster pace . Management was understanding and all about their workers. My co workers were fun and energetic all around good people to be around. The hardest part of the job was learning two different menus . The enjoyable part of the job was getting to see my guest leave with a smile on their face ."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Not a bad place to work just a very up-beat and fast moving environment. Other than being slammed all the time the works not hard you just have to get used to it.
good,"I love the staff at Cracker Barrel, its just the management is not so great. We never get the support we need, until its time to tell us good news about what's going with the restaurant,  As in reviews or expectations."
good,"The experience and actual job was great, the management and scheduling was just kind of rocky. It taught me so much for my first restaurant job and I also made great tips!"
good,"It is the easiest job you can probably get. All you really have to do is seat guests, but in a coordinated matter. It can get very busy to the point where there are five hosts/hostesses at the stand which is very helpful."
good,"Very Flexible with your work schedule, understanding and friendly."
good,Good pay. But too many unrealistic number goals. Therefore feel as if I am having to perform two jobs quite frequently. Would not mind the double tasking if we felt appreciated and our equipment was working.
good,"Wash dishes, pots, plastic ware. Occasionally called to bus tables. Learned a vast amount of problem solving skills and the ability to think on the fly. Love my co-workers as they are always helpful. The hardest part of my job is when we are understaffed it creates difficulties in performing our job on a timely manor. My most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with."
good,Always ready for new things and always come to work on time. Love to meet new people.i enjoy working with others. the hardest part a job for me is having nothing to do...
good,"Co-workers were fantastic, and managers were okay, but it was pretty awful. I would work seven hours, without a break for ANYTHING, and would be treated with annoyance by management if I asked to switch hours."
good,"Cracker Barrel is a great place to work. There are benifits, but you have to be there a year for them to kick in. The only downside that I have is that they are overly staffed so you have a ton of servers on the floor, so the hours they give out are short."
good,"good place to start out working, I wouldn't suggest working there if you are not mechanically incline."
good,"It is one of the highest paying Restraunt Management jobs in the industry but it requires you to be there ALL THE TIME.  It is typical to have a work week of 6 days on and 1 day off regularly.  If you ever want to see your family again or have some sort of social life, this may not be the area to look.  The benefits are quite good, which is nice considering you will be in the hospital from having an work related heart attack after your first year.  This is only a look at my personal work place, and may not be typical of all restraunts."
good,I was a very straight forward fast paced job and did quiet enjoy it here
good,Its a very good starter job. your pay goes up every time you take a test so that was good. this is a job where you get to learn a lot of skills that are useful outside of work.
good,A typical day at work was setting up displays or moving them around or taking them down. I've learned alot about planograms and how to set up displays. The hardest part about my job had to trying to sell merchandise to the guest because im not the type to try to talk people into something they dont want. The most enjoyable part of my job was setting up all the displays in the store. My co-workers were very friendly and helpful. The managers were also very friendly and always willing to help you out.
good,"A typical day includes service and side duties with opportunity to work a 12 hour shift . I learn great communication skills. The management is approachable and friendly and great team motivators. My co-workers are hard working and team oriented. The hardest part of the job is expediting your food correctly while arranging an large amount of to go orders on Sunday, our busiest day."
good,"Cracker Barrel is a good resturant, with great home cooked meals. They have a fire place and service to match a warm dinning experience."
good,•Provided customer service.

good,"the staff i worked with was very open to flexibility as well as understanding to need of all emplyees. While working towards pleasing customers, the well being of the staff was considered as well."
good,"I felt very at home working there, the managers were kind and had trained me well. The place was slow and fast paced depending on the day and there is no discrimination or harassment."
good,Cracker Barrel is a good place to work for cuz it pays weekly especially if you have a big family in your in a pinch but it also needs a lot of work from management to employees looking out for one another and for being held accountable for what happens in their establishment.
good,"Cracker Barrel’s customers are the first priority for workers in the kitchen and in the front of the house. Working with Cracker Barrel for so long has opened my eyes and acclimated me to fast-paced working environments in all areas of my life, such as housework projects, yard work, academic course work, and, most of all, time management."
good,"A typical day at work included serving for the entire shift, as well as doing any assigned side work and folding around 100 silverware. I learned how to wait tables as well as gained better social skills, as my tips relied on how friendly I was to my guests. The most difficult part of the job was certain side work."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the people that I worked with. The job in itself was very simple and easy to pick up on.  It is a nice place to work.
good,Really easy job sometime steessfull good managment good employee and team work. Okay pay when u work there could have more benifits. Overal was a g [d job
good,"All i can say it was a nice fast pace company"
good,"got along with all of my co-workers. everyone helps everyone out. can be very hectic at times, but there are also times whee there I very little turnover rates."
good,"A typical day of work would be thrown into a rush of customers and waitresses. I learned how to host here. The management was good, but the culture wasn't so much. The hardest part was trying to please the managers and coworkers."
good,Worked here 29 years and loved .y job and staff that works there.can say they do care for there employees  and  they  are  going  to  be  there  when you need them.
good,"Works with your schedule, management varies from store to store so some stores are much better than others. Good discounts on food and products. Most jobs are easy once you are trained. Can be very stressful during the peak periods. Many coworkers have low work ethics as this is often their first job or they just dont care."
good,"I'm a people person "
good,"I worked at two different CB locations. I loved the first one, thanks to amazing coworkers. The job is stressful no matter where you are, but it was so much worse when I moved and transferred to a different CB. The coworkers and management in my new location were so rude to me. I went home and cried after work."
good,"Cracker Barrel is a great company to work for, depending on the location and store you work in, a work life balance and being short staffed creates a hostile work environment."
good,"The hardest part of the job was when we had angry customers, and you having to calm them down and fix the situation before it gets worse then it already was."
good,"This was my first job when I was 19-years-old. I absolutely loved my job and made really good money. Unfortunately, our city is in a growth period and the development of other restaurants negatively impacted our business. In addition, our management team split up and we gained a new GM that treated our store like a dictatorship. After several years of working here, it was time for me to go."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"I honestly like working for Cracker Barrel. Every day was a challenge. The hardest part was when a huge party would come in. The best part was getting to know people. I really felt at home there. I got to know a lot of the regulars which was really rewarding. The management at Cracker Barrel was amazing. I absolutely loved all of my managers. They were so supportive and always there to help when I needed it. All around, Cracker Barrel was a very comforting place to work because of how family oriented it is."
good,I had my time working at Cracker Barrel I actually turned 18th. Made new friends and was really closed to the managers. different races. I I've learned a lot from the people that worked there before I did.
good,The hardest part of my job was getting my whole sections tables sat at once. Then all of my tables wanting to order all at once. Also meeting my time limit .
good,"Cracker barrel had awesome discounts and to move up in the chain of command was super easy, based off of the time youve worked. however, the shifts were completely wack. they would have me schedualed for two or less hours at a time. My feeling is, if you live close, do it. otherwise never even look at it."
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel has been a fun experience for me. I get  to meet lots of new people everyday. We have a great employee group. Nothing even gets ""boring"" there. You're always on your feet."
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel taught me the absolutes to pleasing guests and meeting their needs at all times. Being in such a fast paced environment taught me how to multitask and deliver efficiency. The managers are very helpful and productive throughout the shift. Everyone is friendly and encouraging on the shifts. The hardest part about the job is when we get busy and things could potentially get unorganized. The best part is making great money, and being able to interact with our guests while doing it!"
good,"It was my first job, so I was a little it nervous,but after a while I adapted to the work environment. It became easier and easier as the time went by. Also you could tell if you had worked hard or lack on the work day. As the my job required to be a dishwasher and busser, at the end of the day I left feeling accomplished."
good,"being that this was my first job , the experience was horrible. servers would harass me about tables which I had no control over. Although they had a great balance between personal and work life."
good,"Great food, and management was great.  Hours are variable, and discounts on food and merchandise are good.  Good chance for advancement, if you're willing to relocate"
good,"Very flexible with schedules if you go to school or have kids. Most shifts are short, probably 5 hours long sometimes 6. But you do not get breaks at all unless you are a minor."
good,When I come in I promptly get ready for my day. I see what the managers task and goals are for the day and I immediately start working towards them. Management is encouraging and keeps the moral of the staff high. most difficult part of the job is dealing with the rude crowds but I always take into account they are most likely upset with the situation and not me as an individual
good,"Co-workers were very friendly, Management wasnt very understanding to emergency matters which was the reason i left. The hardest part of the job was working around the great smelling food and not being able to just go eat everything! The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to hear all about different areas from guest who would stop in to eat during their travels."
good,"Depending on what area I was working in depended how my day was laid out. Always greeted my days with a smile here. No matter where you were working I always had to keep on my toes no matter if I was assisting guests with ordering, cashing out or finding items for them in the store."
good,"Server- Provide exceptional customer service by seating guest, taking orders, and serving food. We also made sure that our guest never ran out of beverages while in store and that was a team mission. Helped other people out by making sure food was right temp. and tasted as good as it looked."
good,Everything is always pretty lively at Cracker Barrel. There is always something going on somewhere. Everyone is always smiling and always happy.
good,It was a really great job and they have a really awsome program. It teaches you about customer satisfaction. Everyone there earned their raises to. You would learn things and take a test. It was really all about equal opportunity.
good,"Greet Customers, and assist the customer with items in gift shop, and check out customers at the cashier. Maintain gift shop and stock room. Receive shipments of the delivery truck. Package, wrap, and send gift items for customers. Input data in computer for sales floor items being shipped. Maintain cleanliness of gift shop and accessibility for customers."

good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,great place to work for restaurant industry. family environment. very fast paced.
good,Like I said before it can become stressful IF you let it stress you out finding your placement and rhythm like I said is the key to your success at Cracker Barrel. I only say that cause it was so much for me to grasp in such a little time but there was barely much info to grasp as it seemed my advice is don't panic you'll be fine.
good,Cracker Barrell is great but it was just too fast paced for me. The food is good and the service is excellent. The management there is great. The manager and assistant manager are nice and the scheduling manager is also kind.
good,"Typical day at work is come in and go in go mode"
good,"I prepared my tables ,, fill salt and pepper, certain count on sugars, fill ketchup and mustard, roll silverware, wait tables with good customer service, clean tables,keep tea and coffee made and fresh, cash out tickets and claim some tips."
good,"They were very good at scheduling around things in your personal life. Very easy to get pay stubs, great pay and very easy to advance. Very friendly people. Management was great. The only downside was the lack of communication on work clothes. They would tell you very last minute what you need different."
good,It wasn't a very fun place to work. Cracker Barrel is a corporation and they require EVERY Cracker Barrel to be the exact same. If you mess up even a little bit you get in so much trouble.
good,"a typical day for me is always fun and exciting. I have learned motivation, speed, lots more communication. all my managers are awesome. love interacting with my co-workers.i really dont feel that any part of my job is hard. the most enjoyable part of my job is happy customers."
good,"A Typical day at Cracker Barrel is a normal. We come in get set up for peak period. We make sure our guess leaves happy. we have some of the best mangers ever they work with you, they make sure everything goes great for the day. The most enjoyable part for our job is to make we are pleasing people at Cracker Barrel"
good,"management sucks at times "
good,"What was expected of us was very clear, I loved that! To know exactly what your going to do, when to do it, and how your manager's want it done just makes your job so much easier. There were bad days too though, just like any other job. I learned how to pay attention to very, very fine details, and to keep a thick hide! Managers were very compassionate and caring, they actually cared about things happening in our lives, and in turned we cared about them! Co-workers were blah, very catty, petty, competitive when there was no need to be. Hardest part of the job was side work before leaving, that was a killer ! (AT FIRST) Most enjoyable part was every single thing else. If i knew what I know now i would go back to them and stick with it. I just wasnt making any money. I was starving."
good,the management there was good and their work system was great. but they have so many people working there (aprox 150 employees) that you get bad hours.
good,"I first start off at work by coming in to work on time, then I learning the product of the day so that i may explain food of the day. I also try to learn our regulars name each time they come in and also ask my managers to teach me something new about. My co-workers are the most awesome people I can work with because we work together as a team. We are always having fun at work so the time can go fast and I am always coaching my team and telling them that they are do a great job. The one thing I thought that was hard at work was staying in one place, because I the one that likes to help other, such as; cleaning tables, making salads, and coaching. But the most Enjoyable part of my work place is not feeling as if it's an actual job."
good,I Enjoyed working in this environment. I was fun. I love smiling so this job was placed for me.  It was very under paid. I loved what I did so I didn't complain. I made very good tips and I enjoyed my customers.
good,I help customers find what they are looking for also work the registers. Also have to process the truck and put it all away as well as organize the stockroom.
good,"Very happy and fun place to work, not very good at giving hours, people who work there are guiding and help you learn everything you need to know to start working there"
good,"At Crackle Barrel, It Was My First Job, it was relaxing and they also was working with my hours while I was attending school. I learned how a smile can change someones day. I also learned that if you know your knowledge about an item share and people will consider on buying it. The Management was great they followed their quota ""Pleasing People."" When you walked Into Crackle Barrel you automatically feel like You're at Grandma's or Grandpa's home. There was times where it got a little crazy was when it was on a Sunday, When you had large parties of 8-15 figuring out where they was going to be placed still looking organized and clean. Knowing when the next table with a large party is going to be done. I believed the best part of my day was knowing I can have a little conversation with someone who was having a and day and change it that easy."
good,"It’s a good way to make fast money. Restaurant server is the gender-neutral term for a waiter or waitress who is typically part of a wait staff. Servers can be employed in a wide range of establishments, from casual eateries to fine dining restaurants. The nature of their job requires them to be on their feet for much of their shifts."
good,"its the mangers that isn't up to par. Some days were okay but others wasn't. I loved where I was working. The manager that made the schedule didn't care about anyone but herself, and she had her picks of people."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Plenty of room for advancement, and good management. Great work place a lot of overtime and pay raises. It was a great first job, I moved up quickly and had a few promotions."
good,"great work environment ,friendly guest, and pretty good money. one of the largest restaurant concepts I've worked for!"
good,"Helping customers find gifts. Run cash register, train new employees.  Help in all departments when needed"
good,Cracker barrel is famous for its old time country cooking. Great clean place and I also learned how to cook. The co- workers were good people and the managment team was strivers. The hardest part of the job was rush hours. The most enjoyable part was learning to cook good recipe.
good,Good company to work for. Nice benefits. Lots of available hours depending on what you apply for. Chances for. 50 cent raises up to 4 times. Good environment to be in.
good,Need more hours to make ends meet. If u hire a person for full time give them full time hours. Other than that it's a job. Way can can say just tryna make ends meet
good,"You will NEVER leave on time, all of your possessions will reek of Cracker Barrel and you might never get a break. Breaks are paid so there is no way to properly track when we take one. I worked a 12 hour shift on thanksgiving and never took a break. I had period blood dripping down my leg while I literally begged for a break and was yelled at for asking for them. "
good,"Cracker Barrel is a consistently busy business, but the retail side is not always busy. Cashiers for retail are always busy, but the workers off the registers are not. There are many employees in retail that are not friendly and willing to help new employees."
good,Hard to basically survive off the job because due to the server laws sometimes we are left without getting any tips and if it hurts when you serve a table of 8 and no gratuity is given and you have
good,Room for advancement is limited; Schedule is hectic and not always what is needed or wanted; same rules doesn't apply to everyone;potential to make good money in tips;
good,"My review was I enjoyed Cracker Barrel at first. They were flexible and gave me good hours while I was in college. Now I'm ready for a full time job. If you're looking for something part time while in school I would totally recommend working at Cracker Barrel, but if you're looking for a full time job I would not recommend working for this company."
good,I loved working there! All of my coworkers were awesome and outstanding. My guests were enjoyable and my job consisted of working many positions which always kept me busy.
good,"In a typical day at work I come in and serve the tables in my section. I help my coworkers as much as possible. When it is time for me to get off work i complete my assigned side work, clean up my tables, and role 100 silverware. I love my coworkers."
good,I was one of the top employees within the time I worked there and I didn’t feel appreciated. They didn’t pay me enough and scheduled me whenever they wanted even though I went to school.
good,The work is very fast paced. You get paid vacation . If you work enough hours you can  approve for insurance. The management is not very organized or even tolerable. The guest is where you get most of your money so as long as you have great customer service skills you can make decent money.  They will work around your availability.
good,"Pay was low and managers at my loacation were not very professional. However, the customers were the best part of the job. Very sweet! Tips were low though"
good,team fell apart quickly. pay was bogus. no communication. managers tended to get aggressive. hours were scarce. felt unsafe. felt unwanted. unappreciated.
good,just unorganized manager really don't care and you work crazy hours and do work of multiply people  it was always dis organized on people telling you what you needed
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Very busy in the summer time .Very slow in the winter .in busy time very pace and lots to keep you buys .Mangment right now is at a low general manager does like to do much .Other managers are only worred about there bonus. So we eat on the run'. Most server dont take break because the lose money .Ilove the local guest that come in some have been coming in since we opened in 1990
good,Crackerbarrel was overall a very fast paced family atmosphere with good management but selfish co workers such as servers seating guests all in there section and not evenly dispersing or rotating customers seating selections
good,Love meeting people working working hard and getting good recommendations love the expirenance the job was very different when coming to hard work I clean my tables and made my guest happy.
good,"Cracker Barrel was indeed an excellent place for a student starting out, but over time it was getting a bit stressful.  The management was becoming very poor and it had terrible communication.  The one thing I am thankful for is gaining social skills, they brought me out of my shell and I'm truly thankful."
good,not much to say.
good,I had a lot of fun working with the employees. The manager's did not create a flexible schedule to work with.
good,Wonderful work environment and shows how well you pick things up and how important teamwork is within a company. How well you can work with the public
good,The worker there and customers were amazing but the managers really made my experience really bad. I was planing on quitting a lot sooner but the workers there just made the experience better.
good,"Cracker Barrel is a great place to work for the most part. However, I have witnessed many wrong-doings by the management, and it seems as if they don’t care about their employees as much as they should sometimes. I believe Cracker Barrel policies are respectable and understandable when implemented correctly. All locations are very different in employment on all levels, from busser to management."
good,"Want you to work 6-8 hours without a break. Expect you to come in for a 3-4 hour shift , and still go home early. No hours, no communication, its either busy or dead."
good,"I was employed there for many years and when I called in sick only 1 day in all those years , I received a write up. I also was let go unlawfully which was determined in my unemployment review and if I had wanted to I could have gotten my job back. Then they held my much needed $2000.00 bonus only 1 week before Christmas and I was a single mother raising with children diagnosed with a chronic illness"
good,A good place to begin employment and seasonal job. A lot of work training will be provided. Customer service is quick paced and demanding. Holidays and special events are quite hectic.
good,"The greatest thing about working at Cracker Barrel was the people I worked with. Retail management was terrible, restaurant management was great. Because of my school schedule and health issues, I could only work 15 hours a week. My manager consistently scheduled me for 25-30 hours even after multiple conversations that I would not be available to do that. Retail sales and cashiers are pushed to be very forceful and pushy trying to sell to guests, a lot of guests would walk out. I was also not paid at the rate I was given during my interview and training. No organization or respect for employees. It may be right for you but it wasn’t for me."
good,"Loved working in retail. Hosting during weekday mornings is the best. Servers are great & very easy to get along with. Can be a hectic environment, but that makes it fun."
good,"very fast paced and high demand"
good,A typical day at work was very stressful. The company expected impossible tasks to be performed in a minimal about of time. I learned it was all about flipping tables (getting the guests out of there as fast as you could).
good,Quick hard money.. Cracker Barrel helped me pay my bis but u have to go in with a money making attitude and let all the other things going on around u not matter.
good,My time at Cracker Barrel was great. I got to meet so many people who were traveling and some of my co workers were the best to work with. We got paid mostly with tips and we did not have to do tip share. There were days that I would hardly make any tips but I was humble and thankful that I still had a job. I learned patience and time management there. I watched many managers come and go but overall the experience there was worth it.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"I enjoyed the atmosphere ,the people ,the food but management never paid attention to the staff in the front of house. OR EVEN CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS ! Hense leaving the service staffed abashed and angry non paying customers because the manager has walked by them but ignored them or whatever it may be."
good,Fast pace to start. Learned how to use equipment and organization skills and to prioritize what is needed. I enjoyed the coworkers.The GM plays favorites and that is not good. The under mgt is very helpful.
good,Cracker Barrel is a great first job for anyone in high school. I do not recommend trying to make a career out of it because you do not go anywhere far.
good,I love food. I love supervision in the Kitchen. Very good company. I feel like I have more talent then they have to offer. No room for growth. Lots of experience in kitchen and overall restaurant operations.
good,"I enjoyed working here, the people were nice to work for and the hours where amazing."
good,"Cleaning, stocking , taking orders, being able to deliver orders quickly and making sure ever order is up to standard."
good,"Cracker Barrel has a lot of strict rules to abide by. That helped get structured. Tucking in my shirt, wearing black socks only, no hair touching your collar, no tattoos or piercings, only white or clear fingernail polish. A typical day is coming in checking your section and picking up tables as they are seated. I learned to stay positive and keep a smile on your face. The management on a good day was wonderful they stayed on top of things whether it was with the employees or the guests overall experience. There wasn't really a hard part to this job. The most enjoyable was being able to meet different types of people."
good,A very fast paced enviroment. I learned how you approach people is everything. Co workers have to work together to keep a restaurant running smoothly. A customer that is not satisfied. The most enjoyable part of the day is a customer leaving satisfied with the service.
good,I didn't take full advantage of the job because i wasn't very educated on hoe stepping up in the company worked so i got swindled pay wise. but in total its a great company with great people and amazing customers. you can work up in pay and its a fun place to work
good,they are a good place to work but everyone is not nice. The retail manger can be very mean at time but everyone tells me that it happens. the employees are great to work with.
good,"I had fun working here. Cracker Barrel always has me feeling warm and nostalgic. But, I cannot get around how bad the compensation was. The hours and pay were poor from week to week. It was part time, but still..."
good,Maybe it was just the store I worked at but the management 9/10 was ridiculous and rude. No matter how much you'd clean it was always a mess. All the new servers are all worries about drama.
good,It was fun to work there but if you wanted to cross-train the managers wold say okay but it took me three months of nagging them before they put me on the schedule too cross-train
good,"I loved my job and was the top retail sales associate for months. I asked to go over and train as a server to make more money as retail is paid poorly. I was refused and never explained why. This job can get stressful but a lot of the times is very laid back. Uniforms must be pristine every shift. Your shifts change every week. You arent guaranteed hours. Management works on numbers, they do not care about their employees."
good,"The management often times dismissed their workers, and seemingly did not care for them. There was no place to anonymously give management feedback, which I believe could have been useful."
good,"They are very strict but follow procedures that they want to..it wasn't really organized....i would never work there again..not the best place the only good thing here is weekly pay and how much they pay hourly"
good,I think this is a great place to work at just wished they paid more money and gives you more hours great people to work with and a great management team
good,"The hours were minimum , which is little to nothing when you have to make a living from it. Good to be used as a second job for spare time. Sometimes shifts were cut short."
good,I loved working for this company and I absolutely loved my position as merchandise handler seeing as I was always the first to see any new arrivals. I enjoyed meeting all the new people from all around the country who would stop in to dine and shop.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,They are great with working with college schedules. The drive got to long for me. And I eventually needed more hours to work. They began doing hour cuts just to get me to quit when I had been there for going on a year. This started happening when they got a new manager that I guess didn't like me.
good,"love the work environment, just not enough pay. also poor management! it defiantly lives up to the meaning of a ""old country store"". Very tasty food, lots of different things to buy in the retail store."
good,"What you would expect from this type of establishment. Pretty well organized. Boss need to think as one, seem to be all over the place. Need to establish work place jobs."
good,"I was a first hire at the new store, management was constantly changing. Work was fast paced and could get overwhelming at times. It was fun working mornings, my business men just wanted a neverending cup of coffee and quiet."
good,"A good job, with as many hours as you would like. Great money. Unreliable coworkers, and sometimes very rude managers. Like I stated great money, but as much as you have to go through during a shift it just is not worth it sometimes. Definitely a job you have to keep sticking with."
good,"When I first started as a server, I was making really good money. They changed their ways of doing things a bit because we got a new district manager. He changed it so that we were pretty much over staffed all the time and that makes for less money in everyone's pockets. I know for sure that more than half of the full time servers are all searching for another job or trying to train in a different department, just to make up for the losses in income. Personally it has affected me by cutting my income in half."
good,"To many servers on a night for the lack of business, it was impossible to make money, not everyone did their side work at the end of the night which left it for the closers to do, favortism"
good,"Basically said Everything. I love the job but not the hours, I work 10pm-6pm most days. I have a child and about to start school and that time won't work right for my life. But overall the company is good to work for."
good,It's ok I love the ppl I worked with and it's a good company the tips is great the food is great it's friendly ppl that work there and the country store is a great place to shop
good,It was okay but the co-workers were fake and not reliable. Management often did'nt appreciate the dedicated works. The servers are characters. And everything is'nt what is always betrayed.
good,"help customer with order, help other server with orders and parties. fast paste work, clean, organize, set up displays and tear down. good people, good manager, the people where nice"
good,"At Cracker Barrel you get to work and start as soon as you arrive. Its a very fast enviroment. It helps me learn how to hold conversations with a variety of people, no two guest are the same. I also have grew in computer skills by putting mulitple orders in within a limited amount of time. Overall great people experince."
good,"loved the managers that i worked with.great tasting food at reasonable prices.my team mates ,we were like family we all worked for years together,and we""d have our disagreements but were quick to make up."
good,Great job for me because I preform well under pressure. They provide a lot of structure and training as well.
good,I loved my job till I had a knee injury was taking off work for over 30 days they fired me
good,"I am a server at Cracker Barrel. I work one on one with the public, serving them delicious food and making sure they receive 5 star service. I work as a team alongside my co-workers and management to make this possible."
good,It is a fun job to work at if everybody work as a team. It can get very busy and a person has to want to work there. It is a hard job but it can be very fun at times.
good,"I liked working there, and everyplace has its quirks but for whatever reason one manager seemed to want to make my work life a living heck there for me I was singled out and targeted by this man and on Friday december 7th it was made clear he set me up to fail and hes borderline verbally abusive not enough room to go into detail but trying to file a complaint about this man . I did nothing to warrent .this"
good,I didn't work enough to pay bills and buy food. My days were cut plus hours after I was hired. Management wanted to train another prep cook and put me i washing dishes I did my hob really good. Tasty manager is not tete anymore
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"it is a very healthy place. they take a great time to train a person and really cares for them to strive .the other players have a missoinin that is to keep them there for a long as they can handle the pressure.that is a very commitment to keep. they have young cooks striving the best they can"
good,"They are like family,everyone is so nice."
good,"you are the server here to please the GUEST.. and they are. you need to be there in a matter of minutes when they are seated. they take their guests very seriously. They aim to please the guest, it can be stressful and that's when you depend on the teamwork. I have seen 1 man curled up in the corner crying because of the stress.. just take 1 thing at a time and ask when you need help...the folks that work at Cracker Barrel are very human. but business is business and you are there to do a job. don't ever be seen just standing around, grab a rag and scrub walls."
good,"While the back of house environment was difficult at times, customers were pleasant at all times, and I never felt as though I wasn't making the money I was working for. Any issues with customers were solved quickly and proficiently with the assistance of mostly amiable management. Several aspects of management however were lacking in my opinion, especially as our location went through a rough patch in the management team that resulted in difficulties regarding changing rules and protocol."
good,weather we are slow or not we always have to be busy weather its attending to the guests needs or doing sidework or our daily duties assigned to us on the board
good,"Customers were my favorite part of the job. It was so stressful trying to balance the craziness in the kitchen with taking care of your tables. I walked about 8 miles a day during one shift. The managers were usually pretty cool, except during a rush, then they became the devil himself, but you all get through it and at the end of the day, your CB family is your family. "
good,"I entered inventory for new store opening and help varies Departments with anything from customer services, filing, faxing, answering front office phone with multi lines."
good,I enjoyed my 2 years there back in 2010-2012. The General Manager at the time is no longer there but he was amazing to work for and I enjoyed my coworkers.
good,I enjoyed working at Cracker Barrel and would still be there if not for my management there was a lack of community and communications which in turn hurt the staff.
good,"I started here when I was 16, it is a good job for high schoolers but is not a job that can part time pay for any kind of debt, you can minimally work with it but do not plan on buying or financing with it."
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel for over a year has enabled me to become more of a team player. It is detrimental to work well with others to ensure the best guest experience. The management was good overall, but some of the restaurant managers lacked professionalism. Every few months we had meetings with the managers in order to voice our opinions and make adjustments for both employees, and guests."
good,overall a good place to work. They work with your availabity and are understanding when it comes to sudden problems and issues. They treat you like family
good,This place is one place to work if your wanting a family. I loved working here. I had fun and got paid for it. If you work here you won’t regret it. It’s a loving place to work with great people.
good,I enjoyed cracker barrel i have left and went back for extra money i would definitely recommend it its a great first job. I would also go back if management improved as well as pay
good,"Retail environment with lots of young  people working. "
good,I was a student and they had stated in their policy sepcifally that they don’t make minors work too late or too many hours. They made me work doubles on the weekends and work till closing during the week. I had no time for homework or school.
good,"I was responsible for ringing customer food tickets and purchases from the store side of things.  I met a lot of people, dealt with all sorts of situations."
good,"It was a slow retail job with not much to do, everyone really helped themselves. You will have to clean bathrooms and sweep and mop floors. Typical retail job"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,The job overall was fun very fast paced but the managers sometimes felt as though the job was more important than your personal life. I learned a lot about being a host. The hardest part was the rushes but it was also the best it made time go by.
good,First job i ever had but not my best job but I learned a lot and loved my job.You meet a lot of different people everyday and you have to know how to keep your cool.
good,Cashing people out cleaning the store and making sure it looks tidy and selling items inside the retail store is very important You have to sell certain things that your boss wants you to sells for the time perios within the retail store.
good,"That believe in hiring lots of sales people,& not giving hardly any hours to them.Only employees that get almost full time are shift leaders on the retail side. Servers,& cooks on restaurant side get lots of hours & good tips. I was there 4 years the most hours I got eer was 24!!!"
good,"It was just the job that I needed to get thru the holiday season.  I enjoyed the work experience and the people that I worked with. I enjoyed working with the management, they were understanding and great to work with."
good,"This was my college job."
good,"You definitely can make good money as long as you put your guests and work first, Your guests are your priority from the time you arrive till the end of your shift, I have learned different ways to deal with unsatisfied guests, the right and the wrong ways to approach a situation, multi tasking and keeping up and not falling behind! Maintaining a level head and pleasing people!"
good,"I enjoyed working as a cashier at Cracker Barrel Old Country Store. It was a very different experience for me; not for being a cashier, but the environment."
good,Nice place to work. I liked interacting with customers. nice management time that really works with you. Tips vary depending on how busy the day is. You also can advance.
good,"Fun, sweet & friendly staff to work with. Most everyone is a team player. Meeting new guests and locals are a blessing. There is such a uniqueness to each individual .  CB is a great family restaurant with such an"" at home"" feeling to it. It is hard to say good bye to some of our traveling though town guests, knowing you may never see them again."
good,"Greeting guest, making sales working as a team. Everyday I learn something new from either a guest or management from the products we sell to the money we make. Hardest part of my job is pleasing everybody!! I love meeting new people everybody has a story."
good,"I don't prefer working with food, but love interacting with different people every day."
good,"A day at Cracker Barrel, is usually busy, a high volume restaurant. Getting food in and out as fast as you can. Greeting tables, getting drinks, bussing tables all at one. Fast paced work. I learned how to deal with all types of people, angry people, frustrated people, happy people, throw anyone at me and I'll make sure they leave from our restaurant with a smile on their face! Most of all how to make every customer feel happy that they came to eat at cracker barrel and I was serving them! Management were okay. Could use a better pay. Co-workers we were like a family. Always helping one another out with whatever needed to be done. Hardest part was probably being so  busy I couldn't keep up with my sidework. Most enjoyable was when I got customer compliments with fat tips :)"
good,Worked with some wonderful people and enjoyed my job helping customers
good,"need full time hours; promised, but not yet received.  Very easy work, and constantly moving; learned they care about the quality of the food prepared and sanitation methods.  Management is good and co-workers are good and can work with most.  Hardest part of the job is getting hours. Most enjoyable part of the job is cooking."
good,Get to work and help cooks out right away anf clean and cook whenever posible. Learned a lot about working in a restaurant and how fast paced it can be. Got along with all employeees but bosses was a little different all thay ever did was get upset and make a seen rather then make things better.
good,"The work day at Cracker Barrel was usually ok."
good,Nothing at all. Teenagers were getting more hours than adults who actually needed money for bills. 
good,I waitressed it was fast paced.my coworkers were fine and so was management. I learned to multitask 
good,work hours are short
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,A typical day at work would be catering to customers and making sure cold food stays cold and hot food stays food . i learned how to multi-task and keep up in a fast paced environment. m co-workers were all different . the hardest part of the job is dealing with hungry people . the most enjoyable would be meeting new people everyday.
good,I have worked at Cracker Barrel for almost 9 years. I have been going threw the steps of being a manger there. I mostly grill. I open the grill. I have to turn everything on. I also have to clean my work area. I have to pull frozen food from the freezer and label them. I am a people person. I get along with almost everyone. I do work hard. I would have to say the hardest part of my job is dealing with lazy people. I was taught if you had time to lean you had time to clean or get something else done. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to know more people.
good,Management was not easy to work with. I enjoyed the people I worked with. Good Company.
good,"Cracker Barrel is a good place to work if you are in college or a teenager because of its pay and hours. Some people can make a living here as a manager, but that takes a while. Be prepared to work all day every Sunday. Other than that it's a good place."
good,"people are very nice. typical day would be cashing people in, stocking the store and cleaning. Human interaction is a huge part of the job and was something in which i enjoyed"
good,Work a lot of hours not as much pay as you would like  you get what you put into it. As a hourly employee you can make decent money depending on location
good,"I would always work so hard and would never get a raise. I would always get stuck with the longest and hardest side work because I was the employee that would actually do it fully. I liked working there, just felt not appreciated."
good,Like any other job you can get really lucky or really sucky management. I got lucky and was given a team that I really liked. They were the best managers I've worked under so far
good,Cracker barrell is fun and exciting cause your making tips.....But whole new story dealing with the public if you have never its very challenging everyone needs to at least once in your life
good,given the fact that i have been here so long it is easy for me. Make no mistake this job is demanding. Also depending on the store you may not get much help from mangers.
good,I loved working here. I worked here for 7 years. I actually miss everyone there. Everyone I worked along side was like my second family. I left due to personal. I would go back in a heartbeat. Unfortunately it will not pay all my bills and I had to further my career. There is growth opportunity. However it is very hard to do. But I enjoyed it in my teen years and early 20’s
good,"Yes, it's a business, but because of poor management (2/5 managers are good when they feel like it) that tends to be nonconfrontational, we have people who come in high out of their mind, people who repeatedly don't show up but are still put on the schedule, and poor mediation. Work is unreliable in the spring/summer and they work you to death in the fall/winter (40 hour weeks, Thanksgiving required)"
good,"I was getting 25-30 hours per week now i get 10 or less. i have talked to my supervisor about it, now i am getting less.  I really like working here but i am going to have more hours."
good,"I mean, it is for sure somewhere to work and it was a great place but nothing ever got done. Getting the food out in less than ten minutes is super easy, if you just pay attention."
good,"Work there during the holiday seasons and it was enough to make anyone have a nervous breakdown. However, met some good people and was paid decently well."
good,First leadership role was a good environment for the most part If you need a job there always hiring cooks so you can try that although its a restaurant job so
good,It’s food service... what do you expect? The job is fun. Management was okay-ish. There’s room for improvement. One of those jobs where you sometimes have to carry more weight than others in this job... sometimes it pays off. Then sometimes it doesn’t.
good,Night Maintenance at Cracker Barrel was good to me. Never had issues with co-workers. I had a list of tasks to complete every night that was pretty consistent. Kept my mind occupied. Being able to listen to music while I worked made the job ten times better.
good,I really liked working at Cracker Barrel. I liked the management and the other employees and it wasnt very stressful until I moved back into the kitchen. The kitchen is like a whole different world and environment all together
good,good place to work for a single person.   nice to meet a lot of people. place is off interstate so you meet  people from all over.   We make very guest fell special.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"This was a pleasant break from the more stressful jobs I previously had but standing for 8-12 hours straight was difficult and we were not allowed to sit down. Also, you couldn't have anything to eat or drink at the register."
good,I have really enjoyed working at Cracker Barrel but their team work isn't always the best. I loved the people I worked with and the Guests that would come in there. We had a lot of regulars that became just like family.
good,This company has a rich history and a solid reputation in its core market. The west coast is a different story. The company is misguided and doomed without changes in upper management. The productivity expectation in the new units is proven to be untenable. Managers are expected to work long hours over what they are compensated for and forgo time off.
good,I would recommend this place. Great place to work & make friends. Get to pick your hours. Work as much as you want @ when you want. I left because I got burnt out & better job opportunity!
good,Overall a great place to start out at or have for a temporary job. I would highly recommend serving at Cracker Barrel as a first time serving position.
good,"I am trained in Cash/Retail, meaning I can do either where ever and when ever I am needed to meet the customer's needs.  This is a very friendly workplace.  I love meeting and greeting our guest and have gotten to know them personally."
good,Learned about food safety as well as job safety. Very fast paced to wash dishes & send through the drying phase. Put away clean dishes for the cooks & servers.
good,Cracker Barrel definitely has its policies and procedures and line and stick to them across the board leaves micromanagement basically incapable of nitpicking however there is still some discrepancies upon scheduling and favoritism
good,"Management changed right as I left and so did the overall attitude of the building. I know the new manager is much more caring, understanding, and generally and all around good guy. Some mangers there still stress out and get a little frustrating but the new general manager is not going to treat you badly and will listen to your problems and try to fix them."
good,"You work for your tips, which s great, but the only bad thing is that they over hire people so everyone is constantly fighting for hours. The great part was we got half off meals."
good,I was a waitress and still am. I am working my way through school and Cracker Barrel helps me along the way y providing me with a good work schedule and tips for success.
good,This job was about average and was nothing special to me.  The manager was rude and when giving my 2 week notice she kept me in the system for 3-4 more months.
good,The job is very fast pace and challenging. If you do a good job you get paid very well though. Some of the people you may work with might not be that friendly or that fun to work with.
good,"The majority of people were awesome to work with but the management was difficult to deal with. Favoritism runs rampant and unless you are a suck up or a rat, you wont get anywhere no matter how good you are at your job. On the other hand, if you are a great brown noser then you don't have to be good at your job at all!!!!"
good,"Compared to other restaurants, Cracker Barrel starts paying a little above minimum wage and depending on performance, they give small raises every once in a while."
good,A lot of drama on the work place and the management rules and regulations are based on favorites. Everyone talks about eachother behind their backs. Not a really great place to work
good,"Cracker Barrel is a good place to work overall. The management are really good about listening to the issues that you have and they understand that the job can become overwhelming at times, especially on days when the store and restaurant have heavier amounts of traffic than others."
good,"Rules seem justifiable for their reason, though not reasonable with accomplishments. I felt on edge since as a worker you are screened and controlled. Honestly many did well for themselves there, but it’s just not my thing"
good,It is a good first job. It is also a good way for a young teen to get some job experience. However there I some things that the managers could do a lot better to make the experience better for the employees.
good,My working experience with Cracker Barrel was good. I enjoyed working with the people there. The pay raise was not great. No benefits and it was fast paste.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Possible position for retail, host, server, various cook, dish and nightmare maintenance. All positions require hard work, dedication, self reliance, and self motivation. With this mindset, advancement is easy."
good,"Usually Cracker Barrel stays pretty busy, which means as a server you're running around like a chicken with its head cut off. Sometimes when people don't know you don't get paid anything but 2.13 and its tajen for taxes, its very annoying when they tip a dollar or two after you had to run around like a crazy person."
good,"If your willing to work long hours with no break, and can handle being on your feet the entire shift then you will be able to handle this job. There are no definite end times to shifts. Your shift depends on the customers. There are slow days when you don't make any money at all and then you have days where business is booming but there are too many other servers to really make money. Not everyday is a bad day and not every day is a good day. Your customers are how you earn your pay. Be advised that not everyone tips so don't expect it. No matter how much you do for them or how nice you are. Just know that there will always be someone else to make up that non-tipper."
good,"Very fast paced but it was hard to get along with a lot of the other servers."
good,I spent over a year working with ladies who always had something negative to say about someone or something! Very uncontrolled and undisciplined when I worked there. I would suggest for someone to apply at a roll other than server.
good,"There are very competitive sales goals and they get on you if you""re not making enough sales. You are in charge of working the sales floor and the cash register at the same time. You are constantly running back and forth between the two."
good,Good job with a lot of work with little money. great people o work with just like a big family. overbooked floor plans so not many tables. they go around schedule.
good,"Opened store, helped customers get their day started. Provided great customer service. Stocked shelves and coolers. Cleaned store.  Made stock orders, and received inventory."
good,"I've worked at 3 stores & only 1 has been a good fit for me. Great management, scheduling goes around school, & positive attitudes throughout the store. Other stores, not so much."
good,"It was a nice environment, for the most, part everyone is really helpful and its team oriented. Its a busy place so money was good and all the employees are treated nicely."
good,"We had managers who were participating in illegal acts and indiscreet relationships with lower level staff members, whom received special treatment for such."
good,"Cracker Barrel was a very professional work environment."
good,If you are looking for some extra cash thus place is a good place to start. With short hours and always part time you can expect to have a lot of spare time. Cross train opportunity and chance to grow after 2 passed evaluations and 6 months of work
good,"Originally hired on as a host, was trained as a dishwasher. not an easy job but some one has to do it, enjoyed the staff. would have been a better employee if I had the chance to learn how to do my job correctly."
good,"I served many local and loyal customers in this family owned business. I learned a lot about the food service industry at this small place that was opened in the 1950's. I made a great many friends in my co-workers, one that actually told me about the Cracker Barrel. "
good,"Very high paced and physically demanding position as a grill cook. Company advertises promotion within, but landing a promotion with the company is extremely hard. I see more management being hired externally than internally. Co-workers are pleasant to an extent and behaviors, drive, and attitudes tend to fluctuate according to business and stress. The hardest part of the position is dealing with the stress and pace and keeping employees motivated to work as a team. Most enjoyable part of the job is the sense of family at my location. "
good,I like working for Cracker Barrel because they are very flexible with my hours and schedule since I am attending school.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Typical day at work it just depends, sometimes the kitchen just crashes, and ticket times are long, guest get angry, other times kitchen is doing great, guest are happy, and everything runs smoothly, we just have to all work as a team on getting hot food out first before cold drinks and do team refills. "
good,"a typical day at cracker barrel was somewhat kind of fun I learned how to count money basic math school which I learned in school"
good,A usual day at cracker barrel consist of me usually getting to work early around 3:25 and I walk into work and assist my fellow workers with any tasks they are doing while I wait to clock in at 4:00. When I clock in at 4:00 my day usually goes by quick and around 9:30 I am usually cleaning up my section. The management is strict but always assist us in whatever we need. I enjoy working at cracker barrel because I have usual customers who come to see me.
good,"At Cracker Barrel it was a stressful place but overall good, I learned how to multitask between retail sales and restaurant sales. My coworkers were always upbeat and happy to help. Overall management was good, we had new managers every so often so things changed on a regular basis. The most enjoyable part was the regular customers who came in."
good,"Maybe 4 days a week with maybe 4 to 6 hours of working. Being a server at a big restaurant does not mean you get lots of hours and tables it means there's a lot of employees so you have very little. Management would kind of ignore your requests or get rude about."
good,I feel that the cooks are not treated fairly. We don't get off at our scheduled time makes it very hard to make time with the family .
good,"I loved working here. the only problem i had was they were so bad with sticking to the schedule when to be let off. restaurants do tend to be on their on schedule, but there is no excuse for someone to be scheduled to be off at 7 and get off at 9 or 10 instead."
good,Love my regular customer that ask for me every time they come in.
good,"For the most part I loved working at cracker barrel. The crew felt like family as did most of the managers.The hardest part for me were the things that could not be controlled , such as running out of stock and not being able to do my job properly, the best part,the regular guest that we got to know on personal levels"
good,good place for a future just look out for paul hall hes a hotheaded bulling manager and that is the only thing bad about this job
good,"Welcoming each new guest as the entered the store. Keeping the store clean and tidy as well as stocked and orderly was one of my main responsibilities. I would often be rewarded for making a sale by offering samples, selling rockers, and creating new displays."
good,"The management, at least most of it, is nice and very caring and helpful. However, there isn't always room for moving up, some of the managers lack discipline and know how and it's clear who the favorites are. The coworkers are fantastic for the most part, when you get some hours in. They're bad at scheduling, and you don't get compensated for the work you're doing."
good,My typical day at work was mainly taking care of guest and making sure we were all set up to run properly. I learned alot at cracker barrel! I learned the meaning of superior guest service and to please the guest in every way possible to create a comfortable atmosphere. The management team was alright. Some were great and some not so much. My co-workers were good when it comes to getting along at certain times and you had those who do help you when you needed it but some jus felt like evey man for themselves! The hardest part of the job was the teamwork and attitudes I just couldnt cope with it. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know many different people that ate at cracker barrel also I did create a new family with my co-workers.
good,"I really like working for cracker barrel, I would just love to further my career. A typical day at work for me, is just checking guests out and helping the retail floor with whatever they need. My management team could be a lot better, but you have to work with what you have. The hardest part of the job for me, is working with no breaks. After a long day, it's even more exhausting knowing you ran on full energy all day with no down time. But, the most enjoyable part for me, is seeing the guests leave happy because you really feel like you accomplished a lot."
good,This is not somewhere you want to be for a very long time. The mangers are not great. If you are a good employee they will over work you. The people are fun to work with
good,"Not a bad gig. They showed us plenty of appreciation and put us in a strong team building environment. I felt a little under pressure, but they helped us overcome."
good,"Great atmosphere with loving staff (when I first started) managers were cool till the nxt trainees came in who didn't know what they were doing and sucked at it!"
good,"It was a good community with the workers, but dishwashing was not a fun job. The managers didn’t let me take off the time I needed for football and school and later let me go because I missed, even though I told them I would."
good,"As a dishwasher, it helps tremendously to make friends with the wait staff. They’ll help you out when you’re short staffed or bring it you full bus bins so you don’t have to take the time to go and retrieve them. It also helps to at least be friendly with a couple managers so they’ll come and help out in the dish room at peak times if you’re short staffed. Also, just keep your head down, do your job right, and take the initiative to correctly perform your job and you’ll earn some credit around the kitchen from fellow wait staff and everyone that prepares the food. Keep the line cooks happy and keep clean dishes available when they need them at peaks times. Same thing with the wait staff- make sure that they have enough clean glasses, especially at peak times."
good,This job is ok if its your first job . Otherwise just being at the company for years gets over baring . It’s stressful at times but what job isn’t. If you’re there to make money its no problem .
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Bad management only a couple were any I would work with again. They realized that the place is run bad. Waitress run the show, managers make the floor plan they go in back waitress change it. There were a few good ones, but most only wanted there own pockets filled. "
good,"Family friendly and fun but seriousness is a must"
good,It's a good job if you need quick cash or are currently a student attending high school or college. They're really flexible with students. If you're currently attending school or have another job. just bring in your schedule and they'll work around it with you.
good,Management team at Shelbyville is outstanding!! Training was a bit rushed but it is a busy place!! Always open door policy with complete understanding and compassion in times of need ie when my dad passed away! Hard work and loyalty was rewarded and high values and standards were set and maintained loved my job there! Left to keep my three new grandchildren!
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with. It was a learning experience. I would go back to work for this company again and would recommend for a great first time server
good,"Good food fast pace ,too many people coming and going makes it harder to set a plan for side work ,overall it was good, customers mostly friendly older clientele."
good,"While working for Cracker Barrel you will find that although the atmosphere is inviting and warm, the work load is overwhelming. There are no real benefits as the management does not like for any employees to reach full time status. While a typical day for retail would be easy for a person scheduled for cashier, having countless side jobs with no one scheduled to help juggle all the guests and other required responsibilities while you work, there is always a sense of pressure. The coworkers make every day worth it in return because the team is  treated like a close knit family."
good,"I had fun working there and learned how to multitask, overall, it was a good experience in a fun environment. I enjoyed my coworkers and serving customers."
good,I like cracker barrell i like pepole who come and work there its a great place to work and eat i just dont get the hours i need and ive tried and tried so i do recommend cracker barrel if you can get hours
good,The management staff at Cracker Barrel are never on the same page. Definitely lack of communication. Hopefully it will get better. Don't get me wrong I like my managers theres just some things they could work on.
good,Dont expect to making a living wage but at least thr coworkers rock. They do work with you if you get a second job but I find that too crazy. Give more hours not time off to get a second job.
good,"The customers not all was a racist. Some of them did not like black people at all. On holidays it's busy as always, some of the employees were sneakily, lier, other then that they were good. The manager was confusing, one day they want you to do this, then do something else. and you want even get paid for it, like what you apply for you do that and more."
good,Overall good place to work for. Will work with your schedule. Management can’t be tough sometimes but it really just depends on what store you work at.
good,The environment is acceptable people are working together and they try to respect  each other.  Hours are long and they depend on those that are strong to pull the heavy load without compensation. If you become a trainer or redshirt you get to travel to different places and open new restaurants
good,As a server this is a great place to flip tables quickly and staff is enjoyable. Lots of regular customers and lots of busses traveling through. Made lasting relatoonships
good,Does not provide many hours to part time employees and never accept requested days off even when placed weeks in advance. Management has gotten worse since I started.
good,"This job is definitely fast paced and relies a lot on making sure you set up and keep things cleaned, stocked, and organized properly along with making sure guests food and drinks are put together neatly and correctly. Communication is very important, and being ready to help each other makes everyone’s jobs easier and helps the day go by faster."
good,"I would still work here but have to resin due to work injury.been with company for 22 an half years.good jod, great guest have built up my client tell over the years .they treat me good as I do them.more like family.an I hate I have to leave ."
good,"Overall good place to work, stressful chaotic at times. Good management and staff. I would recommend it for anyone who needs something quick to make money"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I did appreciate the work environment at Cracker Barrel it was professional and non discriminatory. Fun and overall i believe most of the employees showed team work and got along ok.
good,I started out just bussing tables but move on to dishes and bussing. Management was on top of making everything was donrle in a speedy pace. You can make alot of friends in the resturaunt business.
good,The job is great for high school students and the pay is decent for them. I however did not like how the managers treated the staff myself included. The food is amazing though
good,"a lot of stress management was the worst don't listen to employees getting off when it was time to leave"
good,"If your young it is a great job for you to start with,  (Host, serving, busser) as it was for me. It helped me with my communication skills , my problem solving, and I loved the environment. Greeting all kinds of different people from different places was a fun experience for me."
good,always classic good food but this is one of the largest privately owned restaurant chains with a lot lobbying power. they page servers nothing and expect everything.
good,Management was awful. Extremely mean and unfair. You had to be one of the top favorites in order to get treated fairly. Because if the GM HATES YOU YOU'RE NOT GONNA EVER SUCCEED.  WHICH is quite UNFORTUNATE. I loved my job at the Cracker Barrel!😥
good,The general manager will gladly put everything on her employees to make sure she looks good on paper. Coworkers are fun and happy mostly. They definitely need more efficient trainers.
good,"I loved this place! I started fresh out of college and it was a great place to ""get my feet wet""! It was definitely face paced and many nights i went home with aching feet, but the money was great as a server!"
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel was always great , co-workers were nice , very family oriented & comfort away from home , always busy & helped me gain working with people alot better , taught me self control and a gave me an Outlook to bettering my career"
good,Good company to work for with the exception of a few managers at this perticular location. Cant keep employees. Always a heavier work load for the employees who show up.
good,"A typical day at work is fast-paced on the weekends and pretty steady during weekdays. "
good,People are nice and it’s an experience to work there. Every place has their ups and downs. Although sometimes the hours that we’re given were so little for part time.
good,"Most of the management are good people however, my hours were reduced after returning from maternity leave. I was a hard worker but I felt like I was being treated like a new hire with no experience. At that point I was only making enough money for the gas to get me to work and I had to quit."
good,Opened our store Monday -Friday.  Answered the phone and answered all question and transferred to correct area's . Helped guest with sales. the company has a very nice work force. most enjoyed part of my job was being able to help the guest.
good,"Great part time job, great team, friendly environment, pay could be a lot better. Professional, fast pace, sharpens your communication skills.Overall great part time job."
good,"My experience at Cracker Barrel was fun I was able to work at a nice pace, maintain a healthy environment, learn how to swiftly keep up with each station, take test & earn certificates. THANKS for a wonderful opportunity."
good,"the staff was alright but there was so many things always going on a once a lot of people were very rude, i dont know if it was the area i was in or what"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,The only thing I didn't like was the fact that Every employee had to work on Every holiday. Most of the employees and managers are very helpful and it's fueled by team work..
good,"serving family, rolling silverware, re-stalking for next shift, team play for the most part, not all management is approachable .it can be stressful on a busy day. and it can be a fun day as well. depends on you ."
good,Cracker Barrel retail is a great place to work. During busy hours you are waiting on guests which is very satisfying. Slow times give you an opportunity for tasks to get done. A good balance
good,"CBOCS is a fun place to work but sometimes you have those who don't like to do much. It's nice to be able to talk with the customers who are traveling thru town and help them find snacks, or gifts."
good,Good company with great pay. Very busy and open all holidays but 
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with my everyday guests and having regulars made the job even more enjoyable and less stressful. The other employees were hard to work with sometimes but it did get stressful and everyone deals with stress differently.
good,"Working here is good. If you want a lot of hours, probably apply somewhere else. Best job for young people who want lots of free time or for older people who just want a side job. Management is fine. There could be some improvement, but if you do your job you wont have any problems with them. The hardest part of the job is pushing items to sell on every person you speak to. Most people don't take it well. The best part is all the stories you will hear from them. And getting to know the regulars."
good,"They have an excellent training program"
good,"High stress, long hours.  I spent 15 years in Restaurant Management and of all of the companies I worked for, Cracker Barrel was the best.  They gave you the help you needed when running a shift."
good,"Very busy every holiday,  Hours are similar to the industry standard however you might find yourself doing less managing and working in a position.  Overall a good job providing you have a good team."
good,"I lacked getting hours and had other things to do.  Other workers had foul language and the stress was too much.  Other than getting burned or hearing about someone's sad lifestyle, the work pace was enjoyable and friendly."
good,"The pay isn't that great, but the managers treat you like family! You get 20% discount on food and retail products. You have the option to participate in a program that will help you get raises."
good,"Greeted all guess with a smile"
good,It’s generally an over all good place to work. You don’t get that many hours but they are very flexible and work with your schedule. The pay isn’t that great especially when you aren’t getting that many hours.
good,a typical day at work was strenuous long hours  and fast past but in high insides it brought a smile to my face to see people happy. that is my goal to see people happy and i love hard work
good,"Every day is different at Cracker Barrel, but one constant theme is the stressful environment caused by the discrepancy in talent among staff.  Some are strong team players, managers included.  Others engage only when volume is high and things aren't running smoothly. There is little accountability for team members that don't carry their weight and even less repercussions for their underperformance.  Loved the clientele, but advancement opportunities seem to go to outside candidates rather than dedicated employees willing to be promoted from within."
good,Very quick paced but has it slow days. Great management and opportunists to grow with in the company if you put the time in. It is the number one training store in the company.
good,"This is a good job for teenagers starting out. It teaches a sense of responsibility and manners. As a server, people normally get paid around $2.63 an hour, but at Cracker Barrel, you get to keep all of your tips. How hard you work affects how much you get paid."
good,"I was a host and enjoyed working at this restaurant, I sat guests and when we were busy, I'd take names for the waitlist. Managers were nice and so were other employees and everyone was treated equally. My only complaints would be, on week days the restaurant was very slow and I would get bored just standing in one spot for long periods of time. Also, I wanted to move up to become a server and had said this to the manager who interviewed me and hired me. After a couple months passed, I had brought it up to him again but said he'd think about it and get back to me, this was an ongoing process until I decided I had enough and gave my two weeks and looked for a serving job somewhere else."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"decent place to work I worked 3 different positions just to try to get 40 hours, can be slow during the week but weekends are your moneymakers, management could be better if they quit going thru them so fast"
good,"It was a fun place to work, but the pace was wishy washy. It could be busy one min then the next your just standing around. Plus you're on your feet all day!"
good,"The management didn't always have good communication but they managed okay. The people are great and make it worth it. The hardest part would have to be how stressful it gets at times with how busy it gets. Typically during the weekdays I was there by myself so when it got busy is was a bit overwhelming. My typical shift was 8am-3pm/4pm, 5 days a week, and working at least one weekend day."
good,"If you manage to get one of the managers to like you, it's a pretty great job. Not a set schedule, but it is easy to pick up or get a shift covered. Management plays hot and cold, they let their day and mood effect how they treat their employees. Often times the favorite workers are the meanest, so no repercussions for them while they liked to point fingers at the people they dont like as much. If you're looking for a solid schedule, don't like getting taken advantage of, or often have differing views as management look elsewhere. If youre good at blending in, you'll maybe enjoy it there."
good,The people and surroundings around you are amazing. They build up your skills as you go. It's a very great place to work if you like a steady pace of work.
good,Faced paced environment where i take orders with accuracy and get their food out to them with speed and efficiency. The hardest part of my job is working hard when no one else is. Everyone one is not a team player. The most enjoyable part of my job is making my guest are happy and full and giving them good service.
good,"Great place to work, especially on weekend.  Tips are great, people are friendly.  The management is pretty poor though.  There was always one strong manager and then the others weren't so great."
good,Everybody worked together to please the guest. Cracker Barrel tought me how to be a team player. I’ve learned more communication skills. Learned to lend a helping hand to others.
good,It wasn't the best job. The servers didn't usually put the silver in the correct place so you would get stabbed in the hand. Most of the time you were alone to wash and put away dishes. You didn't get breaks unless you could find a lull during your shift to chug a drink or go to the bathroom. But not usually both. You could tell them your available hours didn't mean they would go by what you told them. They will still put you on shift when they know you cannot work those hours.
good,"mangers are always yelling at the waitress, the waitress get blamed for everything if the cooks are not doing there job the waitress will be yelled at"
good,"The environment of the work place is not what it seem to be. As a server we get paid less than minimum wage, but the work that we do we should get paid more."
good,"During my time working at Cracker Barrel, I felt underappreciated, over-managed, and over-worked. While CB was extremely understanding to their pregnant employees, the rest of the employees had to take up the slack. Some employees took on at least three ""chores"" on top of their mandatory silverware duty. "
good,"I loved working at Cracker Barrel, you always felt like family. The only problem I had was management wasn't put together very well. They went through 3 managers in the couple of months I was there, which caused a lot of problems for everyone else."
good,Everything was very fast paced.  Teamwork is a must at Cracker Barrel.  You have to be able to work with little to no breaks.  The managers were always willing to help.
good,"I liked working for the Company. I was not crazy about my management team. They don't advance you quickly, in my experience they want you to do all the jobs but now give you the title or pay you deserve."
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel was a great experience, but often left me on edge and stressed. The management lacked communication with each other, and usually struggled to work as a team. While working, you could order an employee meal for 50% off, but it must be eaten in the breakroom. Depending on your PAR level, you have discounts on meals and the in retail store. This job is what you make it."
good,"You must be able to work in a very fast past, and be able to keep up. All the co workers are very helpful and fun to work with. Managers can expect too much from the waitresses at times , but they can be very helpful as well. You can always go to the main manager and talk to him about anything. The training is very explanatory."
good,You get paid 8.25 to start. there are a series of tests you have to take to get the stars on your apron. It is not an easy job. It is very stressful job and you dont get paid enough to do it.
good,"Just like most waitress or restaurant jobs, the work is hard and tiring but the people were great.  The management was great to work with you concerning times you would like to work or could not work."
good,This Job was fine until they low balled us on benefits and bonuses something always changed right before the benefits came in.The location was a challenge learned a lot of working under pressure and character being tested.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"I would tell everyone I know to go apply within Cracker Barrel. I loved working here. It was fun the food was/is always awesome. There was only one manager that I did not get along with too well, only because of the fact that it seemed he picked on me, but I know he was just trying to help me out and make sure that I did my job to the fullest, and the best of my abilities."
good,"I learned a lot about leadership here and this was the beginning of my leadership roles.  Started out as a server and made my way up to management with in a bout a year.  "
good,"It is on the upper end of typical restaurant jobs I have had. If you go in wanting to hate it, then you will. If you can be a bit zen about things, the environment and work can definitely be enjoyable. Unfortunately, it isn't very fulfilling working in any corporate restaurant."
good,Managers are rude and contradict what they tell you to do on a daily basis. Never got good hours. Had to drive almost 22 miles for very little pay a week.
good,"I loved working for this company but I was ready for change and need to expand my horizons. They usually were really great about working with my schedule while I was pregnant, and in school. Always seemed fair in judgment and helped whenever help was needed"
good,"Worked at cracker barrel 4 years now as a cashier.  Love my coworkers and job there, but would like to pursue a career with animals....I have a great boss there and I like what I do at cracker barrel"
good,"It is a nice place to work. Good benefits.  Good vibe and great food. Also enjoyed the people that I met along the way. I would not trade the experience for anything, but it is not something that I want to do forever."
good,Not every job is going to be a great place everyday. at the time i worked there the management worked very well with my schedual. i enjoyed my time there. o
good,"Got to work in every area of the store, I liked working as a server the best because I got to interact with the customers the most and talk to people from different parts of the country."
good,"A typical day involves working with 1-5 other cooks, cooking through waves of guests coming through to eat. Communication is an issue, especially with management. However, the staff works well together once communication can be reached. Everyone works as a team. I've learned multi-tasking and time management, especially on days that I have had to open or close the store. This involves cooking for anyone who comes in, while also cleaning the whole grill line and pulling food to thaw for the rest of the day or putting away food to be saved."
good,I enjoyed working here because I enjoyed meeting new people everyday as well as seeing the usual clients that visited often.  I felt like I did a good job when they came back and asked to have me as their waitress.
good,"Cracker barrel was an ok first job, but the location i worked at was severely understaffed. Management was ok but one manager didn't really know what he was doing. If you're going to work here as a dishwasher then be prepared to leave soaked at the end of the day, and be prepared to burn yourself with scalding hot water"
good,"The management is great, and most of the people are nice to work with. You don't get many hours to make a living and less during summer. You need a second job to make a living, "
good,"I loved Cracker Barrel for my first job, they were very understanding and patient with me while training, and everyone was always free to help. The management was very kind and friendly, but also stern. It was a strict place to work, but I think that's what I liked most about it."
good,Knowing your product information and placement greatly assist you with providing the best customer service. you also need to be able to do quick calculations for product sales and promotions.
good,Cracker Barrel offers you the opportunity to advance at all levels in the company.  When working at Cracker Barrel you become part of a family.
good,It was a great job when i started once new managers came in thats when it when down hill. We had managers talk down to us always for what we done wrong and never tell what a good job we did do when we done it. I believe to have a god crew you have to treat people with respect.
good,Very tedious and boring. No one got a long and the management was just very disorganized and no one did what they were supposed to. I did not look forward to going into work.
good,"There are flexible hours for those with a second job or a family. During the holidays, however, the flexibility is tough. I work on the retail side, and I usually work every holiday.. It is pretty easy to move up a ""par level"", but to get into management, it is really tough. The time for training is extensive and can take up to a year, even for the Retail Management position, and even then, there needs to be a position open. The co-worker environment is usually friendly, but most guests are grumpy and definitely take it out on the cashiers. Just prepare to be busy one day, and bored the next. Each month is different and the amount of hours you work could vary."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,my daily job at work was basically promoting sales and helping the guest with any retail needs. I was only seasonal so I wasn't there long but I enjoyed my time there. I had pretty great coworkers and made friends with some people. The most enjoyable part was probably whenever kids came in and were playing with the toys and I could help show them how the toy worked and all. I also enjoyed when I had sweet customers and a lot of them came in a lot. I learned that you have to come to work everyday with a smile or a great attitude no matter what mood you were in. You needed to let the customers see that you were in a good mood and had a positive attitude.
good,"Generally the staff is overworked with little regard to breaks, scheduled out times or days off."
good,"This organization has the atmosphere of family and personal awareness of one another.  Many employee's become friends outside of work, which is a nice touch. Employee's have the opportunity to submit idea's for holiday get together,s among the staff. Cracker Barrell allows many holiday pot luck meals for employee's that work the holiday hours."
good,"well run with a diverse management style easy going and flexible about school schedules etc. Hit or miss customers, but for this type of job good money to be made if you work your but off."
good,"A typical day at work involves the senior servers struggling between picking up trainees slack so to speak. No disrespect just a challenging job that is not for everyone and takes trying and failing to discover this fact."
good,"At this job you are pretty much the slave of everyone else, I adored my managers. But all the retail and servers walk all over you and push you around."
good,"A typical day for me was serving customers and keeping things clean."
good,"My typical day at work begins as soon as clock in for my workday. I get a chance to smile and greet the customers with the highest form of hospitality possible. I have learned that this type of atmosphere is totally different from my day-to-day interaction with customers on the phone in the past. Cracker Barrel has prepared me for my career as a Medical Office Administrator because I'm working with the general public in person. We have an excellent management group and my co-workers are like family to me. The hardest part of my job is dealing with customers that have had a bad day and for some reason want to take it out on me, but I don't take it personal because I know that I have done everything that I can to help each and every person that I encounter. Positive feedback and a pleasant smile can do wonders for people, so I make it part of my job description everyday. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fact that I am able to meet some wonderful people everyday. I really enjoy the regular guest that we get daily. They tell me that they enjoy seeing me too."
good,"Very comfortable and enjoyed the people I worked with, had to work long hours to make good money."
good,They offer a lot of training for employs and a few raises based on completing the training at different points. My experiences were good  but it depends on the people you work with.
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel was always fun! Management was good, and I loved all my co-workers. I was disappointed when my seasonal time there was up and I had to leave. My most enjoyable part of the job was always meeting different people from all over the place and all the fancy new items the company always brought in to sell."
good,Loved my customers and got along with everyone. My co-workers was very nice. Managers took care of the problems I may have had. Managers checked on me to make sure I was okay. Not bad of a job for teens.
good,Working at Cracker Barrel was a great experience though some of the other staff weren't always nice and were very loud and unfriendly in the kitchen. Managers were great as well as my fellow hosts and retail employees.
good,Enjoy working for this company just isn't guaranteed money. I am currently raising a family of 6 so would like more stabile income.
good,A fast paced work environment. The Cracker Barrel Corporation works hard to keep employee's informed on food safety and sanitation. Great flexibility on cross training for other positions.
good,Very much a happy environment. I deeply enjoyed the work that I did and creating a chance to meet new friends and different people from different work ethnics. The hardest part was having to leave my fellow ex coworkers.
good,"The managers grow on you and you learn quickly. The tips are not bad at all, and you don't have to tip out a bar or any hosts."
good,"schedule employees"
good,"Decent place to work, not a lot of money to be made as a waitress."
good,"Cracker Barrel is a very nice place to work. A typical day is only 5 hours. I enjoy getting the discounts on the things I buy from there. The work is not what one would call hard except for the fact that you are standing for the whole time and it can get to your back. My co-workers are very easy to get along with especially Alison. I have learned a lot about being around the public, in many different areas of work not just at Cracker Barrel."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"The company itself is a good place to work. However, the difference in the location plays a huge part in the job duties and qualifications of the work place. The job of being a server opens the doors to meet great new people and get in routine with the regulars. Changing locations to another state was the most challenging and has showed me that it is time for me to advance my career search and use my degrees."
good,     I had the opportunity to meet new people everyday and serve them. All of the employees working together to make it a great environment was so great.  I learned how to work more with others and how great of an opportunity it is to train others.
good,A typical day at work would be very busy; I only work Sunday mornings as of right now because of school so it's usually very busy and fast-pace in the restaurant. I gained a lot of team work and communication skills as well as custom service skills. The hardest part of the job is keeping a positive attitude all day even when things go wrong. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and interacting with new people every shift.
good,"This job is very fast paced, good place to work when you're in college, they work around your school schedule"
good,"Fast paced, busy restaurant but it had a fun work environment. There was a family atmosphere and most everyone got along. I learned a lot about about food handling, storage, and safety. It got real busy on holidays but when we worked as a team it seemed like a machine. They seemed to weed out the ""bad apples"" quickly and keep it a relatively fun place to work."
good,I like the job. We work with guests and make sure that they have the correct order. I have learned that you have to be careful what you say to other employees because they cannot be trusted to keep party surprise plans. I like being able to talk to my co-workers.
good,"Prepared dishes following recipe or verbal instructions, stored food in designated containers and storage areas to prevent spoilage, cleaned work areas, equipment, utensils, dishes, and silverware. Cooked food properly and in a timely fashion, using safety precautions. Maintained cleanliness of grill line, stocked product drawers and filtered grease pit."
good,Cracker barrel is a great place to work. The management team is fun and diverse.
good,Cracker Barrel was a great place to work during the year. Learned the importance of cooking food to temp and being organized as well as working with a sense of urgency.
good,From day one of training i knew what my duties were. I had a clear understanding of everything and my trainer made sure i had no concerns. Going to work is dreaded its fun. The co-workers are amazing and extremely nice. There really is no hard part of the job i enjoy it all.
good,GOOD COMPANY TO WORK. WHEN COMPANY CHANGE SOMETIME PRIORITIES CHANGE And that could be a good thing and a bad.good for adim sometimes bad for workers
good,It was a fun job during high school. I made good money but that was before the recession and people stopped going out to eat.
good,I enjoy working with the other employee and talking to the customer.
good,"It was great meeting new customers every day, having a great team and working with new people in our respective areas."
good,I loved working at Cracker Barrel. The only thing I would say bad about the job/place is management could be more openly to talking to their employees.
good,I had a great time there aside from dramatically varying tip earnings. The family-friendly environment was really uplifting as well and that always helped the day go by much faster and easier.
good,Must work hard have good work ethic and be helpful to everyone.  The gguests are nice and mostly regulars so it's important to provide quality service.
good,"The relationships you build with you clients/guests will last a lifetime. Great flexibility with scheduling, especially if you’re working and taking classes. (Full disclosure) during my time of employment I was part time."
good,"Job stability.  Make your own hours.  Meet a lot of individuals. 401k plans and stock available.  Ability to cross train in other areas, advancements and paid vacations."
good,"It was a nice place to work. Very friendly manager and co workers. Flexible work schedule, very clean place to work and build a future if you work hard"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Location was chaotic and management was rough. Co workers and environment was good. Dress code and appearance is very strict. You learn good customer service skills.
good,It was a good job nice people I love working with people the managers are very understanding and the hours are very reasonable and they have good food
good,At Cracker Barrel every day was a learning opportunity. I started out as a cashier there but soon was pulled into the retail scene with my love of helping the guests out by finding the perfect gift for someone in their family or showing them that Cracker Barrel carried their favorite candy from when they were a child. The co-workers were often very friendly and working there was one of my favorite jobs.
good,Working at Cracker Barrel was actually one of the best jobs I had. The environment was very friendly and peaceful. I loved the food as well. Unfortunately my school schedule was conflicting.
good,I started with this company back in March 2016 and I currently work there now. I would recommend this job to anyone who has previous serving experience
good,I enjoyed working here. This is one of the few jobs that I was sad to leave. Everyone is very friendly and the work is fairly easy. Only downside is not enough hours since they only hire part-time usually.
good,You can be there some days and the shift will go by fine. But on the other had some day you can go to work and it could be stressful and the mangers don’t make it any better.
good,Great place to work and to improve skills to eventually give you good experience in working in a high paced family or fine dining restaurant.   Many opportunities exist to expand a career.
good,When I got hired at this location I thought it would be my forever job but  unfortunately one of my supervisors was the worst  to work with so I made a decision to not deal with harassment.
good,Great job I loved the environment it's was really cool the customers our employees just everyone just so nice and Team work was never a problem everyone worked
good,It was an okay job for my first job. Management was okay except for a select few. Business could be very slow which is dragging for a host. Managers can be very hard on you.
good,"I liked the job when I worked there in high school. I personally find myself needing more than the salary there to live. Depending on the day, it could run smooth and slow, or fast-paced and overwhelming."
good,Worked for CB for 8 years. It’s your typical serving job. Holidays are super busy and you cannot request those days off. You have to buy your own Oxford shirt in one of 4 approved colors.
good,"At times it can be crazy like during a rush the staff is great and the managers do a good job. You have to like working with the public!"
good,"great place to work if you are beginning to serve, summers can be hectic but other than that a fun place to work. if you're looking to start somewhere, here is the place."
good,"I have worked here for over a year now, the managers are good for the most part. but its a restaurant job so it is what it is. It is a pretty relaxed workplace, and the coworkers are like family."
good,"All in all not a bad place and environment to work, shop and also have lunch and dinner. It paid decent and everyone is so old school, laid back and relaxed"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I’ve worked here for two years and I’ve enjoyed the process it’s a great learning experience. It is very fast pace and if you can make it there you can make it anywhere.
good,The coworkers are friendly and everyone is very team oriented. Everyone works together to keep all of our guests and all employees or management happy.
good,"The pace obviously depends on what day of the week it is. Week days are slow, week nights are moderate. Weekends are definitely the most busy, which means more tips. Lots of elderly people come, that can be bittersweet."
good,Overall it’s a good job for those who are still in high school or just looking to make some extra money. I’d recommend to all my friends in school now.
good,I love my job but I believe that one of the manger has issue with female that are hard working ...I love working here when I first started great hours but they start playing with hours so had to find a second job
good,it was a fun but sometimes stressful job. team work makes the job better. they offer good wages and  opportunities for advancement. great place to work.
good,This job is a great job for quick cash. Friendly and welcoming staff. I have worked for Cracker Barrel for 3 years and it still keeps me on my toes. It’s a different environment every day.
good,"Cracker Barrel helped me save a lot of money for college when I was a server because table turn over is always on full force, so its easy to have a lot of tables in a shift.  I felt really taken care of there and felt apart of a team."
good,"This job doesn't make you a lot of money. They really only schedule me for two days a week with three tables or less. I don't make enough here for gas let alone college. It is a very fun place to work, but also very stressful."
good,"There seems to be a lot of shift managers that are very adept at treating older workers like children,  although there is a job to do you need to have your employees take on some empowerment in their routines, useful suggestions by working staff is never considered or it never gets passed up the chain of command, every kitchen has different floor plans, sometimes there has to be supple  changes to progress the flow of foods throughout the BOH"
good,"All though overnight maintenance was a little tiring and dish washing could be a bit hectic, I believe this is the place I probably shoul have stayed."
good,"As far as serving jobs go, Cracker Barrel was a good place to work. Depends entirely on the management and coworkers there at the time. OKC location most of management was iffy or just obviously tired of their job and there was a TON of drama/arguments between other servers (but that was years ago). Norman location managers and coworkers were awesome!! Night and day difference."
good,"You get out of this job what you put in. If you’re lazy, you won’t get your hours. If you’re a hard worker, you will be recognized and rewarded with more shifts, and even placed on a higher role."
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel as a server has overall been a good experience.  When you start things are slow as expected.  I have been there for about 5.5 months now.  I am now seeing the results I wanted in seating charts and shifts.  You have to give the experience some time in order to get a good payout.  This only applies though, if you are willing to work hard and want to advance.  The only complaint I have is that you only receive your schedule two days before the workweek starts. The employee discount is a great benefit.  This is the perfect place to start as a first-time server."
good,If given another opportunity to manage there I would look into it. Cracker Barrel was a great place to take care of the guest as you would a family member. Unfortunately some people lose that as there drive and it takes satisfaction out of the summary. Like I said given another opportunity to work in management there again would be interesting . God bless
good,I like working Cracker Barrel  everyone is very friendly.  The store is fresh and clean and we get lots of fun stuff in.  The hardest part of the job are Sundays it's crazy busy and sometimes becomes a little stressing but overall  no problem.  The most enjoyable dutie to be is processing the truck.
good,What the company stands for as far as values is very admirable.  They care about people and family.  They work with any schedule to make sure you can go to school or get an additional job if necessary.
good,"I loved working at Cracker Barrel, the managers were awesome and the money was good. I got a different opportunity though and moved on. Miss the place and the lovely coworkers."
good,"Nice Place to work, but not for me. The overall experience was good, but this job was not helping me towards my career goals. My reason for quitting was because of health issues I had at the time. Overall a great place to work, but this place did have its cons."
good,This was my first real job as I was hired at 16! I started out as a hostess then started to train new people as they were hired. I was the first minor server to work at my location and set a pretty good platform for others. I had a great time here and hope to work part-time as a server again.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Loved working there did noy want to make the commute any longer.I opened the store In Auburn In ,quickly became a skill trainer.Over the next 13 years worked at Cracker Barrel in Va and Fla.I quit after 13 years because I did not to make the commute any longer."
good,"Another do what you gotta do job. Not a bad first job, just not something i could see myself doing everyday for the rest of my life. not very fun being there."
good,Excellent  and growth potential  good working environment and have some great management . Hours are flexible  management looks for opportunities to advance employee within store you can go to mangers to discuss issues and look for resolutions
good,"I love my employees but the other managers can be tough to work with. Scheduling kind of sucks. We get great benefits! Good room"
good,"Lots of new changes, good place to work. I didnt like having to work holidays and weekends. Should have more hours for employees. And pay more attention to employee feedback"
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel is fast-paced and detail oriented. It encourages a team ethical environment and I would recommend it to anyone wanting to stick it out for the long haul. The hours can fluctuate, and the days can be cut back to one day a week without your expectations, but if you need a job and not the money, work here."
good,"I worked here for 3 yrs and it felt like part time the entire time I was gone a bit due to pregnancy and was grateful to still have a job to come back too."
good,"All positions are part time, but if you pick up a lot and show that you are motivated more shifts can be given. Servers keep all tips and must report all. Hosts and bussers make more and do not collect tips."
good,"As a dishwasher, I was always cleaning during the whole shift. If it got we had cleaning duties. Never was a time to stand around."
good,The management was pretty good. The only reason I left was because they were cutting my hours. You got a discount on one bill every day you worked. Payed decent too.
good,the work place is comfortable its just that working there we were short staffed .the management didn't make me feel apart of the team like other positions in the workplace
good,It’s ok working there but I just want something better. The management can be a lot better I think they to get to know there staff a little bit better. They need new servers they don’t know how to talk to ppl
good,"I had a responsibility of exercising distinguished time management skills and communication skills. I was required to take computer test's to account for my knowledge of the menu and policies of Cracker Barrel. I had to maintain restaurant expectations, and complete a specific duty before I left the every night at the end of my shift, these duties were determined by closing employee's every night. I had to utilize my interpersonal skills to connect with guest and provide quality service. I had to be trained in conflict management and resolution to ensure our guest never left unsatisfied."
good,Very fast paced environment that keeps you on your toes.  Great group of people who work hard but are underpaid.  Open almost every day of the year so family time is a concern sometimes
good,"Great place to work if you’re expecting to stay in the food industry, managers are wonderful and lots of opportunities to move up in the company. Have created very good friends at this place."
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel was good. shifts are usually five to six hours long. the hardest part of the job was when there was a rush, and you had several tables sit down at once. This means you have to provide great care for three or four tables, all at the same time. This makes it very difficult on both you and the cooks."
good,"It’s a very nice play to work at, the food is really good and you can get most days off as long as you let them know with like a week in advance and tell them the reason why."
good,"The corporation needs to be more aware of the different areas they are in and what will and won't sell."
good,"Overall good job for quick cash and active. Diversity in people and their stories.Interesting and busy depending on day of the week. Interesting coworkers, managers and supportive guests at most."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Cracker Barrel was always busy for a hostess. You were always moving, never sitting. The atmosphere there was amazing and homely feeling. If I had a choice to go back, I would ."
good,I don’t like how much I have to work to get paid the bare minimum I do make. I bust my butt to get money but people are just not generous at all when it comes to money.
good,A typical day of work was both fun and really busy. I did learn a lot and I loved greeting the customers as they walked in and making their day.I just did not appreciate not getting any hours was the reason for me quitting.
good,"Although it can get busy at times and servers run into each other, the atmosphere is enjoyable and the people are friendly. It is easy to be part of a team environment."
good,"Fun place to work , staff members are very kind for the most part, gets very busy on sunday mornings. Overall a fun and fast paced place to work for a first job."
good,Standing on your feet for long hours with no real break is the only negative thing I can remember from this job. Most of the customers are easy going. A few times I sold extra retail items and the manager bought me candy.
good,"The staff are nice and helpful. Managers try to adjust schedule according to requests. Overall it was a good job , just suck on hours. Good job for servers . Don’t like the fact that you don’t get a lunch break unless you’ve worked 8 hours or"
good,"A day at cracker barrel, you go in and get straight to it. No matter what you are doing, there is always more work to be done. The coworkers are the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"I only worked at Cracker Barrel for a few months but it was pretty good. Pay is a a little above minimum wage and it is weekly. It can get very busy on the weekends.Great company, but hours are cut frequently"
good,Ok place to work. You are easily replaced. Very competitive. A lot of gossip. You have to work Sunday or you won't get any hours in retail. Have open availability.
good,"During the season of thanksgiving, the whole kitchen transforms into a mess. Managers at the time are very unresponsive and lack communication. and no time and a half for working the holiday."
good,I had 3 good managers and 1 awful one. Overall ok experience. Didn’t make much in tips though - just about minimum wage. Fast paced and extremely stressful.
good,"If you can get under the right management, you can benefit from the good values that the company tries to portray.  They have a great training culture in a competitive market."
good,"Cracker Barrel is a good start up company.They will teach you good communication skills and also team work skills.It is a enjoyable work Environment,everybody is friendly,and helpful.The con is that it can get really fast paced for dishwasher!"
good,"Hectic workplace allowed for  multitasking skill opportunities. Money was good, great coworkers, terrible management. Awful scheduling and requests for time off were handles poorly."
good,A fun and fast-paced workplace. Managers are friendly and everyone is always willing to help one another. Co workers enjoy having fun while on the clock.
good,"This company cares and treat their employees well to an extent. The discounts you receive on and off the clock is wonderful. Especially if you work there and ""par"" up. The managers will most of the time come help you if you need it and are willing to get their hands dirty when you are getting slammed. The major point that this company lacks in is pay. The pay they give for employees who have worked their for a long time/ raises are a joke. You slave for hours on in of getting your butt kicked (trust me this is a super busy restaurant chain) however you get paid dirt money for it. Overall if they would have paid me what I deserve for the time I put into this restaurant then I would have stayed with them."
good,Good place to work everyone is nice there decent hrs come in do your job an get to go home early sometimes an sometimes is 12 hrs day. You might get moved around in the warehouse to help another department
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"server job was fun, its a nice work environment, everything is set up very well. you work along side alot of people, and every one is always looking after one another"
good,"this was a great first job introduction to a real company, i enjoyed working there and making some great friends, this is a great place to form friendships"
good,"General food place to work, vert faced pace so if that's not your thing move on. potential for high stress especially when customers are being extra needy or there is a really big rush"
good,"I liked the fast pace working environment,  people pleasing attitude."
good,Cracker barrel is strictly about pleasing the guests! The employees at Cracker barrel get along great and are always willing to help one another. The pay is fair and there are always incentives for the employees.
good,"A job not for everyone but good paying if you’re up for it and nice people to work with and get to know, for a first job it was rather stressful to me but it’s a pretty relaxed job if you can get the hang of it."
good,It was a great place to work they are very understanding of things an work with you on your hours they were very flexible an the managers were there to help of you ever needed it they were patience while you learn your job
good,cracker barrel is pretty chill and laid back. we do get busy and it can get hectic but its usually pretty chill. the managers are super cool and get along with everyone really well. i havent had one bad manager at cracker barrel
good,"Cleaning is not a bunch a fun, but i got the job done. I learned how to work a dishwasher machine also. Once i got the hang of eveything it was pretty easy."
good,"Very busy location, you will make good (serving) money if you are a team player and do your job. Management is about what you expect from most restaurants, everyone is trying their best."
good,"Very fast pace and busy work place. Lots of money to be made if you are willing to put in the work, always music playing, over all great work place. Very friendly staff and management"
good,"Usually pretty busy which makes it easy to make good tips. Their is supposed to be good teamwork, but lately it's lacking in that regard. so it has been stressful in that regard. easy to always stay busy because there is always something that needs cleaned."
good,Cracker Barrel is a fun place to work. The employees there is awesome and they help out in every way. The best part of the job is making sure the guest leaves happy and satisfied.
good,"It is highly encouraged to help others out, and although not everyone does, I still appreciate the leaders pushing for team player mentalities in everyone."
good,"A typical day at Cracker Barrel varies day to day.  The guests are treated like family. Co-workers have a unique bond and are very close. I've learned many positions while working there. Hardest part of the job is definitely the fast pace that working in a restaurant requires. The best part about working there is by far the people. My co-workers are like a second family, but I wouldn't change them for the world."
good,"To start the day, we make sure we are prepared for everything needed to have a productive shift. There is a lot more to working as a server than meets the eye, it is very demanding from the back of the house along with serving our guest. Our Co. mission statement is ""Pleasing People"" and we go above and beyond to provide just that. We prepare hot meals and give excellent service to ensure our guest have the best dining experience possible. It all starts with great leadership beginning with the G.M., along with the associate managers that work extremely hard for our guest and employees. We all work as a ""team"". This is a great place to be employed with. "
good,It is a great place to work when you don’t need a lot of money and you aren’t on a fixed schedule. Great when I was in high school but now that I am in college I need something a bit more flexible with higher pay.
good,I enjoyed my job as a retail associate. I was kept busy and my hours on the job went by fairly fast and steady work pace. I learned to be comfortable with customers and very knowledgeable of all products sold at Cracker Barrel as well as the food.
good,"The amount of money you make solely on the customers you get and how fast the kitchen can prepare their food. Coworkers were nice and easy to get along with, but management would tend to be rude and ignorant to their employees and environment."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Productive and cool workplace to buss tables and clean each dishes, cups, and silverwares. I learned how to stock up all the dishes, cups, and silverwares as they are clean and ready to be reused."
good,"Just like everywhere else, the ""team"" either made it or broke it. Some were lazy and wouldn't help which reflected on your tips during peak hours. Dishes were always behind. Management was alright but could be harsh over the tiniest things."
good,"I got to work, waited in my guests. During my shift, I would run my guests food/drinks, or other servers guests food/drinks. I would roll silverware throughout my shift, and would do side work after my shift."
good,"I loved my time at craker barrel, they gave me a opportunity to work in multiple positions. Worked double shifts,  food was amaxing. People were amazing to work with."
good,Working at cracker barrell was a wonderful experience. For 16 years that company provided me with a job to provide for my family......................
good,"Management and fellow co-workers made the barrel tolerable. Being in the service industry, customers can sometimes be a challenge, but that's a typical world for a server. Overall, a good company to work for."
good,"The restaurant team and customers I worked with were great. They have excellent training program and pay management well. However, their upper management is horrible- a bunch of sexist men that need to be gotten rid of."
good,"I have enjoyed every minute working at Cracker Barrel. Working as a host, I have a steady income. However, when I cross trained as a server the $2.13 an hour does NOT show up on a paycheck thanks to taxes, so what you make that night is what you get. But for me its not really about the money, its more about the people. Everyone at my store are like family to me and I hope that you can have that kind of relationship at your store."
good,Cracker Barrel was an great experience job where prepared meals as they were ordered.  It was face pace but rewarding because I love to cook and  good food makes people come back.
good,"Weekends were busy and you are always moving. Weekdays are slower and theirs less to do. "
good,"Being host/hostess at Cracker Barrel is a fast paced, people pleasing job that allows you to work flexible hours if needed.  It is especially good for a retired person or student who only wants to work part-time."
good,"I enjoyed working here, the customers are almost always friendly. Though the menu is extensive and hard to master, but once you've been doing and seeing it awhile you catch on quick."
good,"Everyone gets a long, very multicultural. Typical day would be bussing tables washing dishes and getting stock from the back. management is respectful and understanding"
good,"Cracker Barrel is a wonderful place to work. Unfortunately there are many new hires and those that have been working there  a long time do not get many hours. It is a quick paced learning environment, somewhat stressful at times. I enjoy interacting with the customers, but sometimes there is a lack of teamwork amongst the servers."
good,"This was a fairly decent job.. You have good days and bad days, however the tips on the bad days werent matching up, so i needed to make more money elsewhere.. the people were friendly and managers were great though! Just needed better pay,..."
good,"Cracker Barrel has done so much for me and is a great job overall.They take minors so if your tryin to have a good start off job Cracker Barrel is the job. They give you great benefits and all the employees are very kind, this is a great place to work at"
good,"George Treadway was lead supervisor.Tough on most people, but to me me was a pussycat.He liked to rate my work better then others in front of them. I had to get on him about that.But all told, he was one of the two best employers I ever had.Most days went well as long as managers didn't invade the dish room if so I usually removed them unless they were there to help not fuss at others."
good,It tended to be stressful and at the time of my employment it was fairly understaffed. I did learn to be quicker on my feet when it came to customer service.
good,Fast pace but you'll enjoy your time working there. Once you get the training and get use to the menu there isn't much else to complain about. I would recommend this job to a friend.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,The managers could've been a bit more professional. The guest interaction was possibly the only motivation received in the building. It's pretty high volume from 9-3.
good,Sundays were our busiest shifts and my 1-5 lunch shifts were super slow max 10 people a hour until about 4:30. Best pay in the city I was working in so that's a plus.
good,It was pretty fun place to work. It had ups and downs but the company was pretty accommodating and understanding to my family needs. I worked in the retail store.
good,Tips only start to get good once you've been there a few years and get better sections. New hires get higher wages and management doesn't care. If you get bored with one position they can switch you to something new which is nice.
good,I work only one day a week here for extra money.  I greatly enjoy the customer service and talking with people from all waves of life.  I make great money here.
good,I enjoyed working there with a cool group of former employees and management. Some of the employees and managers felt like family there and I enjoyed the benefits there as well. The hardest part of the job was when the holidays come around during lunch hour.
good,If you are a hard working and like pleasing people this is the place for you. You can make money year round and they offer great benefits and other perks as well.
good,Atmosphere is nice. Most guests are nice. Some very rude. One female kitchen manager very rude to employees and the retail manager can be very belittling to employees. Turnover in retail store is high because of her.   Talks to employees like their children even the  older ones.  Only good thing is the discount and fun employees.
good,A typical day is busy starts with checking your section and getting food out quickly. Management at that time was a little rough. Enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers.
good,"Pretty easy job with lots of nice coworkers. Can get a bit stressful during sundays and when busses come in unexpected. Floor training wasn't great, have to figure a lot of stuff out on your own. Overall an ok first job."
good,"cracker barrel was a nice place to work.  sometimes, though, you could really tell who was there to work and who was just there to gossip or clown around and the rest of us would be picking up all the slack and it really would tick me off. and depending on the manager, certain ones turned a blind eye to the slackers.  It wasn't fair.  Oh, well such is life.  I also got tired of seeing so many coworkers corrupting health department codes via dress, hand cleanliness, proper plate, glass, silverware handling, etc., and nothing being pointed out."
good,"I enjoyed working at Cracker Barrel. Most employees and customers were very fun to work with. I enjoyed getting tips and being a server. The managers weren’t as understand though, but overall I loved the job."
good,"The management was poor and the outfits were a hassle, but the overall job was ok.  The harder you work, the more money you will make. If you are lazy, you probably won't make much money here."
good,During the season the pay and hours are high but on normal dayse you can barely get 2 shifts and you cant pay any bills with the pay. the comute was not tworth
good,Typical day included being yelled at by servers and grill cooks. Learned how to handle stressful situations better. Management was alright most times wouldn't help even if they saw that we needed help. Hardest part was dealing with the stress. Most enjoyable part was half off on the meals.
good,Fastest paced serving job you'll ever have... Weekends and holidays will never belong to you or your family again. They own those. Pretty flexible otherwise! Lol
good,Working at cracker barrel came to be a very intense experience. I had only been there a little over a year and I worked my way up from a dishwasher to cook.
good,Managers were nice and the older customers tipped well. Good place to work if you are just starting out but try to get educated. You get half off the food here when I worked there.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"I worked for CB back in college, it was great money for a college student with no bills, but once I had my son the money wasn't enough. Just like anywhere else management could be better."
good,You never stop moving. Sometimes a guest will be very rude and you will have to deal with it yourself. Managers aren't always a big help. Amount of money you make is solely up to you.
good,even though i never got to move up and always got the same review so that they wouldnt have to make me a 4 star server i loved the people i  served and worked with
good,Its not a company to stay with a longtime term and theres not enough hours for the business they run to many ppl not enough hours ....................
good,its a good place to work if you have more than one job or your in school. Because most people who work there are friendly and make work easier for you rather than throwing you in the water and expecting you to swim.
good,you can move up in the system if you are a hard worker. kind people as employers. builds communication skills. good nice enviroment. stays busy at all times.
good,Was a prep/grill cook for almost a year. I loved my job as well as my co workers. Managment was understanding and was always there to help or solve issues.
good,"It was a great place to work and everyone was always nice, but i was the youngest out of all the employees in the retail department (by A LOT) and it just wasn't a good fit for a first job."
good,if you are looking for a great career and you are single and able to relocate cracker barrel is a great place to work and advance.  for those that are married and have family it can be comsuming
good,I worked as a retail assoicate which is helping people with things they would like to buy and any questions they might have or get any item from the back room. I liked working with different kinds of people and helping them with what they wanted to buy.
good,"good job for someone in high school, not much of a career advantage in hosting. too many workers, not enough hours. managers don't listen about the scheduling about when someone can and can not work."
good,"You can make good money but there are quite a few more side jobs than most serving places. Discounts are amazing, management is strict and coworkers can be nice."
good,"typical day at work would involve taking customers orders, and making sure they were happy at all times, along with keeping my tables and the kitchen area clean."
good,"I work part time only, my manager is great, takes care of employees, and makes sure we know what we should be doing.  Meeting guest is the best part of the job."
good,Cracker Barrel provided good training with opportunities for advancement. They are very customer oriented and were a fun place to work for. They were good to the employees as well as the customers.
good,Cracker Barrel is a great place to work and I love being able to say that i am an employee. I gained great experience on how to communicate well with others.
good,At the locations I was dealing with  short staffed on the Management team missing 2 to 3 managers. A turnover of managers like I never saw before 24 manager in and out over the 12 month period.  Too many expectations put on the managers.
good,Sometimes doing the dishes would be stressful it would supposed be 3 people in the washing area but It would be jus me sometimes im the only person washing dishes in the restaurant and its gets stressful because the dishes build up very fast but all in all its was a good learning experience  and the staff and customers were nice
good,i enjoyed working at this job. i enjoyed the other employees that i worked with.i worked at this job for three and a half years. i also enjoyed the managers too.
good,This was a great first serving job. I learned so much about food and beverage and costumer service. As well as turning tables quickly. And working together as a team.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,It is an environment that takes a quick mind and patience with guests since most of them are of elderly age. Weekends as a hostess or even as a server can be overwhelming since there is almost always a wait. It is a great start for a first job though.The best part about it would be the friendly servers and managers that help you with what they can. You feel very welcomed in this job.
good,It's a very friendly environment to work in and I would suggest it to anyone who was open to working retail. Customers and coworkers were always really nice to work with and there was rarely ever any tension or drama.
good,My regulars were appreciative of my services. I liked that at times they did appreciative things for the employees.  The perks were good at times not at others.
good,I started working here during college and ended up being her longer than I thought I would. It's was a good starter job I learned a lot about people and working with the public. I loved working in the store they have lots of good product that comes in. Sometimes the hours we're rough and long but it's a job that's open everyday someone has to do it.
good,"Cracker Barrel is a good place to work for anyone looking for a challenging, high paced job. I enjoy working for the company  and my reasons for leaving are personal. I have made friends out of my coworkers and in this competitive environment that is important. Over all Cracker Barrel is one of my favorite jobs thus far in my working career."
good,"Greeting guests #1 importance, to ensure a pleasant store atmosphere. Interacting with guests coming into and shopping in the store. It was a lot of fun and satisfaction and fun helping guests find and items they would like to buy for themselves, and or other people."
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel was a great experience getting my feet wet, with so many different roles within the company. Everyday I would be working a different field reguarding: Grill cook, dishwasher/busser, night maintenance. It was a great experience working with Cracker Barrel, but every day I'd leave home exuhasted. I've learned that you'll do whatever it takes to make a living."
good,"Loved working for cracker barrel, and truly appreciated most corporate policies; except no wage pay for servers, minimal discounts, and miniscule room for pay raises."
good,"Absolutely love working for Cracker Barrel. Recent changes in schedule are enabling me to work more, would like to have dependable shifts or hours as well as health insurance options. Looking for consistent schedule and income, to later cover schooling and medical costs for my 2 year old and 4 year old."
good,Crackerbarrel was a nice slow paced work place to learn how to waitress. the management team was extremely kind and really spent the time to teach and make sure I was comfortable with the job before they set me on the floor on my own I would recommend to any first time waiter.
good,"I worked as a to-go server. This is an EXTREMELY fast paced environment. My co-workers were friendly and helpful. Management was easy to get along with and very willing to do whatever jobs were necessary, i.e.: cook, run food to tables, wash dishes, sweep and mop floors etc."
good,"It was an eventful experience working in the food industry. It was always busy, and attention to customer's orders were a must. I recommend this for a great starter job."
good,It is very fast paced at times. Its one big family and I love all of the managers and employees. As the seasons change so do the amount of customers. It is slow at times during the summer but during the winter it picks up.
good,"This company requires a lot from you-their expectations are high. But this will help you for future employment because your standards will already be sufficient, if not greater, than what is expected of you. It can be difficult at times, with crazy schedules and long hours, but most of the time it is rewarding. There are also great opportunities to cross train and learn multiple positions, which can get you more money and hours."
good,I enjoyed working there but the servers were rude and the managers didn't know how to put them in there place. But the managers were very kind and understood.
good,Good place to work if you have a second job. Otherwise not enough hrs to live on. And the management is very biased. Great first job work place.......
good,"All employees were so polite and treated everyone including customers like family. You were always welcomed with a smile when you walked through the doors, employee or customer."
good,"The work here is not easy, especially if you have trouble standing for several hours in a row.  However, the pace is generally pretty quick, and there are always extra hours to pick up.  The employees are nice, and so are most of the guests."
good,"I worked as a cashier at cracker barrel. It was a great experience, Great management. Very friendly atmosphere. Over all I would say it was a great job."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Cracker Barrel is a very structured, corporate environment.  They maintain a high quality standard of service and food to their guests. Cracker Barrel is a great place to learn how to mange all aspects of a restaurant."
good,I made really good money working at Cracker Barrel but I truly enjoyed it. It just didn't have the benefits I needed at the time with having a family.
good,"Dishwasher"
good,This was such an amazing job! The guests were almost always regulars and love to have a good time. It taught me how to interact with a different generation of people. I learned a lot of good practices and to respect. The staff were one big team and were so helpful. The training program was exceptional and made certain you were knowledgeable about your job description.
good,"I would wash dishes all day, I learned how to clean very well. The management team was ok but sometimes they would be rude, the workplace was very hot and very fast paced. The hardest part of the job was when the restaurant would be on a 2 hour or even longer of a wait, the most enjoyable part of the job was when it wasn't busy at all."
good,this place is cool and laid back you can make real quick and goo money the people are very homie and is a great home style environment with great food and guest
good,"I have learnd what great customer service is through the practices I began learning there. everyone is very nice and great to work with, as well as great food."
good,A great first job for a high school student. Accommodating to school schedules. Decent benefits with job included and management is very involved with staff.
good,"They always worked with my school and second jobs schedules. The atmosphere is very fast paced, but if you're willing to work hard then it's a great place to be."
good,It was a nice place to work and they have extensive training that they provide. However there is a lot to be done and there aren't any assistant managers to help.
good,When I began a Cracker Barrel some years ago. It was an amazing place mutual respect. The employee experience was held in high regards. Today it is a more mainstream corporate. They still try to hold on to the employee experience will never superceed the guest experience. But all point to bottom line.
good,"Nice summer job excellent work environment and people. Always busy, nice pay, great customers, employees and management. Consistent work and energy...."
good,"As an Assistant Manager some of my responsibilities include managing staff, quality assurance, financial records, inventory, ordering supplies, scheduling, cooking, cleaning, hiring staff, training and customer service. I learned that great communication usually turns into great results. It's a family friendly culture for staff and guests. The hardest part of the job is the rotating shifts which include opening, mid-day and closing. Also a typical work week is at least 55 hours. The most enjoyable part is providing quality food to wonderful guests, the fun staff, bonuses and knowing that this job supports my family."
good,I really enjoyed working here. The training was very helpful and the managers and other workers were always there if i needed help. i would strongly suggest this job to anyone.
good,"Good company to work for, easy job overall. Great work environment. Only bad thing is if you're a smoker you have to wait for your shift to be over. Once you're in the building you're not allowed to leave."
good,I enjoy the guests and retail store. Schedules are all over the place. Nothing is set. Different every week. No full time employment or benefits unless you are in management.
good,At cracker barrel I enjoyed talking with guest and having fun with my coworkers. The workplace was very nice and I was very good at what I did. I would read the specials and seat guest accordingly for each server. I also stayed very organized and maintained my workplace very neatly
good,"Great place to work, has the old time atmosphere.  We are not allowed to wear our hair down or wear nail polish.  The culture in the store is bringing back the better days."
good,Loved working here. Cracker Barrel has amazing hospitality. kids can play the peg games & checker games. The retail store is amazing too. Good place to work!
good,"Cracker Barrel is definitely a company focused on the bottom line and not their employees. I was forced to work while I was running a 103 degree fever and they had no concern for your outside life. Their slogan and is Shop, Eat, Relax, but really they want you in and out of there as quick as possible so they can make more money."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"It was a very good job. I always got to talk to new people, and always kept everything cleaned and maintained. The management was great, all very friendly and always helpful. Most of my Co-workers were great to work with. We had fun but worked at the same time."
good,"Cracker Barel was a very hands on job. I absolutely loved working there, they worked with me with anything that was needed. I enjoy communicating with the public so this job was really one of my favorites."
good,I enjoy the gift shop and the ever changing array of products. It's been a good experience for me to work there. I've been able to develop my skills as a cashier and feel comfortable meeting and talking to new people.
good,"great place to work, with great money making opportunities. i really enjoyed this company. this was a very fun atmosphere to work in and i made good money."
good,first when i go in i clock in then go to the dish room i go in and wash dishes after that do a trash run after that go back in make sure everything good and clean then i go home
good,Good for college students to make fast money and if their degree is in business then it'll be good for them to promote in the company.
good,Management is not consistent but I work hard and make decent money.  Trying to work my way up the ladder.  I love the people more than any other aspects of my job.
good,I learned you have to have patience and be confident. Social skills are a must. I enjoyed going to work everyday because my coworkers made my day. They made me laugh and enjoy working there.
good,This job has a lot of work that goes along with it. you will be moving from the time you get there until you leave. you will likely be leaving after your scheduled time.
good,This gave me an opportunity to work while going to college.  I enjoyed working with the public and meeting new people every day.  This was a reliable part time job
good,"It's nice working here. I have to be honest, working at my prior job, DQ, we didn't have a lot of strict rules like Cracker Barrel does, so it took some time to adjust. 80% customers ( we call them ""guests"") I encounter are really nice and understanding. However, the other 20% are just grumpy old people who believe younger people need to give them respect just because they're elders, which I do not believe in. It's 2017, if you want respect, you have to give respect, it isn't a one way street. There's people who take things way too seriously and want to get mad at me for our set prices on stuff. Basically I get yelled at for something I have no control over and it infuriates me. But, I just push through it. I do love how they balance my school time. Now, though, I don't get any hours. I worked 45 minutes this whole week."
good,"I spent the better part of three and a half years with the company, the menu was easy to memorize and my coworkers were great. The money was good as well, but I did not like my managers very much. They didn't seem to do a very good job keeping employees on task and assisting employees when needed."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was having the opportunity to interact with a diverse clientele base. I was often times able to turn a customer's day around.
good,Most days are easy to handle taking care of the needs of customers as they enter the retail side of the business.  Managers are not always easy to get a long with causing a bit of stress with the staff. Hours vary and causes problems with health issues at times.  Limited breaks if you get a break...We only get minimum wage for meetings and training even after we've been hired.
good,"Management typically willing to talk to employees"
good,"Great people both customers and workers. Fun place to work, always busy. Management is wonderful at working around my school schedule."
good,Great place to learn the fast paced environment and structure of a corporate restaurant.  Good upward mobility.  Average salary.
good,I love serving I'm really good at it I love meeting new people and being able to bring a smile to there face... It brings me joy myself
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,company really gives you the chance to grow in the company it's good at giving rises and making sure that you are getting hours and whatever you to grow
good,"Supervise the servers to ensure they were up to par with the service they were providing. Made sure that the servers were meeting the sales goals as well as meeting my own. Training newly hired employees. Ensuring all employees followed the main rule ""if you have time to lean, you have time to clean""."
good,"My family is really centered on time spent together. This is really easy to achieve when working at Cracker Barrel. I have never been denied time off as long as I have put in the request by the specified time. Unlike many places, as long as you give at least a week's notice, you are most likely to get the date approved."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of a lot of social interaction, which was great. There was also a lot of work behind the scenes, more than I knew about until I was in the thick of it. I learned how to manage many different things at once, how to sell, and how to make the most of my time."
good,A typical day at work was high stress but manageable. The management was understanding and friendly. I gain knowledge on server register systems and better to handle conflicts. The co-workers were very welcoming and helpful.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and interacting with people.
good,"Cracker Barrel is an amazing operation where the quality of the food in the restaurant and the variety of interesting items in the gift shop make it a worthwhile place to dine and shop.  I'm thoroughly impressed with the value you get for the money when dining there, so much more than most restaurant chains. And their retail merchandise includes unique clothing, mainly catered to women, with nostalgic items like old fashioned candy and toys that are hard to find anywhere else."
good,I learned customer service at this job. This was my first and only serving job and I did it throughout my college career. It was an okay job but I am trying to find a career and hopefully leave this place soon.
good,"Crackerbarrel is a great opportunity for those who love feeding people and making them happy."
good,"great leadership, great co-workers, always learning customer service, always learning retail practices, pleasant atmosphere"
good,All the servers and managers at the most part were very caring and fun to work with. We worked together as a team as should be and we got our jobs done.
good,I enjoyed my time at Cracker Barrel. my management team was very understanding and my co-workers made it enjoyable to work the hardest part about the job was balancing all of the guests. The most enjoyable part was hanging out with my co-workers when we weren't focused on our guests.
good,The people you surround yourself with at work are not only friendly but also caring. Each day is always fast pace but the environment that you are in makes the job easier.
good,"Learning experience, great people to work with, guests are great and great benefits. Must be dependable and willing to work very long hours"
good,"greet and serve guest"
good,Cracker Barrel's training system is superb.  It ensures employees that work for them have required knowledge of all aspects of their jobs.
good,"It's alright. Pretty good work place. "
good,"The management can be intimidating but they are very helpful. The tips you get can get good and some are not, but the faster you work the better. Getting the day off was easy but going home early is not."
good,"The team members really make this job great! Everyone loves to help out and be a team player! It is a very busy business however, and you need to be able to thrive under pressure."
good,"A typical day as a hostess at Cracker Barrel is face-paced, fun, and social. I learned to always try your best to support and aid the guests to anything that they may need. I learned to work well with my coworkers and the power of helping each other whenever possible. The hardest part of the job had to be explaining to persistant guests as to why we do not sit incomplete parties on busy days like Sunday, but the most enjoyable part was being able to develop relationships with ""regulars"" and my coworkers."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Fast- Paced Environment with room to move forward in the company. Friendly staff that will greet you with a smile.
good,"Good place to work. Solid night shift hours. A typical evening including sweeping and moping the store and dining room, cleaning the restrooms, emptying all trash cans."
good,"Good company to work for. They treat people like people, not a number. Long hours, not a lot of week ends off. hardly a weekend off."
good,"The routine and some customers are the same each day, but the pace changes through out the day. There's always an opportunity to learn more about people and the business."
good,"Enjoyed working in retail store at Cracker Barrel.  Loved the opportunity to become a leader, all though compensation for position was not to come."
good,"Need to promote with in more. Also business plan needs to be shared with employees. Managers are not always there to help, and most of the time they are under staffed."
good,"i loved my job here.your trained for everything , the people are easy to work with.even when its busy its overwelmingly fun all the time"
good,"Depending on the time of day you would choose to visit the Barrel, my coworkers and I would be found pleasantly assisting guests as they enjoy their meals, cleaning and a strong sense of team work can always be noticed. Though I have be a waitress for many years, Cracker Barrel gave me incredible training in executing dynamic multi-tasking skills, prioritizing, and problem resolution. There aren't many things that I as the face of the company can not pacify myself before going to management. Many days required vigorous physical activity and little or no time for breaks, even if I had worked an 8 hour shift, and many times more. It was also very difficult for me to leave my young son on holidays so that I could work. After all, I am single mother and have little family. As a server, working holidays is a must. A great staff and management and diverse guests were a daily joy at the Barrel. I am a people person and I love nothing more than making others feel satisfied and respected through professional and courteous service."
good,One of the busy resturants in the company ! It will carry 20 servers on any given night ! I must say high volume is an understatement ! Good learning for high volume end of resturants !
good,"A typical day at Cracker Barrel consisted of a positive attitude and a desire to work as a team. Working there taught me the necessity of team work and the benefits of a constructive mindset. The managers were teachers as well as managers and planned team meetings before each shift. the hardest part was dealing with rude guests, that however taught me how to keep self control and to stay positive no matter the circumstance."
good,I loved being a cashier here and working for both the restaurant and for the retail store. My co-workers were awesome and the managers were great. Always room to move up and earn a new star.
good,"Co-workers were very nice and had an overall great attitude. "
good,Worked for 15+ years and the company always kept it's promises.Culture was very work/ home life balanced at the time. When founder passed went from a family friendly environment to a large corporate business. Took away lots of family friendly events for employees. All about profit now at whatever cost to management.Co-workers at store level great. Middle management under to much pressure to show double digit gains and not enough about the employee experience.
good,"This place is only as good as the staff. When the staff is happy and knowledgeable, the place runs smoothly. Recent change in leadership should have a positive influence!"
good,"Can get busy and crazy, but co workers are very helpful and pay is nice. Provide benefits after so long of employment. Must have 4 stars and make a minimum amount of hours to receive though"
good,I mostly work night shifts and everyone that works there is so nice! management is great as well. im a server at the restaurant so the hardest part would be multi tasking with all of the tables. and i always enjoy going in to work with my co workers!
good,"I did enjoy working for Cracker Barrel, only once I became a service leader. You really don't get much respect unless you're in ""higher"" power. The service leader's responsibilities include taking over  management when they are on vacation, or out of town for conferences,taking conference calls, doing sales outcome, answering questions from coworkers, and much more. I liked being creative and making the displays ( I worked in the Old Country Store) . They're uptight in the way of all work and no play, no rewards hardly, no breaks (unless you were under 18). My manager was amazing (on the store side), the managers on the restaurant where snoopy and tried to get us in trouble, or tried to tell us how to do our jobs when they hardly even came over to our side. It's very split down the middle. The waitresses thought we were lazy because we had to stop what we were doing to so we can greet/assist the ""guests"", so every time they came over to our side they would see us doing ""nothing"", when indeed we were."
good,Cracker Barrel was my first restaraunt job.I learned so much and grew as person while working there. My management team was amazing always taking care of the guests and employee needs.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,While working at Cracker Barrel they start you off with less than 10 hours a week and then you work your way up to 25-35 hours a week. however being there over a year they did not fufill their promise and kept me down to 5 hours a week which cannot pay any bills what so ever.
good,"Being a server, you get the brunt of complaints, it's a tough atmosphere. I learned how to handle difficult guests and please guests on the spot. The most enjoyable part of the job was happy first time guests and the worst was rude, naggy, regulars."
good,"A good place to work, flexible schedules and regular customers. Learned what pleasing people was really about. Management staff is always coaching to stay on top. Most of the c0-workers are team players. There is no hard part of this job. The most enjoyable part of the job is when everyone works together as a team."
good,"Fast paced, never a dull moment, when faced with large shipments, constant reactions to sell through, and a high amount of foot, traffic.  This job was so rewarding as my store was the meeting and greeting place for all guests before they entered the restaurant.  A friendly face and pleasant conversation, which is what my staff and I consistently delivered, was in some cases, the only pleasantries these diners encountered all day.  Delivering visually appealing displays that I constructed, encouraged visitors to purchase food and decorative items to complete their dining experience."
good,i really enjoyed working here until the new store manager came. He over scheduled the staff so nobody could make money even on busy days. Put too much pressure on new servers.
good,A good place to start a job for those who have not had a job yet. Fun coworkers and a very well managers that work around keeping things organized and helping when in need. Great place to start gaining job experience.
good,"I got to meet a lot of unique people. Helped unload the truck with all of the merchandise, floor-sets, opening and closing procedures Collected payments for transactions."
good,"Cracker Barrel is a great place to come to eat if you're looking for a quick stop, or if you're looking to stay for a while. The store is always filled with tons of knickknacks, toys, candies and clothes. What's not to love about that? The dinning experience is great as well. The servers are always friendly and efficient. The food speaks for itself. (amazing)"
good,"A typical day at Cracker is very steady. We only go a rush during lunch time. Also we get a lot of business during the holiday seasons. I learned that great customer service starts with a smile and a positive attitude. I worked off tips and in order to make my money, I had to have a great personality, which was not hard for me because I always have an excellent personality. My managers were okay. You know every one has their bad days. My co-worker were great. I still keep in touch with some of them today. The hardest part of my job was learning how to set up my trays to carry the food, but after awhile I was a pro. I enjoyed my job there because I enjoyed serving people. I had great customers there, some were regulars and we always go along."
good,":My job was to be the best prep cook ,clean, bake ,cut , and prepare salads,"
good,"Cracker Barrel on a day in day out basis is a fast paced, intense, and demanding place to work. I have been a GM for 6 years and I can honestly say that I have improved on my ability to plan months in advance, detailed organizational skills, and coaching and developing on a much bigger scale than I have ever been exposed to in the past. The Management team and co-workers have been great, I have built some great working relationships over the last 6 years. The hardest part of the job without a doubt is the business demand on Holidays and big weekend sales. The amount of time spent at the store versus at home is off by quite a bit. I have enjoyed learning the skill set required and the discipline when it comes to ensuring 100% of the time we are hitting on all cylinders."
good,"Through this job you get to meet many different types of people. The day often depends on how busy it is and your willingness to work with people. The policies are often seen as strict in addition to the strict uniforms. While it can be overwhelming, it can also be very fun and you can make a lot of new friends."
good,I enjoyed my experience at this company......there was much room for advancement......coworkers were wonderful.....job was a lot of fun!!
good,"I did my internship for college at this place. My day began by getting the line set up and getting the prime ribs prep and in the oven for lunch. I learned how to work every station on the line from cold salad station to the saute stations. I also learn of to maintain and clean all equipment used in the kitchen and dish tank."
good,"	Cook breakfast lunch and dinner in a timely matter"
good,This is a fast paced job where being friendly is a must. People come back to eat there not only for the food but the atmosphere as well.
good,"I really enjoy working at Cracker Barrel Old Country Store. The food is great, many employees are great co-workers. The general manager is wonderful. The work environment is positive.  A typical day at work can be either slow or busy, it depends on the time, the day of the week, and what is the feature of the day. I have learned management skills, patience, and over all how to handle situations of all sorts. My customer service skills have become excellent while I am working here."
good,It was good. Co-works were good and so was management. Shift were flexible. Environment was up beat and fun. I learned good customer service techniques. Hardest part of the job was turning tables quick enough to get more customers.
good,"The Customers Are Great People To Serve, But The Management Is Slightly Poor. No Communication Among Management Team."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I enjoyed working at Cracker Barrel because you get to serve your customer and you can for the most part make sure that their meals were enjoyed. When y0u work at fast food places there are many people that are envolved in the order process. The co workers were all nice for the most part. I didn't make as much money in tips that I thought I would make working there though. The most enjoyable part of the job was just making sure that my customer was satisfied with their meal.
good,"The worst part about the job is the co-workers and bad scheduling hours. The best part is the pay can increase, the benefits are nice and the managers are friendly."
good,"Each day brought a new challenge and interesting people to meet. This was the best part, helping and meeting, pleasing people."
good,"There are improvements that need to be made in who is hired to work here. Currently there is too much slacking off that is tolerated, but overall it is a good company to work for."
good,"This company has a good system for promoting employees in house. After you have been hired and start orientation, you began as a Rising Star. Once you have completed your orientation, met the requirements and prove you have a thorough knowledge of this level you can be promoted to a Par1 with a raise. Each level that is completed warrants you a raise based upon your production and work ethics. These Par levels cap at Par4. "
good,Overall I think it's a competitive institution that will help you decide and pursue a career that you're interested in.
good,"Not an overall bad place too work at, just not something to try and make a career out of.  hours get changed a lot and shifts are changing so you have to check your schedule a couple times a day."
good,"Very well paying company that matches managers pay with their previous job.  Much money to be made by a manager, but the work was exhausting.  50-70 hours a week."
good,This is a very exciting job where no two days are the same.  There is constantly new themes being set bi-weekly. Management was easy to work with and customers were fantastic.
good,"I would do the same thing everyday, my job was to take guests orders and make sure they were satisfied with their meal and service by having a positive attitude. I learned to use the register to ring in orders and how to read and interpret them. I learned how to provide customer service. The management was not always the best. my coworkers were always very helpful. what I most enjoyed was meeting new people both coworkers and guests."
good,focuses on guest experience and 5 star service.  I have been with the company for 7 years. It is a decent place to work and offers good benefits.
good,"very flexible schedule"
good,It is a good place to work at.  There is room for advancement and cross training if they like you enough.  I have tried to cross train for 2 years but the retail manager wont let me because I didnt cry when she yelled at me for something I didnt do.
good,"I closed the restaurant down three days a week. I was in charge of making sure everything was organized and cleaned so that the store would be ready for the following morning. "
good,"I bring the buss tubs in the dishroom, empty them, and place everything in they correct places. set  up the dish machine and fill up my grill line wit dishes. i check the parking lots and trash every hour on the hour. plus when the dishroom is clean and slow i go out and help the servers wit they buss tubes."
good,Cracker Barrel was my first job. I was a hostess and I helped to promote retail items in our Country Store. I loved the atmosphere and the general feeling of being there.
good,I learned team work and to communicate with your employees. Everyone was always nice and always helped me whenever I needed help. The managers were very great at managing. They always made sure our customers were satisfied and happy with the service we provided. I always enjoyed seeing customers happy. I carried a smile upon my face no matter what. I love serving.
good,"I am a very service oriented person. I enjoy interacting with the people who come into the restaurant. "
good,I enjoyed working for a place where there were many opportunities to grow and learn new positions. I met many new and interesting people.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Cracker Barrel.  For the most part, I worked retail and cash. I stocked the retail store room, created displays, took money, balanced the drawer, etc. I also served on occasion."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I love working for Cracker Barrel! The management team is wonderful and I have learned so much working for a store with so many combined years of experience! The only downside to my position was that I was not advancing as quickly as I would have liked!
good,Obviously this is not my dream job but the company definitely gets enough business to pay the bills. All managers handle work with care and precision. They do not tolerate B.S. and have a very honest belief about work. You should either be working or you should be at home.
good,"My time at work was decent. A typical day at work consisted of waiting on tables, interacting with the guests and providing them excellent service. I learned how to manage my time while being a waitress, and how to multi-task in a fast paced environment. The management there wasn't what I would expect from a business that demands us to be on our toes all the time. The management lacked the ability to communicate with each other and resulted in shifts that were stressful, which was the hardest part of my job. Try to figure out what manager wanted what and who I'm supposed to speak to about an issue. The most enjoyable part was being involved with my co-workers and meeting people from all over that would come in to eat."
good,"Ok job if you can stand working in a restaraunt"
good,"A typical day of work would involve pleasing every customer who walked in the store by making sure they had the best possible experience, so that they would come back at another time. "
good,"A typical day of work began with setup of materials needed to perform your daily job duties, followed by an employee meeting to ensure policies, regulations, goals, and moral. The shift would begin slow then business volume would escalate. It was a very fast paced environment while being customer friendly and attentive to many different details. The shift then wound down with an overview of the days goals and improvements or problems and solutions. Set-up for the following shift was finished along with various other tasks such as, money/sales, reports, side-work, etc. While it can be a fast paced and strenuous environment, the most enjoyable and rewarding part of the day is seeing a happy customer with family and friends, and knowing you did something to make their day easier or better in some way."
good,"Typical day, I would get my drawer and go up to the cash register and just begin the day. I would have a target item to sell everyday. The management was ok, nothing too great. Everyone had a friendly personality and it was enjoyable."
good,I enjoyed working there.  cooked all the long cook items for the kitchen.  got to work alone and really enjoyed cooking.
good,"work with a wide variety and diverse set of people."
good,"Processing payment "
good,Cracker Barrel as a corporation has a very good thing going. It's the only restaurant I've ever heard of that gives raises with in set amounts of time to all positions. Servers are normally exempt from things like that because tip money is factored in. Cracker Barrel does not discriminate. Paid vacation is also offered with or with out the time off. They allow you the option of getting your vacation pay even if you never take the time off.
good,A typical day at work is usually fast paced. Our motto is urgency with a purpose. Being a server I've learned to have patients with all ages and personalities. My co-worker are my work family and we get along great. Serving requires a lot of team work. The hardest part about serving is that the customer is always right. The most enjoyable part of my job is the relationships and bonds that you develop with your customers.
good,"Cracker Barrel is about pleasing people, from the guests to the staff."
good,"Workplace culture was positive, overall.  The restaurant itself was clean and appealing.  Well ran by management."
good,"My day consisted of urgently helping guests as well as employees and managers. I learned how to multi-task different jobs of the  company, how to deal with customer service including relations, cashier, manage time, focus, and keep kitchen properly maintained.my co-workers were like family everyone helped and received help as well.The hardest part of the job was maintaining your cool when it was busy and I learned quickly how to deal with under pressure and maintain self. The most enjoyable part of the job was the team work and dedication."
good,"Friendly enviorment"
good,There were quality trainers at this job and friendly managers.
good,Everyone did their part and was very reliable. Everyday was full of learning tasks and fun. We made the most of our selling experience. We loved our customers and getting to know them.
good,"management talks down to employees, and will always point out the negatives, and never compliment you on the good work you have done."
good,Read orders off printed receipts and put the order together. Get all sides prepared on platter and wait for main dish to be ready for platter and put up in window.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Just loved the people I worked with as a whole and the customers I served daily. If I needed help it was always there!
good,"A typical day at Cracker Barrel starts with greeting guests as soon as you enter the building. In the back of the house, its straight to answering phone calls and starting new orders. I learned how to multitask, be a team player as well as an individual. I learned how to take charge of situations and be a leader. I learned how to quickly resolve any matter of concern. My management team, as well as my fellow coworkers looked to my for guidance and leadership. The hardest part of the job was sometimes having to carry my entire team because of occasional slackers. The best part of my job was being able to meet and put smiles on so many faces on a daily basis."
good,This was my first grill cook job and I was ok with it if you can handle fast paced and hot environment and take orders this is the place for.
good,Usually at work we start our day off by checking the work list which shows you all your duties for that day and requirements that should be met by the end of your staff. Sometimes I had to work in the dish section which may be the hardest but easy when prepared. I never had a day where is was hard so i was pretty much prepared and ready at all times.
good,I enjoyed working with my team member's. The customers that come into Cracker Barrel are friendly are make you feel comfortable.  The managers listen to you and are always encouraging you to ask questions when needed.

good,This job gave me wonderful experience working with a plethora of personalities. It gave me the opportunity to be myself and apply my people skills in everyday situations.
good,"A typical work day included greeting guest, cleaning, organizing, and smilimg a lot. I learned how to work with many different typres of people. It was a great place to continue building my customer service experience. Workering in a restaurant is very trying, but overall co-workers and management were very supportive. "
good,"Really depended on the day"
good,"Loved this position!  Typical day would start with checking your designated section and/or who's working each section. It all depended on what role I was in that day."
good,It is very slow-paced environment except on weekends. It was a good job just very slow.

good,"I love Cracker Barrel from the food to the guests and the employees, all the way up to most of the managers. There is not too many things I can complain about. A typical day at work is very fast paced and interactive. You really have to love what you do in order to have a job like this. Cracker Barrel taught me how to be a team player and to always stay on top of what ever I'm try to achieve. My managers from Washington Pa were the best authority figures to report to. They cared, listen, diciplined, but no matter what they were always fair. My managers in Conyers Ga are no personal and are hard to talk to but I love the company so much I'm willing to overlook one flaw. I love all my co-workers though. All of them. The hardest part of my job  is conflict, but very rarely will you have any if you do your job right. Sometimes there's no stopping it but it comes with the job. The most enjoyable part of my job is all the different people I met and put a smile on there faces. That's what puts me to sleep at night."
good,"Its nice when you work somewhere, and you still want to go eat there. It was a very clean, nice place, with good food. I enjoyed my co-workers, and there was never a dull moment. I learned how to handle cash in a super fast paced environment, and also retail relations."

good,"I loved my job at Cracker Barrel, although the money wasn't great, I was forced to move on"
good,A typical day at work could be busy and have chance to meet new people. I have learned to network with people. Management are very passionate about the company and they will help you to help the company be productive. My co-workers believe working as a team. The hardest part of my job is nothing. the most enjoyable part of my job is engaging with the guest.
good,Cracker Barrel is a well organized restaurant with flexible scheduling and friendly employees. My typical day starts with a smile and ends with one its a great place to be.

good,Cracker Barrel has a better system to train their new employees than any other business I have worked. They have tons of policies and unlike other restaurants they actually enforce them and the business operates efficiently. Management is good but sometimes too involved.
good,Cracker Barrel is a great place to work at.  The managers were great and helpful and the training as a new employee was super helpful.
good,Cracker Barrel is a good company to work for. If you like interacting with people and are a people person this is the job for you. The management staff is ok and the job is fairly easy. I would not say that there is a hard part to doing this job because every aspect of this job can be made fun if you know how to use your people skills.

good,love working there hr not to great the people there where wonderful a good place to work if you need a partime job
good,"When I first started I thought it was great how well organized their system is. It's extremely impressive how much control they maintain over the hundreds of stores they have; clearly they're doing something right. I liked the job for a long time until management kept running off other employees causing the hard workers to work even harder. At times I miss it, but I'd never go back."
good,"Fellow employees and managers are fun to work with, Everyone is eager to help if you need it."
good,"A typical day of work involved serving guest, selling of new/promotional products, training any new hires."

good,supervising 25-30 member staff during each shift ensuring quality food and service. learned a lot about retail industry as far as pricing and merchandising is concerned. very good management and staff team. hardest part was getting to work at 5am. the most enjoyable part was participating in the retail management and meeting all kind of guests due to proximity to international Airport.
good,I have independently in my position to achieved daily sales goal in food production.
good,"A usual day at work is pertty simple,I get along with everyone from the young to the older employees.The management are all new also because the store is new but it seems to be flowing together quit well. Some evenings it gets a little hecktic but staying organized keeps it running smooth,and you may have to be moving steady for 2 to 21/2 hours but its not bad. I like meeting new people and Ienjoy the good complements I get from guests and co-workers on my work.I have learned that Cracker Barrel is a very well planned out organization and they do there best to maintain it,"
good,was always extremely busy. was fun and great place for a cook to thrive in
good,This was a good job but my position was on seasonal. a typical day involved helping customers find best suited items and welcoming them into store and restaurant with an invitation to shop. I learned to be a great team player and how to better assist customers. Management could use a little improvement on involvement and motivation tatics. The hardest part of my job was dealing with the manager. Most enjoyable part was answering calls and helping customers. Also meeting people traveling from all over.
good,Its a great enviornment and a great place with team work
good,It is hard work thats non stop. Management is good and for me it's the best part. Co-workers ok.
good,My job is pretty pleasant. I get to socialize with my customers and learn about a daily restaurant operation.
good,Greeted customers in a timely fashion while quickly determining their needs.
good,It was good work for what it was. The only bad thing about it was that everybody didn't appreciate nor gave the recognition for what I and the rest of the dishwashers did for the restaurant. And even half of the dishwashers didn't even care to do their job when it's most needed to run the dish room effectively.
good,Very family and country styled restaurant. Can be very busy but it just didn't bring in huge tips.
good,"It was a lovely place to work, tjhe customer load was very heavy. I learned to tract a mac card that recorded all the yearly sales.The co-workers were friendly."

good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Very hectic and highly stressful at times. You do not get to leave at your scheduled time off, after you're done waiting tables, you have at least an hour of side work. You also have to roll 100 silverware sets, and you have to continue to run food, even though you are not getting any tips."
good,"In a typical day at Cracker Barrel's Store 17, it was fairly busy with very little down time. I learned a mostly how to be fast and efficient while trying to keep the guests happy while I was a busser there, and as a dishwasher you didn't really learn much expect how to take care of the machines. The management are generally good people but they do tend to ignore the needs of their employees, while focusing on themselves and guests. I had many good co-workers there that I am glad I became friends with and they were probably the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part of the job would be the fact that you work as hard as you possibly can and be good at your job and still be disregarded and looked down on, however physically the hardest part would have to be doing trash runs or busing."
good,"Greet every guest, give great guest service, restock the floor"
good,"Good job for the most part, pay isn't bad the only downside is they have horrible organization among the workplace. Communications between employees and between managers and employees has a lot of room for improvement. Workplace is generally clean and has sensible practices just needs a good manager in charge to really organize our benefits."
good,It was like working with a big extended family. You fought sometimes but mostly just tried to help each other out with work and personal problems. I loved working there. I used to be somewhat shy around new people but quickly overcame that. I learned to deal with all kinds of situations with customers without becoming overwhelmed or stressed. The managers were great. They talked to you like you were a friend but still acted the part of the boss.
good,As you know Cracker Barrel stores are always right off the interstate so we would get a lot of traveler's come in to eat. I was the cashier so I met just about everybody that walked through those doors. I was a very polite person that they as they entered and exited the restaurant.
good,worked as a cashier as well as in retail. cashier was a lot more enjoyable than retail
good,"Working retail at Cracker Barrel is exciting, fun and sometimes exhausting. You meeting lots of interesting people whether it be locals that visit daily or tourists that just stop by because of Cracker Barrel's reputation for affordable, good food in a warm, welcoming atmosphere. Holiday seasons are the hardest, most exhausting part of working retail at Cracker Barrel. Meeting the guests needs can being very trying but rewarding."
good,"Well-staffed, great customers, majority of managers were very personable, and worked well with my school schedule."
good,"Work in a great environment where I show guests all the great new gift ideas, and how to make the most of the gift, or add to a piece of apparel to make it an outfit they'll love. Teach others to interact with the guests in a like manner that fits their own personality, coach them in the moment to enhance the experience, and to bring along others to reach their potential. Creating and adjusting a schedule based on the needs of the business. Creating an environment in the store that draws the eye, including setting displays, enhancing, and stocking. Teaching employees to understand and use our ""metrics"" system to gauge how their sales are doing, and by reading it, how to improve the sales technique."
good,getting underpaid for the duties i was responcible for doing

good,"Cracker Barrel is a great job to work for if looking for a fast-paced environment. There is always something to do or food to handle while on shift. Typically Sundays are the busiest and the most challenged days to work. Can be a difficult job at times but overall a great place to learn about serving, especially if never done before."
good,"As a cashier I ask people how thier meal and service was, and try to make small talk if we are not too busy. Like asking them if they have any plans for the day or the weekend. If we are busy it is harder to make conversation with the guest."
good,"A typical day at work was great, I learned a lot about the southern hospitality and how it is very important to the customers. I loved all of my managers, up until the point where they hired a new manager, I had a difficult time working with this manager in particular. My co-workers were fantastic, always filled with energy."
good,A typical day at work included entering the work enviroment and maintaining the appearance of the store as well as the cleanliness. I also assisted customers with retail purchases and handled cash transactions. I learned to effectively manage my time in order to enable me to complete multiple tasks in one work shift. I worked with wonderful people who all shared the same goals with me. The hardest part of my job was the long hours I sometimes worked in a day but my managers were extremely flexible so it was not a substantial problem. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to make customers experiences great everyday.

good,"This job was one I should have stayed at. There were rules, but mostly all jobs have them. It was a strict place but it wasn't a hard labor job."
good,"Each day is different at Cracker Barrel. Generally a day for a Retail Manager consist of checking voice mail and emails at arrival. Then the manager would walk the sales floor to check for accuracy, prepare for peak period traffic, set expectations for the days sales opportunity, coach and lead team to productivity. Complete necessary paperwork, have any necessary one-on-one conversations with employees. Set the team up for a good close. There are several managers in the building (restaurant) and this is where communication between retail and restaurant are important. The most difficult part of the job would be managing the work load with the uncertainty of traffic and being able to meet sales goals as well as completing other essential tasks set forth. The best part would be the people that come in each day."
good,Ive enjoyed working there but its time for a change in my life because its not enough to meet all my needs.
good,I really enjoyed working here. I felt as though my time was valued and that I was quickly made into a team member. I loved going to work!

And I have learned a lot since starting at the barrel.ive made life long friends that I will cherish from now own. I think we have one of the best management teams in the district.i love my cracker barrel family."
good,"I truly enjoyed working under their management but the hours was not meeting my needs to support my household, especially my grandkids. I am sorry but I do not have much more to explain on my experience at Cracker Barrel Old Country Store in Hewitt,Texas(Waco,Texas)."
good,This was my very first job and I stayed with it for a long while because it was just so fun. I made many friends with others employees and withany of the customers.
good,In my opinion if you want a job that will give you a chance to advance in your career go with Cracker Barrel the work environment was fun and inviting
good,I think Cracker Barrel is a great place to start out as a server. It will teach someone how to multi-task in a fast-paced environment while retaining quality service.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I enjoyed the environment for the most part. However it is sometimes hard to work with people who cause drama. Overall it is a good job and if you are looking for a place to work part time I would recommend it.
good,Servers have to seat their own tables at some times. Bussers were really only on during the weekend. Tips were great and guests were extremely kind. Staff is very helpful.
good,"Always had something to do. Learned more about customer service. Management was good, took care of any issues. The hardest part of the job would be some of the stress that comes with hosting."
good,"Very good place to start working while in high school, or just starting college. Fairly easy day-to-day tasks. Discounts on merchandise and food can help, particularly employee meals during shifts."
good,I learned so many new things working at Cracker Barrel. My manager worked with me and trained me how to set up floor plans. I eventually asked to be put on truck and have been working on truck every Wednesday 6am-12. I really love my job and I can’t wait to work at Bed Bath and Beyond if hired.
good,"Cracker Barrel was a great first job, learned quickly on what i needed to do as a to-go server. Managers were great and reasonable, always made me feel right at home."
good,Cracker Barrel can be a great company to work for. The place Is always packed if you're at good location. The only thing that stinks is how cheap the food is! Hard to make it rich off an average bill of $25.00 for two people.
good,This job is not ideal for a former professional woman.  It can be demeaning at times if you don’t keep a fast pace and try to sell to customers on the floor to meet goals on store promos.
good,"They have very flexible schedules and it is generaly easy to switch and get shifts covered. More work is expected like individually exposing your trays, rolling silverware and bussing your tables but you don't have to tip anyone out."
good,"Cracker barrel is definitely the place to work for young people. They're super flexible with your schedule, tips are always about the same and that's a given, guests are polite overall, and management is fair."
good,"Always busy and Willing to work with your schedule, always getting new and exciting people, here's where people gain some work experience, and multitasking"
good,"When I came in for my orientation, every server, cook, and dishwasher in the kitchen greeted me and they were all so kind and welcoming. That never changed throughout the several months I worked there. The people I worked with at Cracker Barrel were some of the greatest people I have ever met. The customers are also pretty great, of course there are a few exceptions but that's anywhere. The majority of guests that come in are regulars and it's really nice getting to know them and forming those relationships. I loved working at Cracker Barrel because of the hospitable environment."
good,Cracker Barrel is a great place to work part-time. Most of the Servers I worked with were part-time workers and many had other jobs. They only want to pay benefits to few key employees.
good,"It’s a great place to work but you have to very fast on your feet and learn very quick how to do things, you have to learn the menu fast so you know how to do your job, it does get stressful during the rush hours but there always someone there for you to claim yourself down and everyone mostly got along with each other, very good money if you know what your doing and if your focus"
good,"If you enjoy working in a fast paced environment it is a great place to work. If you are looking to advance with the company it would be a good idea to be close with the general manager, they hold the key to your future. You can always expect to work past your scheduled time and to be called on your time off. If you don't work hard you will not be scheduled."
good,"It was a great job experience the workers we great people, i learned to host and run the computers for seating guests. They have great positions and encourage cross training."
good,"A basic day was lift heavy bus-tubs, prepare cleaning racks and pass it through an industrial size dishwashing conveyor or pre-washing hotel pans with baked on food. Learned some interesting things about the back of house operations in a restaurant. Management was a bit distant when busy but understanding of my need to balance multiple part time jobs with irregular hours."
good,My overall experience at Cracker Barrel was decent! I worked retail so I was never inside the actual restaurant. The retail area has to be set up in a specific way which provided me with the skills to properly manage the layout.
good,Working at Cracker Barrel they treat you like family . The management can struggle at times and it can be hard at times . For the most everyone is respectful.
good,Liked coworkers and some managers. Stays busy and is very fast paced. They have very good country home cooking and a retail store with some unique items
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Great flexibility for a part-time job. I love my team. I work with some of the best people ever. I also work with some of the worst - but I tend to focus on the good ones! One of the best retail jobs I have ever had. I feel valued by management, and by my teammates as well. And eve on the bad days, I am able to laugh about it at some point!"
good,Customers are always polite. The job is fairly easy and you also get commission for your own set item to sell for the day. There is room for advancement.
good,"The restaurant is packed during breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Any worker there will always have something to do and there is little downtime just during the first few hours of opening and the last few hours before closing. Workers are busy at all times but also friendly and helpful."
good,It is a great place to work but it seems that after you are there awhile they find way to get rid of you . They don't appreciate the employees that have been there for long term
good,"Consistently busy, days would get slow and servers would get sent home. No matter how much extra work you may do and put it, you are forever paid the same with now recognition."
good,Overall the job was pretty good. I just have to leave because I didn't get enough hours. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the pace of the restaurant
good,"The days were slow until a rush. Customers are a pain, Management varied store to store, it's usually a very accepting place. I loved the nice customers and how polite they were as well as the relationship between the servers and the hostess's."
good,If you want to count beans and do inventory three times a day this is the place for you they are military for sure if you want to grow people maybe not the right spot
good,Fast and fun work enviroment. Flexiable. Well managed and staffed. Great food. Diverse. Managers show they care about you and what you have going on outside of work.
good,"Although I was not provided with an adequate wage, I enjoyed working at Cracker Barrel due to the coworkers, management, and frequently changing retail products."
good,"enjoyed my part time work there and would recommend it to others, people were nice and I especially enjoyed interfacing with the walk in customers and showing them the sales and feeling that I was helping them and the company."
good,"I liked it, I wasn't stressful all the time but it wasn't relaxed all the time. So it wasn't boring but it wasn't to much to handle. The managers were really nice and understanding. I just wish the uniform poilicy would change some, because it's hard to find the shirts in those specific colors in curtain times of the year and it's also hard to find them for want and they are expensive."
good,Managers are really easy going as long as you stay on task work does get fast paced at times as long as you try to work and show up its impossible to get fired.
good,They were a very good job to start serving at. I came in knowing that it was temporary but I did get attached to the employees of the company. Overall it was a very okay place to work.
good,The customers in the people I work with with find the management needed some more training as far as it goes disciplining her employees in front of customers. They had good discounts and the food there was excellent and the customers were excellent
good,Very busy all the time. Work gets slow after Restaurant gets ready to close. You gotta be very quick on keeping up with the dishes. And restock the clean dishes very quick for the line cooks. They work with my schedule times. I had two jobs.
good,Honestly when infirst started working there it was great. But then we lost our manager and the manager that was filling in from another store completely had it out for me. If it wasnt for her i would probably still be working there.
good,"I would recommend Cracker Barrel as a first job to anyone new to the job market. They treat their employees well and have formed a pleasant work environment. However, the process of changing managers puts undue strain on the employees and their schedules. This normalizes after the managers settle into their new role."
good,"people quit there jobs here so often that you are guaranteed 40 hrs a week, problems are that scheduling doesn't get fixed after someone quits, so one some days you will have no help"
good,Cracker Barrel is a good job to have because it opens plenty of opportunities. You receive experience all the while being in a people friendly environment.
good,"very easy job, loved serving customers and making them happy, there was never a hard part of this job was very simple as long as the customers stayed happy and drinks never became empty. location of store wasn't the greatest so tips and such were not the best."
good,Cracker Barrel is an okay job. But when it is a busy day it gets so very hectic. Employees and managers get stressed out with each other. Our guests lose their patience due to long waits.
good,"Productive at reaching sales goals; however, they don't give enough hours especially if you're younger than 18."
good,It is a decent job but I don't have enough hours. Very good pay. get paid weekly and there are opportunities of advancement. Overall it is a good job.
good,"It's a great place to learn retail merchandising and selling skills. You can also pick up some great tips on gift wrapping."
good,I worked with great people who made it fun and made the day go by car-free. I only quit because I was about to have a baby and wasn't making enough money to support my growing family
good,Cracker Barrel is a very friendly and family oriented environment. I met a lot of people that I am still friends with today. I would recommend everyone to give cracker barrel a try throughout their college experience. Even though I had some rude customers I never let that get me down and out because the work environment was so uplifting.
good,"Cracker Barrel is a great place to serve at for the most part. There is a lot of money to be made however, this staff can be difficult at times. I have known people who have gotten their tips stolen and when it comes to rolling silverware, it is a very competitive environment. Aside from that, the job is easy and it’s easy to advance in."
good,Made several long lasting friendships through this job. Management was not always willing to accommodate and had there favorites out of the bunch. It was a little biased based on who was working.
good,I had some good time working for this company and some bad it is a fast going job ticket times is no joke a lot of cool people to meet and amazing store
good,"I loved my job, but management had become an issue. Not only that, but it had become very hard to make money with the way they were scheduling everyone. The dining room is only so big, and they’d scheduled way too many people, which meant each server would be lucky if they had three tables on a Saturday. It was very annoying, so if you choose to work here, keep in mind that the management sucks, and you should only work weekdays."
good,"Overall, the job is pretty good and stable. It's just, occasionally, you don't have a very good experience, but the management is too nice so even though they agree with you they won't do anything about it. On the other hand, they will always be there for you if you need something to eat, or if you need a break."
good,"Sadly, the management is almost always worrying about themselves and their bonuses. By almost always, I mean one out of every ten managers is not like that. That one manager is in the window, on the floor, cleaning, running, helping when the worker-bees are running like headless-chickens. This job will test your limits. Management will cut servers to make more money because that boosts their EOY bonuses.. but once in a while there is a manager who rolls up their sleeves and dives in with you. Either way, the servers, bus staff, hosts, etc. all lean on each other and work great together. They are the reason to keep working. That is why so many people do continue to work there."
good,Cracker Barrel is a great place to work at if you want to be a well respected waiter or waitress. It is a very fast paced work environment and you make every reasonable money working here.
good,unfortantly they have made offers in the past of promotion opportunities but then change their mind and act like they never offered it to you. prevents you from moving forward.
good,No food service job is for those that are lazy. To make the environment function at optimal levels teamwork is absolutely necessary. All employees must work together and at the same level. One person not pulling their own weight can cause the balance to shift which will severely affect production. Every position in the food industry is tied to one another a lack of work ethic or shortage of help will hurt customer service and company profit.
good,"For a college student, this was the perfect job. You are able to work 2-3 days per week and make enough to cover basic costs of living such as rent and food. Its not a  long term career for most, but I made a lot of friends and most of the management was good."
good,It's a great serving job because your job is secure there. It's very corporate in how they run things though. The management can make or break the experience at the restaurant.
good,"Cracker Barrels of fast-paced job. You work holidays you don't get paid time and a half when working those holidays."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Cracker Barrel help lay the groundwork for my professional life. It was a good company to work for. I found it to be a consistent company most of my 20+years but can not say that for last several years.
good,"If you can pretend to be a goody-two-shoes, follow rules, and smile in the face of hangry people, you can make enough money to get by. Server paychecks almost entirely go to Uncle Sam, you basically only get paid in tips. Every manager is entirely different- some are angels who make your life easier, some make it a chaos, but this is true everywhere. They won't tell you about all the extra sidework and silverware rolling when you get hired, but just be prepared to clean everything- they do NOT play around if things are dirty or even spotted. Regulars will make your day great, because they like to order the exact same thing every time and you can basically type in their order when they walk in the door and guarantee yourself a decent tip. It is made-to-order food at a fast food pace. Just because they have to wait 10 minutes for breakfast or dinner does not mean you get to wait with them however, because there is always something to keep you busy. My favorite part of the job was cleaning up before closing, because that's when everyone could talk and laugh at the end of the shift, no matter how it went, and it was relieving to talk to others who you shared the dinner struggle with. Coworkers were normally great, there's enough staff to swap shifts with if life happened and you couldn't make it to work, and if you work enough hours it can pay a few bills."
good,Great place to work for if you want something to supplement other income. Lots of different aspects to the workplace with different shifts and different workers.
good,"The Management team is one of the best they are willing to work with the Staff on scheduling around their needs. Hours and pay though are low and you are policed at all times. Best thing about this place is the Management and flexible schedule. The down side is you are policed every moment and there are some huge egos among the employees which can make a shift difficult. Best advice, trust no one, do your job, take care of the guest and you'll do just fine."
good,"I come and help out wherever I'm needed.  Afterwards I go find my station and get started. The day usually goes by petty quick if you keep busy, "
good,I began woring there as a minor. I was 17 years old. and I worked my way up from being a bus boy to a server in a span of a few months. I got along with everyone and the majority of customers were nice.
good,"Good. The foundation of the company is good. Work life balance is not good, no paid holidays. The idea of food and a gift shop are great, people are always going to travel."
good,Great work environment Co-workers and managers are great to work with very helpful can be fast pasted as well as slow at times and if lost someone will always help out if needed
good,If you enjoy fast paced / multi tasking then you will do fine. Must have good customer service. It is rare you gets breaks. You must be able to stand for at least 6 hours at a time.
good,It just isn't giving me enough hours or pay to support my family.  I need a job that's full time and benefits that I can afford. I need more pay per hour also. I enjoy my job there it's just hard to make a living not getting 40 he's and better pay and benefits.
good,Cracker Barrel was fun and i enjoyed my time with them.  I loved the people working their/ great managers.  I say it's an easy job but things can get crazy but i love it when things get crazy makes the time fly!  The problems i had with them was i did not like working the middle of the day because no one comes in!  And just had schedule difficulties for me.  But other than that i really enjoyed my time with Cracker Barrel.
good,Nice Company To Work For If You Are Someone Entering The Work Lifestyle. Management At The Time Was Not So Bad. Work/Life Balance Could Have Been Better.
good,"Good for job for young adults trying to get into customer servce career, provides well training, and  gives employees goals to strive for and improve."
good,"The actual job of cooking is enjoyable and fun, as well as fast paced. the employees are enjoyable to work with , and the atmosphere is outstanding. Management displayed more interest in the bottom line, rather than customer service and food quality. This is not representative of the entire company, on;y the location I had experience with."
good,"Management has been excellent, working with managers that actually care and cater to our and the customers needs. They allow us to work at own pace to fit customers needs"
good,A wonderful company to work for.   Hard work with this company brings rewards; very pro-active to anyone wishing to cross train in all areas.  Management expects all employees to work hard but they are extremely fair and work with employees when time off requests arise.
good,its a nice place to work for a second job but not for your main source of income its a very busy place . but as a  server you will not make much money as there as anywhere from 10 to 16 servers on the floor at ant given time
good,Cracker Barrel offered an enjoyable work experience. There is a strong staff with excellent trainers that ensure the professional development of the employees.
good,"In a typical day I greet guests, take them to their tables after scripting them our promos, help out with cleaning and maintaining the dining room, and carrying out tasks given to me by managers and guests."
good,"Personally, I enjoyed working there. I worked at 4 different locations and liked them all except for the last one. It was poorly managed and not really any room for advancement."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,It is a good family place and good food benefits are not the best but the pay is good. you can make good tips. especially on a weekend. very clean well ran restaurant.
good,I didn't mind being a hostess. The food business is just not where I want to be. I would recommend to someone attending any type of school or someone looking to be a waiter/waitress. The pay was good.
good,"I enjoyed it, customers were always smiling, team memebers helped when they could , and managers were pretty laid back. If it wasn’t for the border of team members and managers being blurred i would’ve stayed way longer."
good,"You come in and you have to clean your area from the previous shift or the servers/managers coming in and making messes. "
good,"A typical day at Cracker Barrel always start out being pretty smooth. Then when we get so many guests, it can turn into a stressful work environment. Sometimes depending on the other coworkers and managers attitudes will result on how stressful the shift can be. I have not really learned much from working at Cracker Barrel. However, I always strive to do better today than I did on yesterday. There is nothing hard about my job at Cracker Barrel and I am always open to learning new things."
good,"Being a dishwasher comes with lots of responsibilities, but you have to deal with the servers stacking the bus car and cooks making a mess with pots in the sink."
good,A busy relaxed atmosphere. Love the fireplace in the winter. Steady clientele and enjoyed the discount in the store. I enjoyed working there and made decent money.
good,"Been with the company for a while now as a manager. Work long hours, weekends and holidays but pay is good and benefits are great. Not great for family life balance, though."
good,"This was my first job and it was a good place for that because they have employees specifically for training new people. You can soon become a trainer in less than 2 years because you are constantly tested and evaluated to see how much knowledge you have of the company, with each passed evaluation comes with a raise and a ""star"" on your apron  (it shows ""rank"" among the employees) and if you have a burgundy apron and four stars you are a trainer. Management comes and goes, but everyone was okay. They sometimes have unrealistic goals for the retail team and it makes it hard for the cashiers to sell things if no one is seriously interested in ""buying a piece of candy for the road"" or ""an after dinner snack"". You have to seriously iron you're shirts, pants, and apron before you go to work. I made the mistake of thinking they wouldn't notice, and I had to go strip down in the back office to iron my shirt before I could start work. I had privacy, don't think I was able to be seen, but I definitely wasn't happy about it and it ruined my attitude towards getting ready for work from then on out."
good,ok really could be better management isnt that great food is amazing and the people there are very nice great vibe and the hours there are worth it as well
good,Pretty neat place I guess. Easy to learn the ropes and help out. Emphasis on teamwork and getting the job done right for the customer. Not a bad place to work in my opinion.
good,"I worked at Cracker Barrel for almost 3 years. It was an interesting job. I actually met my best friend there. "
good,Management when I was there simply didn’t speak to each other. I was often forgotten when making schedules — went three weeks without being put on it once. But the coworkers are nice.
good,Great place to work but the dress code was a little strict but other than that it is just a typical job. Would recommend because its great for a long-term job.
good,"A great place to work if you always want to be on your feet, moving around to make sure everything is going smoothly. Customers were always cordial, the managers were mostly great, and everything fits together in order to create a good work environment."
good,Management cares more about making money than anything else. Its easy to cross train and learn more but its part time so pay is low. You do get discounted food.
good,"As is any restaurant, cracker barrel is incredibly busy during the holiday season. Especially thanksgiving. We got a new general manager a few months before thanksgiving. He was foreign and didn't appreciate anyone's point of view. We told him the old GM had overnight bakers for this specific holiday, he rolled his eyes and didn't have anyone working the night before. Thanksgiving we have a limited menu and had 3 hour ticket times. To go orders that were not ready when they were supposed to be. Miserable. Aside from the general manager, the other managers were awesome. If my schedule was messed up, the scheduling manager would always fix it. Overall an okay place to work"
good,"To me, the hardest part of the job was to leave my home store, deciding to take difficult chances in becoming one of the best managers for the business."
good,"I made so many friends quickly at Cracker Barrel. Everyone there is positive and eager to meet new employees. I learned how to exert a positive attitude in the work environment so that working is fun and less stressful. The managers are very friendly and willing to work with you to ensure you're needs. The hardest part of being a hostess is dealing with rude or impatient customers and trying to fit in large parties, but the best part of the job is feeling like your co-workers are your family, making it enjoyable."
good,"The staff was friendly and they were nice with things going on. Asking for time off was ok, but if you are wanting a holiday (besides Christmas) off, they did is as first come, first serve. "
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Overall it was a great place to work at, I just need a job that has more hours though. The hours fluctuated a lot, and it changed far too often. I was told when I first started i would get 40 hrs a week. But that word didn't last the whole 6 months I worked there. Altogether it was a good learning experience and showed me that I'm capable of more."
good,"I love Cracker Barrel.  Still to this day , I remember my first job and how it helped me grow as a person. I think everyone needs to learn how to deal with the public."
good,"Some locations are better than others. It really comes downs to management. If you have really good managers, then working at Cracker Barrel is actually pretty fun."
good,"Was working there as a high school student, it was fast paced and very fun to work with others. I enjoyed the busy environment that allowed me to focus well on the task at hand,"
good,"They do not give you many hours to work, and that is hard to pay your bills with. Depending who is making the schedule is how often you will end up working that week."
good,"Came in and checked my section.  Rolled silverware, Took orders, rang in food, fixed drinks, ran food, cleaned area, sidework. Layed back scene, could be ran better. Management ok. Didn't make a lot of money."
good,"I loved the creative side of the job, building displays, helping customers find gift needs and creating gift baskets! I actually miss doing these things!!"
good,"I worked two different positions, serving and being a retail sales associate. The work was simple and easy, but as a minor there was trouble with my time-stamps. A lot of the time I would be assigned something that the manager or someone else knew I wouldn't be able to finish within a five hour period along with taking care of our guests. Several times the store was fined for this and I was blamed seeing as it's my job to be clocked out on time, but I cannot clock out if I have an open check. This happened often enough to discourage me from working there. Overall the workplace was pleasant. Everyone was kind and knew how to do their jobs well. I've learned how to properly talk to and handle guests as well as problem solve. I would recommend this job to anyone that isn't a minor."
good,Typical day is come in and take care of the restaurant guest and make sure they feel at home. I learned problem solving at cracker barrel. Management there can be tricky it changes pretty frequently there. That place is a great place to go for a great workplace culture. Cracker Barrel is very warm and welcoming to all of its employees. Hardest part of the job would be the inconsistency as a server. Somedays can be really good and other days not so great. The most enjoyable part is the constant interaction with people from all different backgrounds and walks of life.
good,"Enjoyed waiting on our patrons. Fun putting out new merchandise and seasonal decor. Not many hours, most shifts are only 4 hours. If you are wait staff you get to work more hours but only make $2.11/hr plus tips."
good,"I worked a lot but never made enough money to feel compensated plus the lack of support from other staffers and sometimes a lack of control from the management, made it difficult to stay."
good,working for this company is more stressful than you would expect. this place is nicknamed the server boot camp for a reason.the job is either slow and boring or extremely fast paced and stressful.
good,I worked at Cracker Barrel for three years. it was a love hate relationship. Some weekends were great and some were awful. Managers are usually great except when they're under pressure.
good,"I would like to start by saying i do not hate them or regret my time employed by them. It was simply a learning experience that i will never go back to. I enjoyed working with/ talking to the customers, but the hardest part of the job was dealing with the servers and cooks. They thought things should be done the way they wanted instead of how i was trained. As a result, they got mad when I didn't listen to them and did my job how i was trained."
good,I applied to Cracker Barrel thinking it was just a Cashier job. I was wrong. Not only was I a Cashier but my MAIN job was selling merchandise. I wasn’t told about this until after I got the job...
good,"I loved working at Cracker Barrel! Once the management changed the whole working environment was beyond the best I have seen. They are great if you have to move and transfer to a new location, or state."
good,"Fast paced environment, the goal is to have the guest seat to eat time at 14 mins. They hire way to many servers though, so everyone is struggling to get hours. Sunday mornings are really the only time that you're guaranteed to be busy, they will be on a wait for most of the morning and into the afternoon. They put so many servers on you only get 3 tables, but if you're good you can still make 100+."
good,Very good place to work. They look out for their employees. For a resturaunt they have great benefits. They use United HEALTH CARE  for insurance and its great.
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel was always interesting. Management was rude and normally uncaring about any health conditions but you get to keep all of your tips so that was pleasant. When working the morning shift at this location, I walked out with a minimum of $40."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Hey i did like working with them but not enough hours or pay and it got stressful in the whole store and its a fast place job and it gets hot back there
good,worked as a acting GM and had great success but moved to a new area where the DM had his own promotable mgrs and they where promoted in front of me and ironically they only lasted a short time
good,"Everyday is different, sometimes very busy, sometimes very slow. Pretty flexible schedules, management is so so. 50% off meal for your shift, paid vacation"
good,A little disorganized but a good place to work. No compensation for training new hires and they don't have proper equipment to perform job to my standards
good,"It's like a lot of server jobs, but you keep your own tips. Wouldn't recommend working at a Cracker Barrel that's not on an interstate, you won't make money. Expect to be there several hours after the end of your shift cleaning and rolling silverware"
good,On good days you can average 15 dollars an hour. But managers do not order and prep for volume. They run out of product often. Customers are often told they cannot get what they want because we are out of it.
good,love the fact this job offer advancement and many ways to get better pay and hours.  but when management does not care about employees is when it become rough.  had to quit when i could not work the hour i was given after i told them when i could work and could not at that time.  Tow manager laughed at me and walked away so i felt it was time to resign.
good,"I was at Cracker Barrel for 6 years and the people I worked with became my family. I was able to start as a hostess and become trained as a server, I love having the option for this particular advancement."
good,Cracker Barrel is a good company to work for if you can handle the shifts and physical demands of the job. It is a boot camp for servers or will make you better.
good,Can be a positive experience depending on your outlook. Every job is what you make of it. they can be very supportive in times of personal crisis. communication with manangement is key to success
good,"Dish:  be ready to constantly lift 40 lb+ bus tubs, splashback from garbage and water buckets (when tossing silverware into the silverware bucket), and have to be constantly moving around 90% of the time"
good,"loved tthe people but the management was severly slacking with communication. the servers on a good day could make a decent amount of money but if there were no customers for everyone, then you could leave a 7 hour shift with less than $50 which is not alot."
good,Loved working there. Money was good. Everyone was (mostly) great. Just don't get caught up there or you'll spend your life working for the company. Don't get fooled by it.
good,Nothing negative to say. I love this place. Always great food. Great service. Yummy pancakes and bacon. Not to much of a wait time for food. I would definitely recommend this place
good,CB is a good family  restaurant it has wonderful food and a opportunity to grow as an employee. CB will be a good start for collage students to pay bills.
good,"It is a good place to work for great hours and quick money, but is demanding on the body.  There should be an option to have multiple breaks throughout one's shift."
good,"I dumped trashed cleaned tables and moped floors."
good,Great place to work because co-workers make it fun.  Very fast-paced and hard work.  The money is pretty good if you're a fast and friendly servery.  You will quickly make friends and have regulars.
good,"In our store there is a lack of consistency among managers.Some are all about the rules. Some don't care. Some will help. Some don't care. As for work,  some days there is a lot of playing, being on phones, etc. Other day  we clean, serve food, visit guests, and do our job. There are ""clicks"" just like high school. There are some who do all the work. There are the managers pets. Does that cover culture? The hardest part of the job is it's very stressful. The best part is I've made some great friends there."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,The hardest part of the job is trying to keep up with the flow. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people they act like a family. the typical work day well there wast a typical work day it changed all the time.
good,"Cracker Barel was a fun work place and was a good option for a first job. I felt comfortable and the management really was understanding and respectful, which is a must for me."
good,This job was very welcoming. They were very flexible with schedules making it easy for you to have a life outside of work. The managers were amazing and so was the staff. The hardest part about this job was the not so nice customers but the team made the job enjoyable.
good,"Serving by far is a hard job to do period. For the most part working here is fun, there are a few hiccups with management, but I think it's just largely due to communications."
good,A great first starter customer service job. The employee culture was a mix of Southern hospitality with raw employee rage in the break room. You can get promoted quickly with the STARS program if you work hard and are eager to be cross trained.
good,Enjoy the teamwork among peers. customer focus is priority. schedules are flexible. Food is good. paid vacations and employee discounts.
good,It was fun environment. I enjoyed all my co-workers and many of the customers were great. I made life long friends working here and I am grateful for the opportunity they gave me.
good,The first couple of weeks I worked for them it was great. Then some of the Managers were very rude toward me and my co-workers. The best manager was Mr.Scott he was always smiling and helped the kitchen and servers the best he could.
good,"Flexible hours, but very hard to get consistent hours when needed. Communication is terrible between Retail Manager and Restaurant Mangers. Great place to work if you are looking for a little part time job. Great employee discount."
good,"A typical day was hectic. I learned that you can't have much time otherwise because they are constantly wanting to make you work as much as possible - and make you feel like you HAVE to take the shift, even if you've worked all the hours they allow you to work. The management was nice, but they didn't really know what they were doing (in my opinion). The hardest part of the job was listening to people that were clueless. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. You get your regulars, and they are so sweet. I loved working at Cracker Barrel, but I would have to choose a different store from the one that I worked at."
good,Hard work with little time between tasks to take a break. Other employees smoke marijuana behind building and cigarettes.
good,"I love Cracker Barrel. I have worked there 13 years.! It has been a pleasure. "
good,The great thing about Cracker Barrel is the flexibility of hours. The higher up management is very encouraging and helpful in different ways. I enjoy the employees when things aren't rushing around they connect well with me.
good,Was at first warm and welcoming to work there but then became uncomfotable because of unequal treatment. However they have no problem far as hiring people and giving promotions to those to deserve it but do not treat every employee on there worth.
good,Sometimes the managers are rude and disrespectful to employees but they are stressed to get more people in the door in record time. I make good money as a server. They aren't generous with raises for anyone. Medical is decent vacation pay maxes out at 3 weekend
good,"A typical day at work with Cracker Barrel is very fast paced, must be able to multi-task and greet and connect with every guest that visits us. I've learned a great deal of leadership skills, and visual aspects from this job, as well as fine tuning my customer service capabilities. Management differs from store to store, and at various times depending on if one manager is transferred. Other than that, management is decent. Retail has one manager with up to three Shift Leaders below him. Restaurant has up to five Associate  Managers and one General Manager. There really isn't a ""hard"" part to my job, if you enjoy working retail, then you'll enjoy every aspect of this company. Overall, Cracker Barrel is a great place to work for if you have the right team members working with you, it's all a team effort."
good,"Typical day at cracker barrel. Taking orders,running trays, preparing conndiments, greeting customers, making sure orders were put in micro machine accurate. Everyone worked as a team. Being on ur feet for long periods of time was the hardest. What was enjoyable was working hard and counting ur tips at the end of ur shift. That was rewarding to me."
good,"A typical day would consist of interacting with customers and making sure that they are being taken care of "
good,This is a very great place for a first job or even a job just on the weekends. although i ave had problems with management over all its a great place with wonderful people.
good,"I have worked at 3 different locations in my 8 years with the company.  I went from being a Merchandise handler to just a sales associate.  "
good,The main thing I enjoyed at this job was that it allowed me to maintain attendance for school as well as work enough to pay my bills being that I worked overnight. Management would allow me to work during the day when needed to make more money whenever I needed. I was in college and had my own apartment at the time.
good,I loved Cracker Barrel. It was the most pleasant place to work. My co-workers were right on point. Team work was awesome. I loved all my guests. I would work there again.
good,"Good place to work good money must be able to work overtime, fast paced and no breaks. scheduling is not consistent, all holiday are mandatory"
good,Can work in tandem with other coworkers and can set a balanced schedule to match with lifestyle. Managers can sometimes be helpful on hours.
good,"This company is a good one to work for. However, if you don't do well in large groups of people or having to work quickly, this is not the job for you. Many a rush happens here and you have to be on your toes until it is completed."
good,"Cracker Barrel, most of the times,  is a fun place to work. It is a must to be an experienced server as there is a line out the door every Sunday. The daily routine of working at Cracker Barrel is what trains the staff for Mother's Day and Thanksgiving, the two busiest days of the year."
good,I have worked for Cracker Barrel for almost two years and it was great when I was attending school or had another job to schedule around. As a stand alone job hours aren't really there for you to support yourself. It is a great job for a first time job or as I said a student but hours are very unreliable. If you do not keep an open communication with the managers they will continue to cut hours.
good,"The people are great to work with although some of the guests are not very nice. I learned to deal with many things, such as to cope with coworkers/guests/managers. The most enjoyable thing about this job is working with the people."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers! Most of them are regulars and know exactly what they want. They are very considerate when we are busy and if you work hard enough it's easy to make over 12 dollars an hour from tips.
good,"A typical day at work operates around peaks and valleys of business. Lunch begins at 11AM and dinner at 4PM which denote typically busy times of the day, though this isn't always consistent day to day. Some days you will get a very busy lunch or dinner and then things will slow down, other days you will get a very consistently busy peak time for several hours or even may get a late lunch or dinner rush where you're busier past conventional times."
good,"Learned how to better work as a team and coordinate with other departments"
good,"My work experience with Cracker Barrel was on that helped me grown as a worker. There where challenges from my co workers, management, and our guest. It helped me grow as far as my patience, multitasking, my people skills, and working under pressure with out breaking. Cracker barrel was an experience I don't regret no matter how some obstacles tried to break me."
good,Fun place to work.  Good environment with friendly people.  Opportunities to move to different positions.  Great food at a discount.  Training program is a little boring.  Great system to move up.  Helpful Staff.
good,"Everyone was always so nice, just not enough working hours and to many servers. Always hiring new people and not giving the servers already there enough time to work."
good,"Fun co-workers, okay manager's, required uniform, good about giving you time off, work is easy and hours are okay. The only negative is there is no breaks and constantly on your feet."
good,"Cracker Barrel was one of those jobs that you couldn't wait to get to work. The people were always nice, the guests were always happy to be greeted with a smile and showed great appreciation to the employees! It was a great environment to work in"
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, but I didn't like depending on customer's for tips. The managers are nice, but don't take you seriously when you want to cross train or try something new."
good,"Good work environment, flexible hours, experienced managers. work policies intended to create a pleasant work environment. Promotes cross training to encourage learning new skill sets."
good,Good company to work for. Many systems in place to help you succeed. Growing in company is available but have to put a lot of years in to achieve.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"The money is good, thats about it."
good,"great place to work, lots of hours, fun atmosphere. Lots of advancement opportunities, benefits and vacations. also tuition reimbursement. etc"
good,If anyone would like to get entry level experience into the restaurant industry this a great place to start. The company is very thorough in the training process and coaching process after training is over. I learned to a very detail orientated person while employed with the company.
good,"My typical day at work was generally good. The guests are what made the job worth it. Management needed some work, but the coworkers were fantastic. The hardest part about the job was learning the menu and way of things, but with a prioritized schedule, it became much easier."
good,I would imagine that working in a restaurant like cracker barrel is pretty consistent across the board. Nothing fancy. Fast paced environment. Business seems to be slowing as of late.
good,"Cracker Barrel offers many opportunities for advancement and a flexible schedule; however, it can be difficult to plan for things outside of work because you rarely leave at your scheduled time out. Most of the managers are kind, but hostile coworkers can make for a tough day."
good,Work evening for maybe 6 weeks then change to mornings but it was challenge because of communication. Boss would show me how to make it work if I don't understand at all.
good,I have gained a lot of personal experience here and Cracker Barrel is all about promoting from within. I have learned how to be an effective leader and have been able to spend time with my family all while making money.
good,"I have worked here for almost 3 years now. I have enjoyed it for the most part. While the management team has changed throughout my 2 and a half years, it has been a pretty good company to work for. Seen lots of people come through this job. Weekly pay is nice. You are working in customer service so you have to expect the wide range of people coming through and be able to adapt to the different personalities."
good,"Overall good days at the job"
good,Working for this company was most likely my start of my learning curves and triggered my crave for advancement in the restaurant industry.
good,"Although Cracker Barrel doesn't fall in the fast food chains, it is a demanding fast food environment. With corporate's continuous efforts to please customers, it has gradually cut back on employee benefits."
good,My day at work consists of serving guest and making sure that they get the best service when they come in.
good,"You are required to work all day on Thanksgiving (or risk your job!), and many times may work up to 11 days in a row.  The GM will not listen to your side of a story if there is a guest complaint, and good luck getting any help from someone under a three star apron.  Also, a lot of the guests expect a certain level of service; if it is not provided, expect to get written up."
good,Loved the customers and making it a great place to come to for them
good,I would greet and seat guest with a smile. Typically my work day went extremely fast due to the customer's.
good,"Cracker Barrel is a very disciplined, family oriented environment. The uniform code is strict making the employees and business look professional. There are plenty of opportunities to advance if you want a career in food-service. I enjoyed the training program which involved employees and managers from neighboring stores and states. I genuinely feel needed at the store and was recently given an opportunity to become a Service Trainer."
good,"Cracker Barrel is a warm environment to be in. The guest are nice, fun, and caring. I spend most my day interacting with the guest; directing, seating, and having small talk with them. Even though it could get hetic and very busy at times, i learned to keep up with my duties and give excellent service."
good,"Seated people at tables and interacted with guests while they waited. "
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"I learned several important skills while working for Cracker Barrel. Such as, having a strong work ethic, executing urgency with a purpose, and excellent customer service skills."
good,The day at work usually consisted of running around and communicating with customers. I have learned to be calm and collected with people. Management were a joy to be around for the most part. Working with other co-workers had there good days and uneasy days. The most dificult time at work was being rushed. The greatest part about being at work was seeing friendly faces.
good,Open to as many people willing to wait on a table.  Learned how to manage and focus on on both waiting tables and being a hostess.  Management was always busy helping someone.  The co-workers generally worked in assigned stations as a team.  The hardest part of the job was the type of service.  The people made it enjoyable.
good,i seated people and was a cashier and i made basket of products to boost sales
good,"Only worked on the weekends, so it was usually pretty busy. Enjoyed working here, positive atmosphere and customers are generally friendly."
good,If you didn't follow your Business plan on a daily basis then you were going to have a tough day. Communication to the fullest degree all the way down to the dishwashers is what I learned in my management roll. Very energetic team and always willing to come through with whatever the challenge may be. The most difficult aspect of the job was Shift change because the communication ball would drop from time to time. I really enjoyed the concept/ atmosphere the job presented and being involved in every facet of the operation.
good,Worked as a cashier and retail associate. Greeted all customers and make sure they enjoyed their visit. Helped them as needed. Managed all cash handling duties.
good,The management team has a good balance of a sense of humor and responsible discipline when it comes to their employees. It is overall a good place to work.
good,"Sort, scrub, carry dished throughout the kitchen. Trash runs two to three times a day. Collecting the firewood for the fireplace. Learned that teamwork is very helpful in almost any situation. My co-works were always bright and happy. The trash was the most difficult having to empty multiple trash cans. The most enjoyable part was the food."
good,I enjoyed working here as a host throughout high school. i made friends. i was paid well starting out and continuously received raises. Most of the time it was busy and i loved being a scout which ment if your were busy you scouted for empty tables and notified the other host when they were available. I liked most of my managers except for one. The hardest part was trying to not get yelled at by waitresses because if you double sat them they came to you and yelled at you for it. It was pretty fun most of the time.
good,"Everyone there was very friendly, out going & quick to help."
good,"Cashier - Answer the telephone and route calls, Greet guests and answer their questions, and run cash register."
good,"I am now a very experienced server with a great attitude towards any customer. Must be self motivated, very rewarding for very hard working person."
good,This was another Job I kinda enjoyed for a while. Pretty good atmosphere to work in. 
good,good place to work. busy work place on weekends and peak periods. great at teaching merchandising and product knowledge.
good,A day at work is enjoyable and the co-workers and management are very kind and fair. 
good,"This company knows how to stay ahead, offering its employees a future and investment opportunities "
good,management treats ya right food is great great benefits great stable company to work for
good,"Enjoyed working here, employees are down to earth, management was knowledgeable.."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"A typical day at Cracker Barrel was enjoyable, my co-workers were understanding and hard working. I worked the register and was the first to greet guests in person and over the phone. I was in charge of the multi-line phone and made sure I answered on the first or second ring. I helped answer any guest questions to the best of my ability and did all in my power to give them the overall best restaurant experience they could have. The hardest part of my job was figuring out the most proficient way to train new cashiers and making sure I did all I could to teach them all the information they'd need to be successful. It took a little more thought due to how people have different ways of learning, whether it's through observation, demonstration, watching videos, or reading the learning material. I tried to appeal to everybody's learning ways. The most enjoyable part of my job was being around and meeting new people. I am a very outgoing person who is always ready to meet new people, everybody has a story and I am very intrigued to hear them."
good,"A good company to work for with good values. I'm thankful to have a good job. I've met some interesting people thru the years and have some good team mates. We could use some additional training and coaching. If you're following company policy, it has to be enforced for everyone, not the select few. I've learned to work with the public because I used to be so shy. Cracker Barrel has helped me with that. We're all human and with God's help and help from each other, we are making Cracker Barrel a nice friendly, like home place to work. The guests that enter our doors are like family to us. When they are greeted, we remember them from the last time they visited with us. We all need to communicate more efficiently."
good,"A good environment to work at if you can deal with people. You have to be very patient, friendly, and enjoy it at the same time."
good,"Fun and fast paced work. Some people are team players and make it very easy to work, while others are lazy and only care about their own advancement. Management is good for the most part, but as always the age old saying holds true ""its not what you do its what they see"", and people who stick with that logic go far, even if they are the lazy ones when noone is looking."
good,"Cracker Barrel is a great place to meet new people. There are guests coming in from near and far so it is always a treat. Not only have I learned how to work with a wide variety of people, I have learned the value of teamwork. The days when we have run out of food and our managers have disappeared on us, it took that ability to get us through."
good,a typical day at work for me was to balance the cash drawers and issue receipts.
good,"learned that there are times that are helpful, very understanding management fast pace overall good experience however there are complicated guest as would be any place hardest part of the job is biting your tongue most enojoyable is the co workers"
good,learned alot working here there are so many different ways you can go working for such an establishment
good,When I would get to work I would make sure all menus were cleaned and we had silverware at the hostess stand. Upon customers arriving I would seat them and tell them about our daily specials. Ending my day I would make sure everything was clean at the hostess stand and help clean the restaurant.
good,"Great execution of well trained staff,"
good,"When you walk into work and your co-workers greet with a big smile and ask how you are, that makes for a great day. Teamwork is very effective and it is great to work with people who believe the same thing. The hardest part is making sure the customer is always happy. I love the interaction with my customers. I love meeting new people."
good,It was about the same type of management job that I have had in the past I would organize my shift take care of crew and our guests. Staffing was always a battle and the shifts was a 50+ work week but it was very enjoyable. It was fast pace and always something to learn.
good,Typical day at work was real busy. That keeps you on your toes. The hardest part of the job was being up at night.The enjoyable part of the job was there was always something to do.
good,crackerbarrel is a down home resturant with great menu items to choose from.
good,My typical work day is filled with personal interaction. I enjoy working with people. most of the managers are a lot of fun. There is one that seems to be moody a lot and will sold us for things not applicable to my position.
good,typical day started with prioritizing work flow through out the day with steady phone calls. Learning to be patient and listen. Being with my co-workers is like working with your family. The hardest part of the job was having to appreciate employees concerns but keeping in mind I work for a business. The most enjoyable part of job is getting the job done.
good,"I went around to new locations for the company and helped open up new stores and trained new hires for the service area. loved going from city to city and meeting new people, pay was great, but very little time being with the family"
good,"With the location of this job, I had to resign in order to further my education. I fully enjoyed every minute working with the friendly customers, co-workers, and management."
good,"Learned a lot about the company, but some things are over looked, need to go more by the rules"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I enjoyed being employeed with Cracker Barrel. They have some great people that work for them. They treat their employees well other than some poor management in certain locations.
good,"I loved working here but had to quit xue to me not havimg someone to take care of my son anymore as he was only 4 months old at the time, not alot of daycares took infants."
good,Overall a good company to work for.  The biggest draw back for management is the inconsistency of scheduling.  In a 3 day period you can have 3 different 10 hour shifts.
good,Fast paced work place. Nice work environment and good atmosphere.  Fair pay and great management. The hardest part of the job depends on the amount of guest that come in.
good,"The GM  at the time spent most of his time bragging on his toys and was jealous of others that had stuff too."
good,"Enjoyed the job and love the staff, but felt i was paid unfairly due to our high volume on ""Togo"" serving. This location however does not give many hours nor does it provide any benefits to part time employees. I would recommend for students who do not need much sustainability, not a permanent position for a single adult."
good,I enjoy the work atmosphere from the people to the décor and food everyone is always welcoming and what can I say im a sucker for ll the nic nacs  my boyfriend and I also could eat the heck out of there food
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel is very fun and interesting i've learned lot's of new things and when you level up it makes you feel amazing ,but i just need/have to find a closer job to home."
good,Hours there are not Guaranteed also your scheduled can change anytime.Its an ok place to work to get by .one week you might have 40 hours next week you can have 20 something hours
good,"Management isn’t always available, some people were treated like outcasts. New employees are scrutinized heavily. Over all it’s a great place to work if you have thick skin and are willing to go the extra mile constantly."
good,"Better than minimum wage at least, with potential to get raises with each star earned. Probably the easiest job I've ever had. I like most of the managers, though they can be rude sometimes. Don't get as many hours as I'd like in retail, but schedule is very flexible. Best part of the job is the employee discount lol. Hardest part is probably just rude customers."
good,"Managers come and go, however, some of the most amazing people I have met in my life have come from this facility. The coworkers are close and help cover shifts. Over the years, there have been some issues, however, the district manager is one of the most fair employers that I have worked with throughout any company. He will take the employees side if it is the right thing to do."
good,This job was a good atmosphere to learn how to be a good server. It was typically fast-paced and sometimes hard to juggle while in college as many tables often stayed late.
good,"It's not a bad job overall, just a lot of hard work. If you are not willing to put in the work in order to succeed then you will not go as far as fast as you would if you did. If you are incapable of working with other people in a constructive manner or are prone to high levels of stress then this is not the job for you."
good,"It was always busy and you weren't given a lot of tables. The managers were nice and understanding. The hardest part of the job was side work, and the easiest was the service."
good,"The work environment and culture were amazing. Management could have been more organized, and rewarding if hard working employees. There could have also been more incentives"
good,Great customer service.Enjoy the fast pace and taking care of the customer. I still go back to visit since I left makes you miss the people we were working with
good,"Cracker Barrel is a good place to work. They work very well with my schedule, and communicate well with their employees. However, it is very fast-paced and hectic at times."
good,"I really like serving. It’s a tough and stressful job that people don’t realize, but it gets me to interact with people which has made me a people person since I started."
good,Its a great company to work for.. I have been there for three years.. I enjoy the all my  guests sometimes i have requested ..it has been a great experience for me
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,It was good but needed more pay better a 100 something a week wasn't cutting it and I couldn't do just that sorry but if that pay is ok with anyone than go for it
good,"Working as a hostess was great , some days busier than others. The management was always there if you needed help. Working there felt like one big family ."
good,It’s a fast pace place. Weeknights are slowish but always when 6pm hits it’s chaos. The company really does care about you and your family. Just show up for work and work BOH and the pay is worth it! Don’t forget to PAR up and so your pay goes up.
good,Very fast paced work environment. Great place to work if you love to work hard. kitchen can get very hot and loud so if you plan on working in the back expect it.
good,"I will forever be grateful to Cracker Barrel for giving me my first real job, and training me in the restaurant industry. The company challenges you and asks much from it's employees, but reward those that stick around."
good,It is a good job for teens or young adults in college but I would not reccomend it for anyone trying to make a living with a child or household. The environment is stressful and the pay is lackluster but with tips included it is great for small bills or gas money.
good,"The only issue is that management is not always on the same page. Although if you probe your and work hard, you are rewarded. Benefits are given after 1 year of you meet the required amount of hours worked the year prior."
good,Still currently working there. Place is what you make of it. Be kind and courteous to guests and it should be a walk in the park. Would recommend sticking to hosting or retail.
good,You have to have a strategic work ethic.  Its a very stressful environment. And to make the money you had to be fast and a multi talker. It's a very high pressure job.
good,"Working at cracker barrel entitled that when I get there I had to stock my food drawers, refill my sandwich station, refill the steam line (which is where we keep things like green beans, mashed potatoes, carrot, etc.)"
good,"better communication skills , ive learned to multi-task . and interact better with peers . the hardest part about this job was that some nights would be really hectic an the customers tend to become rude and i had to teach myself how to still make sure they were respected and eat well. the most enjoyable part of this job was the co-workers always made sure eachother were happy and always got a laugh out during the day."
good,"The Owasso Retail Manager was the nicest person I've ever met. She followed all of the standards of Cracker Barrel and made everyone feel like they were valued. The restaurant mangers varied. Some were hateful and rude and others were friendly. I would only work retail. It is too bad that a food handler's license is needed for retail. Also, the uniform is the worst! It is so uncomfortable to wear a full apron that does not fit properly. It is also difficult to get a button up, button down collared shirt to fit properly, even the ones that could be ordered from Cracker were uncomfortable."
good,"I’m a minor working as a hostess part time, so I can’t give an accurate review about pay and hours, but I can talk about the overall environment. Management can be very helpful, and so can other hosts and servers at times. Though there are a lot of servers who are rude to hosts and sometimes managers can be a bit much. But it’s a good job overall, everything comes with a little downside."
good,"I worked at Cracker Barrel for almost 4 years. A typical day at work consisted of being able to prioritize and moving at a fast pace at all times; Getting your drinks and food orders at the same time (AKA one stop shop). Put in your drinks and food orders in the computer, then making drinks and, possibly, bringing bread to your guests. "
good,"It is easy overall, the customers and managers are like family, you learn and you lead, and the happiness of working there comes within. The hardest thing was some customers were super rude."
good,"It's a decent place to be if you need a part time server's job balanced with another. Especially during off season with barely much shifts, it'll be best to have another job on the side. When you've worked there long enough and gained enough promotion they'll provide more hours and you'll actually make decent money besides the tips."
good,It was a typical day to get on board and have morning meetings with the management to enforce what the day was planned and what was forthcoming. It was a very fast paced place and requires the team player to take into effect. It was very important to make sure that the back of the restaurant  was clean and well stocked and that everything that pertained to the food industry was properly labeled upon the freshness and the expiration dates. This was definitely a huge family environment.
good,"Current managers on the restaurant side know what they need to do and do well, but aren’t the most personable and can often times be rude and disrespectful to employees. Retail side, manager has high goals set, and puts forth all effort to help us achieve those goals. "
good,"Many of the things I learned at CB helped me in other jobs. Strong sense of professionalism and work ethics practiced.  Though the hours were slim, it is applicable for those not wanting or needing a full time job."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Good company to work for, but too worried about pleasing share holders and increasing dollar margins, instead of just focusing solely on the guest and letting everything else take care of itself."
good,"Typical restaurant. Cracker Barrel is a good place to start out because they will train you very well. I learned quite a bit at the two locations I worked at, mostly how to handle conflict. "
good,"Cracker Barrel was a great working environment that really helped me acquire adequate customer service skills. I am grateful for having worked with an amazing team who motivated each other to do their best everyday. Overall, it was a great learning experience for me."
good,"Outgoing, friendly,  motivated,  determined, confident, and team player... to meet guests needs and any concerns they may have,  I also interact with them in funny ways to make their day a little bit better."
good,"takes good care of employees. work life balance is off but you learn alot here and there always plenty to do. "
good,"The cocncept is focused on the older generations, however, are trying to find the balance. The expectation of the staff is very high, and with the cost of living increasing the hourly employees need more."
good,Working here was not a bad job. I was only working here to get me through college and that’s why a lot of people work there because they are flexible with the schedule.
good,"I don't mind working at Cracker Barrel. Everyone is very nice and friendly, I just don't think the job is really for me. I enjoy more of a modern place."
good,Yes working at a restaurant can be very stressful at times but it honestly was worth it to see guest happy. The staff is for the most part about team work and willing to please each and every guest.
good,I thought that Cracker Barrel had a great training program and continuous training to help the staff be better in their performance. The question is was it adequately applied once completed.
good,"Once fulfilling training requirements for new hires, you are able to proceed with daily tasks with a minimum of direct oversight. Managers are there to help if a problem arises, however, in the busy atmosphere they are often occupied. Completing further training to achieve base level employee advancement is relatively easy, though there are waiting periods for promotions, so you cannot advance at your own pace."
good,"Great place for a first time job, but only worked 3 days a week when I was hoping to get more so at the end of the day I was maybe a little above minimum wage but wasn't enough to pay for things other then leisure activities or what not."
good,Good place to work and decent work advancement and raises.Good management a great place to increase skills and work experience. Overall a family oriented atmosphere
good,"I had fun working here. I was at a place in my life where I wanted to serve others, this was a good place for me to be. Most of the employees were good to work with, some of them were young and only did what was absolutely necessary."
good,"Cracker barrel is a fun and relaxed place to work, lots of nice co workers and managers, they're times where it can get over whelming but every work place is like that, they are good with requesting off work when u need to."
good,"It really depends on the store you work in. I've been with CB for three years, there are definitely adjustments that needs to be made. If they listened to their employees they could make the proper changes to benefit all. "
good,If you need a place to work when your a teen this is your place. Their good at working with your schedule. They make sure minors have thier breaks. There not a 24 hour place.
good,"Not a place for people who are trying to pay bills (rent, phone, gas, etc.) "
good,"Meet a lot of nice people, work is not difficult but stressful at times to meet required sales expectations. I’ve worked for CB for a lot of years and enjoy the atmosphere and regular customers"
good,"Decent enough job, but you need to be strict with them on keeping good hours, or else you will slowly start to dwindle in hours until you really can't afford the commitment"
good,"I love it here. Good pay, friendly people. Very very fun job. Gets along with everyone very well. Love my coworkers and customers as well. You get to meet so many new people here daily. Also, love our food!😂💯"
good,"Cracker Barrel in Russellville ultimately is an amazing restaurant to work for. Servers keep their tips, and do not have to ""tip out"" to anyone. The atmosphere is that of high school where all of the women that work here talk about each other all of the time. (Typical of any restaurant)"
good,"It's quick paced so there is always something to do. Good management, good coworkers, kitchen experience learned. They also offer good benefits as you stay with the company."
good,"Clock in like at every job how to work the computer system before the orders what side work was learning how to balance the food trays that you have to take to the table making sure the condiments were placed correctly on the tables before your shift started or after. Hardest part was making sure I got the customer's orders correctly, and I would have to say the most enjoyable part was knowing that I made their visit enjoyable."
good,Was such a fun place to work. The retail store is awesome and everyone I worked with was always so nice and in great moods! I miss working there alot and will always use everything I learned there in everything I do inside and outside of work.
good,"Depending on who your working with..it can be a rough shift or a breeze. Most of the management is there for you. Advancement is up to you, take the test and advance."
good,"Working for Cracker Barrel is a lot of fun, but you are expected to sell.  It is a high pressure job, but still fun.  Management in my store was mostly and truly wonderful--particularly my immediate manager."
good,I like working at cracker barrel ...i have learned alot and most of the employees i work with are very nice and helpful ..feels great to be on a GOOD TEAM...WHO YOU KNOW HAS YOUR BACK ..
good,"Great benefits for full time employees, would require to relocate for advancement. They are running very hospitable business, guest centric, guest are treated like family. Enjoyed the guest service and experience we provide for both guests and employees."
good,"Management is amazing, they really care for their employees. Organization is huge, speed of service is huge, and making guests happy is their number one priority. I have been blessed to call Cracker Barrel my first workplace setting."
good,A very no nonsense company. It was like being in the military at times. There was no grey area at all. It was a strong corporate structure. You knew the rules and worked hard. I enjoyed my time at Cracker Barrel until the last year with the company. You were expected to drive the business hard and never fail. I loved the product and people I worked with. The hardest part was the politics of the company.
good,"A typical day at work was greeting guests, managing the cash register, and stocking the store. The workplace had classic country feel to it, made you feel at home with the home cooked country meals."
good,"My manager was super sweet, the tips weren't amazing but they got the job done. Be ready to hustle everyday and turn tables. If you get injured on the job and fail a drug test they will fire you."
good,Typical work day is just greeting and seating people at a normal but good pace. Some days can be busy and some can be slow. Management is really good and friendly. The hardest part is getting little to no breaks especially when part time
good,"The focus on team work is well taught. The magic in numbers is learned. The more quests interfaced with, the higher conversion becomes. A focus on conversions increases sales. Sales is the primary focus. Guest satisfaction is the goal. The most enjoyable part of the job is interraction with the guests. All diffierent types of people enjoy Crackerbarrel. Some come to see the current sales (clearance etc) and new products introduced. Others come for their favorite foods."
good,"As a hostess you would greet and show guests where to sit, having to keep a clean and presentable work area kept everyone busy in day to day work. One of the many things I've learned is how to be reasonable with time and expectations."
good,"management is very poor. they do not treat employees with desired respect. serving is stressful anywhere, but it is more laid back here. the coworkers were nice and helpful."
good,I love my Cracker barrel Family. I work retail part time. Retail manager is diligent and caring. My training was very detailed and was prepared to go in the job with a full set of knowledge. The retail hours are slim and there is no insurance offered. The hardest part is foot traffic and not enough space in the retail area for anyone to walk in and out of which makes it really stressful on the workers. I worked there for more than 3 years and I have loved it. Everyone is very humble and supportive.
good,"The management at cracker barrel is very guest oriented as well as employee oriented. Employees always give a fun and exciting experience to the guest, inviting and welcoming them back for more. Employees would greet guests as they came in the door and as they left, if there was help needed at the cash register employees would rush up there and help expedite the line, we would clean the stock room, keep the bathrooms clean, organize themes, help guests find products they were looking for, substitute selling, meet sales goals, etc. There wasn't really a hard part about the job, I was there for 2 and a half years and had learned pretty much everything my position had required. I always learned something new each time I worked, whether it was from my manager or co-workers. The most enjoyable part was getting to see my friends each day when I worked, they always made the work day go by faster and we shared a lot of laughs and jokes, but still managed to work as a team and get our sales goals in for that day."
good,Can become quite stressful for a place to work. Tends to hire quite a few high school students as servers and due to this can become very stressful because the pace required to fulfill customers orders at one time can become greater than the level of experience the servers have experienced are not balanced and can become very far behind on ticket times due to incorrect order placement by inexperienced servers.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"I would come in and make the best of my day. To make sure that people felt at home then an restaurant, that was my goal. More then half the time people would leave happier then when they came in."
good,"Working at a restaurant is a fast-paced environment and Cracker Barrel was no exception. On the week days there was a constant flow that started around 6pm and continued until around 9pm. On the weekends the restaurant was packed all day. Keeping a strict schedule and staying on task was very important. "
good,"I didnt mind working at cracker barrel, but I wouldnt do it again. For lunch you get half priced meals, which is sad really. Every hour you make min. wage ($8 where I was) then have to pay over half an hour of work, to eat in a 30 minute period in which you are forced to stop working. Most people dont really mind that, but it frustrated me. I refused to spend anything on meals, so most days I just went hungry and wasted half an hour because working that half hour would have been illegal. "
good,Fast pace when you do dishes...  The employee are good to work for and their will help you if you need help...  The boss will work with you on days off...
good,Was overall a decent place to work. It was very stressful at times due to peak periods. The people you worked with made it more enjoyable than anything!
good,"Great JOB! Awesome Staff, good food. Fair discounts. This job helped me when I needed it. You have to have a hustlers mind. It's a fast pace work culture. You have work to please people. Pleasing People is the focus."
good,"I have had a wonderful experience at Cracker Barrel, the environment is fast paced. The managers treat guests and employees with the upmost respect. The company provides good benefits."
good,Nice place to work. Lot of great people to work with.  I am a hard worker.  I am always on time. I am always at work when I am scheduled.  I really love and enjoy being a Hostess.
good,I love everything about Cracker Barrel except for how the management decided to handle some situations. The environment was fun and everyone was friendly. The work was hard but so very worth it and it was easy money.
good,"Cracker Barrel is great place to work, but lately I just haven’t been given the hours I need in order to make money and we’ve hired too many people in order to actually get the hours I want."
good,"The place was fun to work at because of the people. Management cares only about how they can get there hands on that bonus, even if it means working there people to death. They expected waaay too much out of me due to the fact that they knew I would get in and get stuff done no matter where I worked. I was strongly take. Advantage of. We seemed like we would be understaffed forever so that’s when I decided to leave"
good,Great management and overall place to work at. I would have stayed if I didn't live so far away and was in college. The servers were rude at times but that is made aware when you get the job.
good,"This job to me is a great one. Also it’s very comfortable to talk to employees there. Making money and killing time is the best thing, also the great food too."
good,"Quick paced, never boring work place where there is always something to do. Management is highly dependent on location but Home Office does a good job of attempting to maintain consistency throughout the company"
good,Cracker Barrel was a high school job so it was nice to get the work experience and i learned really quickly there. It was my second job ever so it give me the feel of the food industry.
good,"The job itself is nothing crazy to write home about. Its a retail job that is attached to a restaurant, so you could be answering to more than one manager that technically isn't yours. But while there is nothing insane to speak of in terms of job descriptions, there are lots of things to look forward to. Stock is always rotating, floor moves were truly a joy, setting new themes and even hanging the seasonal decorations. "
good,Its a great job for a teenager or for soneone who can devote all of their time to carreer advanxement. I think they should increase they pay rate for the people who work harder than most. The employees that do floor moves & process the truck should get a higher pay rate for those times.
good,"Very fast paced environment, some days are better than others but that’s every where . Every so often I get a chance to par up and get better benefits within the company"
good,Cracker barrel is a pretty good place to work. I worked there throughout my entire pregnancy. When i had my daughter i got the full maternity leave plus some. The employees were great! The money was good too.
good,"Coming in to work would be a relief kinda I had a lot of people relying on me and I stepped up and took the leader role there and moved my way up to prep cook ."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"You can settle for your part, or you can advance yourself and become bigger in the company. Great Benefits and awesome and lax environment. Clear procedures and rules, and an amazing(But a little slow)learning program. Two halves to a whole store, but policy runs clear and it's very smooth."
good,I made good money but I had the personality to be a waitress. Waitressing is not for everyone. I enjoyed the job and was sad when I found out I was going to have to quit
good,"I enjoy working at Cracker Barrel but it is not a job I intend to keep forever. Being a waitress is not a career for me. A typical work day starts with some silverware rolling and finding out what tables are yours for the next couple of hours, then filling up the ice by the soda machines, making fresh coffee, sweeping under tables, and keeping an eye on your guests. Then its time to take orders, bring out drinks and food, and keep the guests engaged and happy throughout their stay. The hardest parts are 1.) dealing with guests who are angry and are taking it out on you, or 2.) when you're stressed and its busy and trying not to drop trays or run into people. Its not a bad place and most customers are extremely nice, love to talk, and leave decent tips."
good,Relaxing workplace. A workplace of opportunity for advancement. Very friendly environment and culture. Ive learned the cook position there and how to cook certain things.
good,"I worked from 6-6 most days. I would just clean the floors and the equipment. It was very easy, I had more than enough time to complete my given duties."
good,"Fun environment and great staff. Staff worked together to help each other get their responsibilities done. Retails floor was an easy job, but fast paced on weekends"
good,Responsible for stocking up the hot box with food needed in the grill line. Learned to handle problems one at a time and not be overwhelmed. The hardest part of working in the kitchen is not everybody will do their job and there are many times where you will have to pull in a lot of weight and not be recognized for it. The enjoyable part is just knowing you did your job right and to the best of your ability.
good,"everyone except the retail general manager, were rude, and would not listen to the staff if there was a problem. i had guests even complain about a regional manager not listening and still promoting a product they didn't want."
good,Working at Cracker Barrel was a challenge but in a good way. Its very fast-paced. The management wasn't all that great but they still got the job done. To me the hardest part was trying to keep up with everything. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to walk out with money everyday.
good,great structure to the company but a bit outdated technology. there are product to push and quotas to meet that can lead to stressful situations. management is average and above. the atmosphere is family friendly and collaborative.
good,"I enjoyed working here, you just have to know everything you are dealing with as far as knowledge and time management and everything would turn out smooth."
good,"Great way to build your career. Lots of room to advance. Flexibility, great benefits, if you like to work then this will be a great experience. They take the time to make sure each individual who decides to take on a role with the company is trained properly. Lots of hands on training to succeed in position."
good,"Although the pay is competitive, I do tend to work over 55 hours a week. It makes it hard to have a good work/home balance. Good place to work and you are able to move up quicker if you are willing to re locate"
good,"The job paid weekly  and I knew I was getting money every Thursday, but the manager who did the schedule was very inconsistent in giving enough hours."
good,"Managers work as a team to ensure the best outcome for all employees. They were very understanding, great listeners and proactive about every complaint or issue."
good,Paid decent. Fairly professional management. Great coworkers. Pay advancements slowed down after awhile and they were very strict on overtime. Great part time gig
good,I didn’t enjoy it much they never gave organization for what to do during slow days and there wasn’t much to do other than standing around. They should give more options.
good,"This is a great company to work for. When they first opened, they were dedicated to customer service. Every person on staff did their part and worked together as a team."
good,"Being a sales rep at cracker barrel is overall a nice experience. They started me out above minimum wage and were flexible with my hours.  Manager at the time was kind, but could get a little overbearing with sales tactics."
good,"I was a server. They require you to wear specific pants (no sewn-on pockets, must be more like dress slacks) in either black, khaki, brown, or navy. Shirts must be oxford-style button-ups (long sleeve required for those with arm tattoos) in either pastel pink, pastel blue, pastel yellow, or white. Hair must always be up, always looking your best, and of course black socks and tred-safe shoes. If you can deal with a complicated uniform, you can do well here. It's a high-end training program and you will receive the best server experience. Any time I work somewhere else, if they hear I was trained here, they are highly pleased."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Great people to work with. Daily work is challenging but rewarding at the same time. Rotating schedule can be hard to adjust to for some. Standard restaurant schedule of 50 to 55hrs.
good,"The guests are often friendly and kind, especially the regulars. You really come to know people at this job if you take the time."
good,It's a great place to work as a server. The Managers have always been professional and accommodating to allow servers to grow into their positions. Always courteous and kind.
good,It usually is good overall as long as everyone is doing their part. I like most people from management. Good environment and it is a good place to work if you're foing through school.
good,"Required a lot of work, non stop actually.  Very high turn over rates in all positions.  The work is laid out for you to succeed if you follow the systems they have in place"
good,"I was on the evening shift for the dish washing crew. I would come into work at about 3-4 PM, depending on the day. Next I would clock in, put on the rubber apron (at first I questioned the need for it, but it really helps prevent your clothes from being absolutely soaked at the end of the night) and clocked in. From there, it was pretty simple. Load the dishes onto the plastic racks, and put them through the dishwasher. The pots and pans were cleaned in a separate tub of hot water and took longer to clean (had to be scrubbed by hand), but it wasn't too difficult. After a while, one or two other dishwashers would show up to help (to make sure I wasn't overwhelmed by the dinner rush). Then as the restaurant closed down for the night, I would stay behind and wash the dishes from the kitchen, making sure the morning crew would be able to start cooking at once. "
good,The best part about working there were the coworkers upbeat personalities and the various cultures it represented. The Southern food-style was a unique experience to both witness and eat.
good,"A typical work day at Cracker Barrel is back and forth on your feet and taking care of the guests in your section. It's about being a team player and helping your coworkers do the best they can do. I've learned a lot about how to work with the public since I've become a serve at Cracker Barrel. The management is always willing to work with you and push you to the next level. The hardest part of work would be the constant walking on your feet, but at the end of the day, it is worth it! The most enjoyable part of the job is when I have guests come in that are happy and enjoyable. This makes the job worthwhile"
good,The company keeps asking more and more of its employees without the compensation of benefits (monetary or otherwise). Various jobs have various requirements so it's good to know what you're good at before you apply for a certain position.
good,"very fast paced and constant work. never a dull moment. on top of cleaning dishes and pots and pans you also have to take out trash and clean up the kitchen at night,"
good,Theres always a job and you never get bored. Always keep a smile for the guests and lead them to there destination.show the customers gratitude and respect when they come in and when they leave the store/restaurant.
good,"Can be very stressful, especially on the weekends, but not unbearable. Shifts arent too long and coworkers are nice and cooperative. Nice to have the option of PARing up for increased wages."
good,I enjoy dealing with the public so this was ideal for me. It was flexible for raising my kids. It is a demanding job physically but not more than any other job
good,"Overall a great place to work. Strict rules, but nothing out of the ordinary. I was able to learn new skills and cross train in order to pick up more hours. It also helped to change up what I did on a daily basis."
good,"Trabalhei como garçom nesta que é uma das maiores franquias de restaurantes nos estados Unidos, durante 4 anos em que morei  la. Ingles fluente era um diferencial e tambem treinava novos garcons que entravam nesta empresa."
good,"This place can get very busy very quick but as a server you get good tips plus a decent hourly salary. As long as you're polite and attentive you shouldn't have any issues."
good,Would like to work there again but I ruined my chance. They r no longer 2nd Chance employers. If ur good at serving this is a good place to work. The best is they do actually offer advancement up the ladder to management as well as paid vacation.
good,"Pay is ok. Not as good some but better than others. "
good,The management team and coworkers made working at Cracker Barrel one of the most pleasant restaurant job experiences ever. Everything involved was cozy for the employees as well as our guests.
good,"A typical shift is about 6-9 hours. No scheduled breaks. You're lucky if you can sit down for 5 minutes. I have learned how to interact and please people better than I used too. Management is pretty cool, unless you have one that yells all the time. The hardest part of my job is all the expectations of the company. the most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers. They are always there for me."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,There is always something new to learn. The management is constantly raising the bar on our expectations to keep us motivated. There is always opportunity for advancement through par levels and cross training.
good,very good at accommodating schedules and time off. fun environment. did not like being hired for one position and then put in another without requesting if i wanted it.
good,Fast past people focus job. easy to learn fun and never a dull moment. Many different jobs for all types of people. Super enjoyable job.  Manager are friendly and willing to help in any way they can
good,"Fun place to work, with great people and awesome food. "
good,"Most nights you wont make much money, but others you will. Most people only get 1-2 days a week. You can pick up and trade shifts easily most of the time."
good,"Cracker Barrel Old Country store is a family focused restaurant with a people pleasing attitude.  The environment is exciting, friendly, and fast paced."
good,I learned how to multitask and how to interact with other coworkers. I've also learned how to talk to customers in a professional and manner able way before taking orders.
good,"The workplace culture is extremely fast paced and overwhelming, which results in a  fun and exciting work experience. I'm definitely not saying that this job is always fun and easy... as a server you will make excellent money but you will work your butt off for it!"
good,"Management was nice, except when I told them I wasn't available to work through the week because of my class schedule and they continued to schedule me and would get mad if I could not find a replacement and would have to call out."
good,My job at Cracker Barrel as Host was a rewarding job until the new GM decided to let the servers control the work of the host.  Business was operated without customer complaints
good,"Clock in, memorize you assigned section of tables to service. Make sure supplies you will need for service are properly stocked. ""Running"" food to customers is priority #1. Make sure work environment and all applicable work spaces are clean and safe as possible at all times."
good,"I enjoyed working here. The mangers are great, and understanding. Overall i had a good experience at cracker barrel. They're a good company to work for."
good,"I love the people that I work with. All ages can work here. Cracker Barrel really taught me my communication skills, being very attentive towards not only my guess needs but my coworkers as well. When i say team work I mean team work from the retail store to the host, severs, grill cook, prep, back up to management ! I do love this place. I do recommend Cracker barrel for all ages as well as those that have never worked before great place to start. I could keep going but you just have to find out for your self!"
good,"Can be flexible with hours, depending on the season"
good,I had worked there for two years at the Sulphur LA store and I loved the people and atmosphere. Very busy on Sundays but that is when we made the most money as servers. Very easy to move through the ranks and cross train.
good,I didn't deal with alot of people while working there i was just there to do my job and get paid every week. The job on hand was easy just way too much side work
good,"This job is a hit or miss. Some days you can make $30 and other $100. It is never consistently busy, and always over staffed on servers. The servers are all very young and still act like they are in high school, because well, most of them are still in school."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Working for Cracker Barrel very rewarding company there's advancement opportunities in the company I'm just tired of cooking and I want something different but Cracker Barrel is a wonderful company to work for I enjoy working for them for the 12 years that I have been working for them they're very productive and maintain a very friendly and family atmosphere at all times
good,"Cracker barrell is a great place to work, they do not give enough hours and they are limiting health benefits. Cracker barrrel will work with your schedule and cross train you for other job codes within the companyr"
good,"The employees are amazing as well as the management making it a very fun environment to work in. Servers have the potential to make A LOT of money at this location, however there are absolutely no Benefits. No paid time off, no dental, vison, 401k, ect. Other positions have access to these Benefits but servers are only part time."
good,"I honestly loved working here. Such a good company to work for. The environment is pleasant, and the management staff is wonderful. I do think they could use some technology upgrades, but otherwise, I love this place."
good,a typical work day consisted of prompt and accurate work. I learned new positions everyday. The management was strong minded. the workplace culture was like a family everyone worked together.
good,its not a job to live off of but it is a great job for people who are looking to get in on the work force. I would tell anyone getting out of high school to come work.
good,"Challenging, rewarding team oriented Retail and restaurant operation.Developed over 50 managers several to general and district manager position. Operated as business leader participated in Chamber commerce and acknowledged as regional and district leader annually. Profitable unit achieving budget demands and leading company in employee retention."
good,"Managers and co workers were friendly to work with. The managers were flexible with my work schedule and willing to work around my college classes and second job. Although working for a restaurant franchise was quick paced and sometimes stressful, I have enjoyed working for this company."
good,The environment is relaxed but quick paced and everyone knows everyone and we are like a big family.  The hardest part is making sure that your keeping up with the communication
good,"Simple and easy job. Staff is great and helpful when learning the job. Does require a lot of standing and walking around. Breaks are short and usually require you to ""clean the bathroom."""
good,I worked in the retail part of Cracker Barrel and very much enjoyed meeting new customers and being part of the lives of the regulars. I enjoyed most the tasks that are part of being in retail. Generally it was a fun and worthwhile place to work. This is of course was until the change in management staff happened and it then became a struggle due to mangers attempts to prove themselves. This made the job more stressful than it was worth.
good,Its an alright place to work. You get really close with other hostesses but the servers can get very rude and they aren't afraid to tell you what your job is. Managers don't handle people that should be retrained or even fired because they aren't caring about their job.
good,"I worked at a Hostess which paid very well compared to other jobs in consideration. Even after a month you get a raise. However, being a hostess there wasn't easy. The servers will blame you for a lot of things such as seating arrangement and poor customers. You have a lot of things to balance and servers don't have a tendency to help. Honestly, you're either busy or achingly slow. It gets very hot and I really hope you like listening to the same 10 country songs over and over."
good,I love working at Cracker Barrel and every job has it's downfalls but I feel like on a whole the managers try to work with you and they are very flexible with your schedules.  They allow coworkers to switch as long as they are properly trained to do the job
good,"This would be a fine place to work if it weren't for all the political garbage that goes on. The campus is gorgeous. I loved seeing the ducks everyday on my lunch break. I can't speak for any other departments, but the one I was in was composed of people who really seem to like lying and secrets and all those things women do to manipulate each other. It was too much for me. I can't work with people who aren't genuine. All that being said, the company offers great benefits, and if you're in a department that doesn't have those issues, I'm sure it would be a good place to work until you die."
good,I worked at Cracker Barrel Part time while I was in college. I liked the people I worked with they were friendly and the customers were nice as well. But I didn't get enough hours to consider myself as actually having a job. I'd get like 5 hours a week.
good,"Great place to grow and advance in career, may be subject to tough circumstances at times. Work culture can vary by unit and your typical work day is loaded with many tasks and challenges that will never allow you to cease to have something to do."
good,"Cracker Barrel has recently gone through some management changes that have made it slightly less enjoyable to work here, However, I have met some amazing people and have learned many different important lessons throughout my employment here. The managers are very determined to make their store successful while also managing to keep it fun by making fun little games during a busy night. It can get a bit stressful and overwhelming, but I think that is the same with most jobs!"
good,"a very easy job. only day that the business is closed is on Christmas day, so that means you work every holiday. not a lot of benefits offered. no long shifts."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I love my co-workers. They are the reason that i am still there. I love that they make sure everyone is okay and asked if they need help. Your co-workers make sure if you need help they will help and if you cant do it alone always ask for help.
good,"the typical day at work was a little boring but convenient. I learned how to have good appearance. Management was good, hardest part was standing for a long time. People were friendly."
good,"I worked at Cracker Barrel for five months while I was finishing school. There, I learned how to communicate more effectively with customers and mangement. Also I learned how to deal with stressful situations. Over all I enjoyed my time there and am grateful for what I learned."
good,The pay could be a lot better you have to get promoted in order to get good pay. You could learn something new everyday and plus the management I had was great they helped on a daily basis.
good,Cracker Barrel is a good place to work. You can make good money but you should expect to work hard for it. Would be a better work environment if you weren't expected to work every weekend all weekend.
good,"High-stress and fast-paced, but awards performance-based bonuses.  Minimum of 50 hours per week but can be up to or over 70 hours including holidays.  Nice corporate culture."
good,mu typical day at work is very busy on the weekends and very fast paced. the managers are very helpful in making sure i as an employee am learning everything i need to know. the hardest part of the job is keeping up when it gets busy and my mo st enjoyable is being productive.
good,"I worked at Cracker Barrel from 2007-2009. It was my first job and I started in my Junior year of high school. My first position was Busser/ Dishwasher. Months later I was able to move up to Prep Cook. I would always show up to work on time. I was taught how to properly clean dishes and what chemicals to use. The restaurant was a unique place to work. It was an old fashioned type of style food. The way the meals were cooked and was served, showed how the culture back in the old days prepped and ate. There really was not hard part about the job. The thing that I enjoyed most about the job was the employees I worked with, and the customers I was able to interact with."
good,The only reason I quit this job is because I was still in highscool and the thirty minute drive into work to only work 4 hours and drive back home was crazy. The job was paying for my gas to get there and back home.
good,I just worked here as a summer job. training is very thorough and most of the workers and managers were more than willing to help you. It is very high paced most the time.
good,"I liked how I could go in for a shift during busy season only having to work 4 hours. "
good,I enjoyed working here. It was a pretty typical restaurant job. There didn't seem to be much to achieve but they made you want to get your stars for the apron.
good,"A fast paced environment with many different ways to advance. Cracker Barrel is a pretty tough and strict company but as long as rules are followed everything is great ! From friendly homey surrounding to great people including the management, its a opportunity that hard to pass up."
good,This place was a great experience for my work history to not only build my management career but to bring others along and to further their careers as well.
good,"Cracker Barrel is a good place to work. Traffic flow varies from day to day. Being a restaurant, breakfast, lunch, and dinner hours are the most stressful times. The in-between hours give you time to accomplish side work and set up for the next peak period. Management desires each individual to succeed and will help when asked, specifically if it benefits the core operation of the business. The hardest part of the job is the stress level. Pressure is put on all to perform well and some find this hard to handle. The most enjoyable part of the job has been getting to know my store's regulars and seeing them every week. I specifically learned better time management and people skills. Organization and customer service are also key. This job is best suited for young people just entering the workforce or those who have retired but don't want to stop working completely just yet."
good,loved working here. always great to serve guest that come in just to have your services:).. loved serving guest met some great people this is where i learned how to embrace my customer service skills:)
good,"Good place to work overall.  Management is approachable and easy to talk to.  Breaks and lunches are regularly enforced, and meals are  discounted.  Full time and part time positions are available, though to get full time, you usually have to work in more than one department."
good,"Friendly environment and great training was given. A typical day consists of waiting tables, and running food out to guests in a timely fashion. Restaurant was meant to be well kept so you are constantly cleaning. Side work and rolling silverware to be expected. I learned how to handle restaurant work and service work."
good,Cracker Barrel was strong in performing as a whole more than individual efforts. I learned to multi-task and organize at different paces when it was demanded by volume of business.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Nothing bad can really be said about Cracker Barrel. The product quality is excellent.  The company infrastructure is very solid. It really was a great place to work
good,"Bad part of the job: Lack of leadership...not true priorities"
good,"Fun place to work, all the managers are great. You can be trained very efficiently.  But the hours are the only thing that sucks. You can ask for more hours but it doesn't stay the same."
good,"Good training to prepare you for your position, ability to work multiple positions if desired, semi flexible scheduling. Open door policy."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was teaching new people job skill and interacting with our guests. Management was sometimes transient.
good,"I loved my job at Cracker Barrel. Working as a waiter, it is actually the most money I have ever made working for a company. Management on the other hand was not that great."
good,"A harder place to serve, but it is rewarding. Unlike other serving jobs, CB has a cash stand, so you don't have to worry about cashing out your guests."
good,"The management team doesn't always get along. Hours each week differed, didn't always have the consistent scheduling. I enjoyed dealing with the busy hours because i could handle the pressure. I loved working with my coworkers and helping them improve on their job."
good,This job was a great one for me because it worked with me being a college student earning tips and it also allowed me to meet new people in a new area I had moved to. I like the fast pace restaurant environment and eating is a very important need so making their experience great was what I was all about! I would go back and work in a resturant industry because this job gave me such a good experience!
good,"On a typical day, business will be steady, sometimes the other cooks will work with you. It just depends on who's the head and who's the middle person. if everybody is placed right the day will go by smooth. Management does help out at times. The days when we have a good day, we would be cooking, working, and joking around, mainly just having a good time."
good,I enjoyed working here because the environment was friendly and safe. I didn't dread going to work. I loved the people I worked with and was glad that they treated me like a second family. The discounts are great and the training for pay raises is even better.
good,Cracker barrel was a pretty good place to work.. there were alot of opportunities to advance and you could cross train to other areas.. certain managers were awesome and others were not..
good,Cracker Barrel was a fun and productive place to work. I enjoy the great management and friendly co-workers. As being a server I enjoy giving and treating customers with care. The hardest part of that job was having so much on your plate and to make sure each and every customer receives the best service.
good,Cracker barrel is a very nice place to work. They make sure that all the employees get an equal opportunity to move up. It is a great job to work at.  I moved up very shortly after being there. After some experience being there it gets easier to handle customers with an appropriate response. A typical day at cracker barrel was always to stay busy and make sure your guests were taken care of.
good,Managers seemed to be trained to be very strict and cold to everyone. no employee appreciation. I learned to stay positive. I also didn't like how a manager had to walk you to the front door so you could go home and sometimes the manager would make you wait for 20-30 minutes just because he could. I would go the the managers office and they could see me but totally ignore me and keep talking or whatnot. Not even acknowledge that I'm standing there. Absurd.
good,"I loved it there. They worked with me on scheduling. I got paid vacation every year and the money was pretty consistent"
good,"Generally, all of the coworkers at Cracker Barrel are very nice and helpful, sometimes, like everyone else we will have bad days but in general it is a great place to work if you have flexible hours."
good,"A typical day at work would be greeting guess when seated in your section, putting orders in and running food as well if its slow rolling silverware before the end of your shift. We also have running side work.I learned it is always best to keep a smile on your face and take care of the customers needs. Management is really helpful they help motivate us as well they help us out where we may lack. My coworkers are great we keep the environment fun and peaceful as well the teamwork is good. I would say the hardest part of the job would be rolling silverware and doing side work because you feel like you are being underpaid. The most enjoyable part of the job is making money and having fun while you make your money."
good,"Everyone helps each other out. Everyone is friendly with one another. The Cracker Barrel Crew is my second family. WE all have our good day and our bad days. On bad days, customers would try to blame the server for their food not tasting good. Customers would not even leave tips at times."
good,"I made really good money while working, but they were constantly trying to have me put this job above school.  Some of the managers were not very nice sometimes and I had a hard first few years because of one in particular which was fired.  Overall, I made a lot of friends and I miss the place sometimes.  Good people, good food."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"A typical day at work is cashing people out, taking to go order, and cleaning up at the end of my shift. I have learned great people skills and phone etiquette. The management is very helpful whenever a question is asked and my co-workers are always so friendly. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the occasional rude customer. I love going to my job everyday because my co-workers and management feel like one big family."
good,"all in all cracker barrel is a good company to work for, they struggle with scheduling people the appropriate amount of hours and its difficult to move up in management. but its a fun work environment with great management and coworkers"
good,"Cracker Barrel was my very first job and loved it. Started there when I was 15 and did everything from host, cook, and serve."
good,"Can move up very quickly, good pay raises, and can transfer to any CB you want too! After training you are pretty much on your own. In retail there are a lot of things to keep track of. Not a position for someone who really doesn't want to work."
good,Cracker Barrel is a good a job. The company needs to give employees more work hours. The benefits are greats. The company could be more organize.
good,I really loved my job.....I guess I was very confident in my work....other wise that field of work wouldn't have been for me or anyone who does this type of work...it is based on your performance...
good,Was very good atmosphere with management I started out with. Very understanding and family atmosphere.loved to help customers and clear way for business to proceed. the hardest part was people who were not patient.
good,The most difficult and stressful are the peak hours because the line must be full time and food with good flavor and odor for customer
good,Pre-shift then go to the different bars. Tap out cocktails from the shift before then take drink orders then serve. Tip out bartender and bar back at the end of the day while cleaning up bar.
good,"It is a pretty standard server position. Decent hours, and the average tips weren't horrible. A good place to get your feet wet in the service industry."
good,I learned many things from this company as they taught me being a diligent person pays off by acknowledging your attentiveness. Sometimes it will get extremely busy but having positive vibes and helping your co-workers an turn the chaos into good and effective situations
good,"The Cracker Barrel Company it's self is awesome to work for. The income I made there was enough to support my family and I. Cracker Barrel is a fast past restaurant and I enjoyed that. Everyone becomes a family at Cracker Barrel including the guest. Personally the management can be very unfair and inconsiderate, however it has not always been that way. My first 7 years there however I had the pleasure to work for a very understanding boss, but after his departure from the company things changed, and not for the best in my eyes. Other than that the connections you make with people and the money is great!"
good,"I would go in ten minutes early and get something to eat with a co-worker then clock in and begin my shift.I did many areas within Cracker Barrel.I was a server,which was my main placement,hostess,which I did occasionally on busy nights along with serving,a Prep cook,which was when the other prep cooks couldn't keep up,and an S.A which I made sure that the food came out right so it wouldn't be returned.I loved doing the many different positions.The more I learned of the different positions,the more it insured my placement within the company."
good,As soon as you walk in you're busy. Its required that you roll the silverware before beginning. During the day you are rushed to achieve a goal hour. You encounter many kind guests at the restaurant also a few cruel or impatient ones. The managers are the best once you get to know them and they get to know you. The more open and happy you are with the guests the higher tips you get
good,There plenty of task to do at Cracker Barrel to keep yourself busy. Of course there are a lot of responsibilities as well. It was always important to greet guest and also to welcome them back.
good,I liked working here. They were understanding of home life and tried to accommodate as they could. Kathy Ratliff is awesome to work for.
good,"Cracker Barrel has high standards and loyal guest which allow it to continuously grow every year.  Typical ten hour days, five day work weeks.  Manager shifts can begin @ 5am or end @ 1am."
good,"the hardest part of this job is pleasing the company, not the people. Great manager in retail to work with, very personable and understands service from both the retail and consumer aspects. A typical day is usually ok as long as the store has its staff together and as long as you don't worry yourself to death about sales numbers."
good,"A typical day at work as a server was extremely fast paced and often times stressful. However, the employees and management were very well trained which helped things run more smoothly. However, the hardest part of the job was working long hours and working off a base wage of $2.13 an hour in addition to tips made throughout the shift. Often times mistakes were made by other servers, cooks, or even customers and were blamed on the efforts of the servers which in turn would effect our tips drastically but ""the customer is always right."" Customers simply cruel to servers treating you like a slave often times. I would work long shifts anywhere from 8-10 hours minimum without breaks. On a good day, a short dinner shift would begin at 5:30 until you were cut at 9 or so...only to be held up at work for another 2-3 hours completely demanding amounts of side work and silverware with no help from the hostesses. Often times if a cook or prep person went home early...you were making your own desserts and salads for the rest of the night without being properly compensated for doing so. After discussing alternative options for fair distribution of work among all employees, suggestions were often turned down or ignored. This company is reliable and has been around for years so don't get me wrong, you make plenty of money, and you'll always have a job if you work hard,  it just  all depends which days you work, and how generous your customers were about tips."
good,"The guest and coworkers are, for the most part, kind people. The only thing I do not like are the days I am scheduled for only 3 hours"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Typical work day is 11 hours and need to control a lot of areas including retail part of store. Management is average. Coworkers where fine. The hours where the hardest part of job and working extra shifts not compensated. Most enjoyable part of job was the variety of people and all the areas of the store you where exposed to.
good,"A typical day at work would be to help guest with their needs and to keep the store neat and stocked. Ive learned how to approach guest. The co-workers were hard working and kind. The hardest part of my job was making sure I attended everyone's need. However, I succeeded in helping everyone. The best part of the job was making sure everyone was satisfied!"
good,"Interaction with customers and coworkers, I learned customer appreciation and sales."
good,Great place to work. Loved meeting new people and being able to help them!
good,"Cracker Barrel was a fun place to work, however management was awful"
good,"Typically a day at the Decatur Cracker Barrel is pretty good.  As a server, you don't make minimum wage (if you have 4 stars, you make $5 an hour) but you don't have to participate in a tip-share like other restaurants do.  Every penny you make stays in your pocket.  Training is extensive and continual, and cross-training is possible (if you make sure to bug the managers and ETC enough to get you into those training classes.)  I enjoyed working with most of the people there, though sometimes the levels of professionalism are different for each.  The hardest part of the job is making sure the managers and back of the line (line cooks, prep cooks, etc) are communicating effectively with the wait staff so we know what is available and how soon to expect it to be finished.  The most enjoyable part is getting to work with other people in an easygoing and laid back (but not lazy) environment."
good,"•	Cleaned washed and stored pots, pans and dishes"
good,"Typical family style restaurant. Greet guests, accuracy of orders, quick delivery of food, responsible for pre-bus, refills, carry-out orders and assisting others as needed."
good,Overall good place to work. ability to advance in each position and work your way up in the company.
good,"There is no typical day at work, I have learned improvement on time management and communications. Management is lackluster yet very nice, at my store. Co-workers are a strong hit and miss. The hardest part of the job is the constent neediness from others. The most enjoyable is I get to cook and be around others."
good,Nights cleaning and prep-cook and dishwasher. I learn how to wash dishes and cook make salads. All the co-workers are cool and laid back and everyone was serious about their job we didn't play around. When I had a lot of tickets touching the floor and the other prep-cook call off and I got it done but it was super busy. When we have events we can join.
good,I love the fact that every six months you have to take test on your position to maintain and gain knowledge about the company.
good,"Okay company to work for. However, the management is not acceptable."
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel is fun! The diversity is great and learning about different cultures is awesome. Also, money can be made but hours always vary. One week you get decent hours and next week you cant pay for your bills. A lot of favoritism and managers seem to give those employees the best benefits and hours. Other than that, the job itself is easy and money isn't hard to make."
good,I worke at cracker barrel from 10/2000 to10/2004 it was a great experience got along with my co/worker very well managers was easy to talk when ever anybody had a problem open door sweet
good,"I worked here for 5 years, it was fun but the hours werent great."
good,"Okay, if you want some spending money, not for any serious work."
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel was my first time ever serving and I actually loved it. Work was pretty much all around fun for me in the kictchen but once we leave out the doors to the customers are game faces were on. Me and my roomate worked together so it was even better for me. Management all had their favorites, which I was one of them, but no special treatmemt was shown."
good,Serving is a rewarding but sometimes difficult job. It is inspiring when customers are well pleased and depreciating when they are not. The challenge is in discovering ways to improve the customers experience before their meal ends to ensure a pleasurable experience.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I learned so much from Cracker Barrel that I had not learned from previous concepts. They took the time to teach and give you room to grow. They are full of opportunity.
good,"I would come to work and sit customers at clean tables in the correct server order. I learned that keeping a cool head is a big deal. The managers changed twice in the short while I was there. There was always banging and yelling back in the kitchen, sometimes customers would end up leaving because they could hear co-workers bickering so loudly. The hardest part would be seeing happy customers come in and then unsatisfied customers leave. the enjoyable part would have been when the whole wait staff was happy with everybody. Which was rare..."
good,"overall the work place is wonderful and a person can advance their career in that place. My manager was very stern but understanding, i loved coming in and working with great people."
good,"In my instance our retail manager was amazing yet our GM was more operational and had little interaction with employees. Kitchen management rough and rude, can be expected with the heat in the kitchen. Unfortunately I did see many people come and go, some who left before they should have."
good,"Great place to work, especially if you need the proper training in the food service industry"
good,"A typical day at work was the set up for the guest that came and wanted to enjoy the food!"
good,"had fun when worked  there a little room for advancement opportunities, great hours"
good,"Greeting Customers, Seeking to their seating, making sure they are properly seated. Taking and recieving payments, with cash,debit,gift cards, as well as checks. Making sure their visit was taking care of and very respectful until they will join us again."
good,The day could start off slow or it fast and what I've learned was that anybody could move up with in a month two management could be up beat but a little harsh and honest the co-worker are very socalable and understanding till you mess with the money or they get too busy.    I could say the hardest part is moving up in the job thought the test and stuff
good,over all good company to work with less opportunities foa advancement. Job culture is ok so as management.
good,"take orders, setup food in the window, run food, take care of tables needs, prebus and sometimes bus tables"
good,"My typical day was usually pretty fast paced in the restaurant industry. It wasn't the most fun job but it's all about what you make of it. Over two years, I learned to make a repetitive job entertaining. I was the kind of person that lifted everyone's spirit and kept everyone focused on the tasks at hand. I worked busy days generally (weekends, holidays, etc.) and I was appreciated for the work I was doing. Like all jobs, my work had pleasurable employees, and people I couldn't really stand but I did my best to get along with everyone. The hardest part of the job was keeping optimistic in a field that never changes. The most enjoyable part was finding new and clever ways to make people smile and keep everyone in a good working mood. My management team contained a mixture of many different personalities. Some managers you could talk about anything with (hunting, fishing, football) and other managers cared only about meeting deadlines, labor limits, and getting as many bonuses as possible. (As they say, it's all about the mula.)"
good,I love the people and some of the mangers and work place was fun and always fast pase
good,My main job was a dishwasher/busser. I also unloaded retail truck and cleaned store graveyard shift. I learned how to use commercial dishwasher and how to properly clean areas. Hardest part of job was cleaning pots. Most enjoyable was cleaning store.
good,"Cracker Barrel is overall a good company to work for that provides proper training for its employees and tries to offer advancement opportunities although they are very highly limited. This is a good company to work for if you can be easily satisfied and are not looking to excel within a company for many years as the advancement opportunities are scarce. Cracker Barrel values the work it does and the quality it provides for its guests including ensuring top quality of food sanitation and preparation practices. Management teams work very closely with their employees to ensure proper guidance, training, and overall job satisfaction."
good,"I have been with company for 9 years it was suppose to be temporary for me. Now that I have been their for 9 plus years that has past. I got comfortable with waiting on tables, leaving my work at work.  I have been enjoying interacting with guest. Each guest that comes in are all different and you meet enteresting people. Hardest part my job would be that I care a lot about my job and wished more employees would to."
good,This place is full of fun and hard-working individuals that know how to be team players. 
good,"As much as I enjoy working at Cracker Barrel, I feel it is time that I move into a direction that will be more career oriented.  I have enjoyed taking a break for a few years to follow some passions that I feel would never been achieved while pursuing a career."
good,"Cracker Barrel has great benefits and is a pleasant place to work, however; if you have your own goals and dreams it can be very hard to manifest, unless your dream is to be a district manager of a multi billion country cooking restaurant=)"
good,"Fun place to work,  meet all kinds of different people who are traveling"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Everyday on the job is a new experience. Some days are busier than others. Ensuring great guest service is always a priority. When a guest orders their meal I must repeat it in order for it to be accurate. I love seeing guest enjoy their visit to Cracker Barrel.
good,"*A typical day at Cracker Barrel would be me jumping in total chaos most of the time, serving the customers, and cleaning the tables. Then at the end of every shift I had to roll one hundred silverware."
good,"A typical workday would consist of greeting and caring for guest needs, while maintaining responsabilities and proceedures in the back of house area. i have learned how to prioritize myself so that i do not get behind and how to work as a team to accomplish the goal. management is escecially willing to help in any way they can. co workers work together as a team. the hardest part of the is staying on task and balancing responsabilities between guests and back of house. the best part of the job is satisfaction of hard work and the monetary rewards it brings."
good,"I enjoyed meeting all of the people who came in who were traveling. I got to hear lots of different stories and backgrounds from all over the country. I got along well with most of the staff, but there are always those who are threatened by someone who wants to work and is driven by perfection. "
good,"I learned much more about life working at cracker Barrel. I've learned about how Cracker Barrel is run and I really enjoyed the managers,they knew how to manage a shift.They cared about their employees and they took what their employees would that would make the store run smoothly through each shift.I build my communication skills, and improved my work ethic."
good,I enjoyed working there. . I would welcome another opportunity to work there.
good,Employee were nice people.Magament could stand some training on how to treat all staff equal and fair.
good,"Cracker Barrel is a good company, that tries to take care of it's employees and has a clear, direct business plan and goes to great lengths to keep their vision of being the best in the business. But like every other restaurant in the business, their need always trumps your personal availability."
good,Rather old school in thought but not completely fair in regulations or rules involving non traditional lifestyles. To afraid to enforce policy if there might be a legal question or challenge to those that fit the profile. Easier to overlook it.
good,"I have worked at Cracker Barrel for over three years and I have to say it's decent money especially while working as a student. It can be very hectic during the weekends, but the money is worth it."
good,I loved the company overall. The management needed improvement .
good,the coworkers were great they were awsome to me i loved them some of the mangers were great too you have to have alot of paients for that job
good,"Though I have only worked for CB for several months, I have experience overwhelmingly positive things at this company. With many corporate organizations, it is difficult to feel appreciated and useful. However, CB has implemented several operating systems that assist managers and the company in helping employees feel valued and supported. To date, the main thing I have found is to treat the managers with respect and put forth good work and you will be rewarded."
good,Had a hard time being a single parent with two kids. But the people were great had to watch out for other servers taking money off of tables but I guess that is anywhere you work and wait tables
good,"A typical work week was fifty hours. Our truck came on a certain day at five a.m. and I was there with usually one other employee to unload the truck and work it onto the sales floor. Other days involved managing the cashiers, my retail staff and usually helping on the restaurant side as needed."
good,a good job with plenty of advancements for hard workers
good,"This was a fun place to work, and develop my people skills. No day was the same. I had the ability to train servers with my abilities and see them grow. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with many different personalities and people."
good,"I learned to be the best worker I could possibly be no matter the circumstances, how to deal with all sorts or people, and strive for excellence with a perfect smile no matter the circumstances."
good,This is a place where servers can earn experience waiting tables in a fairly relaxed environment with little stress. Do not expect a significant income from this job as the menu pricing is on the low side which will reflect in your tips.
good,-high stress
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,At Cracker Barrel I had to roll 100 pieces of silverware and clean all my stations before i could leave. I always made sure my customers were happy and taken care of. My manager was very funny and outgoing. I learned here how to work very good with others and how exactly to take care of my customers and make them feel welcome.
good,I greet our guest and assist them with there shoping.
good,Usually worked 8 hours and I learned how to deal with people from all different backgrounds. I learned situation management by dealing with upset guests. Management was usually very involved in making sure the shift ran smoothly. Co workers were great to work with and helpled each other. The hardest part of the job was dealing with people that didn't want to be happy for anything. The most enjoyable part of the job was definatley the guests.
good,"Meet many new people, was able to help out many guest serve them with a smile on my face. Staff was brilliant."
good,"Cracker Barrel Old Country Store is a company that is focused on the efficient and effective development of its workforce. Cracker Barrel provides the customer with friendly and improved upon service standards within a casual dining environment. The environment might occasionally or regularly be found to be fast-paced depending upon the location. Management has tended to deal very well with the scheduling of its employees according to the fluctuations of the customers from within the structure and the layout of the restaurant. The variation in service is consistently seen to be any where in between ""very welcoming"" to ""prompt and friendly"". This type of service is achieved while providing quality home-cooking style products in an atmosphere that most would find more than welcoming."
good,Cracker Barrel is a nice place to work while in school. They offer their employees to make a flexiable schedule. But management needs to be improved in many areas but over all a easy place to work.
good,Good work environment nice managers and very nice coworkers . The experience is very good as well they teach you a lot all in one company I learned how to sell and how to talk to guests the proper way to try and get our sales goals met and also I learned how to be a host .I also did cash . Overall the job experience was very good .
good,"Doesn’t respect the needs of employees and doesn’t praise good performance ."
good,Management could have been better and the pay could have too but overall a fun and great experience. helped me learn many new skills and how to handle situations well.
good,Did not receive enough payment for the work I put in. Tips were always terrible and I was one of their top performing waitresses. Management was mostly nice and good to get along with.
good,"Good people, but hard to get adjusted to technology and processes  Friendly environment and fast paced training process no hesitation to get you on the floor"
good,Working for Cracker Barrel is a bit boring until people start coming in large groups. You will spend all but fifteen minutes of your shift standing so buy a good pair of shoes.
good,"Typical shift is handling the Cash Register, Stocking Products, Helping Guest in the Store, Setting up Displays,Filling Food Wall and Selling, Selling and more Selling!!"
good,I love working for cracker barrel it has flexible hours and they work well as a team. We have really great regular guests who really care about us and it makes me happy to come to work
good,"Good company to work for with solid opportunities to for advancement "
good,"People promise no longer applies to management. Not enough help. Cut backs in labor eroded management experience over time. Food is great, processes would work if management could manage."
good,"My current job is like organized chaos.  We do the same functions every day, but do to the variety of people that we come across daily, no two situations are ever the same.  In a typical day, you may wear many hats or perform multiple job functions in order to keep production going and to meet hourly goals.  It is a stressful position, but it can be extremely satisfying."
good,Working for Cracker Barrel was a easy and enjoyable job. They worked with my schedule and gave me plenty of hours. The managers where very friendly and so was the rest of the staff.
good,Good company that does have some values but can be demanding especially the holiday season. They give you clear training but success is very store dependent
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,My time at cracker was good experience. They are a family friendly company a great job for someone who is looking for a first job. I was a great employee whi completed my task on a day to day basis.
good,Cracker Barrel is a very warm and inviting place to be and work at. the management there is outstanding as well as their employees. customers who came in were polite and easy to talk to.
good,needs to be a little better with scheduling. The hours are sporadic 35+ one week and maybe 20 the next. There is no consistency in the hours. It is not very stable when it comes to scheduling. I would like to see more consistency and stability in the hours
good,Management I efficient and understanding. All management and employees dedicated to ensure everyone succeeds and customers are happy and satisfied with all service.
good,"a lot of work, pressure to sale. employees dont want to work, retail manager was amazing, sweet, caring and very understanding. but managers from restaurant were always mean and yelling no matter how hard you worked"
good,Great place to work for someone looking to become a server and to build experience in the field. Their rules are easy to follow and you practice their policies with almost every shift. The pay may not be as good as a restaurant that has other menu choices but it is a great place to start.
good,Cracker Barrel provided an environment that was easy to learn in.  My managers were always very understanding and helped me if I needed any help at all.
good,Hardest part of the job was having to do other people's jobs but it's part of it.  I learned how to handle big parties and take multiple orders. Most enjoyable was the costumers.  They made the shift great!
good,My experience wasn’t to well I wasn’t scheduled enough hours even after asking and telling them multiple times to schedule me more they would only schedule 1-2 days a week knowing I can only work part time because I have a 7 month old child and I was serving so I only made 3$ an hour plus tips and $50 was the most I’d make on a good night . After your shifts over you have to do way to much things before u can leave and cash out your cash register tips and clock out it wasn’t worth the money at all!
good,"Loved the work environment, however some of the other associates were not so pleasant."
good,"Good management and good hours. Flexibility with schedule, and vacation time. There is room to move up in company. The company has a great reputation and great staff."
good,I enjoy working here for the most part. The team is nice . we all get along pretty well and make sure things het done. I'd say the money is decent for a college kid or someone with little bills.
good,I learned to work under stress when we had lots of customers and how to handle a wait time/list. Overall I liked working there but needed more hours and pay.
good,Cracker Barrel has a motto. “Pleasing people”. It’s a great motto to have and works to remind you to make the customer feel like there at home. People travel across the state and when they see a Cracker Barrel they think of comfort. It’s a great place to work to build your work morels and ethic.
good,"One of the easier jobs I've had in the food industry. Very fast paced type of work, never a dull moment. The other workers there provided a fun time while still maintaining the work ethic."
good,As I began to work there I was happy with my job and hours. Then there were some times that got me stressed and annoyed. But I think that the managers not all but some could use some help with how to talk to employees and not make them feel like they can’t do their job. In the end I intend to get a different job because I don’t think it’s the right job for me and I can’t deal with losing hours because of it becoming the slow season.
good,"Overall I really love the company. I was with them for a while before I became a manager. They have always been a really flexible company to work for. I was continuously able to transfer stores during school and during break. The management position pays really great but the work/life balance you have to trade for this position is horrible. Your 10 hour shifts are just suggestion times. The average manager spends 13+  hours per day. Working sometimes 6 days a week. There are always conference calls you have to be on even during days off, and the labor hours you are given are horrible. As a manager you are expected to cut hours like crazy and take over their position to save money. They expect you to devote your life to your store, and a lot do. I personally could not force myself to do that so I left. A lot of respect for those who can stick with it!"
good,"Good place to work they are like family, Easy to catch on to they are a fast paced enviroment i enjoy working for them. Just wish they gave more hours and paid a little more."
good,Good for a second job. Very busy..I worked dish and sometimes prep. Management good for the most part. Waitress and Waiters were good people overall. Sometimes hectic
good,"its fine but a lot of work"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,There are too many servers on a shift which makes your station smaller less tables less tips. Majority of the staff are willing to help their peers with no problem. Training program there is excellent. General Manager is also excellent. Overall if there were more days to work and less servers it would be one of the best companies to work for.
good,Pretty good place to work. They schedule to many people so that results in only a few tables a piece. It was hard toake good money when that happened.
good,"Work was simple yet kept you on your feet and was enjoyable for the most part."
good,"I've learned on how to get customer satisfaction, work in a fast paced environment and working as a unit when the rush hour happens. Management was good when pertaining to most of the managers. They were helping and understanding but could be difficult at times."
good,"It’s a really good job, I wish I didn’t leave honestly, some days were bad but you’ll have that everywhere, overall wasn’t a bad place to work for, I would go back"
good,Large team of management and employees working as a big family orchestrated within in a fast pace and closed space environment. Always surrounded by the smell of food.
good,"They are, overall, a good company to work for. You can make great tips if you are friendly,  attentive,  and follow the steps of service that they teach you."
good,As a host your job is simple just don't cross the management team and some tend to be rude and cruel with how things are handled.  Otherwise it's a decent but fast passed environment.
good,Most people are very easy to get along with. Fun to work. Hours are not guaranteed. Might work 4 hours one week and 50 the next. Insurance wasn't very good. High Management Turnover.
good,Great benefits and great pay! Work all holidays so u miss out of lots of family stuff! They are closed Christmas so that’s a plus!  The bonus program is nice as well.
good,"Good place to work the night maintenance position should pay better for the amount of work you do without any help "
good,"Really a good job, people are amazing, management sucks, you get paid 2 dollars a hour for loads of side work that's really the only downside plus you have to role silverware after every shift"
good,"There was one bad manager there,he wrote people up for everything small,where other managers there wouldn't.Every other manager was awesome(5 all together)."
good,Its a fast pace work place. Always busy. Good tips. Great managers. Only part time unless you are management. You get a discount after 30 days. Good pay.
good,"I do recommend working there as a server. The tips are very good on the weekends mostly is where you'll make your money. The sidework at the end of the day is the most stressful part, as it will take you an hour or two to get out at the end of the day. Cooking and Prep chef are good positions with a good pay. I don't believe the dishwashers get paid enough for the load of dishes they have to take care of. You'll meet different kinds of people, but overall everyone is accepting and willing to help you if you are new. My managers have been great and helpful in every way."
good,"i really like the environment there, the people are nice, the guests are usually friendly, the coworkers do their job well, it is organized and pretty efficient while not being to difficult or stressful"
good,Working for cracker barrel has been a great help in my development as an employee and a person. There is an open door policy and you can transfer to pretty much any cracker barrel anywhere any time.
good,I love working here and getting to meet people from all over the world. The only negative things is they do not let you out on time. If you are scheduled until 2:30 you will probably not be off until 3:30. They cut you off the floor at 2:30 but then give you about 30 minutes of side work to do plus the 100 to 200 silverware you have to roll. They do on the other hand let you cross train in other areas which is nice.
good,"Management wasn’t the best, co workers don’t care about job, a lot of vulgar language through the work area, and a lot of people rely on others to do their work"
good,You can make great money at Cracker Barrel. Things get stressful on weekends or holidays cause of the amount of people who love Cracker Barrel. But other than that it can be a fun work place with managers who care about you
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Could be a great place to work. Good management. Very relaxed on rules and that creates problems. To many minors to cater to. But there is room to advance your career and they like to promote from within. I’ve worked at other Cracker Barrel’s that run smoother than my current store though. Definitely keep to many servers on the floor so money isn’t as good as it should be   Cracker Barrel is one of the only restaurants I’ve worked at that offers insurance and benefits
good,I loved working at church while going to school. They were flexible with me and very understanding. The management had its ups and downs but generally they were pretty good.
good,Normally very busy.  Working cash register is very rewarding for me.  It gives me an opportunity to personally interact with guests I personally serve. The hardest part of the job is standing for 4 1/2 to 5 hours without being allowed to take a break.
good,"Food takes FOREVER to get made. Ticket times were about 1 hour before i left and have only gotten worse, even if they are slow. But overall the other workers are pretty welcoming (speaking as if I were back in 2017 when I left)"
good,"The retail has a lot of drama, mostly perpetuated by the nosy manager. If you can ignore that the work is very simple and the pay is fair. They are understanding of college schedules and will try to work with your class schedule. However there is no such thing as full time and you will be sent home often during slow season, which cuts into your pay. Overall a good workplace, but try for restaurant side if at all possible,"
good,Great training program.Can gain a lot of great experience as a server and overall customer service skills. 50 percent off food benefits. Lots of chances for advancement
good,"Offers the best training I have seen from an employer ever! Passionate company that was founded on country cooking and down home hospitality!  It is all about the guests and giving great guest service!  If you are willing to put in the work, it will pay off!"
good,"Flexible schedules, reasonable pay, and a fast paced environment with a demanding workload make Cracker Barrel a stressful but enjoyable place to work."
good,"I worked here as a hostess. Although the environment , some managers, and most of my co-workers were great, I would only work 3 days a week with less than 5 hours a day. "
good,Cracker Barrel is a changing and growing company. Its a good opportunity to be involved in new initiatives and help the company stay one of the best restaurant companies.
good,"I likes the job a lot , paid well, easy job fast paced. Just management needs work , poor training, other than that good job. I’d just pick a different location rather than Middletown"
good,It is a very fast paced environment. Can make good money if willing to work. Flexible work hours. Work with people who are full of energy and fun loving.
good,Company works with you on your hours. Great place to meet guests from all over the country. Great place for making friends.  A great place for a people person.
good,"A typical day at work was always business. "
good,It was a nice laid back place to work until it got busy. Management didn’t communicate well so a lot of mixups. Lots of finger pointing between the employees and also a lot of sexual contact
good,They have a great training program. They are consistent with recipes and policies through the the restaurant.  Management is knowledgeable  with policies and maintain a structured  environment.
good,"Even though I was seasonal, I gained a ton of experience working here. This place will practically force you to conversate with guests. If you’re not talking to a guest at the register, you go onto the sales floor, get one in front of you and try to sell something. Most of the time, the guests are simply waiting for their table to be called, so I often felt like a bother. Thanksgiving is this place’s busiest day so you WILL end up working that day. You multitask a lot here, ringing up goods, talking to guests, restocking, answering the phone, so if you apply for other retail gigs, this will look great on your resume."
good,"It was my first job, and they made it extremely comfortable and fun working environment. You may not have always been emotionally ready for a rush period, though you knew when it was coming, but you always had a great team to support you. We were almost always on top of any situation thrown at us."
good,the time I worked their was fun but very stressful you could not say what was on your mind and if you did you got into trouble for it I did the job I was paid to do the lack of teaching was their mistake
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I liked working there and loved the diversity.u don’t no people unless u have a encounter with them despite how the news and politics try to put the minority down.
good,The number one restaurant corporation in the united states what more can be said. This is an awesome company to work for and I am very appreciative of the opportunity to grow with them.
good,"This particular location has great mangement (all levels) and supervisors. Most of the training staff are very paitent and knowledgeable and almost everyone is willing to help you be more efficient without giving you the feeling of being rushed or overwhelmed. If you truly try, you're going to do great. You give effort, and you will definitely see what kind of great co-workers you'll be working alongside with in ALL departments. The hardest part fo the job is getting hours during slow periods of the year and fortunately, they do not last long. Schedules are very flexible as well."
good,"In the restaurant industry there is no ""typical"" day at work. But if I had to describe something close to, it would consist of trying to meet and exceed customer's expectations regarding their dinning experience. I've learned a lot from working at Cracker Barrel. For instance, I'm now better suited to deal with customer complaints. This type of customer service can be applied to all professions. The culture at Cracker Barrel is most welcoming and enjoyable. I've met many people and have made lifelong friendships. The hardest part of the job is dealing with dissatisfied guests and trying to figure out a way to correct or improve their situation. The best part of the job is that you get to create great friendships with awesome people."
good,Our manager cut our hours if our sales were low. Retail was fun but make sure to keep sales high. We always were good weekends and on tuesdays. i enjoyed the job and my coworkers overall
good,My work day is very fast paced. I normally work 6-8 hours depending on the day. I am the retail merchandise handler which means I deal with all the merchandise in the stock room. I also assist guest in the retail store as they shop. I also set our PPC and receive our retail truck every Tuesday as well as process it and set themes within the store. On top of being a merchandise handler I am also one of our skill trainers so i also help train the new employees on cash and the retail floor. The position I have is very fast paced because of the amount of merchandise I need to get out during non-peak hours so that the store will be ready for peak hours.
good,"Although Cracker Barrel was unorganized most of the time, the people you work with and the customers you help makes working there very enjoyable. I was only scheduled to work on sundays from 4-8 usually and we were always over staffed which made it hard for me to get the hours that I wanted and needed."
good,"Fast paced, hectic day every day. Tips though aren't steady so if you are the one that brings home the income, winter months area struggle. The summer months make up for it."
good,I liked working at Cracker Barrel ! But had to move & I just worked at Bob Evans Restaurant! I have worked 2 jobs till my Last Child left home! I worked Bob Evans when I moved too !!
good,"I feel I was treated well by management and most of my co-workers. If an employee treated me badly my manager would go to bat for me, which I really appreciated. They did well at creating a non-hostile work environment."
good,Cracker Barrel is a good restaurant to work at once you get accustomed to the way of doing things and the menu. It is a fast-paced job that keeps you on your feet. Management is good at promoting those who work for it and deserve it and giving breaks to those who need it. I learned how to move quickly with a purpose. The hardest part of the job is remembering the menu; there are so many items and so many possible combinations and substitutions that it is hard to get it right at first without help. Asking for help is a big part about the job because it can get overwhelming trying to do everything on your own.
good,A great place to start if u have never had a job before. Management is ok but can get a bit out of hand. The discounts in the store as an employee are worth it.
good,Cracker Barrel is not for the faint of heart. I have learned that old people suck at tipping and most of them are rude. With any job there are good days and bad days. You make good friends and family while you are there. I just realized customer service is not for me. A typical day at work includes a hoard of people at the door and $100 in your pocket at the end of a shift if you did well. The hardest part of the job is trying to get everything done in a calm manner because you have so many people to serve and so much money to make. The most enjoyable part of the job is leaving. Forever.
good,"Poor General Manager, good managers. Kind of a bad atomsphere but keep to yourself and everything should be fine. Tips are okay on busy days but newcomers beware bad tables."
good,"Overall I liked working at cracker barrel for the people I worked with. Working as a server, my pay check depended on tips. Restaurant was not always busy but has its busy times of the week."
good,I enjoyed working at Cracker Barrel meet different people everyday.  Managers was OK work environment  was OK salary wasn't the best but you get paid every week. That's a plus in my book.  Never had a vacation but transportation got bad on me. But over all a nice place to work
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Cracker Barrel for the most part. Mostly because of the people I get to work with. However, the management isn't that great and that's an integral part of keeping the system striving. Some managers are fantastic, others aren't."
good,"It is a fun environment. I do meet rude guests, but you just need to smile and keep going. It is stressful at times. The restaurant gets busy and sometimes you are not sure what to do. At the end of the night, you have money in your pocket."
good,This job is hard but it can be rewarding as long as you take the time to do your part professionally.  I would defiantly recommend as something to start out your life but not the final part of your life.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Very well structured company. Very good support staff. Middle management micro managed the GM's way too much. So many meetings and conference calls that you couldn't run your business.
good,The grill line can be brutal both in the physical work itself and dealing with other stressed out employees. Breaks are seldom given unless working a double shift in the day.
good,"A typical day at work was slow paced and relaxed, unless you worked on Sunday. Managment was very kind and considerate of other people. The hardast parts of working here was my pay was less than $5 an hour and I only worked 4 hours a day, plus you couldnt socialize with customers you knew personally, which is a bit unfair."
good,I loved working for cracker barrel.It was an outstanding opportunity.The time i was working there i i enjoyed every moment of it.I wish the whole staff at Cracker Barrel nothing but the best.
good,Love the job it was the hours and I need to spend more time with my family. The people are friendly and helpful. Caring staff and they are willing to work with you on what ever you need help with
good,"Great opportunity for someone with an open schedule. You do have advancement opportunities. They offer raises on your performance and length of employment but you have to do testing on your job description. Schedule changes, random hours, start pay is $9 / hr for retail but they have other positions for dishwasher/ host/ server and pay is different"
good,Great place to work. Very busy place. They make great food but the management wasnt really good. I worked there for a good bit but still was treated like i first was hired.
good,Cracker Barrel is a super fast paced working environment you have to multitask and be ready for very busy and hectic working hours this job is not for everyone
good,going to school and being a full time student is very stressful and needing money is another stressful attribute and Cracker Barrel was great in working wiht my school schedule to accomidate.
good,"I loved working there but I had to finish school and I couldn’t do that while working long nights, I would still work there if I could have worked shorter days so I could catch up on school work, now that I am graduated I would love to start working again"
good,"I had a lot of fun working there but a lot of bad days, coworkers were rude when i was in the hospital because i had to call of a shift due to emergency health. But other than that it was awesome, i loved the people in the kitchen, and also had some awesome friends that loved me out in the retail store, the customers are great, and it’s just an all around good vibe when working at Cracker Barrel!"
good,well its fast paced and you never stop because if you do you would get behind  i learned self love is important and to always treat people with kindness management stay busy so you have to stay focused at all times the hardest art of the job is closing and getting finished its alot but nothing i cant handle the best art of the job is when others are kind lots of different opportunities nice break rom and a soda machine lots of garbage and boxes a long day can end in 15 hrs we have to bus tables pull bus tubs rack 6 kinds different glasses do lots of silverware keep stuff of floors brooms dustpans run al plastics scrub ots take labels off  up up all pots and plastic hang utensils
good,I’ve worked at various locations which all had their own experiences. None of them were alike in any way. I hated the uniform and the lack of unique expresssion. This is a good starter job. The management and location definitely set the tone for how your experience will go.
good,"they were nice and they made sure you were taken care of, i didnt make much money where i was located because we had too many people on the floor, other than that, its a good business to work for"
good,It’s a fun place to work at and the workers are friendly and managers are fun to talk to. It’s also a very competitive job. Weekends are the days where they are fast paced.
good,"I enjoy working here except for the long hours for managers and being required to work every holiday except Christmas. The employees are great, the guests are friendly, and the Retail District Manager is exceptional!"
good,I love working at Cracker Barrel and Substitute teaching. Would like to work more often part-time. No available hours af Cracker Barrel. Enjoy assisting guests and explaining the use of various products. Introducing new foods and apparel.
good,"I enjoy my job at Cracker Barrel. It is very friendly,team oriented, fast paced, flexible schedule allows for family time. The pay is comparable to other restaurants in our area, with discounts on meals and merchandise.  The opportunity for advancement is there for those who seek it."
good,"Popular, almost always busy. Its hard to walk away with less than 80 dollars in pocket. Depending on the day or night shift of course. They treat you like you may actually be human under that apron."
good,It was an interesting place to work. I was able to work and attend college. I many and had the opportunity to work with many people of varied backgrounds.
good,"It was fast-paced and stressful, you had to be aware of multiple things at the same time; guest orders, food orders, server experience, etc. The hardest part was being understaffed on busy periods of time, everyone had to cover for multiple positions. The staff was the best part, we were a family looking out for each other both in and outside of work. Management was approachable and cared about concerns."
good,Easy in and great team work fast paced and goes by quickly.quality work and great pay with tips. I learned teamwork values and how easy it makes your shift.
good,"Serving at Cracker Barrel was a fast-paced environment that consisted of making guests happy and doing your job swiftly but with elegance. If you enjoy a laid back but sometimes demanding job, you can't go wrong with Cracker Barrel."
good,The managers a very understand and will work with your schedules and appreciate incentive. On very busy days it will test you and your team but it can be very rewarding in the long run.
good,"For a waitress job I would recommend. The company itself takes care of its employees. And has  a great advancement program based on prefromance, The discounts are great"
good,"Was fast paced at frist but once learned not to stressful"
good,The only thing I don’t like is the room for hours. I barely scrape by on how much I get from there to pay my bills and get the items I need with no room to save money to get myself a car.
good,"Went in at 5:30, sometimes didn't leave until three or four in the afternoon. The work was alright I suppose; pretty straightforward but can be cut-throat at times as people are trying to make their production and you just happen to be in their way."
good,"It was a good experience for being my first job. I made a lot of friends along the way that I still stay in contact with up until this day. I learned the most important thing they teach; pleasing people. The staff and management was like family to me, yes there were some people I had a hard time getting along with but that comes with the restaurant business. I can say I am forever a part of the family."
good,I think it’s a great place to get your foot in the door when starting a serving position. It teaches you the basics of what you need to do and how you need to do. It’s a just an overall great experience
good,"Cracker Barrel Old Country Store is a great company to work for as an entry level work place, but if you want to go further you will have to move beyond this company which is unfortunate."
good,You have to be on your game to be able to deal with the variety of guests. Customer service is a must. I loved the people that I worked with. The team was like a second family to me.
good,"As with any retail job, the experience comes down to managerial staff and customers. Luckily, my time at Cracker Barrel had me work with friendly staff, and mostly friendly customers. Hours are flexible, but you can be called to work at a moment's notice. The company has their own online scheduling system which makes things very easy though. The pay rates are low but fair for the work you are doing."
good,"As a general work environment very cooperative and friendly, however the hours took a toll on my health and despite being interviewed and hired as full time I never got the full 40 hours. Not liveable pay."
good,"A great place to work. Slower paced than most restaurant chains. Not as many standards as other chains, but still very efficient. Many opportunities for advancement."
good,"I love working at Cracker Barrel, but I dislike their minor policy. I only get to work a maximum of 4 hours and 45 minutes each day I work. But everyone is like a big family; there’s bad days and good days, but I believe Cracker Barrel is a great place to work. But again, if you’re a minor you’ll have to accept that they won’t let you work over 5 hours no matter what."
good,Favorite part with Cracker Barrel is making customers feeling welcome and happy when arriving and leaving. Making sure that they were satisfied with what they got.
good,Nice place to work; the management and staff are friendly. Ample amounts of computer training to help learn position duties and to advance if desired.
good,"I worked in the country store part of Cracker Barrel.  I enjoyed helping the customers with their purchases and wrapping gifts as needed. "
good,"great management very serious and want things done."
good,"Really enjoy working there, all of the team members are very friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers as is any customer service based job. However, they are also what makes the job worth it. Cracker Barrel tries really hard to create a family atmosphere for the guests but it integrates into the work culture in a sense your co-workers become your family."
good,"Fast paced, Hard to face great company awful employees and managers somewhat no one u can trust employee wise but loved my time while I was there I would go back but only to retail not serving !!!!"
good,Good company to work for.  I was appreciative of the time they spent to make sure you had the tools necessary to do your job well.  Very family oriented.
good,"Good place to work, if you have good management. People are friendly and very helpful around the work place. Did not take me long to learn everything I needed to know to perform my job well."
good,"Cracker Barrel taught me how to be an excellent server and how to provide the best restaurant experience I could possibly deliver. I was definitely overworked there, but the benefits you receive are excellent. You have to work weekends and holidays all the time, which can take away valuable time from family. However, you are rarely worked overtime. They have a management training program for those interested in career advancements. Everything is extremely fast-paced, and still to this day, it is unlike any other restaurant I have worked for, but if you can survive there, you can thrive anywhere."
good,"Cracker Barrel met most of my expectations when it came to a part-time job. The work environment, while sometimes chaotic, was relatively easy going. They matched my hourly wages from my previous job which meant I didn't suffer a pay cut. The management was fairly understanding when it came to personal issues. Co-workers did their fair share of work, and helped with other things when asked."
good,Pay and people are great . overall best place ive worked ! Down to earth & homey environment. The cracker barrel store invites people in with a smile !
good,"I enjoy this job more than I thought I would.  I stand the entire time and at the end of my shift my back hurts, but I generally leave feeling good with myself.  The managers work right along-side the staff, just as hard, and longer hours.  They lead by example, and encourage staff to earn their ""stars"", become trainers, leaders and managers.  It isn't perfect and there is stress, but for some reason we keep plugging along."
good,"Washing dishes with a 3 man team , work at your own pace , Operating dishwashers and keep up with the dishes which are slow paced , Maintaining a clean workplace"
good,"Overall a good place to work, a different animal than most restaurants, but well worth the time. Truly a home away from home for those who will work hard."
good,"For restaurant jobs, this is the best. The pay is great compared to all the others and the staff is easy to work with so long as you are a good worker. The training system they have in place is well organized and precise. The managers are understanding and helpful. If you work hard and are nice to people, show up on time and dont call in a lot you will go far here and be able to get raises quickly. Take the online classes they have in the back room as often as they will allow you, dont put them off or you are putting yourself off from a raise. If you are struggling with one of the online classes, ask someone for help, its worth it. You get raises in .25 increments, so you can go from say 10.00 an hour to 11-11.25 fairly quickly if you just do them. The managers will offer them to you often if you are a great employee they want to help you. They have a star system, from rising star to 4 star, you get promoted and a raise with each advancement/class. Ive worked other restaurants and this truly was the best. As with most all other restaurants, its hard to get full time with benefits, but they will give you hours right up under 40 a week, just not 40 or over. But- if you want to stay there for years, they will eventually hire you on full time permanent, some people there had been there for years and were full time, got benefits"
good,"good scheduling around school and sports"
good,"I greatly enjoyed the Cracker Barrel culture.  I learned a great deal regarding food service and the restaurant industry.  I feel that when I started with the company it was employee focused, however that focus changed once the original founders passed away."
good,I enjoyed working here. I got along well with the Managers and staff. Managers where fair. Hardest part of the job was being able to hire reliable staff.
good,"Cracker barrel is a great restaurant, great management and great customer service. I left due to the fact because I was promised to be crossed trained and given more hours but none of that occurred. I work for 2-3 days a week, 4 hrs per day. I asked to get more hours, my manager said he see what he could do. This happened for a while till I found out they were still hiring dishwashers and there was enough hours to go around."
good,I worked at the very worst cracker barrel so my review isn't going to be for all crack barrels. Mine was full of very rude people who would try to get you fired. Tried to get health benefits and when i asked they cut my hours so I didn't qualify. Management was poor and not on top of it.
good,Great work place for a first job! in detail training. a very friendly place to work. fast pace too. everyone is generally friendly and there are alot of rules to abide by.  learned how to serve and work as a team
good,"Stocking food "
good,Fun place to work and learn the ins and out of the restaurant business. This location is a main location for training new managers so you will have MITs and new management on a regular basis.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"If you don't mind working hard, not seeing your family on the holidays. This is the job for you. They pay well, benefits are good, I enjoyed the family feeling of working their. I would go back if they would take me back. The rehire policy is a bit extreme."
good,"I actually worked from 2004 until 2014. I worked very hard at caring for the guest and won employee of the year in 2009.  "
good,"Cracker Barrel, my first job, was at first a stressful  for me! I wasn't used to the quick pace and multi-tasking. After leaving, i served at a different restaurant, all the things i learned at Cracker Barrel really helped me get in the swing of serving in general! It was a great first job experience!"
good,"fast moving environment, collaborative team work from all departments. Helpful management , hardest part of the job is moving swiftly through a packed kitchen."
good,I  made some really good friends here that made work fun. It is a stressful environment as it is fast paced and you have to work as efficient as possible. hours can go from short to long depending on how busy the business gets. Over all it is a good part time job. I do not recommend as a full time job because working on your feet five plus hours can be very hard on you feet and back.
good,"A typical day as a server started off with greeting guests and taking their orders. I learned how to memorize things quickly, how to turn tables fast, how to make the guests as happy as possible. I had a good manager.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with people who thought that they were better than me just because they had a better paying job. Another hard part of the job is dealing with people who flat out don't care about you and what you do or what you have to deal with on a daily basis at work. The most enjoyable part of the job was being surrounded by good co-workers who were overall good people."
good,"I loved my job, but you have to have a certain state of mind in order to be able to accommodate yourself to this kind of work.  It is fast paced, always happy and friendly, and you better be ready to walk fast!"
good,"I loved working for Crackel barrel, I made many friends not only with co-workers but also the guest. I wish I I didn't have to quit but I moved. I learned how to make money fast and have fun while doing so. The food was good old country cooking, which is servers would he 25% off! One thing I didn't like about crackle barrel is you had to ask for jelly because guest would steal them. It took up a lot of time trying to find a manger and then having to go to the office to get the jelly. Sometimes it would take up to 10 mins just for jelly. But I would still recommend Crackel barrel to a friend."
good,The only thing i can say about Cracker Barrel is that it is cramped all the time. You can not get to point A to point B without running into someone or something.
good,"A good fast paced work environment with many challenges. You had to be able to work with over twenty people a shift, without conflict.  A great management staff with opportunities to grow into management."
good,The way we operated was supposed to make us all feel like family employees and guest alike. We treated eachother with respect to make everyone feel welcome.
good,Good place to work for young kids and college students. Small room for advancement based on job performance. Fast paced kitchen work. No drug test required.
good,"It is a busy establishment but very helping and inviting. Could improve on scheduling and working in a timely manner. However, overall the training before floor rotation gives employees a confidence boost."
good,"A typical day of work was quick-paced but balanced with everyone involved, including management. Everyone was very friendly and it was a great atmosphere to work in."
good,I enjoyed the mix of travelers and regulars on a daily basis.  The money made the hard work worthwhile.  A good variety of options on the menu.  Reasonable prices.
good,"I enjoyed my time within this company. A typical day for cashier/ retail merchandiser consisted of helping customers, and cashing both store/and diners quickly but efficiently. Only thing I disliked was putting away the trucks."
good,The days were pretty fun and relaxed. I learned a lot about the restaurant business and how to handle others with hospitality. However the other workers were very sassy and some were difficult to work with. All in all I enjoyed working  there and felt like I was appreciated.
good,"I liked that this place had a structured system for advancement, the compensation was typical for wait staff but the extra benefits were great! "
good,people are always willing to help you out if you need it! Manager are super friendly and customer tip well most of the time. Can relocate to and go to school and work when you want
good,"Great management,co-workers, and staff in kitchen. Very fast paced. Great setting and view. I would love to go back to work for the company. Meet slot of faces with smiles,very nice."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Any given day has the potential to be incredibly busy. The job gets very stressful around peak hours, especially if you're just starting. You are required to meet time constraints constantly, and need to move quickly. Management was good at the store I worked at, which made it more enjoyable."
good,Cracker Barrel is a high-paced work place that stresses the pleasing people moto in all that it does. It teaches teamwork and gives people the opportunity to learn the serving craft. It's a fun place to work and easy to make friends and have regular guests that you can connect with.
good,Loved it had its pros and cons but loved working as a waitress and talking with the customers and making sure they have everything they need and loved their experience
good,"I enjoyed working there, the pay was good, management was friendly, and most of the staff works well together. The hours are not full-time, but you can work more than five days a week."
good,The company really needs to rethink its ordering procedures. The stores are left with way too much merchandise after a theme has been in store and makes it to clearance. The items are not really desirable for most of their guests.
good,Cracker Barrel was a great place to work and getting to know the employees and customers that are from all over. Running the cash register and learning the experience of the customers was always entertaining. The management was awesome to work for nice and understanding.
good,Cracker Barrel is what you make it. The atmosphere is respectful and clean. I worked as a server and made at least $10 an hour with tips. I made even better during the busy seasons. It's all about making the guests feel like you care. The management is generally good and the other requirements as a server did not waste too much time.
good,"Friendly customers & staff, fair & professional management. Discounts on snacks and half-off meals are a big plus, as are flexible hours. Easy to get the basics down, so that advancement can be relatively quick."
good,typical day was to assist people to there tables and get them what they needed and provide answers they may have about the restaurant or menu and make there experience enjoyable.
good,"Normal days at work are busy. You need to do side work while also running a register and greeting every customer who walks in the door. The people who manage the location are good folks, but they are constantly being held to strict daily goals that aren't always possible with store staff stretched as it is."
good,"I worked at Cracker Barrel for almost 6 years. I had high hope of advancing within my career, learned everything I could. It is so hard to move up in this company. That was my only negative"
good,"Serving at cracker barrel is nice because everyone works together to bus tables so servers keep all of their tips, and the atmosphere is friendly, even with so many servers, cooks, dishwashers, managers, and store workers."
good,"Expect A LOT of people on the holidays, especially Mother's day."
good,I've been working with this company for more than 10 years. I enjoy working with the public and I am a people person. I work nights and would be more comfortable working days.
good,"My day at work would depend on which position I was working. If I was working as a cashier, my day would either start early in the morning or id day and go late into the afternoon."
good,"Learned how to provided excellent customer service and enjoyed interacting with the patrons, making friends with many of the regular guests.  Learned how to market both menu and store items."
good,"Great place to work if you're a people person highly recommended . Although guest make complaints, we try to de-escalate issues ,but customers still leave with happy faces and RETURN!"
good,"•	Provided friendly and helpful service to customers and diners"
good,"Fun and professional place to work. Work days can go by very slow if there is a lack of customers but for the most part you will keep busy, Management was great. Very family oriented and tight knit place. I enjoyed my time there however it was very breif due to personal matters but the staff was very understanding!"
good,All in all the company is good to work for. I feel like they have made too many empty promises to the employees though. A major down fall for this company is that they are all about a number so they hire people when they really do not have hours to give. Most employees work between 15-20 hours a week.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Fun and friendly people. Learned quickly and opportunity for advancement. Good food and customers are great. Flexible schedules and close to my home. Great!
good,my duties included over seeing all P&L issues employee and manager schedule. Delegating tasks to managers and employees to achieve high standards on food safety and quality. To ensure all guests have a great meal with great hospitality. I have learned alot about how to read and interact with all types of people. I enjoyed working side by side with my employees to achieve company goals and standards.
good,"crackerbarrel was a chaotic environment all the time and nobody ever knew what they were doing , it was by far poorly managed. the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the regular customers everytime you worked"
good,"This is a fun place to work but they are very flexible with you, but scheduling is a big issue because they hire way more people than they actually need."
good,"Overall Cracker Barrel is the hardest serving job I've had, but it's well worth it when it's all said and done. You work at a very fast pace, they have employee appreciation days, cookouts where family is welcome, but the hours are long. Dealing with customer service is hard and requires a lot of patience. Also your working with over 150 people."
good,"Cracker Barrel is a fun place to work with fun loving people. The country culture at Cracker Barrel is one of a kind. Exceptional food, prices, and environment."
good,I loved the money and I loved everyone I worked with. For the most part the managers were nice and helpful when needed. On Sundays just about every person works and some people will only get 2 tables for an 8 hour shift going home with only $40-$60 including sidework and rolling over 200 pieces of silverware.
good,Job tasks were strait forward and the hours were flexible. Your have the option to cross-train into different positions once you work there for a while.
good,"The thing I liked most about this place is that the servers helped each other out a lot, which was important for me since I had never been a server in a restaurant before."
good,Employees are an integral part of cracker barrel and it shows. The upper management at cracker barrel attempt to provide a safe and friendly work environment.
good,"Every day at cracker barrel was fast paced. Whether it was busy or not there were always things that needed to be done. A typical day would consist of cleaning machinery, prepping food, and pleasing guests. Overall the management was pretty good and all of the employees had close relationships to one another. The hardest part about working for Cracker Barrel was when it was fast paced. The most enjoyable part about my job was making new friends."
good,"I enjoyed working for the company, but Management needed improvement. The hardest part of the job was having to work with no back-up and having to work double shifts, which meant working  4 hours , leaving and returning 3 hours later to work another 4 or more hours."
good,"The first few months were great working there, but as soon as I asked for time off they began to cut my shifts in half, as if part-time hours weren't short enough. Some days they were understanding, other times not so much. The last few months of me working there we came into new management and everything we learned and I was use to, I was told to forget and had to completely readjust. I think they are a good company with good benefits and discounts. As for the skills, I developed a good understanding of a fast paced environment and gained a lot of knowledge of a very busy atmosphere."
good,Cracker Barrel provides their employees with various incentives to move up in the company and become more knowledgeable. Aside from promotions into management; there are also other ways to advance within the company and increase your wages. My particular management team is great when it comes to encouraging a good balance between work and family life. Working in the kitchen provides for a non-stop work day; between cooking customers orders there are other various task that I am responsible for throughout the shift. The hardest part of the job has been having to work almost all major holiday's without any type of overtime or holiday pay.
good,Cracker Barrel provides a good and safe work environment for all employees. They are very flexible and understanding. The managers are great and will work with you.
good,A typical day consisted of checking the board to see where my section would be and then making sure that I didn't have any one waiting on me. once the tables started to get SAT the day would begun to roll. I enjoyed part of the management at the time. I loved most about this job was the fast money but the hardest part of this job was working really hard and some tables would even tip you.
good,"it is cool and upbeat place, high demand from rude customers. but it comes with most jobs. great place to work and eat... but one most want more to be able to grow within the company"
good,"I worked at a baby barrel for 5 1/2 years. I was able to move up pretty quickly and loved what I was doing. However, some of the management had clue what was going on. I realize now, after being in a management position of my own that it may not have entirely been their fault. However, the salaried managers were not nearly selective enough when promoting shift leaders and chose people who many including myself were very wrong for the job. Ultimately I was just tired of the same ole stuff, different day routine."
good,Cracker Barrel is a good place to work it's very stressful and high paced but overall its a good place to work I washed dishes buds tables prep cook back up cook
good,It was good to work for Cracker Barrel. Its a good job anyone in high school or fresh out. The customers are always nice and the other employees are friendly.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"I usually enjoy my typical day. I always stay positive, have wonderful managers, get along and joke with coworkers. I continue to learn and grow in customer service and work ethic. The hardest part of the job is when I have a rude and needy table, to stay polite and positive. I think I most enjoy, though, when I get to talk to some wonderful tables. They help me enjoy my job even more."
good,my time working here started off lovely they heled me out and worked with me every step of the way I was homeless until I had to move to Florida so I could have a home and the gms told the Florida gm not to hirer me for what reason I don't know
good,Cracker Barrell is a company who believes in empowering their employees. Upper management is available for new ideas from any employee and often implements these ideas company wide.
good,The typical day at work isn't too bad. I've learned that I'm a good quality cook but I'm not quite good at time management and getting food on the grill. The management team works really well with me to make sure that I can learn to meet the company standards without making me feel like I'm not able to do the job.
good,"The pay sucked as a waitress, but the enviroment was awesome! Trainers were kind and easy going, and the hours were awesome. Management worked with me nicely as I have children!"
good,"The job was okay. It was great in the beginning, but as i started to work more jobs I began to receive less and less hours. This really is a great first time job, but don't work there for more than a year."
good,I loved it here my longest job having title ever. The co workers was solid the management was fair. The work place was fantansic. hardest part was the cleaning The easiest was the money making
good,I work in the retail section and it is great. Most of the 'guests' are wonderful and I do enjoy the regulars when they return time after time. The management is great and do listen to your concerns. I enjoy being a cashier and now also enjoy working in the retail section as well. It is a great position but I am looking for more.
good,The job is fun when you first start. They give you good hours.. but it seems that with time you lose hours even if you are doing well. Managers are overall pretty nice too. But you always get that one with something against you.
good,"It was actually a fun place to work at. Everyone there always has a jolly type attitude towards the customers. Great food, wonderful breakfast. Good beverages."
good,"i loved working there. it was a fun work environment and i loved all my customers. definitely recommend this as a first time job for people in school, they will work with your schedule."
good,"Beginning of the day after clocking in I would get a bucket of silverware and roll the desired amount put out for the day, gave customer service, took orders and put them into the computer in the order of the seats at the table, I would learn about different people who would come in, made a lot of regular guests feel that they were very welcomed and I would give them great service. Management was always on top of what was going on at all times. The work culture was great, but of course the hardest part was rush hours and some services stressed a little more than others and would cause more stress to the service. Most enjoyable part was feeling that I was creating a great experience for the guest and made sure I could take care of them anyway I could."
good,"Working here was often stressful, especially on weekends. I had to constantly be alert and aware of changes in volume of business, customer's needs, the atmosphere in the dinning room, and the needs of my other coworkers. I learned the meaning of patience and developed a more open mind. Many of the customers coming through were very friendly and a lot of those were regulars who became like family. Management was awesome and always willing to help when I needed it, as well as other employees. They really held true to the mission statement ""Pleasing people."""
good,"Personally, I loved CB and have no issues with them. The location I was employed with had several management changes and a quick turnover rate for retail sales. I eventually was looking for advancement and felt that my manager at the time lacked correct leadership skills, though she has since been let go."
good,The one thing i loved about working here was that you can definately advance at this company.For every level you advance to u get another star till you finally get your fifth star.
good,"a typical day as a cracker barrel cashier would involve assuring each and every guest is satisfied with their meal and their time spent in the shop. I would make sure that everything in retail was stocked appropriately, and had a nice and neat finish. I also became a trainer one month into the job, when new cashiers were hired I would teach them how to use the register and how to apply their skills into the retail department. I learned how to communicate better with our guests and create a relationship with each customer to enhance their enjoyment throughout their stay. The management team was amazing, even when the restaurant was busy they managed to still take care of all their employees. The hardest part about the job was when we had to transition to a new manager in retail, because everything started changing dramatically. Retail and cashier was separated but when the new manager came, corporate had decided to merge the two together, trying to do cash and retail at first was a difficult transition. The most enjoyable part of the job was all the amazing customers we had, we got to meet people from all over the world traveling through Florida."
good,This job requires you to move quickly and think of your customers first. I learned to pay close attention to the customers. Listen carefully for all requests. Manage multiple tables at once. I enjoyed working with my managers and co-workers. The hardest part is that everyone needs you at once. The most enjoyable part is the pay.
good,"Being a server at Cracker Barrel was my very first job and I enjoyed it. The management was easygoing yet still kept us workers correct by company standards. The most enjoyable part of the job was the money (cliche, I know). Servers make great money, typically more than minimum wage, and servers earn a LOT more on weekends. When first starting as a server, it takes a couple of weeks to be able to earn as much, but after you're in the swing of things, a server can make around $60 a night and more on weekends."
good,"good training program, overall good company.  Individual locations run completely different as far as accountability of team."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,This job was a great place to work. I learned a lot from this job. Southern hospitality was extremely important. I loved it.
good,"My typical work day began by getting right to work. I had a specific area in the dining room I was responsible for, and many customers as well, who began requesting my service. I loved being a part of something like that, where all the coworkers were all in it together."
good,My only complaint about this company is that they do not hold your job for you no matter what the circumstances are. I worked for cracker barrel for 4 years and had to take a leave of absence to take care of my father who was diagnosed with terminal cancer. My father passed away in January of 2016 & my job was no longer available to me.
good,Always a fast paced environment with friendly staff and customer. Can be stressful at times. Great oppertunities for advancement if you work at it.
good,Enjoyed my chapter at Cracker Barrel based on the employee and customer relations. Made everyday a constant fast paced enjoyment in the restaurant industry.
good,Cracker Barrel was fun and enjoyable with ages ranging 3 yrs -70 years. The environment was  so electrified. Their was a great team effort. The hardest part of the job was learning how to persuade people to shop.
good,"Work is easy and fun. Guests are amazing, and there is always something to do. Servers have more responsibility as team work is required for successful shift."
good,My typical day at work includes being able to deliver an excellent guest dining experience as well as be able to preform my required duties while on the clock. Everyone works as a team and helps each other out wherever it is needed.
good,Good place to work. The management wasn't so good thigh. They switch managers a lot so you're always meeting getting to know and learning new managers. You employees are cracker barrel security. Its up to you to pay attention to people that walk out without paying or stealing any goods.
good,"The biggest problem that you encounter is the unavoidable and extremely ""in-your-face"" angry guest. This individual is not extremely common and, overall, most of the people with whom you interact will be pleasantly unmemorable. Most of the servers are awesome"
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel you were able to experience an awesome family atmosphere. Waiting on the Customers was for the most part the most rewarding part of the day. Families came from all over. To enjoy the Food, Fireplace and the wonderful setting of Cracker Barrel. Each day came with it's on new Challenges that pushed you to be more motivated then the next."
good,Cracker Barrel lays out a country fresh way about being an employee. As long as the management follows the guidelines everything will run smoothly if not then it is NO fun.
good,Cracker Barrel is a very nice and cozy place to eat at if you are searching for that old southern country feel and everyone is so friendly. a typical day at the job would be very calm and relaxing then can get a little hexed but other then that things are great.
good,"pay raises with advancement are available,changing job title is not a problem.steady work with a great future.food service is fast paced."
good,Working at Cheddar's casual cafe was a good place management communicated with you. A day there during busy hours had to be prepared and ready hitting goal hrs while working were succeeded. After a long work day it paid off for the next day working a long shift would be constantly busy no down time unless not busy wouldn't be for long.
good,"As a Cracker Barrel server you will undergo the typical gripes and complaints of a server position. Management doesn't always know what to do, you don't always make as much as you want to, guests can be very very very horrible. However, overall it is a good experience and you will make good money."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Be ready to constantly be busy with work. Customer service is a must. Management is a team. Co workers become family. Stressful situations. Talking with customers.
good,I enjoy coming in and knowing what to expect out of my day.  I look forward to working with certain managers more than others but I know that the shift will run smoothly with any of them. The most enjoyable part is leaving with cash on hand however I do not enjoy the uncertainty of how much I will make in a shift due to the nature of my job.
good,Great place to work but the management sucked. The hours weren't what I expected either. The atmosphere with the other staff was very friendly.
good,"a typical work day starts with leting management know i:m present. then coach my co- workers to get ready for peek period set up.the most fun i have is when we get busy; the faster and busyer we are the more fun i have,"
good,"I have been with Cracker Barrel for almost four years. It has been a good company to work for. However, the work hours are very tiring and long. I have learned a great deal of essential qualities such as customer service and satisfaction, time management, respect, patience, and a general appreciation for hard work. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was creating a connection with the regular customers."
good,"Wonderful experience, early introduction to the Kitchen environment as well as handling multiple responsibilities at once. The staff was extremely welcoming and more than willing to help one another."
good,"Hard work and there was no time for breaks I never was able to even have lunch but It was great pay, I was a hard worker they have flexible scheduling and great management...."
good,Fun work space with lots of people who share the same ideals. The managment staff was always nice and ploite. Thye were always ready to help in anyway they could. There were always new people coming in so it was easy to meet new people and make friends quickly. Great chances to move up in ranks and improve yourself within the compay.
good,"With Cracker Barrel being my first job right out of high school and continuing throughout college, it taught me a lot of the basic skills needed to function in any workplace."
good,"The job is nice because of its flexible work schedules, It allows employees to have paid time off and also is pretty lenient about working weekends."
good,I go in very early. I open up for the day. I get the grill  line  set up and ready for the day. I work the breakfast and lunch shift. I have worked dinner shifts also. After setting up I fill orders as received. We are a very busy place. I love the fast pace .Most of my co-workers are great and fun to work with. The hardest part of this job is when you do not have teamwork. A lot of us have worked together for awhile and are like family .
good,"Great place to work, especially for those who like fast paced environments and are good at multitasking. This job teaches you how to handle a variety of different people and situations. The most enjoyable part of my day in just getting to interact with all the different types of people that come in and making sure that they are happy before they walk out the door, because if they aren't that is a reflection on my job and how I am doing."
good,"Assuring petty cash was accounted for, creating a daily food prep list based off of on hand inventory with regard to expiration dates. Monitoring staff to verify proper prep and production of food products to keep food cost in line. Scheduling for 120+ employees once a week. Managing time to be available to develop rapport with guests to help create an environment that welcomes them back frequently."
good,It was a great place to work. Every one was so friendly. I leaned that  communication is a big part about work as a team. The hard part of this job was that they did not give me the hours I need.
good,"A typical work day starts at 7am.  I do a thorough look at what is already prepped from the night before and then proceed check labels for anything out of date.  After this i enter my findings in to our system to process a new chart for the day.  I make sure i have lunch ready by 11am, then i proceed to work directly with the servers to serve their guests. 2:30pm I start to make a new chart of prep items for the night shift as well as make surer the area is clean and all utensils are put away. Everyday I learn how to deal with different attitudes and how to better serve guests in a timely manner.  The management team is very helpful in answering any questions I have throughout the day.  My fellow co-workers are a very diverse cast of people helping one another when available.  The hardest part of my is organizing my morning duties and prioritizing which are needed first.  The most enjoyable part of my day is just being in a friendly atmosphere helping others, my co-workers keep me active and time flies."
good,"At Cracker Barrel a typical day for me is usually during the lunch shift, and we will be extremely busy. It would always be a hustle but working as a team. I work with another host/hostess to get guest seated in a timely manor. The shifts are generally four hours long and staying busy. At work I learned better communication skills and organization. I have also learned how to multitask and keep calm. The management is very good. Managers are friendly and able to work with your schedule while making sure everything runs smoothly. If something happened to go wrong, they were always there to make it right. Most of the coworkers were team players and friendly, but some would have an attitude at times. The hardest part of the job would be when I was working alone, and the store got an unexpected abundance of guest and servers would have to help me out, but the most enjoyable part was the people. Most of the people that came in or worked there were very friendly and understanding of mistakes or waiting."
good,"This is an easy ""get through college job"". It is an enjoyable job, but make sure you are ready to work. This is a very fast paced job"
good,"Exciting place, but way too many employees, especially managers. It was a fight for hours, seniority didn't matter. No cohesion and the male managers showed nothing but disrespect to the female manager."
good,"I loved this job because i met so many different people "
good,Cracker Barrel is very flexible with employees work schedules. They will work around another job. The managers are approachable & are willing to help as needed in any situation. They want you to be happy in order to carry out your duties to provide your best customer service. I enjoy being a cashier & helping out in the retail store. I like my coworkers & work well with them. We work as a team and support one another.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"I am a strong and dedicated worker. I like to arrive early to get a vibe of customers entering into the restaurant. I like to learn as much as possible to help to me know as much as I need to know about my job. I love working with people because I have always been a part of a team since I played basketball for fifteen years. The best thing about my job is that I get serve my customers and make sure that their every need is met. I just love hearing, ""you are a great server and you made my day."""
good,"Cracker Barrel was a great place to work at and it always fun going into work. Even when we were busy it didn't seem like it because everyone worked together as a team. The employee and Management training programs were great, probably the best training programs in the restaurant bussiness. I always looked forward to going into work."
good,"Well, before I pull into to the parking lot, I have to be completely in uniform (iron-pressed shirt, pants, apron, non-slick shoes). My hair is tied back for safety reasons. I also have to be prepared with my server book, pens, and swipe card. if I don't have these tools I cannot do my job properly. As soon as I walk into the door, I'm instantly greeted by my coworkers and usually hold the door for the older folks. Then swipe my self in on the clock, on time. I then wash my hands, grab some clean silverware and roll 100 pieces, and notify the manager. Once I do that, I'm on the floor plan which means I now have my own section. My job is too greet each table of guest within two minuets of sitting down, and script the daily dinner. Once I take the orders, I bring the drinks and keep an eye on them if they need refills before the food comes out, and if they have ordered salad or soup always bring it out first. I have to pre-bus (take empty dishes) and also leave the bill for their convenience. In the middle of all of taking care of my guest in the front of the house i also have to make sure everything is stocked and fresh in the kitchen. I learned to be more patient with people, that everyone makes mistakes. I've also learned things about food preparation like how long and how hot chicken will be baked, etc. The management is a very good team, they are understanding and helpful. Sometimes though, they're not very flexible with my hours. My coworkers are fun, and it goes very smooth when we all have teamwork and motivation to keep the flow going by having things stoked, taking care"
good,"Co-Workers is what makes me day great! Management is just as pleasurable. I learned how important it is to treat guest the best way that you can. The hardest part of the job is making those who are hard to make happy, happy!"
good,"I enjoyed being a server with Cracker Barrel. I loved the people I worked alongside and my managers. It was not easy leaving such a place as I sought other career opportunities. It is difficult to describe a typical day when addressing a restaurant. While it was nice when the business was slow, I enjoyed the challenge that a busy and lively restaurant brought to my coworkers and me. I learned a lot about people and customer service as my salary was dependent on my tips. As with every job I pursue, my goal was to make a difference.  I worked hard and kept a smile, hoping to create another smile for someone else."
good,Management was good. Co-workers are very friendly and helpful. Starting salary is minimum wage. It's a good place for students to work while going to school.
good,Working here is very exciting always  new people coming threw from travels either on buses or just family. The people that work here are college students usually and are very fun to work with and high spirited. management is willing to work with people as best as they can.
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel overall has been a rewarding experience.  I enjoy a flexible schedule which works well for me, as I am a full time student.  My coworkers are generally pleasant and shifts are usually quick!  "
good,"I clock in with a Micro card. Then find the clip board to tell me all my duties and what section ill have for my shift. "
good,"Interact with guest, selling product"
good,The managers encouraged store employees to engage in the products to show customers how they worked. Everything was laid out in the store and how to do the displays.
good,A typical day at work with cracker means going in starting your shift then at the end of your shift do all of your side duties. Some of the team members are great to get along with then there are some that like to cause issues for other team memebers. The management is amazing at cracker barrel they work with you if you need a couple of days off they would give you them or if you needed to change shifts they would allow you to. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the rude customers but it was getting easier and easier. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was see all the happy customers.
good,Being able to come in every week and serve our customers brings me joy. I've learned so much and have used all that knowledge and applied it in my life. I my co-workers and I work great together. Management is good. They are very interactive with the staff and the customers.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of staying on top of orders and cleanliness in the the kitchen. Timely and effective work, but not to lack quality. The people were good to work with, however I mostly kept to myself and focused on my tasks at hand. Above all else, the room for improvement in greatly respected in that company with the system they have instilled to ensure employees are guaranteed a position they can love."
good,"i was one of the first people hired and trained to work at the allen location, it was fun building trust and working as a team alongside the managers and overall it was enjoyable. the atmosphere was great and the people were nice. the hardest part of the job was just the extra kitchen cleanup but it wasn't too bad. the managers and even the GM were nice people and offered to help any of the servers if they needed it."
good,"Awesome people, great place to work. Team oriented. Managers are easy to talk to. Has a great training program."
good,Not much chance for quick advancement. a great company if you need to travel/move out of area. I was able to transfer as I moved from state to state with my family.
good,"I love the food at this place, but I did not like the management team here."
good,"I'm a server and have been for 8 years  for Cracker Barrel , its a very busy restaurant and there is never a dull moment. Over time i have become a leader ( i am one of only four servers out of 75+ with a 4 star rating) and i am quite often asked to train new employees by having them shadow me  their first week. the hardest part of the job is the lifting of heavy trays and other heavy objects , the absolutely best part is interacting with the patrons , I am truly a people person and just love meeting and relating with everyone that come through our doors , i also like most all of my fellow team members(you're not gonna love everyone out of over 100 but i can honestly say i do my best to get along and help them all) , all in all its a fun place to work but at this point in my life i need something a little less physically demanding."
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel was very enjoyable. A typical day at work included taking orders, busing my own tables on weekdays, preparing food and drinks, and completing my side work ( such as cleaning the juice machines, rolling silverware, stocking the refrigerators, and making sure all the condiments on our tables were filled up.) Management was lovely and very helpful."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Preparation Cook & Night Maintenance Worker "
good,"While I am at work I love that I can go in with a smile and come out with a smile on most days. I am able to talk to the guests that walk in and sit down to have breakfast, lunch, or dinner. Me helping them with what they want to order or helping them just to understand something that is on the menu makes me feel good. Now if only i could do it in a medical setting I would be much happier."
good,"Great Company to work for, ready enjoyed working with the branch team"
good,"This is a very fun, fast paced job that can also be very challenging.  I learned lots about customer service, resolving conflicts, and time management."
good,I worked at cracker barrel while i was in college they worked with my schedule and i made pretty good money during the summers...
good,Good company for a restaurant. They offer benefits and many options for working around a busy college schedule.
good,had a great experience there just cut hours and needed to make more money
good,"Cracker Barrel was am exciting place to be employed, the atmosphere was comforting and stable. The rules were not always enforced by management, which made it difficult sometimes. The guests that we served on a daily basis were a delight to be around. Being a server you meet all kinds of new people, in which i loved."
good,"Cracker Barrel was a very intense job experience. When I was first hired, I was a dishwasher/busboy for about two weeks. My manager realized I was quick and efficient so they asked me to learn the menu and become a cook. After about a week of dishes and learning how to cook, cooking became my main job. Finally, after about three weeks of that, my boss asked me if I wanted to get paid 12 per hour. After I said yes he told me to come into CB around 10pm and clean the store until 7am, aka Night Maintenance. This is where I learned a lot about safety with chemicals, cleaning, mopping, the entire store. Most of the co-workers were a bit lazy. The hardest part about the job was trying to work with my co-workers. The most enjoyable part was getting paid more than them for my hard work. "
good,"Cracker Barrel is a good company to work for and has many chances for advancement within the company.  From my experience, the managers are fair and willing to work with all empoyees to make a better work day."
good,"I always enjoyed Cracker Barrel atmosphere. Great returning customers, always smiling. Their products and their food was amazing and it was easy to encourage sales when you see customers smiling whether they shopped our gift shop, or ate in the restaurant.Never a dull moment with great music playing, great customers to chat with, and sweet employees to work with."
good,Enjoyed serving my regular customers. Most of the co-workers were respectful. 
good,I love my job at Cracker Barrel. I enjoy my team and have a group of great managers. I get paid to play with toys!
good,"I worked in the retail side. It was fun and fast especially during the holidays. Learned how to order products, train, and set displays. The hardest part of the job is when I had to leave due to moving. "
good,"I enjoy the work I do very much, I am currently an undergraduate and will be graduating this upcoming year. Upon the completion of my graduation I will be looking to use my degree towards a great career. "
good,Cracker Barrel is a great place to work while in school or as a part time/second job. They are pretty good with your schedule and when you need to request a day off.
good,came in wnt over list for the day began preparing foods for use thru out the day. as lunch service began i made salads and desserts. would prepare things for night shift thru out the day and clean and stock area.
good,overall a great experience to be able to work with the public.also learned the importance of team work..
good,"A great place to work! provide customer service, light cleaning duties, suggestive sales, managers are friendly but motivate employees to the companies guiding principles."
good,"Great environment as soon as you walk through the door, you get greeted by an employee with in seconds of walking in. The employees are working fast but friendly at all times. The food is great everytime you go, no matter if you want breakfast, lunch, or dinner, you can always expect the best."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,fun work place and envirorment
good,"Overall Cracker Barrel is a good place to work at. Like any food service being able to work under stress is a must. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with all of the duties required of a server when it gets super busy, and depending on your teamwork, the Managers may get frustrated and yell a bit. Despite the occasional hollering, the managers are rather professional in their dealings with the employees and very sincere. There is a lot of flexibility and wiggle-room for when something comes up and you can't show up to work, or if you need more hours."
good,"A typical day at work consists of greeting guests as they come through the door, let them know any specials or sales we have, customer service was necessary as well. Management knew they had to tell me a task once and if I needed more details I would ask them. The most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction I have with the guests and knowing I can help them and they would leave with a smile."
good,"A typical day at work entailed joking around with other coworkers meanwhile keeping up with the pace. Pizza Hut pretty much molded me as a server but every job I have ever had I have learned something new. I learned how to carry a tray full of plates, the menu and other things as well. Management was TERRIBLE. The general manager favored certain employees and got way out of hand a couple times as far as dicipline goes. My co-workers were awesome. I got along with everyone and we even hung out outside of work and did pot lucks a parties. The hardest part of the job was that we were so busy and that I felt I was walking on pins and needles around the manager. The most enjoyable part was conversation with my customers and all of my co-workers."
good,"Typical day at work was good most of the time. I've learned that sometimes people are really mean, but you have to keep your head up and not let it get to you. The management was great; I loved all my managers. Most of my co-workers were good, but there were a couple of people that are rude and mean and don't care about anyone, but themselves. The hardest part of the job is probably remembering the what we're featuring that day and scouting for tables. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you meet those really nice people who just make your day. They're the ones that make up for the rude people and make you enjoy your job."
good,"Cracker Barrel was the hardest and most rewarding job I've ever had. I had been told by a District Manager from Apple B's that Cracker Barrel is like New York. ""If you can make it there...You can make it anywhere."" I believe that to be the truth. The culture is all about ""pleasing people"" internally and externally. I still have good relationships with co managers, gm's, and district managers. The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job was the ""pleasing of people"". It becomes a skill to be able to win over a guest after something going wrong. No day is perfect, but if you can make each guest feel special you're creating a bond that make people come back."
good,"loved working here, but it could be drama filled at times. excellent food and company, but like all places management could be better"
good,its very short they dont give you any hours. i would only get 10 hours a week.
good,On a typical day i'd start by getting my general cooking supplies around.
good,There are 4 tests you have to take in order to get a promotion and more employee discount. My supervisor Tina was great to work with. I had fun learning everything from computer cash register to inventory.
good,i learned great customer service. I management had a lot of difficult problems. My co-workers were very help full and nice. The hardest part of my job was learning the entire menu. The most enjoyable parrt was the customers.
good,"was a hostess, loved working there, customers and staff was great."
good,"Cracker Barrel was wonderful place to work. I was a cashier, so I had to cash the customers out restock the retail store and help the customers. Management was really great. My coworkers were friendly and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was being on my feet for eight hours. I really enjoyed interacting with the customers there"
good,I enjoyed working at cracker barrel and the staff was really nice. I won't mind working there again.
good,"Serving here is no day at the park. It's work. But it gets the bills paid, and once you know what you're doing, the rest is customer experience, and making sure you're constantly doing something. This is not a stand around and stare at the wall job, at least not at my location it isn't."
good,"I started working at Cracker Barrel in 2007 and I've been there ever since. I can honestly say that I love my job! What initially brought Cracker Barrel to my attention was their great customer service --- they value each guest experience (good or bad). Guest service is their main concern, which I love! There are always Pros & Cons to a job, but the Pros definitely out weigh the Cons. So if you can handle the Cons, it's a great place to work!!! The only reason I'm wanting to move on, is because I'm looking for a ""career"" that I can advance in. I'm 27 and ready to start my family on the right track --- which means a stable, steadily rising, income. =)"
good,I worked in the gift shop dealing with customers. I was able to interact with people and stock up the store. I was also a cashier where I handled money. Working at Cracker Barrel gave me a great chance to use customer service skills.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I Worked for Cracker Barrel a little less than three years and I loved it. I started off doing one thing and over the years worked my way through over half the restaurant. They are very flexible and will work with you with whatever you have going on in your life. I learn mostly how much I loved satisfying people.
good,Cracker Barrel was my favorite job I had. I made so many close friends there and made good money at the same time. Would definitely go back to work for them again.
good,"management wasn't always easy to talk to, a lot of them were  to busy to care. it was probably the hardest serving job. I did end up becoming a server trainer"
good,"I had a great experience here. Some coworkers were very nice and friendly and others (mostly females) tried to entertain drama, but if you ignore it, it’ll eventually go away. The mangers were very helpful but in some cases they were too busy to help. The pay was alright for this being my FIRST JOB but it all depends on the hours you work that overall determines your check."
good,Cracker barrel is a great company to work for. In just looking for something new and somewhere I can move up. The management could use some work. Over all I've had a great experience with them
good,"My experience working at Cracker Barrel is that it’s a good job with good people if you want part time work. You probably won’t get enough hours to think about benefits but what pay you get is good. Also paid weekly.  Managers are really nice and helpful. It’s a fun work place, but It can get very busy and stressful at times."
good,I worked there for a month for seasonal and I believed I would keep the job after but then their hours went down and they fired all seasonal. It was a really great experience though.
good,A lot of opprotunities to move up and great work environment. Would recommend to anyone looking for a job that they could move up in. Lots to learn and experience.
good,"Have a clean background, or don't waste your time. Be respectful, on time, and energetic. A smile on your face, and get to work, a very fast pace job. There is no time to horse around or you are behind."
good,"There is no real ""typical"" day at work. Working during the day is typically the better time as that's where most of the ""veteran"" workers are. They've been around for a while and know how things work and tend to be better team players. Evening work times can be more fun, and are at least the most off the wall. Evening is typically when the newer employees work and are a younger crew. Management is hit or miss. There are 2 good managers, 1 of which is the General Manager. If you stick around long enough to learn how to do most everything, then it's not that big of a deal."
good,I enjoyed my job. They are friendly and the management helps with anything you may need and they also make sure you know how to do your job well. It is a fast paced job and great service is expected.
good,"Very established company"
good,This place can be really fun to work at but be prepared that it can get really busy and stressful. The hours' range and during a slow period you can end up working 15 hours a week.
good,There's a lot of opportunity for cross training. You can learn a lot there. Loved my employee discount there! Managers try their best to work with your schedule though they also have to make sure they have employees on weekends.  Benefits are available.
good,"If you can’t work fast or keep up with the speed that they need on the shift, your already beat. They need fast working people at this facility. Once you got that down pack you should be good."
good,"The store I work at has its ups and downs, but overall it is a decent place to work. The work itself is not difficult and easy to learn and execute, but the environment itself is what makes accomplishing tasks troublesome. Our Managers could use a little more backbone, but they do well at listening to their employees."
good,Only stressful if certain things not already on top of having to do extra things that MUST be done. But I must say overall it is a very chill and relaxing restaurant that has taught me a lot.
good,I enjoyed my time while I was there.  But they occasionally overwork their employees as well as don't give breaks unless you ask.  They do have flexible schedules to fill out online.
good,"Cracker Barrel has a very detailed, effective training program. The company does a nice job rolling out new initiatives and operating platforms. Falls short improving the managers quality of life/ work balance."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Working at cracker barrel is a fast paced environment with urgency with a purpose at the top of the list. With all my coworkers I've only experienced a positive  attitude with a strong sense of teamwork to get things done. I can always count on my managers to help me when I really need it.
good,Se debería pagar más por el área que es bastante costosas y más los que trabajan de noche y madrugada
good,"Cracker Barrel was my first serving job, and it has been a great experience. The work is depending upon you as the server with how hard you work, and how friendly you are to guests. The pay is as low as $8/hr up to $30/hr depending upon the day and tips you will receive. A great place for a temporary or second job for some extra money."
good,"It was a good learning experience for getting my feet wet in the kitchen. The management was alright, I've had worse. In two years I did make a 3.50 raise from what I was hired at, so that was pretty good at least."
good,"On a typical day of work, I would either be serving a 7 table section, or I would be cashiering on the retail side of the store. I bussed tables, handled meal receipts, and served food and drinks. I also cleaned kitchen appliances in back of the house as well as swept, cleaned the windows, and rolled silverware."
good,Working at cracker barrel was a very good job. I enjoyed the management as well as my fellow employees. I made some friends there that I still get in touch with! Customers were always great and it was just an overall great experience!
good,"I worked as a backup cook for 3 yrs.It was a challenge for me at first but with lots of encouragement and practice the job proved to be gratifying.Really appreciated the hard work of my managers and good attitudes, they were good teachers if you are willing to be taught!Hard work and not being a ""spring chicken"" it was too much for my knees and I left the job because of that. I miss the people.It was a very good experience for me."
good,I really loved working there with all of the people! It was a huge machine with every job possible working all together to make the customers happy. Overall would recommend for a first job!
good,The management doesnt care about their employees. A lot of people were being double shifted while others only had a day or two on the schedule. I got out quick.
good,"Its a good company to work for,all the employees are very friendly an will to help you..including the management team.its a team atmosphere.But the pay scale is at the lower end."
good,"only reason  i left was because of a single coworker that everybody constantly complained about and the manager just said ""thats how she is"" no thanks but i would work at Cracker Barrel again!! Pay is above minimum wage and has room for 4 raises in the first year if you take the tests on time and the manager is able to find time to give you a raise (never got my last raise, worked at least a month after i was able to get a raise and it is supposed to be immediate or told you dont get one. i was just avoided in a way)"
good,"Cracker barrel is alright to work at, as long as you work well under pressure. It is very fast passed, so you must be up and ready for action, you must have plenty of energy or the experience will kill you."
good,I worked here before I went off to college. It was a good pace and didn’t cause too much stress especially as I was dealing with the stress of preparing for college
good,Great place to work if you like fast paced work and a routine for each shift. Be prepared to have a full house of guests on Sundays; this can sometimes cause stress if you do not communicate with your coworkers when it gets busy.
good,"A typical day at work consists of greeting and interacting with customers in a restaurant/retail setting.  Listening to customers needs and showing them items they may be interested in to purchase.  Cashing out guests at cash stand, calling back to go orders and answering phone.  During slower times we check bathrooms, clean windows on doors and restock merchandise on sales floor.  "
good,Working for Cracker Barrel was like working with family. Everyone takes care of everyone. From customer satisfaction to employees and managers helping out each other. I would recommend Cracker Barrel as a place to work. Just don’t expect a full time position because to my knowledge only managers get full time.
good,Was great working here. Co-workers were amazing. I was able to make plenty of friends which helped create a great work environment. Management was a little iffy at times. They did not create the best environment when under stress. For me the hardest part of the job was trying to please all the needs of management. I really enjoyed interacting with guest and creating fun relationships with them.
good,"The managers really care about their employees. They are excited to see the employees succeed and climb the ladder in the company. If you put in effort here, you will easily succeed."
good,"great job; quality training and support systems; ability to make individual decisions to suit the circumstances; challenging; rewarding - drawback: work most weekends, virtually every holiday including Thanksgiving i.e. open 364 days a year excluding Christmas Day"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Great friendly staff and wonderful management. Sales floor is kept clean and organized and all products are properly displayed and shared with the customers.
good,I had a lot of good and bad things i liked about Cracker Barrel. I did not like most of my managers. There a selected few that i liked. I liked talking to my co-workers and my customers. I was very good in my opinion at my job. I do not have a lot to say about it at all.
good,"Worked for 2 years as a server. The server culture was not bad. Biggest pro was the ability to pick up shifts almost at the drop of a hat, so you can earn as much as you want to work; since you leave every day with tips in hand+ no tip share."
good,I was a dishwasher at cracker barrel I liked the job but it came with no benefits that I needed and it also didn't pay very well. I felt I could find something better
good,"I enjoyed the employees here. I enjoyed the work unless we were busy on the grill line. The supervisor’s were friendly and easy to work with. Friendly work environment and the supervisor made it an easier work day. Laid back, fun place to work"
good,"Depending on the shift you are scheduled to work, the pace varies. i.e. morning shifts during the week can be pretty busy, depending on the day of the week, but morning shifts during the weekend are pretty hectic, especially Sundays. Afternoon shifts are always dead no matter the day of the week and the evening shifts are always busy. "
good,If your looking for something hard and competitive this is for you. The manager field is challenging and always have you on your feet. Quick thinking and finding new ways to bring in the guest
good,I have worked at Cracker Barrel part-time and thoroughly enjoy my time there.  It is hard work and can be stressful at times but I also enjoy working with the public.  I have established many relationships with guests and enjoy going to work every week.  You need to be able to multitask and be a team player.
good,Quick cash especially if you are working on the weekends. It is definitely not a full time job that will cover all of your bills. A lot of other servers have two or three job and this just happens to be one of them. On the positive side if you are a student the schedules are very flexible. It is very easy to give away or pick up shifts. I would not recommend this job as a career.
good,"Gets incredibly busy on holidays with wait times up to 1.5 hours. Fairly clean establishment, always hiring, decent trainers. Can be very stressful, MUST be able to multitask and handle tense situations. Problem solving and productivity are a must, and busy weekends. Slow weekday evenings. Reasonable hours, can be difficult to adjust schedules. Nearly impossible to get holidays off, but super friendly staff once you get accustomed."
good,"Overall it is a good place to work and get some cash with a flexible work scheduled. "
good,There's always something to do. There's never a boring moment. Once in a while our manager has us do a competition to see who sells the most between all retail.
good,"Cracker Barrel was always a fast paced environment.  The customers were the best part of the job.  Management was very conflictive with its communication between DM and Regional.  Stressful at times with inadequate number of hours given to customer service.  Overall, the people in the store was the joy of working there."
good,"They cared so much about sales they always had something they wanted us to sell to our customers and every hour you would’ve to check if the sales went up ....it’s a okay job but it gets repetitive and boring ...I would have to greet guest, clean windows,stock, take out trash and etc but mainly do cashier."
good,"I enjoyed my year working at Cracker Barrel. The fast pace, friendly environment was great. I only left there because I was looking for a job in the medical field with more steady pay rather than depending on tips."
good,"it’s a FUN place to work in! The management is some what cool when I was there! Only thing is, they hire a lot of people and not give everybody hours that they want ! Sadly, that person was me and I needed hours but they weren’t able to give me because they had too many workers! But Cracker Barrel is a fun place to work at honestly!"
good,This place was awesome for beginning work and learning the basics . The management was good and the hours were pretty fair. Overall gave you a better view of the food industry and hands on work.
good,"As a manager, there isn’t a typical day. Each one is a whirlwind of decisions to be made and employees to affect. Everything you do is reflected on the business and guest experience. I enjoyed each day as I have gotten to know many repeat guests like my own family. The employees are also very close to my heart. Like all other places, there are ups and downs and like many families, there are disagreements, but CB truly was a home away from home."
good,"Everything was going well until I realized I was going to struggle paying everything the next coming month with the salary I had working at Cracker Barrel. They had me working full-time but this particular store was over-staffed, so I was getting less than 20 hours a week and maybe a table a two each day with maybe tips surpassing 40$.. but usually, tips for me ranged from 20-35$ which, imo, was not sustainable for me to live on."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Long hours, worked day shift and night shift on occassion.  Food cost and labor cost very important to running this resturant.  Good value for menu items, and very consistent from one resturant to another location"
good,"Never a dull moment at good old #392. We treat each other like family, but yet can be on each other’s last nerve. But I been here 4 years where I learn a lot of things & I honestly wouldn’t change it."
good,"I was Seasonal help, however I tried to stay on as a Hostess and was denied, only to find out after I was terminated, that the position was available I only needed to reapply to Cracker Barrel for that position."
good,"I worked with many other employees, between 15-60+ on daily basis. Our store was a training store so we were held to certain expectations and executed them. The managers were always fair and professional and they really promoted working as a team. I was always impressed with how fast paced the serving environment was and the employees wpuld still work like a smooth flowing team."
good,i had an overall pleasant experience working as a cook. i always had an extra hand to help and the environment was always friendly and had different plates to prepare so my job was always a challenge.
good,I enjoy coming to work and working with my fellow employees. I feel that the schedule could be based more on effort and how you are doing than playing favorites.
good,"Being a dishwasher at Cracker Barrel will become stressful to you if you're working on a holiday which means lots of customers and dirty dishes. In order to leave after completing your shift, I had to make sure the dish room is cleaned, dishes put back in their areas in the kitchen/servers area."
good,Do not want you to work full time.  Move managers from one restruant to another at times.  Over all the company was a good company to work for and would recommend to a friend.
good,"I greet customers, help with merchandise purchases and cashiering.  I love the atmosphere and everyone there is great to get along with.  I work there on a part-time basis."
good,"Like any retail position, they pushed sales like crazy. It was very fast paced. Management handled it all very well. It's not a bad environment. Everyone is nice. There are tons of workers. Hours can be skimpy. Mangers would allow me to work doubles if I let them know ahead that I needed more hours. You get constant evaluations and raises based on your scores. I think it was a 20% discount until you hit 4 stars then 35% discount. I enjoyed this job. I was 17 and it was perfect."
good,"Cracker Barrel is a great place to expand one's social interaction with the public. On a typical work day, I usually start by prepping the shift by making sure coffee and tea are brewed, the dining rooms are clean, and everything is stocked for our maximum hours of production. As a trainer, I will talk to guests to make sure that their experience is over satisfactory. I learned how to work together as a team, whether it be to run food, stay and help after hours, or train in another position that is not serving. The management does a good job to help round all of these different skills. The most enjoyable part of the job was to see my guests' faces light up when I could talk to them about personal experiences and college, and what I want to do with my life."
good,"You work very hard on a constant basis. High manager turnover. High employee turnover. Managers are compensated according to cost of living, but hourly employees are not. Therefore in many states, workers are paid much lower than all other restaurants. It is hard to keep employees and the work strain falls on the managers."
good,"As a dishwasher, you are a busser as well. Weekends can be a little hectic and you can get easily behind on your work. If you can work fast then I would recommend. The pay is good and you are eligible to grow in the company, also able to be eligible for a raise after the first month."
good,Some of the managers are actually really cool but the problem with this job is they aren't always respectful. The workers there are very helpful and are willing to help when it's needed.
good,There was always something to do even when it was slow.  At times it got hectic even chaotic but the team always made it fun and we helped each other out.  Legitimately I always had so much fun with my coworkers and my guests in the short time I was there.   Managers could be tough but they always cracked up too and ran the store very very well. Would recommend to anyone who needed to work and learn the ropes as a server.
good,They were very family oriented and great at pleasing guests. The management was very good and the employees were well involved in team work and helping others.
good,"Pretty good place to work with good food. Hard to learn the menu, but it's a great place to start out as a server, as if you can learn the menu here, you can learn it pretty much anywhere."
good,"Busy but rewarding, loved managing my people. Very much enjoyed interacting with the customers. Especially enjoyed seeing all the new merchandise come in."
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel, I got the experience to take courses on how to be a people pleaser in a customer service environment. I'll take what I learned at Cracker Barrel to my next restaurant. The hardest part of the job was that it seemed the managers never prepared well for peak periods. We often run out of food before the next food truck came. Besides the stress management put on the workers in all areas of the store, I appreciate the time I worked at Cracker Barrel"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"A typical day wasn't too busy unless it was during dinner time or a holiday. It was an easy job and a good environment. There was good teamwork between the hosts, servers and managers."
good,I worked at Cracker Barrel for 3 years and I am still currently there. I’m going to school however so I can get into a career that was meant for me. It was a great place to earn money to pay for college and get my through my late teen years as it was a steady job with a decent and expected work environment for a restaurant.
good,I enjoy working at Cracker Barrel.  We have a lot of regular guests and they enjoy the cracker barrel experience. The company makes sure they give the tools to succeed.
good,"Hours were flexible with my school schedule at the time of employment when i was in college. It made for a decent income while in school. I doubt the job title I carried back then would support my standard of living currently but if I would have stayed with the company I'm sure there was opportunities to grow with the company."
good,Managers are helpful with every part of the store and restaurant areas. We approach each customers with a family friendly smile and ready to give them the Cracker Barrel experience.
good,Overall a company that outlines its mission and tries to loosely follow the edict.  Interpretations of the meaning and value of each criteria are widely diverse.  Sometimes this is used as a leverage point to de-value people.
good,Great job overall no complaints really. I had a simple task at work and always got the job done. I’d go back if possible. The employees didn’t really say much though.
good,"I really enjoyed my experience, learned a lot about customer experience from being a server, host, and retail salesman. I also learned a lot about hard work, being a teamplayer, taking/receiving advice,and being a kind and positive person. I would recommend cracker barrel to anyone especially for a first time job because it teaches you so much."
good,"I started at Cracker Barrel when I was in dire need of a job after leaving the military. While I originally intended to be a host or work in the store, I ended up becoming a server. I quickly became a sort of head-server, as I would arrange the station assignments and closing side work for the rest of the team members when I went in, and would check out the other servers' side work and tables before they would be allowed to leave for the evening. I had several regulars that would see me weekly and some even followed me when I left for a nearby restaurant. There is a lot of side work involved in being a server at Cracker Barrel, but it's not mindless work. There's a reason for all of the rules. It was a fun place to work and if I had been willing to working mornings, there's a lot of money to be made."
good,"Love working here and all my fellow coworkers. Its rare to find managers who actually care for their staff but at CB they do. However, we were always so short staffed which required us to do a huge amount of work in the small shifts we were giving which made our pay seem less than what we should've been getting for the amount of work being put in. Other than that, amazing company to work for!"
good,Cracker Barrel is overall one of the most caring companies I've ever worked for.  They take a direct interest in their employees and have many programs set up to make sure that everyone succeeds.
good,"Very fast paced that can get quite hectic quite fast. If everyone helps each other as they were trained to and as they should, then the job is not as stressful. I loved the interaction with the guests. This job offered beautiful experiences one right after the other."
good,"A typical day starts with the morning meeting to discuss the goals and objectives for the day.  The job is very fast paced and requires a lot of attention to detail, as you are dealing with preparing food to order.  Luckily, the management and team at Cracker Barrel are very helpful.  However, it does become difficult when you reach bottlenecks and get thrown off task.  Usually, it's pretty easy to recover.  At the end of most days, the position is financially rewarding and the relationships that you build with your colleagues and the guests is what's most rewarding."
good,Workng at cracker barrel at a young age was fun and taught me alot about the workplace in the coming years. The customer base was very friendly and always was a joy to serve.
good,It’s a great company to work for. They have pretty good benefits and paid vacations after a year of employment. Flexible schedules was my favorite part of working there.
good,My review of the Cracker Barrel Old Country Store was very fun knowledgeable. I learned a lot working on Long different people from different diverse backgrounds and cultures
good,Cracker Barrel is very fast pace. It isn’t a job for relaxing . If you can make it at Cracker Barrel you can make it anywhere . You’ll need to learn to work as a team player
good,well cracker barrel is a nice country restaurant to work at and dine there too.  I belive that if u succeed there they will work with u during your time there
good,"100% employee driven company"
good,Very busy year round. Must work all holidays except for Christmas day. Great management. Room for growth. Hard for first time grill cooks and servers.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Throughout my time will the company I have learned they will prepare you for success so......you don't have to  worried about that.  But it's all about how you going to do it.
good,"It might have been that my situation was more stressful than others because our CB was already shorthanded when I arrived, but we were short on sales and the manager was....Not the best when it came to breaks or days off. However, The manager was a nice person, and the crew was a lot of fun. I'll miss the people dearly. The company I don't know so much."
good,This is a good position if you're in between jobs or careers in your life. This is also good for teenagers or young adults to get customer service experience.
good,I loved working there but they won't give me the hours. They wanted me to do night maintenance and I did not want to do that and I wanted to keep doing dishwasher like I have been doing.
good,"I enjoyed working at cracker barrel. they show the standards in which high volume is done and done well. In their training program, I saw one of the most organized companies, and a very high standard."
good,"- you were never bored"
good,Its a ok place to work sometimes there is issue it about pleasing the guest overall its a decent company you do learn alot you learn how to multi task and how to become very fast at cooking
good,"Cracker Barrel is for a very specific type of manager. Especially if you aspire to be a GM. If you're afraid to cook, don't apply. You'll be in position a fair amount but not too much. However, the company asks a lot and holds people to crazy high standards. The belt is tightening faster every year."
good,A typical shift at Cracker Barrel was 4-5 hours. I learned how to properly treat the guest and make sure they had everything they needed. I also learned how to use a cash register in a quick and efficient way. The workplace environment was great and everyone loves the way things were done. The most enjoyable part of the job was defiantly seeing the smiles on everyone's faces when they left.
good,"Fun , very fast paced environment. Teamwork and dedication are important parts of the job. The hardest part of the job is when theres a rush, things tend to get a little out of control. You have to be able to listen to the needs of the guest, servers, and managers while still being able to get the food out in good quality and in a timely manner."
good,"lots of employees so you always had help, i loved the people i worked with, great management, always had breaks, the atmosphere was always nice there."
good,"I loved my job here and hated it that I had to leave. Even though it got very stressful, especially during rush hours/holidays, everyone was always encouraging each other on. I made so many connections here, and the managers were the most caring and kind people I've ever had the pleasure of working with."
good,i usually worked long shifts so i came in early and stayed late. i would get a break in between my shifts. this was usually on the weekend. it is a good job to learn how to handle different types of people- some customers are rude some tip you $100 depends on who you get. great place to work.
good,Loved all of my co-workers. Out of all my managers there was only one I had a problem with. Very team oriented and very good place to work if student in school.
good,Management was okay. Co workers were fun to work with. The environment at cracker barrel was good. Safe workplace. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude guests.
good,"I enjoyed working at Cracker Barrel. The staff and management there is great. They are really friendly and helpful. From the back of the house to the front, Cracker Barrel is filled with kind, warm, and gentle people."
good,Cracker Barrel was in all a fun place to work. It was a fast paced environment during busy days but fairly slow paced at other times. The only thing i experienced negatively was a lack of hours.
good,Expect managers to work 60+ hours and General managers clock out with 70+.  The pay is well above average for most restaurants however expectations are a lot higher as well
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Cracker Barrel is a wonderful place to work with positive managers and team members. Most days at work are filled with talking to customers, cleaning the store, pricing items, and pushing sales. Sales goals are highly important to Cracker Barrel, and they aim to achieve this through quality guest interaction. However, sometime guest interraction can be difficult. Many of Cracker Barrel's customers are older. These guests may be hearing impaired, grumpy, or overly-religious, making guest interractions awkard. More often than not, however, the guest interractions are positive."
good,"its a fairly good job to work, if you were a college student or something, great benefits, and discounts. The guest tips excellent, its in a good neighborhood to work in."
good,"A typical day at Cracker Barrel would include but not limited to, Clearing off tables, Talking with people, Bringing the buckets filled with syrup and plates etc. I would take that to the back where I would then clean the plates etc. I would also clean the entire kitchen and dining area after hours."
good,"it is a difficult job but rewarding.  high expectation but given the tools to achieve these expectation.  very progressive, always changing to improve."
good,Crackerbarrel doesn't take care of employees like they use to. Now it is all about the dollar. They have taken a lot of privileges away from hard working employees
good,Its a corporate job so there are stupid rules that make the job a pain sometimes but for the most part the jobs pretty good. Management could use improvement.
good,"Loved it loved the people and customers everyone is so friendly ! Very fast paced. Good food, the managers are good to accommodate time off and if your in college they work around your schedule !!"
good,"Daily work flip-flops between very easy with few customers to very stressful with a lot of customers. The employees and managers are understanding. It is a good first job to get your foot in the door and experience under your belt, but there isn't much room for improvement."
good,work is very fast paced on certain days the management is friendly and so is the staff. Our motto is pleasing people at the barrel and deal with people hands on even as a dishwasher when bussing tables and greeting guests.
good,"The food at Cracker Barrel is great, the customers are perfect but the management isn't so friendly. Its hard to get time off work, but a set schedule is nice."
good,Cracker Barrel was a great place to work. I loved the environment and the people. Unfortunately the management at the time was not the best and I decided to leave because of it.
good,I have learned that sometimes you have to read people's minds because they don't know what they are ordering or doing until you tell them.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the coworkers and the hardest part of my job are the guests.
good,"I have enjoyed working at Cracker Barrel. A typical day involves greeting guests, connecting with each guest on the sales floor, checking people out at the register in a paced but polite way (don't rush but don't take your time), ensuring all displays are organized and stocked, and to check the bathrooms every 30 minutes."
good,"The day consists of normal serving duties as well as constant up keep of silverware. I learned how to multi-task and work as proficiently as possible. Management changes often, as well as the employees. Everyone is there to communicate and be a part of a team. The hardest part of the job is working long hours on weekends and Holidays. The best part of the job is getting to meet all types of interesting people."
good,"Overall management is really great. Retail manager is very hard working and easy to get along with. Flexible schedule and and a easy work day. Weekends are very busy, but do-able."
good,"table touch with every guest, some what a lace of family life which was not expected  could have changed focus on guest needs leave that wow feeling to every on you incounter"
good,I enjoyed my time I spent at Cracker Barrel as an employee. I felt that I really grew as a waitress while learning to cope with some of the set backs of this job.
good,Cracker Barrel taught me a lot about the basics of a functioning restaurant and customer service. They allowed me to work around my class schedule and were understanding when it came to getting shifts covered for school functions.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,You will be bounced around from position to position if they see that you are able to do it. The restaurant is nearly always busy and the guests and waitresses both are rude.
good,For the many years that I have worked at Cracker Barrel it has been a great experience for me I have made a lot of friends and met a lot of people It is a very fast paced workplace And I love the people I work with
good,"Overall, I liked working at Cracker Barrel. There are standards for everything, so nothing to argue over. Most people at my location were genuinely friendly people who would work as a team. There are no breaks or chances to sit down and shifts often go longer than scheduled due to clean-up duties. The tips and pay are good but no benefits are offered to non-salary employees. There is a par system that allows one to advance and receive further training and larger discounts in the retail store."
good,It's a very good company to start with for part time. I would recommend if you would want to have a job for the first time. We worked on the retail side and was on cash. Management is nice.
good,I enjoyed every day walking into work because I knew someone I liked was working that day. Management was extremely friendly and they were focused on helping the servers with unhappy guests.
good,This company was a wonderful company to be associated with. I enjoyed the people. The employees give the place life and balance. I left for advancement reasons.
good,"Everything was great until you got in trouble, nice management. Guests came in and treated with respect. The food was delicious and people always loved coming back."
good,"title says it all, this was my first job and looking back it was far better than other jobs I have held. Good atmosphere to work in. People are willing to teach you how to do you job or perform better."
good,"Typical days include managing diningroom and taking care of guests who eat there. I have learned how to please people and to do my job efficiently. Management is very rude and shows a lot of favoritism and if you are not one of their favorites you will never get promoted at this company.The culture has changed drastically since the first owner died because the managers and the company do not care about the employees, only financial gains."
good,"Fun place to work overall! The only big problem I experienced was with favoritism. Both with cooks and hostesses, they “hook up” their “friends” and make it hard for others to make money.. and in my experience, management did nothing about it!!!!"
good,It was a great place to work some of the managers made it difficult at times. I would definitely work there again though given the opportunity. Then flexible scheduling was a plus.
good,It was good place to work and has good benefits I trained people on company polices the management  was okay at best It was very stressful and easy at times
good,"I enjoyed Cracker Barrel, but I had to leave b/c my mother got sick and I took some time off from working.  What made this job fun is the FOH and assisting the servers and doing table touches.  There was a retail store there and this was also a fun part of the job."
good,I really enjoyed working with this amazing group of people. Our managers and fantastic and work very well with everyone there. The most difficult part about working there is not going into overtime!
good,I learned so much working here you are able to advance and work any and all positions once you proved you were a hard worker and did what needed to be done you can begin as a dish washer and eventually become management
good,"I love the food, environment, my coworkers, the discount, the gift cards they gave for Christmas.  There is no growing or advancement here but the money was worth it"
good,Easy job not stressful and very flexible with schedule. Guests are usually nice all co-workers are willing to help if needed. The meal discount makes the day much better at the end of a long shift.
good,"i loved working here. its a quick pace work place and its always busy. made a lot or friends here to. all and all as far as corporate jobs go, this one is a grate place to start Cracker Barrel"
good,"Good place to work fun  environment, fast pace, good people!!! But  management wasn’t all that great. You learn something new every day they give you great discount of food. Training class was awesome you learn a lot but you better be able to peform when you’re on the floor.Management was my only problem the weren’t even on the same page most of the time!!"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"I learned mostly about the sales market and how to sell. Another thing that I learned, and eventually loved, was doing stock room. I am one of those people who loves to see things organized."
good,"Overall this was a very fun and extremely busy place to work but the tips you would walk away with after every shift was amazing, especially on Sunday mornings/afternoons."
good,It was a nice job to get through school. Management was usually available to help. Co-workers were extremely nice and helpful. had a great time when I went to work.
good,"I was hired as a grill cook and went through their training process. I was trained for other positions like prep, dish, and back up cook. I would be scheduled for grill and get bumped to other positions or be asked to stay later because someone had called off or not shown up. If you stay busy, clean when in down time, and can handle quick fast paced stress during meal hours you can get down time to do job chores during the off times..."
good,I had a lot of fun at Cracker Barrel.  It was the co-workers that made the job enjoyable.  The guests were also super nice.  If you did your job well then management liked you.
good,I cant live on minimum wage for the stress i had to put up with. Management was racist and horrible. Has raises and benefits but still i couldnt live on what I was making.
good,I loved it.it was a great work place.the manager need to work together more..more communication to each other always....the staff knows when manager are not working together.we the staff fill the vibe..no negative from managers from each other.
good,It was a nice place to work. My son is in sports they did do everything they could do to make sure I got out on time. the work place was positive most of the time
good,"Easy, fast paced environment with great people to work with the holidays are always fun and the fire place gives you serious warmth when you get cold in the fall and winter"
good,Worked here for 3 and a half years. Turn over rate was pretty high but that's to be expected in a college town. Went through a lot of managers in the time I was there
good,"Decent job, friendly staff. Would recommend to someone who is still in high school, or someone who is retired. The only down fall of working in the retail part of the store, is the hours. 4-6 hours a day, possibly 12 hours a week. But really that's the only sad thing about it."
good,"I definitely got to work in the most enjoyable part of Cracker Barrel, the retail store. I enjoyed learning about all the products in the store. The management staff was pretty friendly. Really the only thing I didn't like about the job was it wasn't good pay or good hours. And they had some specific rules about hair color, fingernail length, and Oxford shirts. ONLY oxford, which are a little expensive, especially if you're just beginning to work."
good,"Good training"
good,Cracker Barrel has the great guiding principle of pleasing people. Skill test make. Employees very knowledgeable about their jobs. Managers are on top of customer issues.
good,Cracker  barrel is an excellent place to work. The money is good and its very fast paced. The team is friendly and are very helpful. Been there a year and I hope I continue to work there for many more years.
good,"Great Company to work for well trained staff.   Resources for great training on labor, supplies and food cost.  Chances for growth  with in the company."
good,"Since leaving I have heard it went a little down but while there it was actually a very good place to work, the people there were like a family and very supportive, not hard to deal with the management either, very understanding."
good,"I learned it was very important to understand that a lot of people have different views. "
good,"This was my second job in high school. It was a lot of fun working here, especially around holidays. I miss working here, I just wanted to get out of food industry."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Management is great, especially towards their employee's. "
good,"Being a food service job, it is difficult, but there is lots of opportunity to move up the ladder. Pay is good. Many of the employees have bad attitudes, but they don't last long."
good,I love working here more than my other jobs. I don't have to worry about my food sitting in the window or my guests waiting too long if I get busy with something else.and I like not having to tip  out any one
good,A nice place of employment. Most of the team enjoys working together and accomplishing the same goals. We all strive to keep our guest happy and satisfied.
good,"Management was superb, wages were to be expected, the general demeanor of individuals existing in employment at Cracker Barrel varies and the quality of life of those employees is subsistence-level."
good,"I love greeting a guest and being able to make that connection with them, because i want them to feel comfortable while ordering and eating at our Cracker Barrel. I have learned to be faster in taking orders and making sure their food and drinks go out. The hardest part of the job is dealing with guests who are sometimes rude and take advantage of our excellent guest service. On the other hand, i enjoy meeting new people, and making them happy by fulfilling their need for food."
good,"It was a fine place to work, I had a falling out with one of the managers, but overall experience was decent. Friendly staffing, but often times I had to clean the opposite gender's restrooms and on multiple occasions had men ignore the sigh and barge in to start doing their business while I was in their cleaning. Not good or safe"
good,I started there when it was still new and it was busy off the bat. It was overwhelming at times but I had great co workers that were team players and managers that were always there to help. I learned a lot about customer satisfaction and team work and I still hold onto the knowledge I learned from working here.
good,I enjoyed working there as a server. There was times I couldn't make it to work and another server could pick up my shift. The managers were easily to get along with and was there to help when needed.
good,"If you do your job as is intended, you will have plenty of opportunity to move up the chain & will do pretty well with the pay raises. It is a very fast pace place to work & the guest are your #1 priority.The employees are great to work with & feels like 1 big happy family. As for the managenent, they need work!!!!"
good,It is a friendly environment where employees work together to ensure the best of service is given to our guests. I have learned a great deal on how to bring about  the best experience for guests.
good,"Great atmosphere to work in, and wonderful people. I enjoy the fast-pace environment, even if it can get stressful at times. The weekends are definitely our most busiest times, however, their are usually enough servers on to make them manageable. "
good,"Great place to work, management is good, professional and cares. They support you. Franchise owners are frugal, tough to get new equipment.Quality of life good"
good,Everyday was a good work flow and lots of side tasks to choose from. Scheduling was something of a concern but was looked into by the staff. Nice place
good,I loved this job all the way until the end. it is almost like a small community in almost every sense. the benefits are amazing and the food is half off for employees as well as the merchandise in the store.
good,Hard job in weekends. They need to improve their leadership Sometimes there are too much confusion. For heavy season they should hire more people to attend the demand.
good,Cracker barrel is a pretty good place to work. Great for a high school student just looking to make a Lil change. Or awesome for a second job. Its a convenient store. So dome customers may get rude because EVERYONE is required to show their ID. But as long as you do your job you shouldn't have any issues.
good,Very good job to work great team and very clean store. Pay is okay could be better but other than that I liked working at Cracker barrel. They are very helpful and get you to be a people person.
good,"Decent place to work, money is decent. Management is average. Good shifts available. Gets pretty busy on the weekend. Lots of travelers from out of town"
good,"Good company , overall very good company to work for.  Require a lot out of Management and employee positions. Not a very balanced work life home life environment. But overall great company that strives for more each and every day"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Fun place to work. Very little opportunity for advancement. Enjoyed my time with company. I would recommend CBOCS to anyone looking to get into the restaurant/retail field
good,"I really liked the management here when I worked at this Cracker Barrel The most enjoyable part of my job was seating customers and scripting them and yes sometimes even joked around with them.."
good,"Management is nice enough. It's a great place to develop your people skills, if that is what you are looking for. Too many servers on some days. There are days when they run out of the most random things, so inventory could be done better. Coworkers are nice and get along well."
good,"great company, awesome team players, very productive environment. I enjoyed the knowledge I've learned and presented great customer service."
good,"Cracker Barrel has a very nice, friendly and hardworking staff. I got along with most of my co-workers. The managers there are so  mean and they don't treat most of the employees the same, they show a lot of favoritism. some of the managers are so unprofessional. The food there is so awesome though!"
good,The typical day at cracerbarrel is pretty fun and goes by quickly. Depending on what shift your working you might have to deal with two rushes during the day or just the dinner rush at night. The only thing that gets difficult is when you sell out of something that causes a back up in ticket times.
good,"I personally love my job. Every day is something new. My typical day starts with cleaning up whatever last shift didn't do, and getting ready for dinner. Management is great, they're fun and willing to work with you. The communication in the building is probably the best of it all. There really is no ""hardest part"" of my job. I enjoy it most when it's busy and i'm kept on my toes."
good,"Great environment, advancement is possible and time consuming. Great co-workers and management, really good attitudes. Pay scale is on a timed scale, eligible raises after so many months worked. I liked that."
good,"Cracker Barrel is a good, reliable place of employment. With it's flexible working hours it's great for college students and part-timers. The discounts and vacation pay are just a few benefits of working for Cracker Barrel. Like any job it has its ups and downs."
good,"I have worked int he retail store for 5 years as a retail associate and cashier, and now am the retail shift leader. i have lasted this long because the flexibility to allow me to go to school and work. 35% employee discount, 50% off meal when working, and a few goodies like employee xmas gift cards and employee gatherings. but over time has been focusing too much on all the money number without thinking that many people dont have the money to both eat ans shop and then the company believe we are not doing our job."
good,"Working at cracker barrel gives you many duties but nothing completely unexpected. There is a huge split between lobby and dining room experience though, not much communication between workers."
good,"Cracker Barrel has a fun and comfortable workplace environment. Management is understanding of family and life situations, they seem to actually value their employees"
good,Basically I feel I work really hard and not paid enough for how hard the work is and since I'm the only girl working in dish I feel when something goes wrong fingers point at me when its not really my fault I basically feel since I have a Ged I should get paid more so I'm looking for a job that's not a nasty and stinky lol and doesn't leave me soaking wet after I'm done working and that pays me more
good,"A typical work day would consist of me waking up and getting dressed for work. (Not putting the hours down because I never knew when I was going to work)"
good,Was a great introduction to sales and customer service. Loved working in a small town location and getting to know customers on a first name basis.
good,"I loved working at Cracker Barrel. The food is amazing, and I loved the idea of having a quirky little store that people could shop in before or after meals. I got to know the regulars, and loved when they'd come in to say hi. Hardest part of the job was probably just reorganizing everything after a busy day. My co-workers made the day very enjoyable, and I became close friends with them even after I no longer worked at the company. I learned that I can be persuasive in up-selling things."
good,"It was a fun place to work during high school, but the hours were to short. There was alot of great people in a friendly enviroment."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I loved working here the first month until i realized the cracker barrel doesn't pay you your full $2.13/hr. I would only get paid about $5-$7 a week including tips which would be gone by the end of the week.
good,Its a good to job to work everyone positive and fun to work with. Everyone plays around even the managers but its also a good to job to make sure there is teamwork and everyone is getting along and on top of there work.
good,Overall very good work environment. The people you meet are very sweet and the people you work with are very helpful. Great job for part time.
good,"The environment is fun -loving and strict.  The ultimate goal is ""pleasing people"" where the guest experience should never out way the employee experience."
good,"I really enjoyed my time with Cracker Barrel. I ran the gift shop and cash area but spent a lot of time helping out in the kitchen too. I got to go help out in several stores and overall, the level of friendliness of the managers and employees, the efficiency of the staff, and the quality of service were pretty consistent."
good,"I have worked at Cracker barrel for 10 years, I became a skilled server trainer after 2 years with the company.  I am the opening shift leader Monday-Friday.  This job has been beneficial for me by giving me flexibility and a steady cash flow.  I work with many different types of people on a daily basis and help make the shifts run as smooth as possible."
good,love meeting people from all over the world. fun place to work . hetic at times but loved the challenges that i occured. enjoyed getting to do differtent jobs
good,"I enjoyed the fast pace work environment. I was able to build a special request customer base that secured me with a reliable income. I worked at Cracker Barrel for sixteen years, however, it came a time for a change. I missed the experience."
good,"fun and easy going workplace"
good,"The job was pretty fun. The only thing was on a Sunday morning it could get very busy. Also Thanksgiving is mandatory, but you only have to work about four hours."
good,Cracker Barrel has train me to be a great skilled trainer and also had great chances to move up with the company I also learn how to become A ETC which is the person who conduct all train classes for new employees skilled training that last for four hours. Over all great company. Employees learned how to work together and become a great team leader. Management is very understanding and fare to all employees. They also build a great working relationship with each employees. Hardest part is dealing with short staff shifts when business comes to its peek hours.My most enjoyable part is meeting new people every day and interacting with the guest daily.
good,"I work as a host. A typical day at work depends on whether or not you're opening for the day and working alone, or you're coming in as a second or third host. I'll explain opening for the day. You first retrieve the Ipad and floor plans from the manager's office and update the restaurant dining room management system, since hosts tend not to come in until 07:30(weekends) or 08:00(weekdays). After that you would collect all of the menus and organize them, then you would check the cooler, empty the catch, and refill the ice because it would have mostly melted from the previous night. If the fireplace is lit, be sure to keep adding logs as necessary. At 10:30 change the feature board from the breakfast feature to the daily lunch feature. Fold and insert crayons into the children menus if necessary. Greet guests with a genuine smile, script the feature to them, and assign them a table based on server rotation (dining room management system will help you with this). During this job I learned how to better interact with the general public and how to keep them relatively happy. Positivity and a smile will take you a long way in that aspect. I learned how to better multitask and communicate with managers and co-workers to ensure a smooth shift. I learned how to deal with complaints and how to bounce back from mistakes I may have made. The managers at the particular store I work at are fantastic for the most part, I have very few complaints. They have great personality and treat the lower workers as actual people and everyone jokes around with each other a lot. As long as you're doing"
good,Working there was an amazing experience. I was able to work and interact with employees and customers in a polite and friendly environment.
good,It was a polite and wonderful work environment that I enjoyed going to. The staff and employees were kind but the customers were the best part of my job.
good,I have been employed with the company for a number of years. The job gets a little frustrating at times but what job doesnt? You make plenty of friends. Everyone for the most part is real friendly. Theres always something to do but can also laugh and talk while doing it. I would definitely recommend this company to others
good,"This is a great Place to work, Specially for those looking for Part-Time work. Caring place, eventually you become like family, with repeat customers and friendly employees that keep coming back. Many server positions available and they always want help in the kitchen, since they do make a lot of items from scratch. Don't forget the Retail store. Each location has an average of 200 employees, so they are almost always hiring."
good,"Prepping drinks and silverware would be how a typical day started, handling customers and cash until my closing cleaning duties. I learned how to work fast here, management was very upbeat and positive. My co-workers never let each other struggle. Helping customers was the funnest part."
good,"it can be a very stressful environment some days, coworkers tended bring outside problems in with them, and I learned you will work with all kinds of people and you can adjust to anything."
good,Cracker Barrel has very high standards for employees and managers alike. They are very open to job advancement and leave the opportunity up to you if you desire to advance. Compensation is above average for the restaurant industry. Work/Life Balance is less than optimal but on par with other restaurant operations.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"A typical day at work with Cracker Barrel was to come in, get ready and hit the floor running. I learned how to handle difficult customers, time management, and multitasking. My managers were wonderful, always looking to teach something new, so that they could advance your position when the time came. They did their raises and advancing according to seniority, but it also had to be earned. The toughest part of the job would have been working doubles. Being a waitress you were on your feet the entire shift, if you worked two shifts you were ready to sleep as soon as you got off. I loved meeting new people every single day, but also getting to see my regulars. I left Cracker Barrel when i received a full time office job and it was just too much to have both jobs. But overall, it was a wonderful first job for me, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for that type of work."
good,"A typical day at Cracker Barrel would include myself and about six to ten other servers working together as a team to help run each others food, do team refills on drinks that might not be in your section, and keeping the kitchen stocked up for peak periods. Of course this also includes me keeping up with my own section by taking orders, delivering food, filling drinks, and dropping checks in a timely manner. Throughout my time working at Cracker Barrel I learned how to manage multiple task at once and how to work in a fast pace environment while staying calm. Management at Cracker Barrel for the most part was great! They were very willing to jump in and help out whenever we needed it, they were understanding people and always had my best interest in mind. I was very thankful for the way they worked around my school schedule. The hardest part of any serving job is learning to deal with the public. The guest aren't always the nicest people but making sure that you keep a positive attitude is important. The most enjoyable part for me working at Cracker Barrel was the bond that I made with my co-workers. I enjoyed working with everyone there because it was really like a team."
good,"When I worked at Cracker Barrel, it was very slow. I found myself bored and watching the clock. It also felt like we were pushing our retail on people. I felt pushy and rude."
good,"Everyone here was wonderful, management consistently helping along with other servers. only problem was poor customer quality, consistent $2 or less tips no matter how good the service, they are not held to a high enough standard to make better tips than that along with the type of people that go to eat there."
good,"Greeted and assembled guests to their issued table, acquiring appropriate communication skills in a professional setting with both customers, and fellow employees. Inspected dining and serving areas to insure cleanliness and proper setup; creating a calming environment for guests."
good,This was a good job with great people. I learned how a big business worked. The management was great and so was their training program. Probably the best training I have had with any job.
good,"Very fun and Family oriented. Great tips, and awesome customers. The management was great. The greatest thing about this job was that we were a family."
good,"Much of the corporate career growth requires relocation to Tennessee. Unfortunately, that is not an option. Great colleagues."
good,"Depending on the shifts you are appointed, a typical day would involve stocking and preparing tables and helping in the back to get things ready for the daily rush. Management was very helpful with scheduling, and being available for any questions which needed answering. Co-workers were great to be around. Most everyone had a great disposition about working with others. The hardest part of the job was when multiple people would call out sick, but that was not an every day occurrence. The most enjoyable part of work was seeing the smiles on customers faces due to the great service you provided."
good,I worked with all staff for the most part that was amazing! You feel like you are appriciated of course of you do what it takes.
good,"As a Par IV Server, it is my responsibility to provide the greatest quality of service to guest both in the dining room and back of house staff. "
good,"Cracker Barrel is overall is a good company to work for. As a server if you put in the effort with your guests and comply to their needs you will do well. Management is like anywhere else, you have helpful and understanding managers, and you have ones that are just, on the clock. The hardest part of the job is keeping your guests satisfied along with all of your other tasks at hand. Some days, you will have  a full section, with very needy guests, a short staff that needs you to greet other tables, seat guests, and run food. It can get hectic, but if you have a good team to work with most days are usually smooth."
good,"Productive, and good money. Managers work with you. Flexible work hours. Nice tip money. Would work here again anytime. Very good about callouts, and personal life experiences."
good,"Busy almost all day, learned to never take life so seriously. you have to laugh and joke. management was the best part of the job, they were always there when you needed them the most. coworkers were cheery and happy all the time. hardest part was no one wanted to stay longer then their shift. best part was playing with the kids and getting beat at checkers."
good,Greeted customers and help them find merchandise that they are looking for and help them wrap if the wanted it during the holidays. kept the shelves stocked and clean. The management was very nice and helpful. The most joyable part of my job is helping the customers find wat they are looking for.
good,"I found Cracker Barrel to be an overall enjoyable workplace. It had its ups and downs, and was fairly hectic on the weekends, but management is very personable and friendly."
good,"All of my co-workers were happy and excited to be there and so was I. Usually I would restock the shelves and greet people as they walked in. If i customer walked by me (within 15 feet) I would say hello and see if they needed any help. I would do my best to sell them our merchandise but it can be difficult when majority of the time, customers only come in to eat and not buy. It was my first job and I learned a lot. How to work as a team and time manage. I learned to step out of my bubble and talk more. The hardest part of the job was getting my sales rate up when I would be scheduled to work only 2 hours. The best part was the learning experience."
good,"At work, I would greet customers, have short talk with them if they struck up a conversation. I worked on restocking products and organizing shelves in my free time. I learned that communication is a big important thing. My manager never gave me more than I could handle,  I am a hard worker, and I enjoyed working out front in the store and making customers happy with what they pick out from Cracker Barrels products."
good,Working here was a tough job. Being a dish washer was not easy. I learned that just because we are a big part of the business and if we fell behind everybody else did as well. Many of my co-workers did work hard and got things done. Others didn't take the job serous and slacked off and it effected the rest of us. The times I enjoyed the most was when everybody was working together and had no problems. Nothing is better then when you get along with your co-workers and management. The management stayed on top of everybody and always made sure things were taken care of and everybody was working together to have a smooth shift.
good,I was charged with spearheading the training program.  The great part was meeting new people and giving them the tools needed for them to do their job well.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,This was my first job. The managers were great and the workers showed impeccable teamwork throughout shifts. I learned teamwork and great customer service skills. The hardest part of the job is that I'm constantly on my feet tending to different things. It all pays off though when you get guests that are friendly and regulars that come in and request you. I always like to hear personal stories from guests and to see smiles on their faces after their meal.
good,"Hostess"
good,"Rang customers out with meals and store product. Paged managerwhen help was needed or they had a phone call. Very fast pace when busy, everyone works well as a team"
good,Meet new people everyday. I really enjoyed this work place. hostess  gave equal setting an money was good. I well enjoy working with my team at night we always had a good flow
good,I really liked the managers here and the ones I worked with were really nice fun and it was awesome. The environment was peaceful and calm. Its really home like. Puts you in mind of Grandma's house.
good,"I would just wash and put dishes away,,prolly take out trash and buss tables if they needed me to. The hardest part of the job proolly was tryna make it a little fun"
good,i offten worked by my self.... lots of team work... i used a flat top and friers
good,"A typical dinner shift was 5-9, which usually meant 5-11 due to the expectation to adamantly run other servers' food after being cut from the floor-plan. Other than that though, it was pretty decent. The opportunities for advancement were very accessible, and the management made sure everyone was trained properly."
good,"Cracker Barrel was my first ""real"" job, and has been a decent one at that. During the slow hours it can be a drag, but friendly employees help pass the time. As far as coworkers go, I enjoyed working with most of them. Occasionally, the servers can be a bit rude to the hosts, but the management does a good job to handle their attitudes. "
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me coming in and making sure that the hostess stand was stocked and cleaned so that I was fully prepared for my shift.  I learned how to keep my servers happy by seating in a specific rotation. When it was busy and there weren't many open tables I learned how to retain from seating certain tables so that we could seat the parties that came into the restaurant. I worked with an amazing group of people.  They took their job seriously but were enjoyable to be around.  The hardest part of my job was seeing guests I got to know, that had been regulars going downhill with their health. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to see guests leave with a smile on their face and the employees leave with a smile on their face."
good,I loved working for them the people were great the store itself was well run. but i did not get enough hours.
good,"doing dishes "
good,Meeting and greeting guests.  Making all of our customers feel welcome.  I learned about our many different products and how meet the needs of our customers.  Our management team was extremely helpful and fair to the employees.   I loved my co-workers.  They were all very friendly people.  The hardest part of the job was when it was slow.  I loved it when we were busy.  I loved interacting with the customers.
good,"A day at work was to make sure all customers were greeted and spoken to about what was going on in the store, what sales were new, what products were new and that when they finished their dining experience to come and browse the store and enjoy the atmosphere."
good,"As a server assistant I spend my day in the ""QA Window"". I check the food and garnish it. I communicate between the grill cooks and the servers. The hardest part of my job is dealing with a rush. The co-workers are friendly, but they can get stressed easily."
good,You have to be fast moving and be able to multitask. I have learned to work with a team. Management is good. Co-workers are like a family.
good,I loved my job at Cracker Barrel. The only downfall was there was not enough hours to be equally passed around to more qualified employees.
good,"take orders and handle money. sometimes you could go in and make nothing, other times make alot."
good,"Cracker Barrel was a very nice place to work, the people who worked there are very nice, they do a great job of training all of their employees."
good,"Enjoyed working here. I worked in the retail side of the store. A typical day will center around either morning shift or late shift. Work is split between three jobs, the casheir who checks out guest and watched the cash stand, the stocker who will clean and stock the floor and check in deliveries, and a sales person who will try to influence guest in the gift shop. typically you will be rotated between one or two of these jobs. Morning shift will turn everything on and unlock the store. Late shift will clean and make sure the store is ready for tomorrow. Sometimes the store will be very busy, but a lot of the time there is too much standing around."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"I would go to meetings, clean houses, run errands, make phone calls.  Always professional with having to deal with so man people."
good,Educated employees on company products and regulations. Help provide satisfaction to all guest. Ensure accuracy and quality of all food and products. While working with an amazing team.
good,"offered great benefits such as 401k and insurance to servers. Also, had a facebook page to help exchange shifts which was very nice. Co-workers were fun once you got past the first few months where they basically ignored or hazed you. "
good,The management and employees were terrific. The fast-paced environment at The Cracker Barrel could get overwhelming at times but for the most part it was a great place to work.
good,"typical day at work"
good,I loved working as a chef creating food for customers was very rewarding. I worked with a great group of people and loved going to work every day.
good,"Excellent company for students with flexible work schedule, benefits for part time employees, advancement available."
good,i was a dishwasher a bus person prep cook  made rolls i got along great with my coworkers and management never had any problems
good,"waiting on others in a friendly atmosphere"
good,"Looking back it was a great place to work.... I was there during some trying times with the lawsuits, but I should of stayed.."
good,Cracker Barrel is honestly a great place to work. The atmosphere is laid back and being there can be fun. The corporation has high expectations for its employees and has set in place all kinds of training with tasks and rewards. However working here can become overwhelming due to scheduling or personal issues with management. Im sure this varies from store to store and even person to person. Cracker Barrel assures you from the very beginning that you are not guaranteed a break or a meal.
good,I usually work shifts from 1 in the afternoon until 11 in the evening. I do my best to be clear and concise to the customer and get them whatever they need by providing excellent service. I have learned that provided for the needs and wants of the customers is the best way to handle a table. My co-workers are easy to deal with and fun to be a round and we have a strong management staff for support. The hardest part of the job is when it is slow because I like to remain busy all the time. The most enjoyable part is to satisfy the customer and get good tips.
good,"Cracker Barrel was a great company to work for. I was paid very well. Overall I really enjoyed my work with Cracker Barrel. We had some great employees. I enjoyed a great relationship with staff members. With their help we were able to get through some extremely busy shifts. The hardest part was extremely long hours at times. More than my previous management positions, but I was paid very well so I'm not complaining."
good,Its a nice place to work where everyone tries their best to provide great customer service to every single customer.
good,"good experience,  excellent work atmosphere, and management"
good,"I work as a server about 4 days a week night shift usually.  I get along with everyone I work with which makes my job easier and fun."
good,a normal day at cracker barrel can be very calm n chilled. its very slow n not alot to do in the dish room. u can learn alot about working in a dishroom the main thing is when we have all workers there we should work as a team not everybody doin there own thing.the managers can sometime be a pain because when we need help we dont alwayz get it and it does get hard when u only have two people working a dishroom on a very busy day. the hardest part of my job i feel is just working wit very few people n having the people u work with not doin there job. i love working with everybody no matter who it is i just love tha feeling more when we all can work together n get the job done
good,I had a close knit staff that worked hard together. Were playful when the timed allowed. I made many connections with guests that will continue long after I am gone.

good,"Great place to work, very high volume."
good,I learned a lot of ways of handling large and rowdy crowds. The most enjoyable part of my job was during Sundays. We were always extremely busy but that helped me learn to do what I got to do to make the guests happy. I loved my coworkers. We all had the same goal which was to make the guest feel at home.

good,"Working in the Giftshop is great. I work alot with people, which is my favorite part of my job. Shifts are usually between 4 and 6 hours.. Hours usually depend on sales that we make through out the week."
good,"If you can get the good shifts, you're in to win. Great money on Sat and Sun mornings. However, getting those shifts are hard."
good,You were able to help the guest with their selections and gift wrap for them. I learned alot of information about Cracker Barrel the products they carry. Everyone there worked well together. 
good,Awesome place to work as long as you stay away from the druggies!
good,"Greeting and seating guests, fixing drinks and taking to-go orders. The job becomes very routine and tedious. The management was nice the coworkers were friendly. The hardest part of the job was the stress of Sunday mornings. Getting to meet nice friendly people everyday was nice."

good,Typical day
good,"A typical day would consist of cooking for 5 to 10 bus loads of people not including our regular customers. Very busy constant moving with lots of communication. I've learned how to deal with people in hectic situations without losing my cool. Management was very hands on not afraid to jump in and help when needed, and the co workers were awesome. The hardest part of the job was not to compete with your fellow co worker to see who best or who plate looks the best it built character. The most enjoyable part of the job was the relationships i've built over the years."

Everything I went through was just too much to handle at the time.. But they were awesome! Everyone was friendly and caring and always had time to help me when I needed it. But the pay wasnt that good.. Maybe if I would have stayed their longer that could have changed?"

good,"I only left because I was tired of the restaurant work. I started a family and wanted more consistency in my life. Like every place, there are the good with the bad."
good,The team that work for is amazing and I love working with them they could give me more hours but working for them has been great I have learned new stuff
good,Working at Cracker Barrel as a hostess really gave me a clear understanding on the importance of taking care of guests/ customers. If people really see you care about giving them good service they will continue to spend money at your business.
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel has given me the opportunity to serve others and make an impact in their lives, make them feel special, appreciated, and part of our ""family."" The atmosphere is both professional and relaxed/casual. The management has been tremendous with a true ""whatever it takes"" commitment, be that as biscuit maker or dishwasher. Management also treats employees with the highest respect. From management, to servers, to hosts, everyone helps one another, making a combination of leadership and teamwork the keys to success and personal satisfaction at the Cracker Barrel where I work, CB #29 in East Ridge, Tenn."
good,I worked in the back as a cook since I was a jack of all trades I was always needed and wanted the servers were always nice and entertaining so the atmosphere was normally cheerful and full of fun
good,"As a manager we are in charge of daily store operations, from cash to Front of house and Back of house, to retail sales positions. We are responsible for not only making the employees as happy as we can but making sure the guests are receiving great food and great service."
good,"I'd work here again if I could, friendly staff, and a friendly work environment. As well as delicious food and neat things for sale inside the stores shop, it's pretty cool."
good,"Flexible scheduled  days and night and weekends, weekly schedules...weekly pay. Benefits opportunities to work different areas. Discounts and meals and retail items."
good,"I loved Cracker Barrel as a place where I could grow and become a good server; however, the culture feels more like a McDonald's level place. Care is not the main thing and most of my fellow employees lack a sense of professionalism."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,A great place to work great business good tips if it was busy mangers are awesome I would love to work there again great food live the 50% of while on the shift and 35%off the clock
good,"I've worked at 5 different cracker barrels. All of them are pretty much the same. The people become like family, once you start there. Lots of good benifits at this job too."
good,I worked here for a little over a year and enjoyed my time at Cracker Barrel. They were flexible with hours and were easy to work with concerning taking days off and gaining other shifts.
good,"Pleasant Experience . Friendly environment and flexible shift. Training and orientation was welcoming and patient. Great job for those looking for new work, opportunity for growth, and low stress."
good,This job was demanding most times but in the end was typically worth it. Management was pretty decent with the exception of one or two managers who were pretty clueless.
good,It is a very fast paced workplace and they give no breaks. If you are a minor they will give you little to no hours and it doesn't really matter how much you complain about needing hours. Other than that everyone is nice and usually pretty helpful.
good,They have excellent benefits availaile for their employees.  Decent 401k.  You can move up in this company if you have availablity.  It is corporate so some of the rules do not always make sense.
good,"Cracker Barrel was my first job and I really enjoyed working there because it's a perfect place for a first time employee to learn about working with a business. It also helped me learn how to communicate and associate myself with customers, which is also very important when working with a business for the first time."
good,Great place wonderful place to work at. Good people great mangers. They understand how you are and what you need. I love my experience there and would come back if I need too.
good,If you enjoy working at a fast pace and talking to customers. You may enjoy working here. Old fashioned country styled personalities will excel here. Co-workers care for each other.
good,"Quick service restaurant that caters to the travelers on highways all across the US.  Good place to work while in college, as they offer night shifts that won't start until 5pm, giving you the entire day for studies or family."
good,"I learned quick decision making, team work, organization, and time management. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people i worked with, the team work was outstanding. The hardest part of the job was the cramped work space and high temperature work area. Once i got used to it, it was a lot of fun"
good,Cracker Barrel in Saginaw Saginaw has a very friendly  environment and it's a great  place of employment. Employees there were friendly and always had a helping hand for one another.
good,I had a great work experience there at Cracker Barrel. I worked with a group of hard working people who always worked as a team. It was always a friendly environment to walk into.
good,Fast paced restaurant with quality foods and ingredients. Nice staff with good management. Room for advancement through hard work ethic and time put in.
good,"Cracker Barrel overall was a good company to work,focus on employee and guest experience, worked avg 55 hours a week , enjoyed the people nad community envolvement"
good,"I have worked at Cracker Barrel for about 5 years now. I have been through the ringer at this location! It is a very chaotic place to work at times but my team always pulls together and gets the job done the cracker barrel way. It can be very stressful and most likely you will cry on your first day, however if you stick it out and grow some thicker skin it is worth it in the end. The staff there are so caring and supportive of one another and have a tight knitted family at Cracker Barrel. The managers are amazing people. This company gives you amazing opportunities and are flexible with you and helps you in your time of need. The only down side is you'll most likely need to get a second job when slow season comes."
good,"While working here I had a few personal problems with myself and they were really understanding about everything, although I did not get many hours, so I had to find a new job. This is a great place for a first job for teens."
good,I hope everyone can experience the work ethnic this is a great place people are nice it will work you but I like it it’s a great start to the young people serving you will enjoy it
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I really loved working there I loved the environment and the people and my managers. It was a great place i got along with everyone. I left to stay at home with my newborn baby at the time.
good,Cracker Barrel is a warming fun environment. When you walk in to work you are welcomed by other workers. Although you have to hassle for sides that are missing the grill line is very professional and quick.
good,You have to be willing and able to work with many types of people.  From all over the country.  And you cannot have ANYTHING on your background check show up or they won't even consider hiring you.
good,Run grill station or fry or gather all the fixings to make the plates hard work fast paced and fun if you like being busy. Clean and easy to work areas
good,Good place to work great atmosphere and good friendly mangers and co workers good benefits and discounts in store enjoyed my experience working for cracker barrel would to work there again
good,It was a good company to work for.  I learned alot having to do with my customer service skills.  The best part about the job was the tips and the worst part about the job was being over staffed.
good,Everyone that works at this establishment are an absolute treat to be with. I have never worked in a restaurant before but they taught me and made me feel at home.
good,"pleasing people .helping guest with sale of products, cashier  .check people out .clean.  arrange , bring product to the floor  to sell .  people enjoy there visit.at Cracker Barrel."
good,"A typical day at work would be easy although it could get a bit tiring as it could get fairly hot in the back of the kitchen. I learned how to properly buss tables and clean out an industrial dishwasher. The management was very friendly and helpful with any issues and were fairly quick to help you. The workplace culture wasn't anything too special but as for friendliness and helpfulness co-workers for the most part were definitely so. The hardest part of the job was having to work alone as the nature of the job required at least 2-3 people. The most enjoyable part was simply washing the dishes alongside fun, friendly, helpful co-workers and managers."
good,One of the best jobs I've ever had. It's very face-paced but easy to get used to. Could be stressful at times but your coworkers help with the work load. Management was well balanced and they worked around personal emergencies. Hardest part of the job is dealing with rude guests and completing side work. Most enjoyable is having that friendship with all the other employees.
good,"The cracker barrel is a nice place to work. Most of the employees work together to get things done helping each other out .  How ever there are those who never seem to want to help out anyone . They do the minium and go home!  Managers are ok some of them on the line. But cracker barrel has a zero policy forgiveness ,. Remember if you make a mistake against their policy ☠️it'☠️☠️☠️☠️☠️off with your"
good,So far I enjoy working here. Its a very busy location but everything they have on the grill line is easy to put on the grill and easy to get it out fast.
good,I love working at Cracker Barrel. I am a server and it’s good money and my fellow workers feel like family.  Cracker Barrel is a very good place to work with plenty of opportunities.
good,"Overall it's a great place to work. Has it's pros and cons. People are nice to work with, the customers always have their moments but usually some tend to joke around. You'll get around 5 dollars a tables. Which isn't much but that's about the average. Some people will give you between 10-20 dollars. You'll have to get lucky though. Being a grill cook is fun. Not much to say about that, it's basically common sense."
good,"Due the process of pay increase and advancements"
good,"I It is a great place to work, great food, you can learn new things everyday, meet new people. The only thing is that management is doesn’t interact with guest."
good,It's really nice to work at cracker barrel it's just way to hot in the dish room when it's just me working in the dish room when I have to wash dishes and go out them up
good,"Overall a good place to work. So you think your a cook? I did until I stepped in there kitchen :) this ain't no Casino or waffle house gig with 25 seats this is a super busy establishment that will short out the regular cook with a 100 tickets in your face for 8 hours straight on the weekends :). The plus side is that they teach us, ""like me"" that no matter how good you are on the grill you can't do it all on your own. There dedication to instilling TEAMWORK IS BY FAR THE BEST AROUND!! EVERY Manager there is par 4 and have been awhile I'm sure. They will step in help out and help get you through that rush. I was really impressed by that. I'm not gonna lie if you cant handle being slammed 6 out of 8 hours mainly on breakfast shifts sat and Sunday this job is not for you and will give you anxiety knowing you have to work breakfast on the weekends :). But overall the knowledge you gain in there kitchen with ability to work EVERY station if your a good worker prepares you for any commercial kitchen around. There safety and paid computer advancement courses give you the knowledge to exceed and accel in any restraunt chain in the u.s.. I would work there again."
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel as a server or host can be fun. When serving, a typical day would end with doing sidework in the kitchen, cleaning the dining room, and rolling a bin of one hundred (100) silverware, then getting your tips. For hosting, at the end of the shift there is little to no sidework. After working here, I've learned how to be more personable and work in stressful setting, because it is a little difficult at first if you've never work at a restaurant. The management is hit or miss. It's either a great manager or a completely terrible one. The workplace culture is also hit or miss. There are days when people help each other out and others when you have to fend for yourself. It can get stressful. The hardest part of the job may be when one has a large party (nine (9) and up) alone and also other tables. For hosting, it may be when gets complain about wait times and tables. The best part though, is being able to hang out with friends but also make a difference in people's days."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,As my first real job it’s good. I like the atmosphere for the most part. Some guests are rude but you have to think about how their day is going and consider that the guest has been sick or found out some bad news. Just give the guest what they want and they will be happy. Go out of your way for the guests and the feedback is rewarding. Management is decent some are better than others. Communication needs to be better on management side.
good,The company itself is one of the best out there unfortunately not all locations meet the standard and it doesn't look like it is going to change anytime soon
good,I come in make sure the lines stock with fresh food and then make sure we stock up for the day In if we have some dishes need to be cleaned I make sure they are done
good,It all depends on management really. I worked in retail and I loved it. I loved the weekly pay. There are great opportunities for advancement there. Not a horrible place to work. I just got tired of working retail.
good,"This is a great place to work. The management is pretty great and the employee discount is pretty big. Also, if you're there for over a year, you get a week paid vacation which is rare for restaurants. The only major downside for servers is that the tips aren't very high because the food is cheap. You get a lot of 20 percent tips, but off of a $14 ticket, the tip comes out to about $2-$5 a table."
good,"i would clock in and go into the dish room where i would grab a buss tub and just go out and clean clean tables. most days were pretty busy, especially around 6 or so, but for the most part it was a pretty enjoyable experience. the management was nice, and the people were very friendly. the only hard part would be carrying the bus tub if you don't have a lot of upper body strength, and the best part is when you get into a flow state and everything just becomes natural and 3 hours seems like 30 minutes"
good,"This is an excellent company to work for if you are trying to get through school or simply need a bit of extra cash on the side. Management tends to be understanding of any schedule arrangements you may need, and they are more than willing to hear you out if any unexpected life events pop up. Be prepared to work, this is a food service job that comes with minimal hands-on training and you will fall behind quickly if you are unable to adapt to the pace expected. Overall, I would highly recommend this company for anyone seeking a food service position, you won't be sorry."
good,Great team players and wonderful guest experience.It was a good company to work for alway room and encouragement to move up.everyone alway worked together and as one that alway makes things run smoother.Good management always there to help you to make sure every guest has a wonderful dinning exsperience.
good,"While working at Cracker Barrel I would seat, greet, and guide people. I would have to answer questions about the menu to those who were looking to dine, or order a To-Go, as well as give menu counts, clean tables, and pour drinks. While working at Cracker Barrel I learned a lot about food, as well as good people skills. Working at Cracker Barrel was made a million times better by the people that worked there, everyone was always kind. The hardest part of being a hostess would definitely be the frustrating customers who didn't understand how certain requests would have to be fulfilled."
good,You will make a new family and learn many people skills. My typical day at work usually begins with me working with my coworkers and making a plan together to get customers seated correctly and quickly. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to greet the customers and make sure that they are satisfied with the restaurant.
good,A great place to work with good benefits. Will work around your schedule. Managers are very nice. New employees come through a lot. Enjoy working with different people.
good,Good place to work at nice environment.. Fast pace teamwork.. Good pay..i live in area managers are easy to get along with understanding and busy place..goid work pay
good,It was a great place to work. I would definitely go back.  They are easy to work for and have a great atmosphere. The guest are great and so is the food.
good,I honestly loved working at Cracker Barrel. I loved the managers and my coworkers. The stress got to me a little bit. The vine fits were great. I hated closing.
good,You have days when it’s super busy and have to be constantly moving! The customers can be hard to deal with. Management can be pretty bad at not being flexible with your schedule. Tips are good!
good,"At Cracker Barrel, I learned how to properly communicate. I was young & not shy at all. I had a hard time saying thing in the right way, everyone there all the way to the cooks, were very helpful until I figured it out"
good,"The Cracker Barrel I worked at had a fun productive atmosphere and was very fast paced. If I could wish anything different I would hope that in the future, management would recognize those who give their absolute all and be grateful for such. Unfortunately, all Servers typically kept their tips and didn't really tip you (the busser) for doing their jobs while they slacked."
good,Great place to work. Very laid back but makes sure you have everything done. Very polite and to the point about what needs to be done and how to do it.
good,I enjoyed my time with them would love to go back had many personal issues causing my job. Overall though a great place to work and advancement can happen you just might have to battle and show your worth.
good,I had to study set of hours that I worked there. Worked with really good ladies. With no drama and respectable people. Managers were Fair and helped out when they needed to.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"I was a hostess at Cracker Barrel, which was an easy and fun position. The main duties you have are taking people to their seats and wiping tables. We used an iPad to show which tables were available and which were taken as well as a bigger screen at the host stand. The environment was pretty relaxed, when we weren't super busy we got a chance to talk to one another and joke around. The management was mostly okay, and they were understanding of time you needed off."
good,"Being a server here required multi-tasking and quick paced thinking as you were responsible for busing all tables, prepping food, serving, cleaning and restocking during a busy work day."
good,"My experiences at Cracker Barrel were great, and I was welcomed with open arms despite being nervous to work as I had no previous experience with food. Expect to be busy all the time, but you get good tips to make up for it! I loved my coworkers and enjoyed coming in to work."
good,Cracker Barrel is a very friendly and calm place to work. Overall experience was great. They have great customers that come daily and great food. I definitely recommend this workplace
good,"-Fast Pasted"
good,"Job detailed checking customers out at registrar from the restaurant and gift shop side. Able to effectively complete PPC, which details putting items on sale and reorganizing the store when needed."
good,it was a slow paced working environment with friendly staff but the management was somewhat careless although they were very friendly but overall i got the most out my time working there.
good,The store that I worked at had a large customer base as it retained regulars and it received travelers on the way to the beach. My coworkers at the time were great. Training for advancement happens regularly.
good,"I loved working at Cracker Barrel, I made plenty of friends and met a lot of different people. I enjoyed being there and all the workers were polite, especially the managers."
good,"Know the foods, if you have any questions ask you manager, follow instructions, smile, don’t be afraid, your first day won’t be bad unless you make it bad"
good,Being a hostess was a overall good job for me. At times it could get overwhelming dealing with the customers especially when it got busy. I enjoyed my coworkers and managers though.
good,"Very busy, customers are always coming in. You must be able to multi task and handle stress with this job or you will not succeed. Pleasant working environment."
good,It’s a fun place to work but it’s hard to get many hours and days to work their are days that are busy and days that are empty it’s best to work their part time to save money but to pay bills and the best place to work
good,They said that they where hiring for a maintenance position with janitor jobs to keep you busy then after a month I quite do too it had nothing to do with maintenance and is a just cleaning up the kitchen and bathrooms!
good,"I loved working at Cracker Barrel, everyone there was so nice and accommodating. It was fast pace sometimes, but for the most part it was pretty easy. I would definitely recommend Cracker Barrel for a first job."
good,very fun working place very positive workplace very good employers and staff treat you with respect. very caring and will go up and beyond to meet the policy
good,The over all store was good.  I enjoyed the customers and the staff within the company and their food was great.  I would still visit here even though I no longer work here.
good,good place to work if you want to make fast and easy money. fast turn over with servers. Fast past working environment. Scheduling wasn't an issue. They give you time off when asked for it.
good,"Friendly staff, but management varies by store. Overall easy job. Provided lots of training. Where I'm at, the management is nice, but inconsistent. Can be stressful."
good,Cracker Barrel has fast pace jobs. It is handwork but having supportive coworkers makes all the difference. If you come in with a can-do attitude you are more likely to have a good work day but you never know exactly what is in store.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Cracker Barrel is a great place to work with flexible hours and friendly coworkers. They also have achievable par levels that increase your pay and discount.
good,The Cracker Barrel is a great restaurant to work for it has a friendly atmosphere and great homemade tasting food. I would recommend working there because the staff is like a family working together to help make the customers happy.
good,I had a great experience working there and would most definitely work there again the staff were amazing to work with they were such great team players and the managers were awesome they really talked and worked with you on what you needed they were really there for us
good,"I was 17 while working there and it was a great first job to have as a hostess. However, it's very competitive and stressful. I wasn't able to balance my work life with my private/school life. I would recommend this place to anyone who is comfortable working in high strung conditions."
good,"Never the same day twice, fun and engaging environment, Collective coaching, large staff. Working as an RM for Cracker Barrel definitely  requires task efficiency, delegation and strong visual merchandising skills. Collaboration with other Management is key to a successful partnership."
good,"flexible schedules"
good,"I absolutely love Cracker Barrel and everyone I work with my only issue is I have complained multiple times that I did not have enough hours and that I would take anything and I’m still not making anywhere near enough. I barely make 9 hours, and this most recent week they only have me scheduled for 4. That is very unacceptable."
good,It was a very fun place to work. Everyone was close. It was very friendly and everyone got along it was like a second home but you didn't live there. Work went by pretty fast but i didn't work much. when people asked for certain seats it made the job harder especially if the seats were taken
good,It would get really busy on a typical day at work but everyone was friendly and a great environment to work here. They are very flexible and will work with your hours.
good,"Truly it was a good job, I was just too young to take advantage of it. I also was only a dishwasher, which I really don't recommend only because it's terrible for the body, but it was all around a good job."
good,"Great potential for growth and advancement.  Good balance of work and life within the company.  Good care and concern for staff, as if they are family."
good,Had to clean tables sweep the floor and take dishes to the back i had to wash them to and make sure they came clean even if people didn't finish i had to clean it.
good,The job was great and they offered many opportunities for advancement. Its very easy to build a career here. The only downside is that they over-hire for most positions then cut everyones hours. When i left this job i was only being scheduled for 12 hours per week
good,Fun and hectic place to work. Super busy most the time. Friendly environment for the most part. Management was fair and friendly for the most part and would work with you on your schedule.
good,"I worked for CB during my college years; and it was flexible and a good work environment. I enjoyed meeting the guests and providing them with a positive experience. "
good,"Cracker Barrel was fun , although some of the employees were rude and nasty to the new comers ! Management really don't address the situations until it has gone way to far !"
good,"An ever day work day for all that are there.  Is to ensure the best quality of service for the guest. That is working in a timely manor.  Also following recipes, procedures; and most important of a typical day at work... is to communicate with all employers.  Because someone is always serving a guest who might need some assistance."
good,flexible hours always have the ability to pick up shifts.what i learned you have to be flexible and adjust doing more jobs than can count. We are responsible for the prep area and the to go phone on top of our normal assist our customers with the food and other needs.
good,"The days vary when it comes to business, some slow, some busy. You have to know how to multitask to get by, and you have to move quickly. I'm sure like any stressful job, you can get into with your coworkers if the stress is overwhelming. It can take a while to get your side-work done when they drastically cut the floor and it gets busy. Then your stuck there taking everyone's food out. I'm usually beat after a shift that's not even 7 hours long. It's a lot of hard work, more work than I imagined when I first started. The management is nice. I'm sure compared to other places it would be considered ""blessed."" It's a very stressful job, and although the tips are good, they don't come in handy if you don't get any hours. That's probably the most upsetting part of the job, is constantly fighting for hours and having a schedule that is not ""set."" One week, you could have 40 hours, and the next you could have 15. You can always pick up shifts, but that's not guaranteed. You get paid weekly, so the paycheck is kind of low (if you're a server), so naturally you rely on tips. The discounts are nice though."
good,"Max of 55 hours ended up being 65 or more a week,went through 5 G.M.s within a 5 yr period...however we did have great employees the benefits are great, meet new people every day,"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Fun environment to work in. They have good food and the people there are really nice. I would go back there and work if I could. There is alot of items on the menu but its manageable.
good,"A typical day at work would start by updating floor plans in the IPad then organizing menus to ensure preparedness for peak periods. The three roles in the host position are seater, lead seater, and caller. Seaters escort the guests to the table. Lead seaters work on the IPad to match floor plans to live dining room action. Caller keeps track of the guest wait list."
good,"This job was only temporary for me to make some extra money for school, but I actually enjoyed working here. I was a prep cook, so I portioned and cut fruit, mean, vegetables, etc. I liked it because I could mind my own business and just do my job without someone breathing down my neck all the time."
good,My experience at Cracker Barrel was good. It was stressful. I got a long with all the other employees. The managers were good. They were helpful. We had q few disagreements on scheduling issues
good,Upper management has to hire x many new people every quarter so it really drains the hours when a lot of people stick past the 3 week make or break it. Had plenty of hours before I took a family vacation with grandparents. When I got back I barely had enough hours to cover living expenses.
good,I really enjoy working for this company. This company has given me a great year of my life. The management has always been most awesome. Waitress is not something I want to do forever.. I'm looking to better my future... because why not? Who doesn't?
good,I enjoy working at Crackle Barrel but I'm ready for a change. Meet great friendly people and the food is great. Just a lot of turn over with hiring employees and managers.
good,"The behind-the-scenes to any business is meant to be a group effort."
good,good place to work pays good. Hours are good. Management is pretty good they will work with you if they can. Overall very good place to work. Tips are good
good,"Very face paced, I liked working there, but it is a busy place.  You are gonna work very fast and hard.  When busses hit it is an all out frenzy, placing yourself is key. Start by sitting then help servers get table drinks, then as they ring in orders you drift back and call things to the kp your gonna need for the big hit, you then go to grill for the out pouring of tickets, when you finish cooking you go to clear tables, then cash to assist with check out.  Like I said I enjoyed it but extremely busy,  But knowing where to be is the key."
good,A very busy and fast paced restaurant. The tips can be very good. The hours are always holidays and weekends  The hardest part is keeping up with the pace of business.
good,This is a fast paced restaurant that is a really good quality because they have cracker Barrells all over the world so most guest know what they want as soon as you greet the table so it makes you turn and burn your tables to make more tips
good,Cracker Barrel is a wonderful place to work.  The Management Team all the way from Headquarters to in-store are very supportive and encouraging.  There are many training opportunities and opportunities for advancement.
good,I have worked here for a couple weeks. Cracker Barrel is a good friendly place to work for teenagers and adults. I would highly recommend this place for anyone to work here it is a good work environment with great managers.
good,"Constant work, doesn't really have real breaks, but was engaging. Cracker Barrel is like family. Always supportive, and management always just wants your best at the end of the day."
good,In my 9 months with Cracker Barrel I met a lot of amazing people. It was a great experience. If transferring had been an option I would have done so. Sadly there is not a Cracker Barrel in Globe Arizona.
good,Don't expect to get more than 13-14 hours a week there and don't expect to work more than 3-4 days a week. The pay is good and discounts are nice. But them hours are trash.
good,awesome had a great experience love the way operation is ran enjoy staff and the upper management. wouldn't mind working another cracker barrel again awesome place to eat and work!
good,Good management and Hr. Fast Paced workplace. No room to advance. Workers do not get recognized. Good part time job. Good for those that like working with the public.
good,"can be stressful as any resturant is but mostly pleasant experience"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Servers get two to four tables depending on the time of day. Servers have side work and roll silverware. The money is fair. I hear days is better than night. I work at night.
good,"Learned a lot of costumer service skills in a fast paced environment. Very thorough training on a wide variety of skills needed in the work place.  "
good,"The people you work with are for the most part amazing and the management is strong. It’s a good place to work. You will be expected to keep the sales floor stocked, work the register and assist guests whenever needed."
good,"cracker barrel does a great job of training ,but once you get into your store they do less to track your progress and don't take in consideration of what you are doing for your store and district to help them move forward and improve areas of concern"
good,"It's a good place to work, I would still been there working had it not been for new manager coming in trying to make a name for his self. We always paid for our food before leaving for the day."
good,"Cracker Barrel is a well structured business, with systems in place for the success of the employees and the satisfaction of the guests.  The organization is awesome."
good,Cracker Barrel was a very fun place to work. most of all the co-workers got along and treated everyone like family. if you needed something all they would all be there for you in your time of need. all the managers were understanding and lenient as well. I loved working up there.
good,follow the guidelines and systems will allow you to fall within your target guidelines to help drive your bottom line profit. looking to get heavily into off premise sales and catering.
good,"I love working there, meeting new peoplen working as a team is nice, and, working alone is just as good but I want to be an adult  now and move  out and be an adult. It taught me a lot about the work place and showed me my worth and working to my best ability each day made me feel good about myself"
good,I enjoyed working at Cracker Barrel but you can only work up to 40hrs and raise is like 10 to 25 cent raises after each start (up to 4 starts). I loved my co workers and it is a very friendly environment just wish hours were more overtime and a better raise for your good deeds you have done. NOTHING for good deeds besides a gold card.
good,A typical day at work would be to get prep lists started and get prep completed while talking with guests and welcoming severs into work.The culture of Cracker Barrel was to turn tables and take care of the guests by giving them a hot meal and do a little retail shopping before getting back on the road. The food reminded you about Southern Hospitality like your mother would have made.
good,Most of the management was very nice They would help you out if you need it  and I always tell you that she doing a really good job you got the place up to par and that made me feel real good
good,they don't give any one enough hours. they schedule you but will call you and tell you not to come in when its slow or send you home when it is slow. I realize a lot of companies do this which is why I'm looking for another job to go along with it..
good,"After clocking in as a Grill Cook, I would go to the Grill line and check stock, replenishing what was low both for the grills and for the steam line. Afterwards, I would be required to cook food on the grill or plate food and sides on the steam line to ensure that tickets were completed in under 10 minutes."
good,"Great place to work and the opportunity to advance.  I enjoyed working here, co-workers were great as well.  Everyone worked as a team.  The only problem I had was being over worked for a period of time."
good,I enjoyed working here as a cashier. It was fast paced but it was a fun team effort. I enjoyed working daily with the customers and making sure they had a good experience.
good,Being a server was awesome because I really enjoyed interacting with the guests and helping them with whatever they may have needed. I am a people person and this was the perfect job to be around people.
good,its a great job for collgege students. its very fast paced stress ful but definitely worth the money you make in just a 2 or 3 hour shift. I like working her because there is good structure.
good,This was my most demanding of restaurant jobs I had undertaken and one of the most rewarding ones.  I been cooking around different places in town and usually move from here to there in my youthful exuberance for any and all things new and exciting while in my late teen years and early 20's. This company takes care of its employees with great benefits but management and transitioning from employee to manager is not an easy user friendly move and one that is impossible unless you are willing to relocate. the management staff when first hired were knowledgeable and willing to help but as the years progressed and that revolving office door spun the caliber of management teams declined and I often found myself taking orders from a person that was not versed on my responsibilities nor were they capable of doing my job.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I enjoyed working at Cracker Barrel . It was fast paced which made the time go by faster . I met amazing people while working there . The food is great and it reminds you of home !
good,When I first get to work I clock in say Hi to everybody and then I go and put my white apron on and a hair apron. I have learned a lot over the last years I've been there. The managers I work with are great. Workplace culture is okay I like seeing all the new customers and coworkers that come in. The hardest part of my job is checking each and every plate that comes out the kitchen to make sure that it looks nice and presentable. I love working seeing all my coworkers.
good,"My position was good for what I wanted to do, but the low hourly wage could be improved for the amount of work that I accomplished each and every night I worked"
good,"Great place, everyone is friendly, team work everyone is willing to help. The other cooks are very helpful"

It stayed busy sometimes, but that's to be expected, and with the computer system they had, it was an easy job.  I really did like the culture there."
good,"I loved being a waitress for Cracker Barrel. I was there for 4 years, and left due to needing a more stable, higher paycheck. I met some of my closest friends in my time at CB, and management was great."

good,Loved working here didn’t really talk to many people just loved it cause you stay busy all day . And time went by fast I just really enjoy being a dishwasher
good,"A typical shift at work included rolling 20 lbs of silverware before being put on the floor plan. After each shift, you were required to do side-work and fill sugar caddies, salts, and peppers. "
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Decent serving job. Be prepared to work every holiday besides Christmas day. Long hours on Sunday especially as well. Takes a toll on your body, not the best job for anyone with back or joint pain."
good,On a regular day it is nice and slow paced but on weekends it can get crazy and frustrating. But i still love the team work and goofballs i work with.
good,"the most enjoy part of my job was learning new thing about the lodge cast iron.i own 4 of there frying pan, all from cracker barrel because of all of the information"

good,Working at Cracker Barrel was a beneficial experience in that it taught me a great deal about the fast-paced food service industry and customer service. I would recommend this job to someone looking to make some quick cash who doesn't mind a fast environment.

good,"Pretty relaxed"
good,"Slow days were easy, busy days were fast. I learned how to properly was dishes. Management was great. The people I worked with was awesome. The hardest part was keeping up t first. I enjoyed working with people."

good,"This was my first serving job, and I think I had a good experience.There is typically ""drama""in most of these environments but I found it for the most part ""Drama Free"". People where nice to work with, and customers are also friendly. I recommend this job to others looking for a serving job."

good,"A fast pace environment in which I could barely keep up, funny and interesting people to work with but the clientele wasn't always the best, its exhausting work for sure!"
good,"I was a Server to begin with. After two years I became a Shift Leader. I was also a trainer. I assisted the managers with the shift operations. I also assisted in the kitchen by cooking, prepping, and inventory. I was the Shift Leader for 7 years but no advancement. I decided to find a company that would see the skills I had and help to develop them."
good,"i learned how to work quick under stressful conditions, as there were always dishes to be cleaned and/or put away. i also learned how to work well with others, with a ""assembly line"" type system"
good,"The environment is fast paced and stress full for servers, but the pay off is great. The management staff is helpful and cares about their employees. It feels like a home and the team members are great."
good,Cracker Barrel is a place for people who can handle working in a fast pace environment along with being able to multitask. Friendliness and communication are very important. Management tries to help out the best they can when we are very busy. It is a very country fresh environment. There is no wifi so families have to either use their data or talk to one another. Hardest part of the job is when they are very busy and you are literally running around trying to please all the guests and get the job done safely and successfully. Most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the regulars that come in and making new friends at the workplace.
good,"A typical work day would be greeting people at the door, straightening things up, and helping guests."
good,"Cracker Barrel was my first job, and I enjoyed working here as a dishwasher/busser. Coworkers were very friendly and the workplace felt like one big family."
good,It's a great place to work. The management was fun and are easy to talk too. I learned to value serving customers to their expectations in the restaurant business.
good,This is a great place to work at. It can be stressful at times but the management team and employees are very friendly and willing to help you through.
good,This was my first job. I was a retail associate. It's an easy job and you get a raise from $7.90 to $8.13 after working there for about two months. The only con was I never received breaks.
good,"I learned customer service skills as well as learning to multi-task in a high paced environment. The work environment is not the most enjoyable. There is quite a bit of favoritism/drama, but I assume that occurs at most places."
good,I enjoyed being a server for Cracker Barrel. I loved the old country store feeling you got when you walked through the doors. Prompt and friendly service and great affordable food.
good,"Server, cashier, hostess, gift shop, lead trainer, hiring paperwork coordinator, "
good,"I have had a positive experience working for cracker barrel, the hardest part is learning their vast menu. They have great managers, flexible schedule, and good benefits for full time employees. Fast paced environment makes the clock go faster!"
good,if you can deal with  from your coworkers then you can make it but if you are in the military then getting hours can be a problem but over all was not bad
good,"I would recommend cracker barrel as good place to work. In my own opinion, cracker barrel is a seasonal job. Your hours are based on the buisness they get..  I have worked for this company almost eight years and im a full time cook there but still not getting but one day a week on the scedule."
good,"It was very stressful during your shift when things wouldn't go right, but at the end of your shift it was nice to get a cheeseburger and fries with a ice cold root bear at 50% off."

good,This company is nice and I enjoyed working for it especially over the holidays. The holidays are the best part of this place. When the holiday displays are put up it looks amazing.
good,Easy going atmosphere with great managers. Learned a ton about food service and the whole restaurant business. Thoroughly enjoy the company of my coworkers and guests.
good,"I worked at Cracker Barrel part-time to help pay for college. A great management staff and company work-environment. High turnover of employees is expected in a restaurant, but a great place to work."
good,Everyday that I would go to work you had to read the MAC card which told how much should be sold each hour and how much you should have by the end of the day. It became competitive with other employees to see who could do the best instead of co-workers working together as a team. In time you could see our sales going down because co-workers were more like enemies than friends.
good,"Cracker Barrel is a great place to work if you are a people person and exceed in engaging guests and being proactive at all times. You will come across people of all kinds, therefore, it is your responsibility to make them feel at home. Cracker Barrel is actually known to be a place that is your home away from home. A typical day of work for me seating guests from the time I walk in the door until the time I get ready to leave. Each shift can sometimes be very stressful due to the chaos that is going on from getting the food out in time, to guests being seated properly, to servers getting orders in enough time. Overall, it can be a pretty demanding job, but the environment in itself is very friendly."
good,"It's a great place to work if you don't have to depend on it as your main income.  The pay does not match the required knowledge, company mandatory policies and job requirements.  However, growth within Cracker Barrel is rapid.  You go as far as you want to, they leave that up to you.  They are very flexible working around primary job schedules."
good,Cracker Barrel is one of the best full-service restaurants in the Battle Creek area -- a great place to eat with family and friends. Cracker Barrel is also a great place to work when students are trying to become educated with a flexible schedule.
good,working under a lot of pressure is never easy we use to get huge rushes of people coming in and the kitchen sometimes got chaotic but working in a fast paced environment was nice because it taught me a lot
good,"I loved my time employed at cracker barrel, because I was able to work my way to other positions and the co-workers where cool and the older ones showed me a lot."
good,"Friendly place to work at, management was a little strict but it was necessary to get the job done. Not a hard job at all. Made great connections with employees while working there"
good,"This is a great place to work at , you meet great people & at the same time having a good time while doing it . Co workers are like family , everyone gets along"
good,I really enjoyed working for this company. I worked at 5 different stores and every one of them had something new to offer. the management on average are great to work with. If the compensation had been better I'd still be there.
good,"Please people was the first and far most important part of the job. Team work and helping others to provide customer with great service. Running food, greeting other servers tables, helping each other with drinks, dipping food, and washing dishes. It all about the customer and giving the greatest service ever."
good,I think its a good family oriented environment. all the employees are treated like family. they really do care about your well being inside and out of work.
good,Good restaurant and good food. Well organized and good benefits. There's a good opportunity to advance there and the management team is wonderful. They also have paid vacations.
good,Cracker Barrel is typical a good place to work . Its all about new technology and innovation so you can sell more retail and keep customer comming in the door.

good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Great place for the fast paced person, extremely structured. All about the guest and employee experience. Clean and extreme high standards. Great for making the employees feel good."
good,"One of the things I learned was no matter what duty you're performing, how to focus on when that door opened, to immediately greet that guest and to anticipate a guests needs.  Offer a basket to them as they browse the store and offer to hold merchandise while they dine.  Management was on the ball with periodic coaching, not as a punishment but as a reminder of procedures and core values.  No matter how long someone worked for Cracker Barrel, everyone was coached periodically.  One of the hardest parts was to meet the daily sales initiative so more work hours could be obtained.  Over all, I like working at Cracker Barrel,  I had fun with the guests and their children.  If there was one close by to where I live now, I would apply for a job."
good,"Worked with the company a long time, as with all places it has its ups and downs. The company seems to be losing it's focus on it's life force ""the people that work for them"""
good,You create a friendship with the workers around you and when it's late you can get free food and they do discounts on all your food but you can't really advanced
good,Sometimes it can be stressful but overall a good place to work with great people great regular customers and great atmosphere fun sometimes they do care about employees
good,"loved it but was working 2 jobs , had to find full time with  dependable paycheck. I enjoyed it. customer service to the highest. Employee great, did training for  new waitress"
good,Cracker Barrel was a great job. I was retail cashier and had fun with all our customers. I worked 2 jobs at the time 40 hour+ on my regular job and 32+ there. I worked this for 9 years. I need a break and gave my notice.
good,"Very quick paced work place but itś easy to have a blast with coworkers and guests. Being a server, personally, I believe is a very rewarding job. Many rewarding skills are learned such as communication, upselling, and teamwork can be learned and this place definitely had you practicing these skills."
good,"Cracker Barrel was a very nice place to work , I learned alot from my team and manager the work culture was great . The drive was just too far for me every day ."
good,Good work atmosphere with great camaraderie among coworkers. Each job is fast-paced and requires attention to detail. Cracker Barrel is consistent with one set of policies that apply to all locations.
good,"A Cracker Barrel server is a good job for a college student, single parent, or retired person wanting to work a couple hours a week. Flexible hours and friendly environment made for an easy-going work environment."
good,"I really liked working for Cracker Barrel. I made plenty of friends with my coworkers and all of my managers did good at guiding me through my job and giving me advice. I worked really long hours, but they paid off in the end."
good,Great company to work for...just not making enough money to support my family. looking for company with more opportunities to advance. would be willing to travel with company.
good,Fast pace environment to work. With promises of advancement of job titles. Was able to move from server to prep to host to line cook all within a year.
good,Great place to work! I have a lot of kids and I’m seeking a second full-time job! They also don’t offer health benefits for hourly employees unless you’ve been employed for a year!
good,"it is a good place to work and is good because they are all over the country from which I came from new York and fit right in to day to day operations, the business is always busy parts I did not like were mixing a strong retail business with restaurant and being responsible for that as well and the hours on managers schedule were very tough from 5am one day to 2pm -1am the next. the work culture was very enjoyable great teamwork upbeat atmosphere"
good,They are a fine company plenty of room for advancement. The management team was happy to help me advance and wanted me to go into there management program.
good,"The work environment is awesome! The staff is well trained and knowledgeable, and is kept up to par. The food is great, the customer service is great, and the store has some nice items for the customers and the employees."
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel for me was a very fast paced job that required a lot of multi-tasking in order to get a lot done in the time needed to fulfill my job duties."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I love working at Cracker Barrel. I have learned a lot about helping out customers and co-workers. They have tought me what the meaning of team work is.
good,A good company to work for. They are very understand and you able to advance in any position. Management is always pleasant to work with. Servers on the other hand do not receive a lot of income since the dropped from having 3 to 4 tables a piece. They have dropped it to only 2 tables per server now. That's the only down fall.
good,It was a fun environment at first but eventually due to factors that I rather would not say I dont enjoy it anymore. Ive been looking for another job for a while.
good,The next step after Shift Leader is Manager. Management in a Arkansas Cracker Barrel are few and far between so in order for me to become a Retail Manager I would have to relocate to a different state. My entire family lives here in Arkansas and I want to be able to continue being surrounded by my family.
good,"I would recommend for anyone to work there,the management team was good and they are willing to help, so if your interested please do not hesitate to apply"
good,During my time at cracker barrel I was given little hours. I would recommend this job to those who are looking for only about 12-18 hours a week. Would be a good first job.
good,I enjoyed working for Cracker Barrel. The managers were great to work with and learn from. Meetings were always enjoyable and always came back with more knowledge on how to make the business better.
good,"i worked at the cracker barrel in pigeon forge at the end closest to Gatlinburg. the store was incredibly well managed. the manager knew everyones job and how much to expect in productivity out of each person. the employees at cracker barrel were very dedicated and loyal. The only issue I have with the workplace is that the employees are seemingly just cogs in the wheel. One lady left while I was there, she had given twenty years of loyal service to the company and on her final day the management didn't care. No cake, no warm words. It was really sad. On a positive note there is opportunity for advancement in the back of the house. I moved from dishwasher to prep cook in a short period of time and had my eye on the line cook position."
good,My review would have to be great because this place was great to work at and I was pregnant with my daughter at the time and they really worked with me through it!!
good,I have already written a statement on the previous pages. I am so sorry if this is a error I have made. I think cracker barrel is a good starting job.
good,This is a great place to work if you like a fast paced environment all with open transfers. All the employees and staff are really friendly. Days at cracker barrel can be busy but most of all it's relaxed.
good,"I very much enjoyed this job, always customers always something to do and the entire restaurant works as a team. You can always ask for help. The management runs on numbers so the higher their numbers are thehappier they are. Which works out for the servers because that means more money."
good,The little time I worked there it has been a blast but things need to change. More opportunities are needed to expand the business as a whole . Great family like environment
good,I worked at my own pace not too fast but definitely not slow and I had co workers help which made the job much easier. It Is A Good Job to have if you need work and a good place to eat w family
good,"it was a decent place to work with good people and it was a fact-paced environment,which is what I like. The management is good and most of the other people that worked there were very friendly."
good,Well oiled company with good training and incentives to continue to work hard. Managers are fun and care about employees. Overall a great business to work for.
good,"Despite being night maintenance and not meeting many people, the ones who i have met are very nice, welcoming and caring. Along with the nice people, after a month of working there everyone gets a 10% discount throughout the store and while on the clock a 50% discount for food."
good,"Despite being night maintenance and never really seeing anyone, the people i do see are very nice and caring. Along with only working for a month everyone starts off with a 10% discount throughout the store and restaurant and 50% discount on food while on the clock."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"There were many days where we were encouraged to upsell a product to get out of certain duties (rolling silverware), that created a competitive environment, but not hostile. My coworkers were friendly and willing to help often, but not always. The culture was friendly and personal lives were discussed between coworkers/friends so long as both parties welcomed it. Working in any kind of customer service is hard, people can be rude and misunderstanding, but that's part of the job that can't be helped."
good,"Quick-paced hard working environment, not many breaks throughout a shift. But is a good work environment and co-workers are usually great and you will always see new faces being in a resturaunt."
good,I worked here for 2 years and i loved it i just needed a new job byt the people are great the managers need to do more training but other than that everyone is nice
good,I actually talked to my manager about it but I have my ears pierced and I was able to keep them in during work. I believe that it really shouldn't matter as long you look presentable
good,I been working with customers for years my first job was a grocery store I love dealing with customers . Great Customers Service is the key to a happy environment
good,The company was good to work for and there were many advancements available.  I just needed a temporary job at the time.  It was kind of expensive to buy the uniform and the mandatory creases in the clothes was annoying. I also didn't like having 4 different managers to turn in my 2 week notice to.
good,I enjoyed working there even the the job was challenging. Constantly on your toes and must be alert at all times to keep up. If you like a challenge and staying busy this is a great place.
good,I loved working there! I wish that they had one where I am located now. I loved all the customers and employees. Everyone was like family there. I would work there again
good,"The management was good, environment was good as well. Formed a family like bond with everyone there. A typical day was very relaxed but a lot of walking and interacting with guests. The hardest part of the job was just trying to please everyone's needs at once. The best part was being able to have fun."
good,I enjoyed the work which included greeting Guest as they entered the retail store.  It was fun assisting them with some decisions of purchases.  Also offering sampling of some products helped with sales too.
good,"Fun place to work overall.  Everyone is really nice.  There are times of chaos and stress when it gets busy on a weekend, but nothing too crazy. Overall good place to work."
good,I was a cashier waiting on customers after they ate or bought something in the store.  Love the company. Good values. Managers were nice. Left because I had a baby and moved.
good,"it is a very good job, i learned a lot from this company. it gave me very good people skills and taught me how to stay calm in bad situations. the hardest part of the job for myself was learning how to deal with unhappy customers. the most enjoyable part of my job is getting rewarded for doing a good job with a raise"
good,"I love Cracker Barrel.. it was the best place I've ever worked. I love the enviroment, the staff, and the customers. Everyday its about the same routine, but it never gets old. I like coming into work and everything is already stocked and cleaned. The hardest part about working there is just managing your tables and memorizing what each table needed from you.. it gets easier the longer you've been working there though. I learned to always pace yourself to not make a mistake or forget anything."
good,"It's a pretty decent place to work if you want extra income, especially if you have experience in serving. Majority of the employees are great to get along with."
good,"Cracker barrel makes it so much conveint as a workplace because as a cook/dishwasher you have some what of your own area to attend and maintain as well .(note) always prepared foods,griillers oven grease traps"
good,Cracker Barrel is a great first job to have and you can advance a lot in it and have multiple jobs at the same time. The managers are very flexible with your schedule as well.
good,I took peoples orders and made their food made sure they got their right food and that they were happy. the other employees were really nice but the managers were not.
good,"Cracker barrel is different in the sense that it's a family themed, down home place to eat. Breakfast is served all day which was different for me. The culture is laid back but it gets hectic  at times.It's a good place to work"
good,A Typical Day at Cracker Barrel was showing up to work always looking neat clean and spiffy the people and co-workers were very nice and they always treated you withrespect.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Loved working here and would recommend to friends and family, great environment and people to work with on a daily basis, would definitely recommend if you are in a job search."
good,We work 12 hour days. Its very busy.  I've learned a different type of management skill while being with the company that has helped my advancement in my career. Culture is a family style setting.
good,"I enjoyed working at Cracker Barrel.  I learned a great deal about customer service and how to deal with  different situations.  I ranked from a rising star to 4 star and to red apron, training position.  Working at Cracker Barrel requires a lot of walking, lifting, and team work.  It was a fun and challenging place to work. My manager was always helpful in any situation.  I enjoyed meeting many different people from different countries.  Cracker Barrel in Kingman was always a stop for tourists passing through. The hardest part of this job was the hours of standing and walking around."
good,Cracker Barrel is a great place to work if you are looking for a first job. It is easy going and management is easy to connect with. They work with you on hours and days you want off. My only complaint is that there is way too much drama among go workers and it can affect personal life.
good,Cracker Barrel was a good place to work but also so hard being a Hostess cause your just standing around waiting on families to come in so really something i wanted to try out but overall it was something different
good,"I have loved working at my Old Country Store and would absolutely be willing to come back one day. The managers are fantastic and they work with you when you need it which I felt very fortunate to have had starting out with CBOCS. The employee discounts are the greatest part of working for Cracker Barrel and the opportunity to really get to know your customers truly helps you develop your social skills as you learn how to start ""Pleasing People"". Its a great environment but unfortunately you don't get much of a chance to move up in the works/ranks other than your Par status. Also unfortunately the pay isn't the best, however it is ever so slightly above average. I'd have to say the hardest part of working in the retail is selling product and learning the product you have to sell seeing as everything gets moved so often. Other than a couple minor flaws its a restaurant and gift shop that honestly does feel a lot like home."
good,I have had a great experience and have met many great people while working here. They are more than willing to work around your schedule if need be and are always there to help.
good,I have truly enjoyed working for this company. I have valued the fact that I could clock in and start my day and clock out and go home. Every day is the same but every day is different. They expect you to work hard but that has never scared me and the reward is always worth the effort.
good,"Cracker Barrel has a great work environment, I had to leave due to family issues. The staff is friendly and the guests were always looking for a place like home. The place itself made you feel at home."
good,"Weekends are the busiest days to be working in, need to be capable of dealing with different people/attitudes, adjusting to workplace environment. Paid weekly! Great staff/management, flexible scheduling , and unlimited requested days off."
good,"Cracker Barrel is full of fun people who are great to work with. Schedules are flexible and management works well with your availability. The worst part would be working holidays, but everyone is required to work a shift so that it is fair."
good,always multi tasking. constantly on the go. hours are short. people make the job fun. hard to work in a hot kitchen. first kitchen job that offers benifets.
good,"Cracker Barrel cares about its employees, and it shows in their quality of service and food. There are ample benefits including health insurance and paid leave, two things rare to find in the service industry. Hard working employees are rewarded with the hours they want and extra responsibilities."
good,"Typical day at Cracker Barrel was nice and easy very friendly co-workers. I learned how to give great customer service to guests and how to smile with a positive attitude, answering phone calls in a timely manner.  Managers were great they are very great help of work schedule and emergency situations, school and other activities. The hardest part of the job was that I feel like they were hiring too many people and the floor was crowded to the point where everybody could only get two tables.  Enjoyable part of the job was serving guest and looking at the smiles on their faces."
good,"You have to take people's orders, bring their drinks and food. You have to put up with very rude guest plus they do not tip very well. You are responsible for making sure guest have a pleasant experience."
good,Fast paced busy place to work. The manager was a great guy.I worked long hours.i worked nights and weekends and had plenty hours but was short staff sometimes

good,great people to work with and for. Exceptional environment. Upper management was amazing. Easy to talk to and understanding of life issues. Knowledge of the b rand and all things surrounding the store
good,"Sometimes its balls to the wall, sometimes its completely dead. Management seems to care more about labor cost than the employees but you will find some lifelong friends."
good,I would never have left if I had not had t move. Management always gave constructive feedback. I learned a lot about leadership and task delegation in my time there.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.

good,"Working at cracker barrel was a whole new experience for me being that I had never served before getting the job. However I enjoyed it extremely, especially once I learned how to talk with the guests and put my own skills on serving. "
good,"A typical work day would entail serving guests from the minute they walk in the door, until they leave. Making sure to have a positive attitude throughout your shift while serving and helping coworkers. Hardest part of the job would be maintaining composure when it is extremely busy and you are forced to multitask like crazy. Most enjoyable part is getting the money you worked hard for."
good,"Cracker Barrel was my very first job as a teenager and I'd have to say it was a very pleasing experience. I was a hostess which was quite tackling at first (especially since I have a slight case of social anxiety) but the managers & crew made me feel right at home. However, there were times I almost broke down from the massive waves of customers (on weekends/holidays mostly) but I was surprised on how well I was able to still do my job. Also, the other hosts/hostesses were there to help and were very kind and no doubt helpful for a rookie like me. Cracker Barrel is very organized as well in job positions which made my first job not as hectic. The only reason why I'm giving this 4 stars is because one of the managers was rude to almost every customer during our peak times which caused meltdowns/tension towards me later. But other than that Cracker Barrel was a great first job experience for me."
good,"I like serving people because, I am a people person and love getting to know new faces. If you are a people's person I highly recommend this job! It's fast paced and friendly work environment. Tips are good most nights."

good,Weekends get very busy. Ive learned alot so far from working here. A typical day at work is making sure your guests are taking care of and leaving in a great mood. Hardest part of the job is when it starts to get really busy. the most enjoyable part of work is being able to serve our guest
good,"Love to working for this place, have no complaints. Was my first job and I would go back if I still lived in in Utah. They were very welcoming and management was always easy to work with."
good,"They work well if you need time off, but just a little bit better the longer you've been there. Good for high school or early college students (and that's mostly what it is)"
good,This is my least favorite job. The work was physically and mentally challenging. The general manager was very unprofessional. No one took the time to teach you anything. It was horrible.
good,I had a great time working there. People were always happy to see us and everyone was welcomed with a welcome from the heart. It had a great sense of home and was a family friendly place!
good,Great restaurant to work part-time. Decent hours. The culture is great and the food is delicious! some discount is given during work hours for meals. Also discount on store items.
good,"Cracker Barrel was my first job that I obtained at the age of 18. I was in Seasonal Retail, meaning I sold items to customers, greeted them, and made sure they found everything they were looking for. The most enjoyable part of this job was seeing customers satisfied with their purchases."
good,"My day starts with preparing the podium by getting feature boards ready for lunch/dinner, knowing the daily soups, stocking silverware, having clean menus, having ample children's menus and crayons, and making sure the correct floor plan is loaded into the mobile device."

good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.

good,"Cracker Barrel is a family oriented company. I have been able to balance a good work life and a good home life throughout my time with the company. I've grown with the company, having the opportunity to learn any position that I wanted to, making it possible to get more hours when needed and gain experience in several different positions."
good,Cracker Barrel is a great place to work if you are in school and what I learn about this place is how to be family and the management is great and the workplace culture old fashion home cooked meals and the hardest thing to do is dealing with people with anger problems with the waiting list. the enjoyable part of this job is seeing everyone being happy and having a good time.
good,"The typical day is very fast paced. I enjoyed it very much, but with me going back to school, I needed a more reliable income.The hardest part of the job was definitely keeping a customer happy when things went wrong that were out of my control. (like food being cold or incorrect) I enjoyed the variety of personalities I encountered every day."
good,"There are many rules and regulations, which is great if you like structure in your workplace. However, it makes it hard to be creative and input your own ideas."
good,They really do care about making progress in the business and making positive changes. The only thing I was not fond Of is the customer's racial comments.
good,Great people very friendly and caring. had a really great experience with this employer. very good work flow everything had a great vib to it and worked as well as a Swiss clock.

good,"great company to work for, hours and pay worked well to improve my financial situation. the hours weren't very flexible but they weren't bad at all"
good,To be a back up cook you need to prioritize your time very well. If you don't you will find yourself staying overtime three hours. It took me awhile to get a hang of things. However after awhile there I found myself actually having free time.
good,"I was opening grill person. MY day started by going into work everyday at 5 am to get up the grill area, mix the pancake batter and get ready for customer orders. I full fill the orders in addition trying to get some of the prep work done. The management team was great in helping you out when you got busy. The co workers were  all nice, especially when you were in training. The hardest part of the job was when we got busy and you were by yourself, than it was hard to get caught up"
good,overall I think it was good working there and being able to get a raise when they told you it was do and having good management when they weren't stressed out themselves.
good,Fast learner .people person great worker i loved it. I would loveto stay but i need something to retire from. Why do i have to write so much .

good,Good company.  Many of the downsidesame for me are more related to the industry rather then the current company.  They change managers often which makes it hard to read your leadership.  It's my first serving job and I'm doing fine but again I have no comparison to my situation.  Average over 15/hr.
good,"good restaurant, works well if you have a weird schedule, they will accommodate you. doesn't really allow holidays off unless you have worked there for a long time."

good,"The day starts off bright and early with a nice iron pressed uniform . I stand in line for an inspection of my appearance , I'm of to check for my assigned tables. Customer service is key if you don't know how to talk to people,and learn the different tones of their voices you might be the one going home broke .After I've taken my order/orders I  then input them into the system that goes back to the kitchen .I pick up serve and make sure the cups are never empty .

good,its a great place to work fast paced and lots of good people there . holidays are the busiest but also the best day to make money '
good,A typical day at work would consist of me interacting with my fellow co-workers as well as customers. I work hard and enjoy talking and laughing with customers and co-workers. Busting tables allows me to work fast and interact with people in the dining hall. The hardest part of the job for me would be having to leave. I want to stay as long as possible . The most enjoyable part is being able to help other co-workers out and working as a team.
good,"I was hired in the store as a cashier. The job was in a safe place and very family friendly, people tended to be happy. Overall I enjoyed the experience and wish I had stayed longer to rise in ranks . At the time was also going to college so that came first and changed my career interest. In conclusion I learned many skills, how to bag orders, label items, clean , stock merchandise and many other important things, and found this was  good part time  job."

Alot of pressure is on you to sale. toward the end I felt I could not be myself in talking to a guest.As they say could not be genuine and natural. Felt like I was on commission. I also did not wnt to train for cash and wewere having to cross train,"

good,"Morning Server, awesome coworkers for the most part. Learned people skills in guest services, relations, and troubleshooting. Also experienced various management styles, in respect to the individual and the company culture.  Relations with co-workers depended on there level of seniority. I work with a new person differently than an ""old timer"", People have different needs both personally and professionally as they grow and are promoted within a company. As a server the hardest (least desirable) part of my job was rolling silverware at the end of the shift, but it had to be done, part of the job. The most enjoyable, the friendships I made with so many wonderful people while I was there."

It is a very stressful job, (dealing with all men, trying to please the servers constantly, making our customers happy each and every visit, working under strict time limits)---but I love it. I love the challenge, making people happy in very stressful situations daily. I love to learn new things daily. I am simply looking for more hours and better opportunities. I love to work hard and put out 100 percent work effort plus some."

good,"A typical day at Cracker Barrel all depends on what time you work that day. If you open, you are usually slow until around 8-9am. Until the rush, you usually do all of your side work which included making sure you wrote down all of the server's schedules so you and the other hosts would know when seating arrangements changed. You cleaned the host podium as well as folded kids menus. All while seating guests in the proper seats, rotating between servers. It than gets busy around noon and at 5-6pm. I learned how to help customers with their problems in a polite and quick manner to help get the problem solved, how to get things cleaned in a fast and proper manner as well as how to work well with both managers, kitchen staff and retail staff. My co-workers as well as managers were always so helpful. If someone couldn't get to work at the last minute, everyone had each other's numbers so not only you were trying to find someone covering your shift, it was really everyone helping you out until you found someone. The hardest part of the job was if you were scheduled alone, and the restaurant got a whole bunch of customers come in at once, you had to seat them, clean tables, clear tables off of the electronic table seating/chart and it got a little overwhelming at times but it was worth it in the end. The most enjoyable part was the customers, co-workers as well as learning things I never knew about Cracker Barrel."

good,A typical day for me was helping guests find everything in store. What I have learned is being a good co-worker and do my best at my job. The management was always nice and courteous to the employees.
good,there is a lot the should be changed. I dont know how yall can function in such a small space for xashiers and when people none stop block your line while waiting to be seated.
good,"Health Benefits, Vacation pay, opportunity for promotion.  Its a huge restaurant with a hundred employees and every member is important to the machine.  Management cares a lot for the employees and empathizes with life that happens."

I became a skill trainer so I could guide new employees and help them develop their skills.  I enjoyed the atmosphere and my co-workers.
good,"I love this job I learned how to open and close all stations in the store at the back of the house , I could cook clean and close anywhere to do with food.  There is  great team work and a chance to grow in the buisness."
good,"It's a great place to work if you need flexibility. Being a server at Cracker Barrel gives you the chance advance if you want to. Not many restaurants give you that chance or the recognition by adding stars to your apron that every one can see, and a raise on your check that you can see. You can also cross train to other positions if you are interested. "
good,"I have been serving at this Cracker Barrel for nearly 17 years. Flexible schedule that works well for me, and my satisfaction over the years has prompted me to stay for so long. The employee discount, good at all locations is another reason. Great management too!"

good,"My main issue is the distance I live from the restaurant and the pay being too low in comparison to the cost of living where the restaurant is at. This is a great company to work for though and to learn new skills. For anyone who is in college or has a second job or doesn't want to go down the academic route, I would say this is probably one of your best companies to work for."
good,A typical day at Cracker Barrel was pretty smooth. I learned how to read the production board to understand what needed to be done for the day. The managers were really down to earth with the staff. Most of my coworkers were friendly and made work a lot easier.
good,"A typical day at work can vary.  On the weekends it can get very busy.  I have learned to be patient with people and many requirements of a shift leader.  The management can be good and bad, depending on the day.  The general manager is always looking for new ways to coach them on being better.  My co-workers are amazing.  I have made forever friends there.  The hardest part of my job would be the guests.  Everyone is different, but there are the times when someone is very unpleasant and is negative towards me.  I do everything I can in order to calm them.  The most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers.  It is very rewarding knowing that I have met great people."
good,"worked alot of hours, moved from job to job each day, management would jump in and help you if they could. very friendly co-workers."
good,Not a bad place to work. Good environment with friendly people. Customers tend to be pretty friendly. Management team is also pretty friendly.
good,"- fast paced"

There may be obstacles every once in a while, but with the help of your coworkers and managers, you'll get the help and support you need to get through the day! The managers are very nice and friendly and helpful, as are the employees. I learn new things almost every day, and it's fun to learn new things!"

good,Provide excellent customer service. Greet guests with hospitality. Sell products in retail store.
good,"Each day has its lulls and peaks, but there's never a moment where you'd be able to sit still. There's always something to do, and there's always something to learn about. Management will lead a helping hand, but there are times when they are too busy to provide assistance. In such cases, there are other employees that also work as trainers that can help you with what you need to know and what you have to do. All in all, help is always available, but the type of job makes it show that more experience will get you far in that line of work."

Everybody is different, and I have met so many different types of people, so it has given me experience with how to handle certain situations, and it has made me into the sociable, kind, and open person I am today."
good,"worked as a hostess, which meant handling busy wait times, turning tables and customer service on the crazy holidays such as Black Friday, Mothers day, Fathers Day, and Easter. I learned a smile goes a long way even in the face of hungry guests who just want to eat with their party of 16 on Mothers Day. Management is consistent and fair. Coworkers always make it fun and interesting. "
good,"I enjoyed working here a lot. The people were very friendly, and the co workers were also as well."
good,"Nothing in life is easy, We work hard. I've learned that not two people are a like. Managers really have to know how to juggle fun and discipline.  I enjoy working with my co-workers, each in a different way. It's not easy to make un-happy customers, Happy!"

good,"kind managers, easy sidework, flexible schedule, nice customers, easy uniform"

good,Everyone gets along with each play games with on or another. But also get thing done when suppose to. When busy no games are played only getting the orders out as they come in and a very good speed to meet their guest needs. Hardest part of the job is Sundays after the church rush the restaurant feels up and everybody in the restaurant has something to do.

good,"A great and fair company to work for.  Very fair with promotions, just a little slow."

Once you are cut or taken off the floor plan you finish sweeping your tables and then proceed to your side work after that is done you rolls ilver wear and then you go home. the best part is the managment I worked at two different cracker barrels and both had a very strong managment team.

good,"I worked at Cracker Barrel Old Country Store in Mount Laurel, NJ. I worked there from August 2008 to June 2013. I quit because I could no longer handle two jobs at once, also the hours were getting cut short and it really wasn't worth it anymore. I left on good terms and could go back if needed. I was a waitress there. I had to wear a uniform to start work everyday. I would arrive, clock in.. Check to see where my station was and also check on what side work I had to do when my shift was over. I would check to see if my station was complete with sugar caddies filled, salt and pepper filled. I would make sure the tables and surrounding floor was clean and ready to start my shift. While waiting for my first guest of the day or evening.. I would check to see if there was any food sitting in our heat window waiting to be served. If there was any food sitting, I would get it together and bring it out to a co-worker's guest to help out. We always helped at this job, no one just stood around without doing something. If it was slow.. We would clean up our kitchen, stock anything that needed to be, make juice, make coffee, fill up ice bins. When I finally got my first guest at one of my tables in my station.. I would go up to the guest and greet them with a smile and say my hello, tell them who I was, tell them any special we had that night and they would tell me their drink orders. Than I would go back into the kitchen, get their drinks together. By the time I came out to deliver the drinks, they were usually ready to order. I got their order and went to our computer system, rang up"

good,A typical day includes seating guests and ensuring they have a great customer service experience as well as spot checking the entire restaurant for anything that might need to be cleaned.

good,Enjoy the culture and food. Great people to work with huge emphasis on team work.
good,This was a great company. I enjoyed working here. The customers and most of the staff where very friendly.
good,I loved working at cracker barrel. Your co-workers are like family to you and help you out in many situations. Most of the managers are good but no matter where you go there's always one you don't get along with. The hardest part about the job is having to work on Thanksgiving and not having a choice in not working. The most enjoyable part is to see the smile on the guest's faces when they had a bad experience because of another workers and you changed the experiance around and made them want to return.
good,Dishwasher and clean tables  and help customers out..unload truck and stock the fridge
good,"everyday was different, of course. It all depended on the volume of guest, if you had a good day. Other wise they sent you home early."
good,I served at this restaurant when i was a teenager. They helped  me with my hours while i was in high school. Everyone was very nice and outgoing. i enjoyed my time there.
good,Enjoyed working there for the six months I worked there. It is almost a subculture itself! Loyal clientele and always busy on the weekends
good,Loved being able to interact with customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing different people everyday
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,management was very organized and my coworkers were great teamplayers.
good,i have learn to have customer service and how to handle customers with complaints. the hardest part was being on my feet alot and carrying the trays.
good,I liked it a lot but management was wishy washy...i mean they weren't too bad but then again they were
good,Cracker Barrel is one of the most challenging jobs I have ever had. The size of staff and volume of business has honed my time management and organizational skills. Its attention to food quality and its guest is top notch. The staff is very diverse which makes for a fun environment and the guest will always keep you on your toes.
good,My review of this job was a lot of fun I met a lot of new people. the staff was friendly the environment was vary laid back.This one job I would like to work at again.
good,"Many long term employees, great money.  Management was overall good and understanding.  Hardest part of the job was working with the public some days, other days it was great and very productive."
good,I worked as a host at Cracker barrel while I was in high school and some college. Its a great place to work where you meet a lot of travelers.
good,"Cracker Barrel is an awesome atmosphere to work in. A typical week day would be probably about 10 tables. Co-workers always looking out for each other. Hardest part of the job would probably be rolling about 100-200 silverware and cleaning up your area and running food out the window at the same time. The most enjoyable part would have to be customers , they make your day literally."
good,My typical day at my job is a un but crazy wild day. It starts with all the guest that I am taking care of then it goes onto the management and my co workers who keep me going every day. I love my job!
good,"A typical day is quick and full of yummy smells. I learned about how to keep food safe and how to please the guests. Management takes their jobs seriously but not too much so to make you uncomfortable. Co-workers can be difficult when things are going fast, but are generally pleasant, especially if you treat them well and carry your weight. The most enjoyable part of the job is watching people enjoy their meal and finding neat items in the store."
good,a very fast pace and fun ppl to work for and i like the southern style food
good,"On your feet and moving all shift, great if you love interacting with people, sometimes you may have to work in the restaurant."
good,"My location was fun and shaping. I learned a lot more about people and ""job separation"" than before I worked there.  When I became sick with my pregnancy they were very understanding and accommodating."
good,"The employees at Cracker Barrel are so close, they're like family. It's fun working there when most everyone gets along. The managers really seem to care if you're having issues or questions and need help."
good,"A typical day at Cracker Barrel was filled with energy and much to do.  There were always customers to wait on in the dining room and always things to do in the back as well.  You had to be able to multi-task and be a good team player as you were dependent on others to help make you successful.  The management overall was helpful but at times could actually contribute to the stress of the hour instead of helping to difuse it.  The hardest part of the job was working long hours with limited to no breaks.  The longer you work in a high stress environment with no break, the easier it becomes for nerves to become frayed and mistakes to happen.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with the customers and seeing the satisfaction they derived from a job well done.  As the Employee Training Coordinator, I learned organizational skills as well as the importance of keeping managers on task as I was also responsible for ensuring performance appraisals were administered in a timely fashion."
good,"Typical Day: Head into work, clock in, go to my first table. Before I knew it, it was closing time and I was ready to go home. I learned how to deal with a variety of customers, how to juggle different requests at the same time all while trying to make the customers happy, how to manage money.  My coworkers were great. We all got along and helped each other when it was needed. The hardest part of the job were the tests to get to the next level. The most enjoyable was definitely getting to know all of the customers. They were some of the sweetest people I've ever met."
good,"there very professional, they have there own training program which has opportunities for growth in other areas of the restaurant including mangers"
good,I liked working here aside from the people and the shifts not being long enough or not getting enough shifts. The management was okay  though but then again most people didn't do there jobs to the extent they were supposed to. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the pace of the customers since we had to seat people and go in a rotation at times on Sunday mornings it would get very busy and it was hectic. The most enjoyable part would be the customers that would sometimes come in and just make your night and make you laugh!
good,"My typical day at work was, coming in early to unload materials needed in the store and restaurant. I worked in the back and in the front. i was were ever I was needed. Coworkers were great to work with. NO hard parts for me. I loved my manager!"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"it is a great company, we are always learning more, and have the skills to teach other from the way they teach us."
good,"I enjoyed this job, the tips were good, and they were always busy!!!"
good,"Typical day at work involved taking orders from the guests and serving quality food still fresh and hot from the grill. I learned how to use the register and how to be able to make guests happy in different ways other than with a great southern charm. Management was okay in my eyes, with many managers there was some confusions and favoritism. The co workers was a small family after a while, working hard together and helping one another along their day. The hardest part about the job was taking bad criticism from the guests, if you messed up they would let you know about it. The most enjoyable part of the job would be when you can cut up and laugh with the guests and make their time there as good as my own."
good,"Everyone there welcomes you with open arms. There are several people who train you so you get a different aspect of what you can do. The management is not bad, but slow with reminding you when you are up for a raise or need to take online training courses, otherwise they are friendly. Overall the job is easy, but you get no hours and you are standing the whole time."
good,"A typical day at work involved me arriving on time and ready to work. I would bust tables and/or wash dishes depending on how slow we were. When I worked over night shifts, I would do special maintence such as cleaning and changing light bulbs. When I worked early mornings I unloaded the truck, peeled and put away potatoes, and break down boxes. I was promoted to shift leader. I learned how to work in a fast pace enivorment. I was taught a lot of valuable lessons. I also got to experience my first job with Cracker Barrel. I never had an issue with management or my co-workers. I got along with everybody and I really enjoyed meeting all the new people. Everyone was friendly and really welcoming. The hardest part of the job was being shift leader. If someone didn't complete their task then I took the heat for it, but being shift leader was also the most enjoyable thing about my job. I was extremely proud of myself to be shift leader. I was only there for a short amount of time, and in that time I was promoted!"
good,It is a great place to work and meet new people but it wasn't enough hours for me.
good,"Great place to work, with great food, and great staff.  Enjoyed doing the cooking, prepping, and cleanup.  Worked all different hours.  Enjoyable place to work."
good,i love being in the enviroment of a job that requries you to work with a sence of urgency. this resturaunt was located off of a freeway exit so we would get lots of guest from all different areas. working as a hostess came natural as i am very outgoing. i was able to quickly answer questions of the guest. also i was able to quicly make any guest feel welcome to our bulding. i believe in doing beyond your best to keep custumors happy wen it comes to business.
good,"Cracker Barrel is by far one of the most organized companies I've ever worked for. My co-workers are extremely friendly, as is the management. The only major issue I saw with the company was communication among management sometimes was weaker than it should've been. With 3-5 managers all operating at the same level things got a little messy at times with things like call-ins or scheduling. "
good,"it was fun fast pace and i learn a lot there was no hard parts of the job because it was a family orientated place everyone had your back. the mose enjoyable part was the customer,fellow employee, and the pay."
good,"I enjoy my job, but I would like to gain experience in different fields."
good,"Everyday at work I will clean the store when needed. Catch up any dishes left behind from another shift. I learned that washing dishes is not a hard job but it is fast paces and you need to be patient.My co workers are harding working people. I learned a lot from them and I remain close with till this day.The hardest part of the job is when fellow co workers call off or fail to do their job correctly which makes it harder on others like myself."
good,My coworkers are amazing. Kind of like a family. The managers are willing to listen to any problem that may come up but are willing to help. With completing my education in C.N.A I want more for myself in the future. 
good,"A typical day at work for me is seating guests at the appropriate table. Also, I help the guests with anything they may need as well as keep up the cleanliness of the dining room. The managers are nice and easy going. My co-workers can be difficult at times but I handle the situations professionally. "
good,"I like the job, I feel that the management staff take a strong liking to the care of their employees and ensuring the overall satisfaction of customers and staff. "
good,A typical work day consisted on pleasing our guests and serving them home country cooking and making their experience as good as it can get. What i learned was how to handle a busy situation with a calm mind and perform my duties professionally. My co-workers were amazing and so was management except for one manager. 
good,This company gives great customer service to all employees and customers. Strive very hard on finding employees that's hard working and enjoys having fun

good,"A day at Cracker Barrel for me is pretty good. I love my co-workers, most of my managers, and my guests. The most enjoyable part of my job is making my guests happy. The hardest part of my job is dealing with rude or upset guests. I learn everyday how to multi-task and be patient."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"A typical day of work is greeting every customer as they walk through the door, answering questions customers have: retail related or company related. An employee has to stock products, provide customer service, and help create thematic displays all while communicating a positive atmosphere."
good,"One of the highest paying resturants in the area, with a good core management staff. The hardest part of the job is the pace and sometimes high level of stress that is placed on speed within the workplace."
good,Everything had to be done perfect. When it came to cleaning we had to do the best job or we wouldn't be able to leave. I served the customers and got them anything they needed. It would always be a hard days work for not much compensation.
good,"Weekdays are simple most of the time, slow business with easy hours, however there are some hectic weekdays that get very busy, Weekends are always very busy and requires diligent work to avoid getting overwhelmed. Most of the managers are friendly and understanding, easy to talk to on a peer to peer level. The co-workers have a large variety of personalities and attitudes but in general are approachable in friendly manner. Hardest part of the job is heavy lifting, especially the trash. Most enjoyable part of the job is the weekly pay."
good,Very flexible hours if you need them to be. You are able to cross train in every area if you would like and management training available.
good,A fun and safe work environment with close nit staff and diligent managers.

This company offers great room for advancement and has a great training program to let you acheive those sought out advancements."
good,Set up work stations for front and back grill daily at 5:30 am prepared made to order meals for customers in restaurant
good,"I worked at Cracker Barrel for a little while. I was actually there best cook but I quickly realized I became a victim of my own success. Since I was good at my job, I never had a weekend off, I was given all these extra responsibilities and my pay grade was not being moved up for all of it. After being promised more money for months and not seeing it I took another opportunity and went to Deano's."
good,"This was a very stimulating and fast paced place to work. I loved my managers. They treated everyone as equals. I made very good friends with my co-workers, and I loved all of the guests that came in. Especially the regulars. Some of whom I still see out at places which is nice. Id have to say meeting new people everyday and getting to talk to them was the most enjoyable part. The hardest part would have to be getting hours. They liked to hire too many people and it was hard to get enough hours."
good,"hard work to learn thing, but never get bored. I enjoy learning and work hard."
good,"I worked at three different positions at one time or another and I learned at a later time that most restaurants pay the same for the ime worked and not different amounts for the job worked. Regaurdless, the work was both challenging and enjoyable at times. It seemed that all the managers had worked in the kitchen at one time or another so they knew how a kitchen ran well, wich benefits everyone that works under them."
good,"A typical day consisted of reviewing a chart of the last shifts' completed and incompleted tasks. I've learned the basics in heating elements and their functions. It was not an impossible concept to grasp due to the encouraging management personnel that they had prepared on hand. Holidays always welcomed guests in mass quantities, but I always welcome a challenge. Naturally, the time spent in the workplace can tend to bring a bond between you and your co-workers. Needless to say, I sincerely miss them all."
good,i walked to work everyday clock-in everyone say hey and ask me how am i doing i learned nothing comes easy to you you got to work for it and the job made me work for it my co-worker was really nice i loved it the hardest part was doing doubles i love working with people that's what made me come to work everyday

good,"A typical day at work busy, busy, always busy. I learned to hostess, wait tables, cash out customers, cook back-up, prep-cook, make biscuits, and get food out fast as anyone. Management was pretty fair and okay. My co-workers were like a family to me. Some co-workers displayed envy but were okay to work with. There were no hard or issues with my job. The most enjoyable was counting tips at the end of a busy day/night, counting my cash drawer down to the penny and not being short or overdrawn, and getting out before 12 midnight to go home to my kids."
good,every day is the same when you work as a waitress the only difference may be certain days are busier than others..my co-workers were friendly and worked as a team..I made great tips there every night even on a slow shift
good,"A typical day at work i come in, I serve guest and i make decent money. I learn alot here, from food cost, building a relationship with customers, and having a better overall attitude. Management is okay at times, but there are ups and downs to that. I get to work with some* of the most respectable, laid-back, funny employees iv'e ever met. The hardest part of working here is managing time and keeping up with the floor plan. some times it changes and you might end up with a guest whos your and they walk out because you didnt know.

good,Depend on day
good,CBOCS was one of the best companies that I have worked with over the years. I was truly impressed with their management training program with the professionilism and organization. The company's core values was very much in line with my own.
good,I definetly would work there again I loved it there. The hours were great the work was good.
good,"When I worked for Cracker Barrel it was a more family oriented company all hire were made from within and everyone was trained in the CB culture, As they started to bring outsiders in it became a more stressful place to work."
good,"I loved the atmosphere at Cracker Barrel, I worked with great people and also the customers where great as well."
good,It's a great place to work.just not enough for me to support my family.Recommend for single students or anyone still in school.
good,"For anyone who wishes to balance home life and work life, Cracker Barrel is a great place to work. Time off was granted as needed, without any hassle. I worked for this company throughout a pregnancy, premature newborn, and with limitations to hours. Scheduling was very easy, and management worked hard to accommodate. At one point, a family member of mine in another state was placed in hospice. I was immediately granted a week off to return home and take care of her effects. The day I returned to work, that family member passed. Without question or problem, I was immediately granted another week to return home for the funeral. The support was amazing, and I never felt that I had to worry about my job being in jeopardy."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Cracker barrel is a nice company with simple rules and a very easy work life, long as you work hard and don’t slack off. The management can be difficult to deal With at times but they are open to listen to you and ask about what is goin on in your work life to help make things easier on you."
good,majority of the workers have been there for 1-15 years. Great long term and they don’t care about back ground. They only care about image. You can’t have earrings or nails. tattoos are fine but can’t be any gang or violent.
good,Great place to work at. Great benefits. Good people there and great management. Organized and clean. Fun people to be around. Chill laid back place to work at.
good,very fun and safe work environment. it is has a very friendly atmosphere. always on the look out for busing tables in the mourning when their most busy. everyone their is very friendly and able to help you out with any questions you have.
good,"If someone is not helping to do the dishes let them go. "
good,"For a predominately breakfast place, there is money to be made at cracker barrel all day. If you put in the hours and the effort you can make it work out."
good,I felt like it was way too fast paced and it made the workers somewhat stress out but people tried to stay calm and happy to be their. Management was thoughful and the people worked together the best they could to keep the energy positive
good,"Management is great, most people are great ( there are a few bad apples ) and for the most part you can make great money here. You don't have to tip anyone and you get to keep all your earnings. Managers are supportive and understanding. Only downshift to this employer is few hours and even fewer shifts."

good,This job is a good place to work great pay an there is room for moving up into a better position. The managers are very help2 an want u to excel in the company
good,"I have worked for Cracker Barrel since 2006. This is a great place to work! Flexible schedule, great employee discount nationwide! It's a company that you can move with. Transfers are very common especially with college students. The only negative is that, after all this time, they don't want to pay me what I'm worth. I plan on always keeping my employment with them for the discount and as a safety net should I ever want to up and move. It's nice working for a company that makes transfers so easy. However, as long as I can make DOUBLE the income somewhere else, this will not be my full-time employer."
good,"People are great, job is easy, but even during interview you are told this is a job that won't soley support you esp. as a single parent.  They are willing to work with any schedule you may or will have so at least there is plenty of flexibility for that second job, schooling, or whatever reasons you may need to work around. All in all its still a valuable work experience."
good,Managers were usually pretty understanding and helpful. Strict uniform. Usually short work hours. Often very busy. Can be a fun place to work. You get a decent discount depending on your star level
good,The managers are great and the staff are great and the food are Great the best place ever to work you get promotion and Merit raises and you get stars on your apron to show the public your achievements

good,Cracker Barrel is a company that focuses on employee first and then the guests.  Difficult at times but rewarding.  Career security.  Loyal.  Peolple Pleasing focus.
good,You take the people to their seats and then you'll also have other various side jobs such as folding menus and wiping off boosters and high chairs. As well as having knowledge about the retail store and some versions of what the servers know.
good,If you work in the dish room your expected to do the work of two dishwashers.   The good thing is that they do not stand over you while you are working.
good,Cracker Barrel remains to be my favorite job. The relationships I cultivated with the staff really made a difference in the work day. Cracker Barrel taught me a lot about customer service and being a team player. A great place to grow if you put in the effort.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I liked the weekly pay that we always get. Get paid every week on Thursday. You can make your own schedule and time frame. Work long hours sometimes even double-shift if you need the hours. Nice place to work but challenging.
good,It is a good place to work and pays well but hard to understand the system in which you enter the orders to. It has a flexible dress code and I always felt welcome.
good,I trained new servers that got hired. I enjoyed the work atmosphere! You can move up pretty quickly! Not everyone that works there was pleasant to work with but most were and I think that is at any job! Made great tips!
good,"If you’re in high school or fresh out of high school, it is a great place to work. The managers are very understanding and they will work with you to make you happy."
good,The fellow employees and management and Cracker Barrel we're almost always a delight to work with. It was a very fast paced environment most of the time with a few slower moments that helped break the stress. Would recommend.
good,"Great place to work, nice managers,great co workers,great advancements,employee discounts, flexible work hours, clean uniforms,good food, great retail gifts."
good,The training is essential and long but the confidence and work performance pays off in this fast paced invironment. The co-workers will assist and promote what ever you may have in question with computer/cashier.
good,A good place to work and the team members are well trained before starting on a position. The mission statement is about taking care of guest. I would recommend Cracker Barrel.
good,"A typical day at work consists of breaking down the buss carts, washing the dishwasher, distributing the dishes to where they are needed, buasing tables, taking trash out, and cleaning the floora and bathrooms. I learned that Cracker Barrel is a job that keeps you busy at all times. The management at Cracker Barrel is very amazing. They are helpful and very polite."
good,Anyone who works for them know you become family. Many who work there start in one position and grow to become standouts in others as well. I enjoyed my time there
good,"In general, it is a high standards environment that pushes the individual to grow to become the best worker they can be. The company itself works for pleasing people, both within and without."
good,"The typical day at cracker barrel is mainly interacting with guests while multitasking restocking the floor. The work place culture is a great atmosphere, and the coworkers are very nice and easy to work with. Management is flexible and cooperative."
good,"Normal server customer service/ restaurant environment. Management was in all areas to help out. I enjoyed working with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was getting food out on time on the weekends, dealing with unhappy guests but I always tried to make things right."
good,"It's a busy place on the weekends and at random intervals during the weekday. Don't expect a weekend off ever. You can work with the scheduling manager but understand weekends and holidays are mandatory. Have childcare arranged and know your availability. The managers are great and willing to work with you/help in times of need and influx of customers. "
good,It was a great place owork at except for you didn't know what was really the right way to do things so ay mangers with so different ways of doing things
good,Cracker barrel is a great place to work that I would recommend. They're very accommodating to people's schedules and really care about their employees.
good,"I personally loved working for the Cracker Barrel industry, everyone made you feel right at home.  Our most recent manager gave employees a sense of appreciation to feel comfortable and encouraged And really showed us how to better our department. She wasn’t afraid to step in and fill in any role of an employee. I will say though sometimes you will probably feel more experienced than your managers depending on the store."
good,work with some really good people. Staff was over worked and was very negative .I had many regulars that came to see me weekly. we ran out of out staple foods way to early and often.
good,"Working as a server at the Cracker Barrel is a difficult to define job. Some days are quite slow, while others are incredibly fast-paced and stressful. As a whole, I enjoy my position, and I'd recommend it to anyone that's personable and has good energy."
good,My typical day at work was to make sure that when you walked thru the doors that you wee ready to work and you was in uniform with a smile on your face and if you have any problems at home to leave them outside of the job doors. I also learned that most people that come thru those doors they are just like you and all they want is respect like you do and everyone should be treated the same. There was really nothing hard about my job I loved what I did. The enjoyable part of my job was the customers and my coworkers. I loved going to work everyday just knwing tht I was going to get to see my cowrkers.
good,"I have been with the company 10 years, and love it. I have learned how to multi task in high stressful situations.  I have met a lot of amazing people from all over the country working at this location."
good,I love it here and in as little as three months I got employee of the month. Managers pay attention to merit. Uniforms aren’t too bad. Got mine off amazon. Great place to start serving if you have no experience. They are very thorough in their training process
good,"I was a hostess at Cracker Barrel from the beginning of July to midway of August. It was a part time job, and was responsible for weekends. They had fair hours, because weekends were the most accessible time for me to work, and the pay was fine for what I did at work. I was in charge of assigning seats, taking guests to seats, organizing menus, and promoting the specials. It was not bad for the most part; the only time I did not enjoy it was when I get put outside to assign guests to the wait. I worked at a Cracker Barrel in the south, across from Carowinds, on a weekend, from morning to mid afternoon, in black pants and long sleeve shirt with an apron, it was hot. I was always there when times were mostly busy, which I was happy for because I like to keep busy, but sometimes I'd be the only hostess when a rush hour comes in and so I was scrambling to do everything on my own that's usually divided between 2 or 3 people."
good,Enjoyed my time here as it was a very friendly laid back environment. Stays very busy though and you do not hardly ever receive a break. This can lead to frustration of team members from not being able to stop for even a few minutes in such a fast paced environment.
good,"Flexible with working woth scheduling needs, friendly and helpful. Work hard to meet customer needs.  Good training. Staff is efficient and hard working."
good,Defintely enjoyed all 3 years I worked at Cracker Barrel. I went from dishwasher to Shift leader in 3 years with the help of all of the managers there and enjoyed every second of it.
good,Gave me a place to start here and trained me into every position in the company. Advancement was nice and supported by managers and staff. Working hard paid off.
good,Loved working for Cracker Barrel. Work was challenging but very rewarding. I felt upper manages were concerned about my experience. Was allowed to make decisions to improve the operations.
good,By far it was the best restaurant I have worked at. The food is top notch in my opinion. I would recommend this job to anyone wanting to start or continue a carrer in the resturant buisness!!!
good,the job was really great for coming out of my shell and getting better at talking to people. staff was always helpful and patient with teaching me. management was kind and understanding. great sense of friendship and community
good,The job isn't easy. The menu is large and there's many different ways to switch it up. But a typical day Flys by. An 8 hour shift generally feels more like 5. Some days drag but most dont.
good,Absolutely loved position and company cues when started. Very large company that believe in family values but really too large for corporate to oversee all stores.
good,This was a good place to work.  I learned a lot and I advanced quickly.  The pay was decent and the hours were good. There was a breakdown in communication between Management and Staff.
good,Love working for cracker barrel no problem with the job. They take care of the employees and keeping you busy because they busy with the customers and there family.
good,"I spent almost 2 years at Cracker Barrel - it was my first job - and I don't regret it. As a corporate restaurant the uniform and the rules were rather strict, but the staff and management were kind to me, I had a flexible schedule, and I made good money."
good,"The people that work there are very nice and helpful, especially if you are new and are not used to how things run on a daily basis. I had no problem adjusting to my role as a prep cook."
good,Its a fast paced job especially when you're double sat during dinner rush but the company pushes teamwork and that makes it much easier knowing when you can't be in two places at once your coworkers got your back
good,"Feels just like home when you walk in . The pay for a server is just too low , we are kind of the brain of the store .we greet , get drinks and food orders , run food , deliver checks , & bust the tables during and after"
good,"Retail is a great area to work. There is always something to do and is a very supportive environment. The negative is that the pay amongst coworkers is not quite fair. I have worked the longest at mine and some of the new people (with fewer stars) that were hired make more than I do per hour. It is frustrating. There is also a lack of communication amongst the restaurant managers and retail, so it is difficult getting togo orders out. "
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"over all the company has great benefits for full time people and there is a chance for advancement and retiring and such, but the one store that i worked at just had bad manager after another and the sales just were not there since we had to hit sales on candy while being next to a hospital full of diabetics. if you want a full time job with benefits and don't mind the pressure, by all means work here."
good,"This is a really stressful job at first but once you get the hang of everything it gets easier. You help other workers and they help you. You’re a part of a team. You make a lot of new friends, good tips, and learn better ways to communicate."
good,They want all the food out in 10 minutes or less even with a stream of 20+ food orders and mostly management will stand and watch the grill line down instead of jumping to help out with a huge rush and stand around yelling at us to go faster.
good,"This company treats you like family and always pushes to a higher level. Promotes from within , great training this company sets you up for success!!!!!!!!!"
good,"Not too bad of a place to work even though the holidays can be a bit hectic, they definitely will give you the hours you want as long as you’re skilled at doing what you do."
good,"A typical day at work as a server includes, meeting the needs of other people in professional standard, that meets the needs of cracker barrel in a ""country fresh way"" "
good,"The management was great, but they weren’t always understanding if you had something come up. You won’t work many hours a shift but you will get enough shifts. However, if you want to live off of this job you will need to pick up shifts because the salary of 3-5 shifts a week will not be enough to support you."
good,"It shouldn't be your main job but it helps a lot.The managers are awesome, yes they do expect great work from you,but it's expected. The customers are sweet. Most of them, every where has their ad apple."
good,"A typical day is very busy and fast paced. Also there a chores for every role that needs to be done. It is hard to get overtime, but the workers are very friendly."
good,"The work load and environment at the Cracker Barrel is usually busy and somewhat stressful, but the amiable coworkers and understanding managers more than make up for it. Everyone that works there has a respectful nature and produce a jovial atmosphere and degree of teamwork and camaraderie that help to make an otherwise stressful work atmosphere enjoyable. The work is hard, but the workplace is great."
good,"What I liked is the training process, they teach you everything and there are ways to grow within the company if you want to be in this industry (management)"
good,"I have been there going on 4 years. I love my job , I serve help sa in window to get food out correctly and quickly. Guest satisfaction a must . work well with others. I am also a trainer for servers. The jobs just isn't enough income."
good,"A typical day of work would be fast paced yet enjoyable. I learned a lot of skills working here and I think it was a great first job, especially while in school. Their hours are flexible and they have opportunities for advancement and pay raises. The hardest part of the job was working on Holidays, especially when you have children. The culture is quite Southern; mostly because of the country music and the pictures and things hanging on the walls."
good,"A typical day at work on a weekday, would be slow. On Weekends, expect long lines and crowded waits for tables and angry customers. There are alot of regular customers that treat the workers like family."
good,"The trainers they sent to train the GSS staff are amazing! The management at this location is awesome! They always greet you by your first name and with respect and politeness. If you do what management asks you, treat the guests as the most important person/people there, do your job according to the training you received, work hard, there is room to advance. I don't know much about the benefits yet, but they appear to be typical for the area I live in."
good,I love working at cracker barrel. It can be very stressful at times like most jobs but I love working with people and meeting people from across the country traveling. I've learned how to be patient when training a new hire. The hardest part of the job to me is disappointing the guests when something is not right for their experience.
good,"Great experience, timely raises, great benefits, although too many hours weekly, most of the time more than 55 hours, if sick had to make up days however when you worked more hours they did not give those back ...."
good,"Nice managers, friendly coworkers and just all around good people. It is a high stress job during the weekends, but most places are. Expect to work thanksgiving and Christmas eve in most cases."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"I had to call them, and ask if my background check was good and when was my orientation. But once I got my schedule, and I was working on the floor it was a good place to work at."
good,This was a good place to have  a first job. The employees and most managers are very friendly and create a good working environment. You start off with a good pay rate and are eligible for many raises throughout your employment depending on which position you take on.
good,"They are adamant about customer service and satisfaction."
good,The management was wonderful. Always helped with any problems or any other stressful times. The work place is clean and very upbeat. The hardest part about the job was moving through the dining room on busy hours esp. Sundays.
good,"Cracker Barrel provided me with useful customer service experience that I will take into my future career.  My fellow employees were cooperative when communicating with customers, and the management treated everyone with respect.  As a student, Cracker Barrel was willing to work with me based on my class schedule.  That way, I was able to work while also keeping school a priority in my life.  Cracker Barrel is an excellent place to gain valuable work experience."
good,"Its very fast paces Sundays were every busy for us everybody was in a positive attitude I like the employers I made a lot of friends , you get very comfortable with the area ."
good,Serving your guest with a family oriented experience every visit. Making sure you handle each guest with respect and with the best customers service possible.
good,"Great place to work if you want a part time job"
good,I enjoy working for Cracker Barrel.  It is not stressful like other restaurants.  The hardest part would be sometimes they would give me a 15 table section and not help me at all which was hard and they should have had more people scheduled.
good,Cracker barrel is a really nice to work everyone is so friendly and always smiling. Management all work together to make the store run great and make sure the guest are happy.
good,"A typical day at Cracker Barrel included making sure your tables were stocked and your area was kept clean. I waited on the tables that were assigned to me and made my customers feel at home. I had to write down their orders, memorize additional items they requested, put in their orders, keep them hydrated, along with a few other things. At the end of the day/night I had to restock my area, sweep, clean, to do whatever task was assigned that day/night in the kitchen, and count and roll up 100 pieces of silverware before i could leave. My manager was friendly from what I can remember. It was a very relaxing place to work at considering I was so young and it was my first or second job ever at the time. The hardest part of my job was not getting paid enough. Doing various things helped me enjoy my time there."
good,My experience from working at Cracker Barrel was awesome i really enjoyed the atmosphere made me feel like i was home. The workers there are very respectful and very friendly and i enjoyed
good,"I received a raise every year on the same date based on my performance reviews"
good,"I enjoyed my merchandising  position with cracker barrel. I loved the old time atmosphere, products and food as well as my fellow co-workers. I would definitely recommend this as a nice place to work"
good,Great place to work. Management is mostly good 5 out of 6 are great. 20% discount after being there for about a month. Paid weekly. Only 10 minute breaks after 6 hours though.
good,"Great for college students, flexible schedule. Watch your tips, people can be shady. The company overall is great to work for, but be advised many of the staff are on drugs, and it makes for a drama filled day."
good,I enjoyed the job and my co-workers. We are like family. You get a raise each time you PAR up: Personal Achievement Responsibility. Cracker Barrel  has a very good training program.
good,Cracker Barrel gives as much as you put in. There are opportunities for advancement that allow you to learn a great deal that transfers well should you choose to move on for whatever reason.
good,Cracker Barrel was a great place of opportunity. My boss was very fun to be around as well as friendly! I've made great connections with coworkers too.
good,I like it. You meet a lot of new people. The guest os very friendly. The money is good. And you can learn a lot of things from the people that has been working there for 20 plus years.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"My typical day at work consists of meeting guests needs, whether I'm cleaning, running trays of food, or actually greeting and serving the guest. I learned to multi-task and better time management due to the fast-paced and busy environment. Management is always helpful with any needs I may have and they maintain a positive attitude even in stressful and difficult times. This helps keep up work morale. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet the whole time. Sometimes it is super busy and you may not get a break for a few hours. This job requires a lot of walking. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people. Some of our guests are travelers who have stopped for a good home cooked meal. As a server I get to hear about where they have been and where they are going."
good,"Working for Cracker Barrel has taught me so much.  During my time here I have grown so much as an employee, as a person, as well as a mother. I'm very thankful for my experience and time with Cracker Barrel."
good,"I truly enjoyed working here! When you have the right management team and coworkers that work together, it makes the shifts a lot better. Very stressful at busy times of the day. I made great tips, but I am also a people's person. I averaged about $15+ per hour"
good,Cracker Barrel was a great place to work at! It felt like we were all family. I recommend anyone new to working to start off at Cracker Barrel. I did more than one job and was trained to do prep cook. It was a wonderful experience.
good,"Working as a dish washer for Cracker Barrel takes a lot of energy out of you. You got to be available to take criticism and turn it into success. Got to see the backbone of the company from a different perspective. The hardest part of the job is when the dish washer would break down, when you saw hot water coming out of the machine or hearing noises. Repetition is key of the job and communication."
good,"Absolutely a great environment too work, wonderful co-workers, and they always kept you busy and made work fun and enjoyable. They always settled a problem at hand and encouraged you too do your best."
good,"My review and statements are meant for the younger generation or retirees. This is a fun place to work. Management in general is wonderful! I never experience the healthcare benefits, as I was just a part time employee, so I cant attest to that."
good,"I enjoyed my time their. Managers could be a little better handling conflict.  The staff is kind, the guests are great to serve. Overall a good job to work for."
good,"I started working at Cracker Barrel when I was 16. I filled out their online application and three days later I was interviewed and hired. "
good,"Everything was great, except the hours. Most people only worked one day a week. The minor rules of the company didn't allow minors to work more than 4 hours a day and no more than 20 hours a week."
good,"The company I worked for had their ups and downs. It is a fairly new company, so they are getting better. I would seat people on a Sunday morning when it was busy, but at times it was very slow and they didn't have much for me to do so they would send me home for the night. I moved up quickly, and soon became a server. In that area of work, I was able to stay busy and help out in many places necessary."
good,"My current manager (retail) is amazing and the main reason why I have stayed so long. Work place is great, I love my coworkers and our regulars (the nice ones) are a plus. "
good,"This job made me appreciate the working experience. I Truly appreciated how competitive it was and how hard it was, especially for someone that was my age."
good,"Went from host to server and worked as a dishwasher, busser, and food prep on the side.  Hosting was the best because serving comes with two hrs worth of low pay side work and dish was just long into the night.  Management was pretty great as they were all enthusiastic and enjoyed their work and employees.  Hardest part was dealing with the customers.  They don't tip too well and leave your tables a mess most of the time.  I did however love greeting them at the door as a host when I only had to show them to their table."
good,"I worked my way up from being a server all the way to shift leading, ETC and on my way to being a manager. However I would see the struggles my current managers were having and they would talk to me about their problems. All of it stemmed from lack of communication and lack of following through with the cycle of service. For those reasons and a few others I quit before my two weeks notice. They were happy I was there and that I wanted to keep moving up but a lot of them used me for that reason, especially when they messed up."
good,A typical day at Cracker Barrel was 12 hours long. You learn how to manage retail and running a restaurant. I really enjoyed working in the gift shop helping the guest.
good,A typical day at work would be showing up on time and looking at my production chart and getting it done on time for lunch or dinner. I learned how to manage my time efficiently.
good,"This is a good job if you enjoy a slow paced environment. The management is pretty good most of the time. Themanagers genuinely did their jobs well (Please keep in mind this is only my personal experience.) The job itself was not difficult, but often times there was not much to do. You are required to speak with each customer several times so ability to interact comfortably is key. The most enjoyable part of the job is my co-workers. We all get along very well, and have fun together, however once again this is my own experience. It is easy to move up as you are guaranteed 4 raises depending on how long you stay.  They are usually very flexible with hours so that's a definite pro, and treat minor workers very well. I have been working here for almost a year and plan to leave soon only because I will be moving."
good,i had a lot of fun actually washing dishs at cracker barrel employes were nice but my fav was night maintnence was able to work by myself at my own pace take breaks when i wanted to and just do me
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Cracker Barrel was a good job at the pay rate, and how nice the employees were. The only problem with the job was that they were not willing to work with my school schedule. They also cut my hours, and when I added another day to get some hours back. They raised my hours back up, and I was working full-time instead of part-time. The job was good, but the manager were hard to work with around school."
good,The staff is very welcoming and the business runs on equality. You have the opportunity to succeed fairly quickly. They also work well with hours outside the workplace.
good,"Everyday you begin with a plan for success through leadership and coaching of staff.  Anticipating ever changing trends, as well as cultivating comradery.  Challenges in maintaining staff consistency and positive morale on a daily basis."
good,It is a fun place to work if you enjoy fast pace. Although sometimes the workers do get a bit frustrated with everything. Also breaks are very short if at all due to business.
good,"Cracker Barrel was my first real job. It was a great place to work. There were great people, atmosphere, management and great guests that came trough that door. For working at a restaurant I thought the wages were good. I never had a bad day while working at Cracker Barrel old  Country Store"
good,Cracker Barrel Old Country Store is a great place to work because the management team works well with my hectic college schedule. They are also great at teaching professionalism and maintaining a great environment for guests and employees.
good,Great managers great employees loved working in the fast pace environment. Worked there for over 3 years while raising my family and they really worked with my schedule
good,Great management and employees a overall fun place to work i love that i always get to socialize with people on a daily basis and im a very big people person i love it.
good,People treat you just as you want to be treated with love and care and they also treat you like if you were family the customers come in and treat you with respect just as you will
good,Opening and closing of cash drawer. I learned how to navigate guests to what their needs were. The manager was very willing to help and provide assistance when needed and very encouraging. All my co-workers were more than fun to work with.
good,It was a great work experience was welcomed treated like Family would recommend it to anyone looking for easy way to adjust into work industry.
good,work life at cracker barrel is nice and fun. Enjoyable atmosphere. the moment you walk in the door it feels like you are visiting your grandmas house.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of anywhere from a four hour to a twelve hour shift. I would come in and typically begin rolling my silverware immediately before I am sat. Once I am sat my shift would primarily focus on my customers. If I am given extra free time I typically kept up with my side work and continued rolling silverware. "
good,A typical day at Cracker Barrel is not very stressful. The job is very easy to pick up and repetitive. I have learned time management skills and great customer service skills.
good,"A good serving and restaurant atmosphere that makes you feel at home.  Customers can be a hit or miss. Provide good service, flip your tables fast and you will make bank. A very fast paced restaurant so if you are lazy this is not the job for you or you will find yourself making no money."
good,"As a minor, you are not allowed to work more than 5 hour shifts at a time but sometimes they do it anyways. They have every type of personality there in managers. Some of the other coworkers do the bare minimum in their responsibilities and managers do not seem to do anything about it. But if you are a people person it is a fun place to work for a while. You are surrounded by tons of different types of employees and customers."
good,A typical day work would include me getting a radio and immediately going out and serving and pleasing people doing anything I can to help the guests experience more enjoyable. What I have learned working at Cracker Barrel is how to please people more than I already do. The managers are lovely they each know what they are doing and help by keeping the peace between coworkers. But they need to communicate better amongst themselves and with the co workers. My co workers are lovely to work with though some of them can be a little rude at times but overall they always help in anyway they can if I need help. The hardest part of my job would be remembering exactly what a guest wanted. The most enjoyable part of my job is the guests and getting to laugh with them and just make their experience more enjoyable
good,"Great atmosphere and team to work for  "
good,Fun and friendly staff very hard working people. I love working there the people make the work day fly by it's safe its fun it's a great first job or second job.
good,"Working here for three years, I notice the changes that happen in life. I gained the will to exceed my expectations and work ethic to become a team player for a smooth work environment."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Everyone at cracker barrel makes new employees feel like family. They welcome everyone inside and provide great guest experience to anyone who walks in. The motto is ""to provide a home-away-from-home experience"". Natural, genuine interaction between guests and employee, causing a great atmosphere and a wonderful time."
good,"Cracker Barrel has a fast paced environment. You need to have the ability to multitask while constantly smiling because everything they do deals with hospitality. It is a family friendly environment from the restaurant to the retail store. However, a lot of the employees find the environment to be stressful. Each position has different types of responsibility and you're constantly moving while you are working. During peak hours it often feels like you cant catch up because you are often under staffed. Each manager, at every store, goes through the same training. Just like any where else you have great managers and then you have really terrible ones. The management team works long hours and they show it during a shift by slacking off when they are tired and often through the employees off to the side choosing to ignore issues."
good,Awesome co workers and employer. Very helpful to employees and offers chances for improvement. Very strict health and sanitation guidlines.
good,"I love working for Cracker Barrel. I've been working for the company for three years now, and since then I have had several opportunities for raises and have become a Skill Trainer. I love teaching new employees about the job, the management, and the culture of Cracker Barrel. "
good,First day I walked into the door I was hired on and placed into chef training. Training course was very enjoyable in that it was in depth on detail making it a great challenge. By the end of the third day of training my trainee had full confidence to put me on the line. By the end of the week I was cooking up orders during rush hour. After weeks had gone by I desired to advance myself in my usefulness by branching out onto the dining room floor waiting tables. After months of going from the kitchen to the dining room I showed desired in working the gift shop as well in unloading trucks and stocking shelves. I developed some wonderful relationships both with customers and co-workers which I still keep in contact to this day. The pay was the best in the building under management as being a chef but the drive was a bit further than desirable.
good,"A typical day at work is ensuring guests have a pleasant experience from the time they walk in the door until they leave. I have learned a lot through this company such as a great work ethic, pleasing people, how to maintain friendships, and how to work well with others and work through problems that may arise. The management at Cracker Barrel has been excellent in working with me and my school schedule to ensure I had the time that I needed to work as well as attend class. The most enjoyable part of working at Cracker Barrel is interacting with guests and hearing the stories they have to tell."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Cracker Barrel. The management team was always pleasant and helpful."
good,"Typical day at work would be overall pretty satisfying. I learned team work, putting guests first, customer service skills and hospitality. I also learned a lot of time management and how to work with waits in restaurants. The management and co-workers are both great. Hardest part of the job was to figure out floor plans throughout the shift, the most enjoyable part is to be in a smoke free, alcohol free, family place."
good,"Great for people looking for a part-time and flexible job for only a year or two. Too many negative attitudes, everyday you'll hear people curse this place while they're working. I probably would've wanted to stay if these people weren't around. Little effort from managers to boost company morale or solve any reoccurring issues mentioned at company meetings."
good,Great company just very hard to advance. Been with the company for six years and I have been treated fairly. Easy going staff and the company values their employees.
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel has given me an opportunity to pursue a career in restaurant management with my background in Culinary Arts. The culture at Cracker Barrel is ""country fresh"" defining how our food is prepared and served to how we treat our guests and each other. "
good,Cracker Barrel creates a safe and fun work place in which you are able to bond with your co-workers not only as a team but as a family. The guiding principles and mission statement help to develop a good working attitude and work ethic in most all of the employees and managers. I have learned how to work with others to achieve a goal. I have also learned how to instruct others on how to complete a task based on Cracker Barrel standards and guidelines.
good,Cracker Barrel is an enjoyable place to work. There are many opportunities to improve yourself and even outside events from the restaurant to get one even more involved.
good,"With the job I learned what work is, and that work never stops while clocked in. The hardest part about washing dishes was the constant pressure to clean every dish."
good,"I was treated/trained very well, and the opportunities for advancement were plentiful. Management was very patient with me during training, and very quick to reward me for a job well-done."
good,"I began working for Cracker Barrel at 16 as a server. After college, I chose to move forward with the company in the Emerging Leaders program. Management, like any other restaurant company is a challenging career. To me, the work-life balance is not the best if you want to be a parent who is involved in the lives of your children. Politics are highly involved once in management, they talk a lot about personal development, but it's really all about the numbers."
good,"Fun place to work. They are very flexible. Ideal for those who are enrolled in school, be it college or highschool. Fast pace, yet is a nice place to start for experience."
good,"I worked at Cracker Barrel for about 3 months and my management, coworkers, and guests in the restaurant are always welcoming. I go in to work feeling bad or down, but after a shift of serving I come out feeling great. Serving can have its ups and downs but I love getting to know people and have a glimpse into others daily lives."
good,"Cracker Barrel is a great place to come to eat if you're looking for a quick stop, or want to stay for a while. The store is always filled with tons of knickknacks, toys, candies and clothes."

good,The mangement is very respectful and will listen to your needs or questions about the job. They always make sure that you are doing well. We are always getting evaluated and they share with us what we need to do better in or are struggling with. I love to see guests come and leave happy!
good,I would seat people and make sure everything was clean for the customers. I learned how to deal with conflict if anything was wrong and help my managers find a solution. Most enjoyable was being able to interact with customers and seat them. Hardest part was getting out of rotation due to the customers preference of where they wanted to sit and the servers getting mad.
good,"The job was fun for the most part, the people you work with make the workplace what it is and I had good hard working people to work with. Management didn't see eye to eye with everyone but they did there jobs to the best of their abilities. A daily basis, the job was easy as long as you were working with the right people. I believe the hardest part of the job was that Sunday lunch rush. It was the worst five hours of the week, but it was the day that paid the bills. The people made the job enjoyable all the way around."
good,"I love breakfast and early mornings, I enjoy touching tables and making sure guest are happy. Teaching servers on how to give great customer service. The intensity of the power hours, where ticket times are so important."
good,"After clocking in, I would put on a headset and start seating guests in the dining rooms. I had to set them in a rotation  according the server charts. I would seat over 200 guests a shift and would sometimes be working with as many as 18 servers. I was in charge of checking the bathrooms regularly in case they needed cleaning. During busy times I also cleared and cleaned tables, as well as received and delivered drink orders "
good,"My job involved me walking around small sections asking customers if they needed any help. It became very tiresome after doing this for 4 to 6 hours at a time when there were no customers and every shelf was stocked and no one was there to disorganize it."
good,I worked at Cracker Barrel for 7+ years. I started as a server in college and advanced into management. A typical day as a manager required managing staff and costs of the daily operation. I learned a great deal in the aspect of managing a retail operation and working with a variety of skilled employees. I was able to manage the restaurant while being able to jump in and work any position when needed. I worked under a GM and alongside 4 AM's. Each day presented a new challenge and our team worked very well together. I maintained a great rapport with staff and co-workers. The most challenging part of the job was ensuring the operation ran smoothly during the daily fluctuations. I greatly enjoyed serving people and working with such a large and diverse group of individuals.
good,"Daily set up food production and expectations.Ensure food quality,food safety and sanitation. Improve guest count by providing excellent guest service and meeting financial goals."
good,"I only worked there for two months. The money was good compared to other serving jobs I've worked, but the work load was insane. Many of the servers I worked with, especially the ones that had 4 or 5 stars on their apron, were very lazy. I ended up doing all the work for my tables while taking care of other people's tables. All in all the company structure is good, you can promote yourself with time and the right attitude."
good,The people you meet working for cracker barrel will make it all worth the VERY hard work!
good,"A typical day at work was generally easy and laid back. I learned many customer service techniques and the Cracker Barrel culture and history. Management were okay not too hard on us, and very understanding. My co-workers became somewhat of a second family due to majority being generally good people, everybody had some type of relationship outside of work. The hardest part was dealing with a sudden rush every now and then but we were prepared most of the time. The most enjoyable part would have to be working with my fellow coworkers"
good,"The work day is some times busy depending on the day and time. I learned to open up to meeting new people and being able to read a person better. The management was great there, from the general to the regional. The were easy to get along with and understanding of situations. The workings there were like family after a while, every one got a long pretty well and helped out when ever it was needed.

Management is different everywhere, but specifically where i worked it seemed like if management was having a bed day so was everyone else. My coworkers were very diverse in ethnicity and friendly all around. The hardest part of the job was dealing with guest who weren't happy with their meal in any way shape or form. sometimes i got cussed at due to a cooks mistake and only thing i could do was smile and attempt to fix the error and offer for them to speak to my manager on duty."

You learn some very good recipes and how to be a better cook. All of the other workers were very nice and respectable as cracker barrel assures that the hire specifically those kind of people.

I continually have an urge to always reach customer satisfaction. I complain about management sometimes but all in all they do a very good job at maintaining a great restaurant. The hardest part of my job is the stress, because I am a hard worker I am expected to do more. There is just a huge load of pressure always on me to carry the front of the restaurant when I am needed to. I really do enjoy working there and I genuinely adore the people I have the privilege of working next to."

It will give the children and/or parents and idea to purchase that for their kid(s). There was a roll up keyboard also, both were really cool. I use to love the smell of the fire burning during the winter the fireplace was always active. The hardest part of my job was the stress to sell certian items. There was a quota everyone must have filled by the end of the day. If you sold more then you got more hours the next week. I didn't think that was fair and some customers find it to be pushy."
good,A typical day of work starts for me at 5am. I open the store and get the grill line ready for the business day. The most enjoyable part about the job is making orders and pleasing the customers.

After the guests obtain their food, I make sure to check back for any needs or wants they may have.

Management was acomindating to please employees and make sure they were happy and comfortable with thier position. The only downside is the pay was very poor."
good,"Showing up you get told how things have been. But it's inconsistent. Also, many of the associates begin to stress about the sales metrics.

I was doing well until the retail manager was fired and people started boycotting cracker barrel, and the business went down hill. I had flexible hours and they gave me time off when I requested it. I rodeo and have a busy schedule and they always made sure I was off when I needed to be. One complaint I have is that some of the managers refused to cut the floor on time and it would be 45 minutes until we had a new floor plan. Overall i appreciated cracker barrel."
good,"l love my co-workers and management because everyone cares about each other. There will always be a lousy customer, but the people I work with create a wonderful environment. This job has helped me learn how to deal with situations effectively and efficiently."
good,"This job had a high demand in the kitchen, but working in overnight maintenance was easier for me. You're hours as a cook are primarily based on how quickly the servers bump off your orders and deliver the food. It's best to be friends with the hardest working servers so they are likely to pay attention to the food you place in the window. Simply being the fastest, most organized cook won't get you more hours. On overnight maintenance I soon received the most hours since I was being rated on my own work. The back up cooks had the best position I think; they always had the best moral and employees constantly wanted to move into that position."
good,"It is a very fast paced work environment. Many of the guests are regulars. So you get to know a lot about them and watch their families grow up. They have practices in place so that everyone has a chance to move up, and have an extensive training program."
good,Cracker Barrel is an amazing company to work for. They have a tremendous training program to ensure everyone excels. I worked as a server and in the retail shop. As a server I learned how handle difficult situations with a respectful and calm attitude.In the retail shop I learned how to do floor moves and educate guests about the products.
good,The management was understanding and very nice. The other workers were very friendly and helpful. They made working there not so bad. If I ever needed any help I always had someone there for me.
good,"I enjoy working with the other employees. Those of us who have worked together for a while have become a support team for each other. I have grown during my time here and am always encouraged to reach new levels of greatness. I have had small disputes with my management team. Nothing major, just little disagreements, however we always seem to work it out and I do not feel as if there have been any repercussion from challenging my mentors. The hardest part of the job is when I am scheduled doubles. I do my best work in an eight hour window. After that point, I am useless. I just do better tip wise and customer service wise in eight or less hours. Every one gets tired. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I get a table of great people who I enjoy as much as they enjoy their visit. That is what keeps me going back to work."
good,"Fast paced but love the environment, it so good being around all the friendly faces. my usual day starts with me getting a run down of what to expect and our goals for today and if there are any tasks that need to be done before the end of my shift. all of the retail associates work hard to meet a sales goal for the day, we usually do that by assisting guest and engaging them on products and services around the store."
good,"I like working at Cracker Barrel, unfortunately some days are really slow and that means you don't have a chance to make money as a server. "
good,"As a restaurant in the highway, the server have to give a fast and efficient service to the guests. We are very experienced with working in pick hours. The staff is great and always try to work together. The priority is to give the guests the best customer service possible."
good,From my experience this is a very good job and should be persuade. My only down side would be with some of the polices and procedures. Also not all but some managers really need to be reviewed and dismissed.
good,All the people there are amazing. They really make it easy to want to go to work instead of dreading work. They management treat you like one of their own.
good,Great time working there. All the managers we're nice. The co workers were helpful and nice. Good atmosphere can Make good Money if u really try. Deff recommended
good,the most busiest days are friday - sunday. It was a decent company to work for just disliked all the test dummy experiments. I had amazing and understanding managers.
good,"Not a high paying job but for its line of business in food service, it is a great place to work for. They have many opportunities to advance in pay and responsibility. Everyone from management/coworkers to the customers were friendly and easy to work with. I enjoyed the customer service there as well as the experience in food service."
good,"really great place to work at fun and beneficial. i have worked here for almost two years and never had any problems. the company gave me a great opportunity,"
good,"This job was really enjoyable and offered many benefits due to its various advancement opportunities such as a raise every time one 'pars up'. The staff was very nice, for the most part, and the environment is very friendly and easy going."
good,"I like some of the managers, I like the retail store. I like their food, I like working with people who are doing trucks. the work is kind of fun"
good,I love the atmosphere. It was very loving and team oriented place to work. The management team as well as staff was awesome.
good,"This company was very happy that I worked for them in such a small period of time, and all the time that I was there, I was always on time and very efficient with my job."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,A typical day at work I would greet customers and seat them. When we were slow I would help waiters clear and clean their tables. I learned how to balance between customer needs and the waiters needs. The hardest part of the job was getting customers seated on extremely busy days. The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with customers and their needs.
good,I picked up this job in order to bring in some extra revenue while in college and have nothing but good things to say about my time there. Nice and easy to talk to managers who are understanding of school schedules and outside obligations. The hardest part to me was sometimes staying on task solely because it's so easy to get caught up having fun with the people you work with.
good,"The best part about working at Cracker Barrel are the coworkers, including management. The store and restaurant are both well staffed and communicate well. There are opportunities for raises and more job opportunities as you work and grow with the company."
good,"arriving at cracker barrel for any shift was a cross between surreal and exciting. The aura of expectation and drive of making or creating your own rate of pay was adventurous. You never knew what to expect from customers or what to expect from your co workers as the turn over rate was high due to a lack in commitment from workers. The managers played dual roles although they managed professionally they mentored personally. Always encouraging us to apply for a higher position or learn as many skills as possible to increase knowledge of resteraunt and understand its flow of operation.  The hardest part of the job was when the guest had to wait on food because of shortage in kitchen during these times i would assist the kitchen as best i could to help everyone order come out at a faster pace, because my knowledge of kitchen orders was limited my help was but any help as a team member was needed and appreciated."
good,"It is a fast pace and high volume place, but very exciting and a fun place to work at. Very flexible hours so it is a great place to work at for college students."
good,This job was a extremely positive work experience to have. I most definitely enjoyed working here because I learned a lot more about serving.
good,"It was great place to work.  Some people could be a little doped up.  Some were fired for being high on the job,  but other than that it was great.  Managers and shift leaders were very helpful if you had questions."
good,"this was an absolutely fun and entertaining job that was fun of things to do. even though it got busy and frustrating at times, everyone still managed to pull together and get it done."
good,i enjoyed working at this establishment.  managers were respectful and did monthly reviews of me that would result in letting me know what i needed to improve on or what i was doing good at and possibly a promotion. aka more stars
good,"When you come in for work at Cracker Barrel, often times, you are greeted by your fellow employees and some regular guests that may recognize you. Almost everyone is friendly and has a smile on their face. During the work day, the tempo fluctuates with the number of guests coming in and out, but you are still expected to be productive, even when there are no guests to serve. "
good,my night at work was fun I got to stand by the door an let people out an they was so thankful for that. with going in at nit I also got to met some of the works that was doing there job to make the people happy I got to see what they did how the did it. as I was there I had learn so much there I never thought I would learn how to use an buffer that was so much fun after I got use to it. management was okay if you ask me I really don't have to much to say. the hardest part of my job was the the trash because it would get so full an I would have to push it out an dump it.
good,"Opening procedures, review our manager's log for any issues from day before, orders to be prepared for delivery, to go for this day, or any special events, open door for employees, set up the registers, conducted a thorough inspection of dinning room, restrooms, and of course the kitchen for cleanliness and organization,  conducted inventory of prepared food items for my shift, prepared list of items to be prepared for next shift, and list of items to be pulled out of freezer for the next day. Wrote floor plans for servers, etc. Made sure all personnel needed were in premises, Open restaurant doors for guests, greeted guests at the doors or tables. Go to the bank to take deposits.The hardest part of the job was to keep the restaurant fully staffed, since most of our employees were students from college and some of them were kind of irresponsible. The most enjoyable part at my job was to see happy, satisfied guests, and off course happy co-workers."
good,"Cracker Barrel was a great place to work at. However, once new management arrived after 2 years and did a whole new ""cover"" it all went down hill. Hours were being cut, no money was capable of being made. Couldn't get help from the upper management.  I learned a lot of cash handling and to work more at a fast pace."
good,"I love working at Cracker Barrel because the work environment is very diverse and there is always a lot going on at one time. I thrive on the chaos in the restaurant and can usually keep things together so it's controlled chaos. I've learned a completely new set of skills since i started working there such as multi-tasking, people skills, and the ability to find the balance between working quickly and efficiently. The management are always willing to help when it is needed which is very often considering the volume of guests we have in the restaurant on any given day. The thing I enjoy most about the job is that i get to meet new people and I love training someone on how to do our job effectively so they are a valuable team member."
good,It was a great first job. that understood I was young and gave me the experience I needed to develop and skills I later took to other jobs.
good,"Taking care of the guest by providing an outstanding guest experience."
good,"in work by 7 am"
good,You're constantly always on your feet at this job. Always around people. Don't work here if you hate people.
good,I liked working here because of the great managers and because of the work environment.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"The company was very involved in helping everyone advance and get farther in their career. They are very helpful in creating flexible schedules for students, parents, and people with multiple jobs."
good,Everyone knows everyone. Very close and welcoming family. When you’re there you don’t mind working because it doesn’t feel like work. Like you’re always at a thanksgiving dinner with friends.
good,"I loved working with cracker barrel,many heartwarming guest and co workers. Imagine working with family in a business. I feel like I work with nothing But family at cracker barrel."
good,A great company to work for.   Servers make great money there.  Employees are treated fairly.  The chain of commands is used well.  Didn’t want to leave there
good,This job was wonderful. It really helped me develop the necessary skills for working in customer service. I absolutely loved every single minute that I spent in Cracker Barrel Old Country Store.
good,"My personal experience with Cracker Barrel with the past year I have worked here, has been great for the most part. That is my own experience, however I know a few who can not say the same. I love my managers and co workers. The environment is fast-paced and was a little difficult to adjust to at first but all of my managers worked with me instead of against me which has really made the difference for me."
good,"Despite weekends being packed with so many people to seat (sometimes you'd have to be a busser), the job does not demand too much. You have to be fast-paced and attentive to customers needs and managers direction. The several managers there are very flexible and will help you if you are having trouble."
good,"Would definitely recommend working there, a great first job as well. It has very flexible working hours and management is excellent. You will always have a blast while working."
good,My experience at working at Cracker Barrel with excellent The Only Exception was the general manager that was there at the time he was rude at times other managers were great I would do anything to go back to Cracker Barrel but maybe as a server
good,"Typical work day was for the most part smooth, steady paced. Unless of course it is Thanksgiving. That day is probably one of the busiest. The hardest part of the job for me was the tips. I was used to making way more money than I was. It was definitely a humbling experience."
good,It was an ok work experience the only thing I wish they'd change is how they have their workers cleaning their bathrooms without gloves or any sanitary protection. Other wise it's a good place to work positive employees and is a healthy work environment.
good,"Been working here coming up a year in June and it is my first job. Starting off will definitely be stressful if you've never been a server before, but training is very thorough. High expectations, but very helpful with feedback and praises. Very busy in the summer and it is easy to work 6-7 hours and make $100 or usually well over $100 in tips especially on the weekends. During the cold seasons (Fall, Winter) tips are still pretty decent. Hardly ever make less than $10/hr in tips. Bad thing is that managers usually make busy rushes way more stressful than they need to be. When managers are all over the place it affects the servers and in turn the guests as well"
good,A family atmosphere.a fun place to work.nice servers and managers.great cooks and great food.weekly pay and paid time off.some times it can be stressful but at the same time it can be fun when you have the right people working together.
good,A bit hectic during rush hours. Manageable though. I learned how to rotate the floor in dining room settings without double seating people. I learned  to communicate easily and efficiently with others. I gained teamwork skills. Variety of ethnicities and culture at work. The hardest part is trying not to upset servers whenever a guest asks to be seated elsewhere from where led too. I like the pay and customers. Management is great for the most part however they often have a hard time with floor plan and paycheck management.
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel I have Learned a lot, I meet a lot of people, they make you feel like family, you get benefits, tips are great.  You can Work double shift and they give you a flexible schedule."
good,"Some customers come in regularly, dining with the same server. Enjoying their experience as if it were their first. Hostess and retail associates work side by side to greet every guest, and make each of them feel warm and welcomed. Associates of retail offer children and adults young at heart to play with the days featured toys. While members of the hostess team tell the family of customers the specials, and new food offers."
good,A typical day at Cracker Barrel is hectic. I've learned how to accommodate guests needs best as possible. I have also learned how to assist guests with their complaints.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"a typical work day is either slow or fast paced. You are always working and always doing something to help out the servers or the managers. There wasn't really a ""hard part"" when working at Cracker Barrel."
good,"Being a server at Cracker Barrel was a lot of fun. The workers, the customers, and the management team all made it a fun and safe place to work. The only thing I disliked about the job were the busy,  busy days. It would sometimes be stressful but my co-workers helped me get through the day."
good,"Great company with great pay and benefits. Not ideal for single mothers or families that want extra time at home however, you're working 12 hours, 5 days a week as a manager and you're working holidays also."
good,"Typical work."
good,"At Cracker Barrel old country store, you get an all around experience of selling to guests, and checking out guests at the cash registers. This is regarding the retail store. Pay should be better, as I do much more than $9.50 an hour. I am up at the cash register, as well as checking the (awful smelling) restrooms, selling to our guests, constantly replenishing items, and food, and stocking in the stockroom. I think $12 an hour would be a much more fair pay. The team I work with is amazing. They have become my second family! The management is awesome as well. I couldn’t have asked for a better boss!"
good,I really enjoyed working for Cracker Barrel. The management was great to work for and very understanding. The management worked with the hours I needed. The other employees were very nice.
good,"I had fun working there. Most all management was superb. Only anthony was an incompetent compulsive liar, took credit for any positive direction the restaurant took. Just a sad disgusting little man who couldn't run a line to save his life. A nerd that has no business in a kitchen. But everyone else was awesome! Especially Ashley!"
good,It was a fun and good place to work. The managers are very understanding in balancing your work and home life. The managers and coworkers treat you like family. You learn how to work in a fast paced environment as a team.
good,"I would work the sales floor and restock product. Certain days I would check and unload truck deliveries. I reset sales weekly. Handle inventory counts. Assist guests with items, sizes, gift wrapping."
good,It was a good/interesting atmosphere and quite fast paced as well. I barely went out there to eat so learning the seating was a bit confusing. Overall it's a great place to work at if you've had previous serving experience and this was my first time.
good,"Usually busy, especially on friday and sunday so always look forward to moving all the time. Management is tough, but stern. and fair, most if the time.The best part of the job is most definitely the GUESTS! They are truly amazing! And the hourly employees are great as well. The pay is good, especially if you are a server!"
good,"work be a manager there, the pay is great. They dont have much room to move with scheduleing and like all restaurants find a few good workers and work them 80/week."
good,"Cracker Barrel is a very challenging job for the uninitiated, however with a little time and practice it quickly becomes simple work. The great challenge of the store comes with the day and the amount of people we serve. Considering our store is located near the off ramp of a busy highway, our business is always steady. Knowing how to manage your time, creating the right amount of food, recording times and temperatures, as well as maintaining a clean work environment is critical to a successful shift. Lastly is the relationship between co-workers which is always friendly. In short, setting you and your fellow workers up for success, along  proper knowledge of your stations many intricacies  is key to a productive and fun employment."
good,"this is a place you take your entire family out for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. a typical type of day goes fast. we make sure your food is hot and ready to go to you as soon as it hits the window. management try's to work with everyone's wants and need in order to please our guests as they walk in and out of the door. The workplace culture is fun, friendly, and employees become your closest friends at work or out of work. The hardest part of the job is when teamwork doesn't exist, which makes the vibe go off at times, that's when people start to get angry with one another. the most enjoyable part of the job is when the management crew becomes your friend."
good,A day can be very stressful at cracker barrel it all depends on how you handle your issues I try to just think of the best way to deal with a issue during my shitf
good,There's room for advancement as long as you are consistent with knowledge about your position as they go by par status here. If you qualify there are benefits you can receive.

good,They didn't allow me time off for a family emergency so I quit only reason I left. But overall I liked working there the staff was very nice and not once rude or cruel to the new staff some managers help and take charge with rowdy customers while others stand and glare and do nothing.
good,Management and employees are wonderful to work with. Love to intract with the guest. Great team work. They work with you on anything. Easy to talk to to resolve any issues... management is working as a team and works as hard as we do..
good,Everyday has its struggles. You get busy out of nowhere and on some of those days you just happen to be short handed but you pull through and it becomes a very good day for not only you but you make good as well. You can work all day and pick up shifts to make more money. Everyone is like family. We all help each other. We cut up and laugh and try to make it at least a little fun. It difficult when you go through management a lot but you pull through it turns out to be really great as well.
good,"You can never be in a bad mood at Cracker Barrel. Even being an Employee, coworkers and customers will always brighten up your day. I love the management, coworkers and customers their fantastic people!"

good,This job was great. Alot of opportunities for pay increases. The hardest part was the upsales after the customer was full and ready to leave.
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel is a fun and enjoyable experience on a day to day basis. The management is friendly and professional, as well as the staff.

good,I like to work for cracker barrel they great advancement for management by you have to apply yourself to work and have a great score in  review by over 95% for the next level. The people are great their sometimes a little pushy when they order don't less than 5 seconds as soon they ring the order in. The management staff are great as well all pretty cool to me. The hardest part is what i do as back-up cook i have to get all the food prepared for line cooks at 10:30am sharp. But when you do a great thing that day the managers will appreciated you for your hard work ans says thanks.
good,"I have 6 years with this company and have seen ups and downs, but I am very happy to work for Cracker Barrel.

good,I was only employed here for a few months because I was out of school for the summer. It was a fun job and I enjoyed the experience and the people.
good,"A typical day at work at Cracker Barrel is one that is in accord to everything. U walk in and you arrive in the store area first of the company and you see the display of antique collections of toys, machines, and everyday objects used in the early twentieth century America with classical country music from the best artists back then, and it also gives the affect for retirement aged customers that their youth is still in affect even today. My apearance is usually in the right uniform, I greet everyone in my work station, including my manager or shift leader and I start my work off by asking who is assigned to each operation sections in the dishroom. I make sure every step and safety procedure is followed, putting on gloves and using the right sanitation material for the pots and pans, and making sure the dish machines water is sanitized enough for the remaining two hours ahead. I learned a lot about the way to be a professional team member in and out the dishroom and to keep customers satified listening directly to instructions of my managers and co-workers. The hardest part of the job would be when it is very busy. I learned instantly my first month working there how to work fast and efficiently, keeping up with the pace of the customer's menu, desires, and demands because the cooks and prep cooks were depending on clean dishes and cooking material from us."
good,"Their wages were competitive, great place to move up quickly and cross-training is available. They are fair and easy to work for if you are willing to do your best show up on time and do your best."
good,"-You have to be good with math"
good,"I’ve been fortunate to work with an enthusiastic group of individuals. Working retail is rewarding and the employee discount is great. If you are looking for flexible PART-TIME work, this is the place for you. Full-time is hard to come by until you have been with the company awhile and have proven yourself."
good,"The company that I work for is all about Pleasing People, and that’s what I do on a daily basis. When I became an employee for the company i knew that would be a perfect fit because I like interacting with other people and satisfying guests. Overall my experience for working with the company has been great. The benefits are great!"
good,Love my job and all my fellow coworkers. Being a merchandise handler was one of best career decisions. Teaching my team and girls to better the store and truck is one of the best feeling.
good,"I love working at Cracker Barrel because I get to interact with the guests/customers, I get involved with side work, and with communicating with the managers, they will help you with your schedule.  I enjoy working with this organization."
good,"The people are great. Pay is above generous. The managers work with your scheduling whether it be school,kids,etc. The advancement opportunity is great as well."
good,"It pretty much says it all there ^"
good,"A typical day was chill on the weekdays and very manageable. I learned that communicating boundaries with your managers works best, in regards to how many hours and day you can work. The management was good, my favorite managers worked alongside me and were willing to help when we were understaffed. Overall my coworkers were very kind and helpful. The hardest part of the job was being understaffed on the weekends due to people calling out or scheduling conflicting with peak hours. I really enjoyed the comradery with my coworkers."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.

good,Faced paced. Team players. Cool managers. Everyone gets along. Sometimes the customers are crazy but not everyone. Great tips. We don’t split tips AT ALL
good,95% of staff are always happy and always willing to help out even without being asked. My pay was good just hard to get hours because we are a bit overstaffed. Managers are great except one of them but all managers are flexible and understanding also they help all team members.
good,Great company; good back up from superiors. Long hours; hard to balance family and work. Good pay; opportunities for advancement always available. You will learn a lot.
good,It's nice but if you want full time apply somewhere else. And you have to be willing to work weekends bc they will schedule you Friday-Sunday.  They hire a lot of people and you don't get as many hours that you want. But the coworkers are nice and willing to help you. Requesting off is easy and online. The people are just so friendly.
good,"Was my third job nice if you want to make extra cash on the side or work full time would recommend "
good,Fun enviroment I was responsible for 8-10 employees as a shift leader/ trainer and learned the basic management skills like making orders scheduals shipping and recieving
good,"cracker barrel is a good company to work for ,benifits are great, job is a breeze,the only thing bad i really have to say is the pay stinks.payrate could be more for the workers when mgmt. puts out the right training and they should have night differential. i loved my job with company some of the employees work hard and deserve better payrate."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job at Cracker Barrel was the different types of people I met on a daily basis. I love hearing different stories about the lives of others. I met many famous people and got many autographs.
good,I worked the cashier so I would deal with transactions from the restaurant and store. I would also have to meet a sales goal every day for retail merchandise. I learned that working together as a team can help better reach sale goals. The management was very friendly and helped me better myself in my job any way they could. My co-workers were also very friendly and made some great friendships as well. The hardest part of the job was standing for very long periods of time. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and making lasting friendships.
good,I really enjoyed this job and the people I worked with and for. It's a great company to work for. Everyone from my co-workers to the management was great to work with.
good,"Team work plays a very important part in the overall performance in reaching the goals that have been set by managerment. I love this Job because I seen how the manager came together to increase the income, and how they kept the consumer happy and satifed. They also kept the communication line open with the employees in other to keep a heath work enviroment. There are many opportunity to keep growing in this company."
good,"a typical day at cracker barrel is a handful, from the most busy-est hours to the most slow ones (at least at my work area). I had learn many things. Some sort like: organization, responsibility, punctuality, handling things under pressure. Management is strict, but caring for their employees. You have your ups and downs with my experience in co-workers. some are rude and slobish, some serious and on point, some in the middle of both mention. the hardest would keep up with the up coming customers, and keeping a physic to clean dishes as fast, yet calm and focus manner possible while enforcing the cracker barrel and health rules. i wouldn't say that any job is enjoyable. but making friends in a work place is the most of it."
good,"I learned and was able to identify different mortgage and legal documents such as: a lease, deed, death certificate, and short sale."
good,"This job was everything I expected it to be. I loved the customers, I loved the managers, you could advance and move around pretty much any time you wanted, and you got regular raises. The only downside was that hours were not guaranteed."
good,Its a fun and good place to work and eat. The managers are very helpful and understanding.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Awesome place to work at. So many perks and benefits. Great training
good,"you'd have to work there for a long time to really get an idea of what the cons are. Its a great place to work, but no job is perfect of course."
good,"A work shift as a dishwasher generally doesn't exceed 5 hours and is very fast-paced and physically demanding. Managers will usually not check on dishwashers or provide encouragement and/or feedback, and when employee's leave their shift they will not check to see whether side work has been completed. Workers will usually leave the dishroom a mess when they leave and when they work, and it usually falls on me to keep the work area clean and organized, and make sure that things are done correctly. The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to test your speed and dishwashing ability against the demands of the job."
good,"Good people to work around. Wash dishes, take out trash, you don't get a free meal for lunch, but you do a employee discount. I will love to get back in the crackle barrel"
good,Great place yo work very strict policies and you have to double check order accuracy to a tee. I would suggest that if you work here you are full of energy and keep a very very positive attitude at all times and remember to breathe and smile ..if your not sure of something please ask  and just once yourself so there are no mistake on your part and love what you do period.
good,"I liked working at cracker barrel, it was almost always busy so i always had something to do. the coworkers were nice. management wasn’t horrible. you aren’t allowed smoking on the grounds or on the clock."
good,Fast paced environment but very full of learning experiences. I was responsible for cooking cleaning and being on top of the orders and the food prep .
good,I really enjoyed working for cracker barrel. I left for what I thought was a better job opportunity with higher pay rate ( which did not work out). I would love to try and get rehired at cracker barrel
good,I had looked at my schedule wrong and then whenever I looked at my schedule and Sunday to go in and see what time I was supposed to be there I noticed I worked on Saturday and I got scared and I didn't call I didn't show up I didn't do anything I was scared I thought they would be mad so now I know that that was the wrong thing to do I know it would have been a lot simpler just me calling in and saying I looked at the schedule wrong I'm sorry it won't happen again but that's the way life is a lesson learned
good,This job had a great environment.Everyone was always helpful and has nice attitudes. This was my first serving job and it was great place to learn fast pace and all server skills.
good,i liked that there were compwtition with your py you could par up within 30 days thats the biggest thing i liked. managers were laid back and i also liked the speed of the work in theor kitchen
good,It was good loved the muic and food and the guest were great. The people was great i loved the old country store i lovwd it so so much i just hated the low money and hours
good,"If you love cooking food then this the place to be. They have great manger staff, great employees just have to pace your self when working. A lot of times it gets really busy an you can’t help that ppl love to eat there a lot"
good,Working here is fun but also very serious. When the time comes you have to be able to buckle down and take a stand for the team just to make it through the day.
good,"I love Cracker Barrel, the co-worker, the Guest, the Management, etc. I like working in a face paced environment. Giving the Guest want they want is important, and seeing them smile made it even better. The management did a great job, as for the team players as well. The most enjoyable part of the job would be to have no complaints and all compliments."
good,Cracker Barrel is a great place to work. I've been working for the company for a year and I couldn't see myself working a better server job and the management is efficient.
good,"A typical day at Cracker Barrel, is always walking in, in and out of uniform, and being greeted. At your start time your section is ready to go, and people start coming in. I learned how to open up and not be so shy. I started working there in 2009 when I was 16 so I was shy and hardly spoke. Well, being a hostess really turned that I'm around, and I'm happier for it. The management team is outstanding. I am so grateful I work for such awesome people. I've had managers come and go over the years, but I have never had a bad experience. I think the hardest part of the job is when the food comes out not cooked to the guests likeness, We fix the problem but sometimes it's not good enough. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with. It is so positive and the management is outstanding with leadership."
good,"A typical day would involve greeting guest when they walk through the door, cleaning windows, cleaning the bathroom, making sure the customer is pleased, making sure the stockroom is cleaned. Working here I have learned how to carry on a conversation and how to start one, prior to working here I lacked social skills that I now have. My coworkers are great and they even give me tips on certain life skills, they're like a second family to me. The hardest part of the job would have to be keeping the guest happy and approaching them without seeming like you are pestering them to buy something. But overall I love working here."
good,"Cracker Barrel is one of the most successful restaurant chains in the country and it is rooted with down home country charm and values. I loved the culture of this job, and also the people which made it very excited to work everyday."
good,I waited tables at Cracker Barrel for 10 years. I loved this job!
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I worked there for 3 months I was hired as a cook under full-time employment and then was only given 9 hours a week I could not live on 9 hours a week it continued after I told them that they hired me as a full-time employee so I quit because I could not pay my bills or take care of myself
good,My managers were not fair they picked favorites and they didnt tell us when the schedule would change they would fire good employees for walkouts and falsely accused me.
good,I believe that This company puts a lot of responsibility on their servers as in if people don’t show up or they don’t have enough staff they put their extra weight on their current employees which messes up their business in the end I believe that the servers are overworked and under paid considering they keep the place afloat I also believe that the manager Waits last minute to fix problems
good,"Working a server was really stressful with no job security or benefits. "
good,I was mistreated by my managers and coworkers while working at Cracker Barrel. I was physically hit by a manager at one point and nothing came from it. They acted as if it wasn’t important.
good,My co-workers and I were able to get along and problem solve very well with one another. The management was very poor always seemed to be degrading employees and would not work with the employees for time off.
good,"waitressing and a typical busy day. hardest part of the job was really nothing, the most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with."
good,I had a good experience. There was a lot of favoritism which made it hard on new people that needed to make money. If they didn’t like you you got terrible shifts.
good,"It was an good job,  just dealt with retail management issues and felt it could be managed in a more understanding way with those who balance school,  life,  etc."
good,Horrible work hours. Great coworkers. You get a great discount. They give you an apron but you do have to buy your own work pants and work shirts. Uniform has to be perfect.
good,"Worked for cracker barrel for 6yrs, advanced!  It was a great pay advancement, but quality of life was mot there.  We had went through 50 plus managers.  Could,t get a good eval. On job performance because no one stuck around.  Busted my butt, ran great shifts, had great #'s.  Done my job and that of 10 people but never noticed for the hard work or hrs that i dedicated.  No chance of ever getting day shift and spending time with my children.  Loved my job, the company, the guest. But couldnt juggle home life and work.  Worked 55-70hrs. A week, never compensated or noticed for extra time spent in house."
good,"Nothing is ever under control, the stress level due to poor treatment by management runs the store down. Everything is always very hectic and no one ever gets out of work when they neee to. Very inconsistent."
good,This company has kept me coming back in between my breaks from continuing my education. I love the 471 store. I have a second family there and feel very at home in the welcoming atmosphere.
good,"I loved talking to customers, enjoyed this job very much. Wrapping gifts, helping customers find items and greeted every customer. I loved the people I worked with.  Sometimes hours were slim."
good,"Yeah it was okay. Manager was rude, no hours. When you did get hours they would still sometimes send you home early because of how slow it gets at times."
good,Management needs work but is an overall fun place to work. I learned team building skills that will carry on to my future employment opportunities. I would recommend this job to someone that lives in the area.
good,Great place to work when you are a student and it has flexilibilty in scheduling and understanding of school demands
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,It would be better but I felt like at slot of jobs not vulued an it needs to train every one in the right manner an direction it will benefit if give people a chance an be more upbeat expecially hire management an I feel most management in Branson should quit
good,"Cracker barrel was a good place to work if you are a student going to school because of the flexibility. But to make a living off of being a cook, dishwasher, or waitress is not going to happen in my opinion. Good people though"
good,"I have been in the restaurant business for 22 years, I love cooking and being in management, I take my job seriously, and follow all guidelines and safety policies"
good,A typical day at work was okay.  Co-Workers were very fun and easy to work with.  I learned how to have better one on one conversations with people with success.
good,"I love working at cracker barrel. I have learned a lot, and I enjoy interacting with the guest. I love all the regular guest that I get to see and talk to everyday."
good,"Co-workers are friendly. Most of the management team was understanding. My experience with my manager varied. Some days were good, some days were bad. She wasn't very understanding when it didn't concern her. My pros and cons are merely based on my manager."
good,Cracker Barrel was a fun place to work and I love working there.But the managment was TERRIBLE!
good,Fast pace Job but did not last long. Working making boxes and putting movies in.
good,"Roll too much silverware"
good,When i was working with this company the management at the time were great.
good,"At Cracker Barrel, I met alot of great people to work with. The management was very poor and treated their employees awful. The managers were always so rude and didn't care to call you out in front of everyone and make you feel awful about yourself. I only miss working there because of the nice customers I got to serve and the good food."
good,"New challenges each day because your clientele is different everyday. I learned how to multi-task and also how to have on the heels service, which means anticipating my customers needs before they even know they need it. "
good,I liked working here because of the chance I got to work with the public.
good,I typically work 5-10pm 2-3 times per week for my part-time job due to working at Northern Middle School 10 months out of the year. There is never any incentives for reaching daily goals. The most enjoyable part of the job is greeting the guests as they walk in and out of the retail store.
good,It’s ok for a younger population   You have “clicks” that hang together and outsiders are made to feel that way. There are some managers that need to retire
good,"it was an ok job , i enjoyed meeting  new people but there was no place for advance in the company and the pay wasnt enough for the amount of work done.  i was a night cashier and worked many nights alone and did all the training of the newhires without any compensation or recognition from the company or management."
good,"It's a fun job if want to make new friends, and or meet new people everyday! Sometimes if you're a server, you'll get ""regulars"" and that's something to look forward to! You can take your ""Par"" tests to earn little raises, or get more stars on your aprons. The management isn't very good at all, they come and go, and they don't help with bullying issues, or drugs in the workplace. They need to do drug tests on all employees, I think that would make It a safer environment to be in. I don't recommend this job if you're looking to pay the bills!"
good,would still be happily working for cracker barrel if i would have never transferred. my second location only cared about impressing higher ups then caring about their employees
good,I've worked there so long and need something new the company its self is great the management sometimes is unfair... I use to love my job now I dread it I feel the pay isn't enough what we have to put up with they can't keep nobody so we gotta work double for less pay
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,you must have patience even the most level heade person will get overwhelmed aat some point. co workers are amazing. management was weaker than what is needed in such a high pace store.
good,"Cracker Barrel is a great company to work for. It is a fun, family environment and they are flexible with hours for people who need it. It is a very fast paced restaurant with high clientele volumes at all hours of the day. The restaurant itself is very clean and the food quality is excellent."
good,"Day to day life at Cracker Barrel can be hectic and stressful, but the customers can be very pleasant and nice to work for. Working here I learned how to be kind and respectful and how to multi task because those same pleasant people can need a lot of things at once."
good,Nothing bad to say really but need to use these characters  so i can find a job and not worry about what i have to type to get past this screen...almost there
good,Easy job. Only stressful when mass groups of people come in and need large tables. Fun people to work with and good management to work with.
good,Great company to work for. Productive rate is really high and great customer quality service. Family dining. Managment needs to be improved and safety of employees needs improvment.
good,i get to work i clock in and get my first guest of the day i greet them with a warm smile and a how are you today from  there i take their order and bring them drinks then there food  comes up i take it out to them with a smile see how everything looks then get them refills and anything else i can do to make their stay comfortable.all with the help of my coworkers and managers.
good,a typical day at cracker barrel is over bearing rush hours. i learned how to cook and make homemade biscuits. management was not a strong point for this work place but when it came to working with my co workers it made coming to work fun.
good,This company has a fun environment to work. I got to meet people from all over the United States.
good,I enjoy working at Cracker Barrel.Like alot of things there is stuff that needs improvement.Staff and management being the most that needs the improvement.Also I feel like the retail store could also use more cashiers.One especially made for when the servers leave their shift.You must wait in line till all the guest have checked out which could leave a person waiting almost an hour.
good,This particular job taught me to keep up with a fast pace day. Siri will definitely keep you on your toes and teach you to think quick and rationally.
good,"They hire more people than needed instead of scheduling the help they have that are willingly to work, they should have better register procedures. The restaurant customers get mad at us and all we do is ring them up we have nothing to do with food side"
good,Turnover is very high because they do not pay enough  for a normal adult to life above poverty level. add children to your family and you will be collecting food stamps while working here.  Fun place to work but no room for advancement. They say they promote from within but they really don't that often. You will get told you have to do one more thing. Then one more thing. Then one more thing. Next thing you know years have gone buy and you are still in same position.
good,Great job to put you through school. Very fast paced! Unusual hours normally unless you work the morning shift. I would recommend this job for anyone seeking job placement!
good,I loved the fast paced and competitive atmosphere working at Cracker Barrel. They work you fairly. They give you decent pay. And they work around your schedule.
good,Not a bad place to work co workers all get along good serving gig some days I'd walk out with more than 100 bucks in tips they always have hours available
good,"Cracker Barrel is a great place to start if you want to become a server, they provide excellent training but I do recommend moving on once you are good, tips are not what they are at other places."
good,"I love working for Cracker Barrel. However, when I was asked to work on the grill line, they told me I would receive a rate increase of a dollar more per hour, in all actuality, that never happened. Our GM resigned due to her numbers and we don't really have a staff that can uphold original GM's promises in pay."
good,"communication fast pace work area its a learn fast type place "
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"It was a placeholder job for me, but it is a great place to build up work experience. I was lucky enough to have an amazing manager that I still consider a friend and was a place I built great work relationships."
good,"A typical day at work includes ensuring guest satisfaction along with replenishing the sales floor with merchandise and keeping the store tidy. At a workplace that includes the involvement of customer service, patience was learned fairly quickly. The hardest part of the job is making sure that I engage with every guest on the sales floor regardless of how busy we were while the most enjoyable part includes being able to accommodate each guest while being able to personally get to know them each time they come in to visit."
good,"It was a little stressful learning the menu and working in a tight space with about 10 different people. Its a good way to learn how to work in a team environment. And a great way to gain experience serving. If you can do it at Cracker Barrel, you can do it anywhere."
good,"I've enjoyed my time at Cracker Barrel, the management has changed several times throughout the past two years that I've been there and I still feel like something might be missing from the team. The workplace is stressful but only because I try to pick up the slack of the servers who slack off. The hardest part of the job is when you get complaints because people blame you for things that you can not control, however out of everything that I have learned, that has seemed to be the most helpful. I've learned to do whatever I can to help the people with their complaints, and I've come to understand that it's not my fault. The most enjoyable part of the job is when all the servers work together and have a great fun-filled night, as well as when you get certain customers who make your day better!"
good,Cracker Barrel is a very busy restaurant.  I enjoy being busy and working with my co-workers.  The hardest part is upselling and the most enjoyable part is I make the job fun.
good,A typical day at work was decent. I learned what being in the retail industry consisted of. The management was okay. I loved all the restaurant managers but I did not care for my direct manager. My co-workers were out of this world. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I didn't feel like a job.
good,"Sometimes slow, sometime hectic environment."
good,"I enjoy the job I've learned a lot while being here. To always keep a smile on your face no matter what, to keep the customers happy and to treat employees and customers the way you would want to be treated."
good,My review is that I enjoyed being a people person and satisfying them. That was our main to make sure our customers were happy. And being sanitary cleaning out the equipment like the eating utensils and the tables and floors.
good,Enjoyed greeting and assisting customers to ensure they feel welcome. I also enjoyed working with my team at cracker barrel retail store. Very nice work environment.
good,This job required you to be on your feet for many hours and it requires you to be fast and detail oriented. Being friendly and being able to have polite conversation is a must.
good,It was very good and the customers and workers were very nice. The only thing I did not like was the work times were not flexible. Everyone there is very nice and great first job.
good,Had fun felt safe i enjoyed my experience overall have no complaints about this job would highly recommend this job to other to friends and family one of the best interviews i had
good,Cracker Barrel was a straight job. I worked at the one on Daniels parkway. Very nice staff. Very flexible with hours. Understanding if you have emergencies
good,Employees are the driving force of the customer experience at Cracker Barrel. Head management creates a culture of hard work towards the goal of pleasing people.
good,"Working for cracker Barrell is an amazing company , they offer you cracker barrell care if you ever need to take time off work for a long amount of time"
good,"Great place to work with great management. It gets very busy so you better be good at what you do. Usually a lot of new, 1st time younger servers were hired so until they learn how to serve & do side work, you'll need to do the work of at least 3 people."
good,"Cracker Barrel is the most laid back country place to eat.  The people their are so friendly and make your dining time enjoyable. Work together, come together, to create an family environment.  Teamwork is the most important part in the kitchen or food business. Every person has their own part to do throughout the day, so when the time comes everything will be done, and perfect and in place.  Business will run smoothly."
good,I think it was fun to work here because the people that I worked with made my job fun. there was a lot of nice people and it was cool to get to work with them even day.

good,It's a job pay weekly good co workers need  better management more work then pay . New managers new ways of doing  things . Some changes are ok. Some or are not.
good,"been there 3 months now , People are freindly and the training is excellent. a job that you can go a long way .Managers are very easy to help you train and succed."
good,"Life around Cracker Barrel is strictly business. Servers are required to wait on 3 tables at a time while also making sure all food is brought out to the dining room, even at the tables that are not assigned to them. This requires fast paced working."
good,"Pleasing people"
good,This is one of my favorite places to work if you like customer service jobs this is the one for you and they have free lunch if you're looking for a job that requires that
good,I loved working there and the environment too. Although the management should be a little better but it was my best first job. It was like having a second family.
good,"I learned to greet guests, I learned how to make sales and be social. I learned to work with other people. I learned how to operate the register and do planograms. I learned a lot at Cracker Barrel, it was the best job experience ever."
good,"I taught new hire orientations, handled all paperwork. Teach employees how to be a better in customer service. Worked side by side with the general manager."
good,I absolutely loved working here because the atmosphere is so welcoming even the employees leave with a smile on their face. I am a competitive person and this job requires me to be a suggestive seller. So I am always on the hunt for a new sale I feel like this company help me with managing problems at work and help me learn marketing strategies throughout my time at this company.
good,Cracker barrel was a great place to work.  Met friendly co-workers and establish new friendships.  Very easy going managers and coworkers.  Once you got the hang of things the work was easy.
good,All the staff is accommodating and kind. I love the guidelines that they have as a way to give back to their customers. I really liked the method they use to advance in the company.

good,"Working at Cracker Barrel was simply amazing. During my walk-through I saw everybody smiling and laughing. Not just people in the front of the house, but also the ones in the back. These weren't fake, these were 100% real. I saw a family of co-workers. I knew that this is the perfect location for employment. I recommend Cracker Barrel as a primary place of employment openly."

good,Started working once i began college dishwashing wasn't the best job but i did the best at it i had fun working with employees and had a great learning experience.
good,I didn't mind working at Cracker Barrel as long as I was busy but if it was slow it wasn't worth getting paid $2.15 a hour when no one was there. Only other part I didn't like was folding 100 rolls of silverware.
good,"Every day starting at breakfast was quick and on your toes from start to finish, lunch and dinner service was the same also. you get to move up ranking by completing classes and tests, which included a pay raise."
good,I would recommend this job for someone looking to make good money especially on sundays. I enjoyed working there but I don’t like doing side work. There is a lot to do.
good,Constant interaction with people and employees offers on-hand experience for customer service. Training department was well-developed and opportunity for advancement available.
good,My manager in the retail department was awesome. Very understanding. Flexible hours. They worked with you if something came up. Very fair. Fun to work on the retail side. Enjoyed most employees.
good,"A typical day was counting your cash drawer before starting your shift, greeting the customers, answering the phones, take to go orders, and check people out."
good,"good place, but they sometimes hire too many servers.  its good for a part time job, i made around 10 bucks an hour on average.  overall it was a good job and really helped me when I was in need."
good,It Was Great Working At Cracker barrel I Really Enjoyed Myself I Enjoyed The People That I Worked With And I Made Good Money There The Job And Hours are Worth It.
good,I love working here! I learned a lot of kitchen skills. It is a very good place to start working in the kitchen. Management was wonderful. You just learn a lot there.
good,Cracker barrel is a good place to start fom with the right management team. You have to have patients to start from the bottom to the top. You have to have tuff skin and not let anyone get you out of character.
good,"Cracker Barrel provided me with proper training and leadership skills that allowed me to grow into the positive,hard working and dedicated person I am today."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Depending on the day of the week or the weather there are many guests that come to eat and to be served. Serving is a challenging job for others who can not pick up their pace when needed.
good,up until i had i got pregnant i LOVED working here everyone was like family i couldn't wait to go to work even though i was only a hostess i enjoyed helping my server friends
good,I worked there for over 13yrs. Coworkers are friendly and lots of times. Good starter job to make money and save of. Can be hard though and challenging if people don't come to work. Overall. Good people

Even with tips, you don’t make anything but maybe just enough to pay your bills. Some days you can make $150+ in tips and the others $15-25 per shift! You work way too hard here for just a couple of bucks!"
good,"Great atmosphere. Job is easy just a lot to learn. Guests are very different, must learn how to adapt easily. Bust tubs are to your disposal, dishwashers are there to help carrying them if it’s needed and/or isn’t busy."
good,"Love the atmosphere and business. Managers mostly were great but that depends on store to store. Also love the guests that regularly come in, all in all nice and sweet place. Very fast paced at times."
good,"You do your job, you get better tips. Management gets run down, but its a 7 day operation so they are just as exhausted as everyone else. Rules are a bit much..Old school is the way I would put it."
good,I really enjoyed working here I really enjoyed my job and the people I worked with was great. The only problem I had was not enough hours in a day. Pay was very low where I could not pay my rent or house bills if they give you more hours and more pay this would be a fantastic place to work.
good,Things can get stressful at any job but I believe the managers did a great job of compensating for the stress that occurred on occasion and when we set goals as a crew we were rewarded for such things.
good,Ok job if they pair you with the right training  the person  I got stuck with barely spoke English  and  only had me doing the things she didn't want to do  so my whole  training  process  sucked
good,Overall depending on location I believe CB is a great place to work. If you are willing management & the company offer many opportunities for raises and other benefits. Go for 4 stars!
good,"Working at Cracker Barrell was like working with a second family. Everyone helped each other out, if someone wasn’t able to carry all the trays to a party table someone or even maybe 2 other people would help and pass out their food. If someone’s table was dirty after customers left someone would clean the table or even help clean a party table. There was never a moment to set down especially on weekends. This job gave everyone that worked their character."
good,"Cracker barrel is a great place. Great food ,great people.we stay pretty busy most of the time. Only thing I don't work enough hours that I need. They are very helpful and friendly. We work very hard to please our guest and make sure they have everything they need."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"I would go into work, clock in then get ready to serve our guest with a smile on my face. I would try to serve guest to the best of my ability and help out my co-workers deliver food. While i worked at Cracker Barrel i learn the value of team work, because i had amazing co-workers and Managers."
good,"Mostly under staffed, but that is mostly any restaurant. Pay is pretty decent, however, I personally was employed in North Dakota, so there is definitely a big pay difference! At the end of my Cracker Barrel career I was did transfer to Flint, MI where I noticed the pay drop."
good,"Met tons of great coworkers while working at Cracker Barrel. Learned a lot about working in general. Always kept busy, 6-7 hours or over was a hard/long work day. Overall my favorite job that I’ve had."
good,"Worked here for a year and a half, some as a server and some as a host. Enjoyed a lot of it. Tips were decent and I made good money. Some customers, especially the Sunday crowd, test your patience and you have to work through people being very rude."
good,"Most of the time no breaks. Loved discount on food and retail items. Loved guests. I'm a People person. Overall, I really loved my job. I had to quit because hours were cut. I couldn't pay my bills on 8-9 hours a week."
good,This is a fun job as long as you have a good management team. The hours aren't terribly long and there is good money to be made. Also the discount you get after being their a while is worth it.
good,"A typical day at work is not really that typical. You never know what to expect. It keeps you on your toes, yet you stay busy no matter how many guests walk through that door."
good,The work day goes by fast because you're always busy and the co-workers are easy to get along with. We get paid vacations and the pay is good. A lot of the customers may be visitors because there is a hotel next to this location.
good,"I love working here the people are friendly and wonderful.  My mangement team is good, but needs a little more help.  As a server its good.  I am unsure about other postions in the resturant."
good,"As a gm you need to play to the talents you have and that are working for you and not hold people down.  Be fair.  Just because you are the GM does not mean you should work the cake shifts.  Balance it out, show your staff you care about them and they will go the extra mile for you.  Treat them like underlings and they will not respect you, they will fear you."
good,Everything was great but management. That was about it. I did not like management because one manager was terrible and she was horrible to her employees
good,"Hardest part of working here was enjoying a life outside of work. Getting holidays or weekends off is almost impossible, so going to visit family out of town, not always the easiest. Getting a Sunday morning off to go to church, yeah that's not gonna happen, because Sunday mornings are by far the busiest shift of the week. "
good,"It was a great place to work until they changed the management. some employee's do not quit the job, they quit the boss. besides that it was a fun place to work."
good,"They really care about you. The company itself is very strict, but they will do all that they can to make sure you are okay and well taken care of. If you choose them as an employer, you won't be disappointed."
good,Cracker Barrel is a very job as long they have better managers there that will treat you right but as long you do your job you wont have any problems it all about working as a team.
good,I open the retail store for business. I take care of the morning cleaning and stocking. it is overall an excellent company to work for. The only downfall is I don't get as money hours as I would like weekly.
good,i worked for this company as one of my first jobs when i was a teenager. it was a good start up job. the company worked well with me going to school and other school functions
good,"Typically I would go in and we would be in full rush.  Chaotic at best.  But, Wow!!! what a rush.  I mean things in the middle of a dinner rush always seemed to be on the edge of falling apart and every time I got there at dinner, I knew it was time to rock-n-roll and that was part of the lure of the job.  Keeping it together and cranking out the orders successfully was always the challenge and what I loved most about the job.  I learned how to hold chaos just out of reach of disaster.  Management rocked!!!  They did just what I did as a cook but on Jedi level.  Co-workers, each was his/her own unique character and added spice to the job.  Hardest part of the job was always being under-staffed.  The most enjoyable aspect was the people.  The people and how close we all got working through the chaos together on a nightly basis."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Working at cracker barrel is fun. sometimes stressful but the money is good. Older crowd usual goes there so expect some rude guests. learn how to have patients.
good,I went here while attending school and they were very accomodating to my schedule. The people that work here are phenomenal. The food is great. The customers are composed of regulars and people traveling which keeps things exciting. I enjoyed working here.
good,"A typical day at work would be filled with smiling customers, mostly regulars. I learned a lot being a cashier at Cracker Barrel. I learned how to balance work and my personal life. Management was okay. My manager was the best she made the schedules fair for everyone. My co workers were nice. Everyone pretty much got a long. We never really worked shifts together. I would say that was the hardest part of the job. Being alone for 8+ hours. My regular customers literally made my days and nights go by fast."
good,"Cracker Barrel was an awesome company with amazing benefits offered the their employees. The store is still one of the newer ones, I opened the store June 22, 2013. It was a fun, fast paced restaurant that always kept you moving. There was always something to be done. We always had ""Alley Rallies"", which was a pep-talk for the shift. I learned how to deal with costumers that have had an issue as well as the ones that want to share with your manager how amazing you were as their server. I loved the people I worked with because they made it a friendly environment where you enjoy coming to work. I looked forward to every shift, working with everyone. You got 50% off employee meals 30 mins before or after your shift, also 20% when you come in on your day off. They have a big problem with accepting that their employees have outside lives and would make you stay 1 hour 2 hour after every shift, and that was on a good day. They take advantage of their good employees and if you don't give them a reason to fire you, and they don't like you, they will cut your shifts to only maybe 5-7 hours a week till you complain and complain, they force you to quit. This place has its good and bad sides. The money for the most part is why I stayed for so long."
good,"A typical day at work is basically multi-tasking without sacrificing excellence. Urgency with a purpose was our motto and most servers followed that mission. I was responsible for speaking with customers and being knowledgeable about all aspects to help assist them in any way. I learned how to take on many tasks at once and to work with others no matter their skill level. The management team was very ""hands-off;"" They let us make mistakes so we could learn from them and if one needed help, they encouraged us all to communicate with each other to solve problems. My co-workers ranged from bad-Excellent(as most companies do). There were some who could not handle the pressures of the job and there were those who thrived. "
good,Very busy restaurant. I worked double shifts and enjoyed it. Worked most nights with just the manager and I and we ran the whole restaurant. the management was great and were team players when it got extremely busy. The co-workers were also team players. The hardest part of the job was dealing with upset or rude customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was customer satisfaction.
good,"A typical day would require you to set your tables up in your section then the customers would roll in and you would have to serve them as best you can. When you shift is over when you are cut you have to clean your tables, sweep, refill sugars and salt/pepper shakers. You would also have to do your side work which all depends on what you are assigned that day (help the morning shift that way it is cleaner in the back) and then you would have to roll as much silverware the manager on duty would tell you to do."
good,"Co- Workers were awesome a lot of team work. I learned about customer service and the way to speak and handle different situations. The hardest part of my job was carrying big trays. The most enjoyable part were the customers who came in they cared so much about you. To them you were more than a waitress. Typical day would be coming in at 5: 30 and opening the store up, getting everything set up for that morning and also started taking customers. When your shift was over you cleaned what you are assigned and your day is done."
good,Working at Cracker Barrel and helping the guest is awesome. To know that you helped them pick out a gift for a family member or friend it makes your whole shift.
good,Cracker Barrel is very family oriented.There seems to be favoritism but I understand that is most places you work. You will do fine as long as you make it all about the guest and make sure they are happy
good,"Had fun meeting new people. learned new skills and had fun."
good,"enjoy meeting new people daily "
good,Management and employees are fun to be around but its not enough hours.
good,"I enjoyed working here. It taught me many things, The management wasn't ideal but it was ok."
good,really great co-workers and management is always helping people out and not sitting on there buts
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel was fun the food was great my co-workers were friendly. Everyone respected each other and got alone well at work most days.Hours were great weekly pay.Same customers nice and sweet people to get alone with.Got alone with managers, was a very hard working host."
good,Is it a fun in Teamwork and work environment...it  Can be a full time job if you are allowed to have the hours. Great things go on at Cracker Barrel....
good,"Great atmosphere, and great place to work. Flexible schedule to help with all that life might throw at you and when the unexpected happens. Also, the money is good."
good,If you stay you're valued and can gain a lot of regulars who you love taking care of. Very family like. Love the Christmas parties; and when needed the managers do their very best to make sure you're happy.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I worked in gift shop. It was fun and customers were friendly and in a good mood (unlike working at a mall). Overall it was a good place to work. Many customer were celebrating life events so they were in a good mood. I liked seeing all the new merchandise come in.
good,"As with any job there's always people who don't agree with you, but my managers always fix the problems, I've learned a lot about myself and our guests working here"
good,The different customers to loyal customers is what makes cracker barrel a place to be. The relationships you make with co workers and the customers make coming to work worth while and enjoyable everyday.
good,Overall cracker barrel is very family oriented and understands the values of the employees they strive to take care of their own and guests as well. Cracker barrel is one of the best places that I have had the pleasure of working at.
good,"I have been at Cracker Barrel for 11 years.  I have raised my two boys as a single mom there.  They work with my schedule and it has been great."
good,It’s a good place to work. They pay as good or better than anyone in the restaurant industry. The management was great at first until a new general manger was hired and she let it go to her head. The other managers were amazing people to work for. Overall it’s a good job.
good,It's a good company to work for. They are good to their employees and it's a good work environment. They have a good training program and make sure your prepared for the job.
good,Working here was the best experience because it helped me strengthen my customer service. While working here also showed me how to work as a teammate. I greatly appreciate this experience I learned that my manager seen alot more in me that I never noticed.
good,"The managers are very nice and helpful. The environment is amazing and I love working here. There is not a day that goes by that I don’t love being there, it has great work vibes."
good,My overall experience was great. There was always friendly people and a good working environment. The managers were kind and always tried to help you grow. They were friendly to the customers and workers.  My co-workers were also very collaborative and treated each other with respect. I learned a lot from the people there and the experiences I had. I have enjoyed my days there and talking to everyone I met daily. The hardest part of my job was the busy hours. Everything was a bit rushed and it could get difficult to please everyone but I always got the job done best I could.
good,Love greeting guests and providing a good experience for them. Enjoy helping guests by handing out baskets and helping them make purchases for others or for themselves.
good,I will remember them for the good times and good people I met along the way I also got a few more tips on how to become a better cook and how to keep personal life separate from work
good,a typical day at work is me seating the guest that arrive in a timely manor. the management is pretty cool they help out a lot. they normally forget when someone ask them for time off or need me hours. i have asked all managers for more hours and i have yet to get any. the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and chatting with the guest.
good,"Friendly co workers and regular customers that keep you coming back to work everyday. The peak times and every weekend was busy, and very fast paced. Overall, a great company to work for,"
good,I like working there the managers are nice and accommodating the people you work with sometimes can be stressful. managers go in and out of the store as far as leaving and moving somewhere else.
good,"A typical day at work was clocking in going over sales, and seeing my position for the day. I learned how to work with a team and share responsibility"
good,great to work if your a teenager or young adult trying to learn dciplin as for living wise i would not recommend it pay is bad but the people are good
good,"The coworkers are great however at times, it feels like noone works as a team and always leaves more work for the next shift. But other than that, its a great place to work at for a first job."
good,This job has good benefits when you stay with the company for a long time. You will make excellent money working at this job you can connect with you coworkers and it is a great work environment but it is very very fast paced.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,They were really to the point which is a good thing (for me anyways). I loved the job and everything about it. However due to my personal life falling apart I wasn't able to keep the job. I highly recommend working here.
good,It was good to work here. Teamwork is big and communication is big and our guest and employees are put above everything! They love to promote from within.
good,"Management has gotten pretty bad, but the staff is great to work with. Incredibly fun! "
good,the atmosphere of this place is wonderful and the training I received could last me a lifetime. The reason I left was because the store I worked at hired a new general manager. I could not stand her and she refused to work with my schedule
good,I love all the managers that I work for at Cracker Barrel. I enjoy my job and the quest that I greet! The people I work with feel like my family. It is a good place to work.
good,"I would have stayed in a heart beat if the money would have been better. I made some really great friends, I quit almost 6 months ago and me and some of the people still talk."
good,"Great job you get to meet different people from around the world along side experiencing different entertaining products/toys, housewares etc great scented candles selections and lotions"
good,"Productive retail store, daily responsibilities, equal opportunity employer, fun place to work,  working with guests with their needs and wants in the store, working with all the staff as a family. We call it team work, enjoy helping the guests to find the products they are looking for. I un-pack the truck delivery and get to see the new items before anyone else"
good,it a good place to eat but not good place to work.. you're standing all day without a break.. you do get a discount on products you buy from them after its not bad for a first job
good,It's was a good place to work. But needed more hours to feed famliy. Great food and nice people great old fashion place to shop Grubb n rock  great place
good,"the managers were always very helpful its just a slow place to work and there wasn't many hours available, the other servers there tend to be very jealous and very dramatic"
good,"I love working for this company but sometimes it can be overwhelming. I'm constantly on my feet and lifting things, but overall a good job. A typical day at work for me is working 8-12 hours and providing quality service to my customers. I've learned how to cope with a wide variety of people and situations, and what to do in an emergency situation, such as when a customer chokes on food. The management isn't very steady, we constantly cycle between managers, which can be overwhelming to the company. The hardest part about this job is carrying a tray for 8-12 hours in one hand. I recently had wrist surgery and I was unable to serve for months because of it, so sometimes serving can be a setback. The most enjoyable part about the job is interacting with people of all cultures and then as usual, going home with hardworked money."
good,Never short on guests or things to Do. Management could be more effective if they listened but there are few things to be truly upset about. Retail side is a great work environment. Best job I've ever had.
good,"Very nice job, everyday money and helps with speaking and presentation skills.At times it can be busy and hard but if everyone works together it can make the job so much easier."
good,Great place to learn responsibility and was learned to work with others the hardest part of the job was having to do everything in the kitchen independently
good,Cracker barrel takes care of their employees.  It is a great company from a business point of view.  I wrote all of my business papers in college on them.  They are very hard to beat in their industry.
good,"I worked as a backup cook, I enjoyed the work and the people I worked with. It was a nice place to work for, the management is very understanding. I would of stayed longer if I wouldn't of had to get my surgery."
good,"Productive and a fun workplace with a continuing educational program, enjoy being able to receive my discount on food and retail, and enjoy working with the public."
good,working at cracker barrel is a home environment. everyone is like family. management is nice and straight forward. this a good place to work. there are plenty of tasks for the five hours you work if you are under 18 but its fast past. management just doesn't give enough hours.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Fun place to work. "
good,"Working for Cracker Barrel was almost like going to visit relatives out of town. The atmosphere is very friendly as they pride themselves on 'pleasing People'. Cracker Barrel makes sure to deliver excellence within the community each time a guest walks through their doors. I personally worked in the gift shop and must say I was excited everyday to what new toys and clothes we were going to have on display that week. Cracker Barrel is a home away from home, surrounded with smiling faces and tasty old fashion style food. Weekends and lunch rushes is when it got very fast paced, but on average the pace is moderate speed. Since the gift shop is big with a huge selection of products it can take more than a month of working here to learn where things are located. I think honestly one of the most enjoyable things about cracker barrel was its customer base. Cracker Barrel has been around for many years and delivers the same quality of service at each and every store. Since they pride themselves on consistency of quality their customers keep coming back. Great place to work, I definitely was cared about by my managers who were nice enough to provide me gifts from the gift shop after I delivered my son"
good,"A typical day, i would prepare food which consisted of weighing bagging food, cutting food with commercial cutting machines, and preparing salads for guests. I learned many things here, it is an entry position job so it wasn't too bad. It was a great place to improve my understanding of the restaurant business and how it worked from the kitchen. When we had the right team members on the clock we could get up to maximum efficiency and we worked like a well oiled machine.The store manager was great and, really dedicated to the job. He put in many hours and would run around like a maniac to assure everything was going smoothly."
good,"Fast pace job in a fun environment. I'm a fast learner, therefore I became a trainer and shift leader. With being a fast learner I learned the importance of stepping up into management role when needed. The hardest part of the job was trying to accommodate guest with product we didn't have and yet getting the support needed from management. The most enjoyable part was interacting with different people daily."
good,"The ""Current job"" rating is this job. I guess I missed something. This is w hat happens when your new to a web site you think you know what your doing and boom :)"
good,"Excellent training programs for hourly as well as mgt staff. Full benefits package for mgt personal. Promotional advancement available if interested. Excellent salary for mgt staff "
good,"Pays the bills, the people are great, but sometimes, its hard to feel appreciated. This company has been an asset to my life, however, when you no longer benefit them, the feeling goes away."
good,"each I am given a list of task to complete. With help from my team members and management team we successfully complete them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           "
good,Cracker Barrel is a perfect start for anyone that will be working with the public. Cracker Barrel has great benefits and advancement  within the company.
good,Was a temporary job for the summer. Loved the mangers am other employees got along with everyone there and made pretty good money I was a server the entire time.
good,"short nights,not enough hours. the benefits were not affordable compared to the hourly pay. I still enjoyed the job.the job was in noway hard. worked with some really good people."
good,I enjoyed my job at Cracker Barrel very much. Everyone was like a big family. I loved interacting with all types of people that came into the restaurant. I love the fast pace work environment and working together as a team to help my co workers out with their section and vice versa. I love the fact that we had regulars come in. It gave you something to look forward to each week.
good,Great Company. Love the management team and all of my coworkers. I have learned so much through this job. Works extremely well with schedule.
good,"Learned computer system, great training team, great co-workers. Flexible hours. "
good,"I enjoy this job, I just need more hours. There is a great group of people that work there. I like the fact that I am able to help others while I am working in the serving position."
good,a typical day is making sure you dont have gum in your mouth or have anything to drink behind the counter or your in big trouble. hardest thing about this job is when your not busy but you cant walk around you have to stay in one spot.
good,"You work with fun people and great management. I learned multiple people skills, learned how to be a better cashier with the training that I received."
good,"Very structured, sometimes a little to much, but I thoroughly enjoyed working there for 9 years. Management was supportive, and I loved all my co-workers."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Very diverse in hiring employees. A lot of turnovers in management and employees. Limitations on having employees becoming full-time, seems to have good benefits. Feel that they do not compensate their employees. Usually have an end of the year company party (during the Christmas holiday) but did away with that this year and other than  myself, some other employees felt unappreciated for the hard work done throughout the year. The most enjoyable part of my job, is working with my co-workers and having fun and laughing (at least that is what i put out)."
good,"Typical day at the Cracker Barrel starts out with having a positive attitude the moment you walk through the doors. If you come to work feeling negative then I believe it will be a hard day. You have to think positive no matter what. People will be people, sometimes the nicest and then sometimes the most challenging guests walk through our doors. Our job is to make sure that guest has the greatest experience possible from the moment the host seats them to the moment they pay the cashier."
good,I loved working for Cracker Barrel. It was a great work place and a great restaurant! I loved the food and especially the breakfast. I loved how all the customers were just happy to be there and it made me proud to work there. I loved the atmosphere of the older country style type of store. The items in the shop were fun and exciting. It was easy to get people to buy some of the novelty items. There was a lot of teamwork and good co-workers. The register was fun and I loved helping the customers and hearing what they had to say about their experience.
good,"My co workers are like family, we support each other. We share our good times and our bad times and vent about difficult guests we may have had."
good,Seat guest as they come in. Arrange tables for large parties and introduce our features and items on the menu to the guests.
good,"Waitress, fun relaxing place to eat. Trained New employees."
good,It had poor management close the end of my days there. i would open and close dish most days.
good,"clean, great performance, always was ready to work with great fun people"
good,"My day consisted of ford preparing, order taking, customer service skills, cleaning. I learned to take excellent care of my customers. The management was great. My co-workers were extremely nice. The hardest part of my job was when food was not up to my customers satisfaction. The server takes the heat. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people traveling from all over."
good,Enjoy meeting new people and getting to know repeat customers.  You get involved in their lives and what's going on with them.
good,i learned how to work a cash register and how to stock shelves. My coworkers were real nice and friendly. I liked my managers they helped me out when i needed it. the hardest part of the job was having a lot of people checking out and only two people working up front.What i enjoyed the most about this job was how every one was so nice and you got to have a little fun time on slow days.
good,work together to get the custumer waited on and happy must have a smile on the face for a great custumer and keep the experience a good one
good,servicing customers
good,"The Company as a whole, Country Fresh, Good Food Fast, Great family values, I love it!!"
good,"Cracker Barrel Old Country Store foster a comfortable and friendly working environment. The main focus/goal of this company is ""Pleasing People"". The goal is to be consistently pleasing to patrons and make sure that they receive the same experience at each and every Cracker Barrel location."
good,a typical day at cracker barrel would be interacting with empoyee's to motivate them to exceed sales goals and have fun with the guests while doing that.
good,"I recently reapplied to Cracker Barrel and was totaly rehireable and needed the job to continue my education. I was told by current management I had the job but was always given the run around for 3 weeks with false excuses. I was a 4 star in all areas which is as far as anyone can go with the company.I at the time, of my employment , was going to get married and did not want to continue into mangement due to relocation."
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel was one of the best restuarants to work for. Pay increases were steady. Overtime was available during season. It was a lot of hard work, but closing at 10 was a bonus. No alcohol was sold, so it made the checks smaller for those who worked as a server. Management always came out to help when you get overwhelmed"
good,My coworkers were amazing. The team playing between everyone helped everything run smoothly. I liked that we rolled silverware before our shiftand side work was relatively easy.
good,When I was a cashier at Cracker Barrel I truly did enjoy my time working there. The work environment is always super friendly as well as the vibe of the company in whole  I loved working there.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,The people you work with are helpful and the customers are great the pay is good but the hours are limited all in all it’s a place that will help with bills
good,"While the hours can be long if the mgmt. staff develops the staff and keeps a full staff the shifts can be very smooth.

good,There are many systems in place to help the employee achieve their individual goals and goals as a team. The hours are too long and the time around the Holidays is dedicated to the store without thinking of the employees.
good,"I was shiftlead.  I made good money, but there were no benefits available to me.  I found myself responsible for to go orders, checking sidework, bussing tables and hostessing.  This can stretch a person too thin to deliver awesome service.  The cooks were excellent.  There was a constant war between day and night shift."

good,"I felt like Cracker Barrel did an excellent job training and offered continuing assistance. Most things were reasonably Fair considering the restaurant environment. Side work was expected to be done by the end of the shift, which made it difficult to meet that expectation while still giving excellent levels of service to the customers. I think that's pretty typical in most restaurant environments."

Every job has its good and bad moments, but CB makes its worth getting through.

good,easy to learn positions but hard to advance to other positions. Great management team.  Fast paced never really down time during shifts to relax.  Work hard or dont work
good,There is finally a manager there who does not play favoritism and runs the store efficiently. In six years this is the third general manager. I have learned a lot about the company itself and believe in its concept. The hardest part of the job is making sure the young people do not just stand around but do their part as well. The best part of the job are the guest.

good,"A typical day at work would have been helping guest pick out something at the gift shop and gift wrapping it for them; or checking them out at the cash register. I learned how to communicate with others, be a team member and good sales techniques. The management was really great, they would work with you when it came to your schedule, and they were really good to me when my dad passed away. The hardest part of the job was when they closed our store without any notice, relocating to a new store was hard on a lot of us but they took good care of us and made sure we were well taken care of. Some people I worked with even came to his memorial. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping guest pick out gifts for their friends and family and taking the stress off of them by wrapping it."
good,"Good place to work, and learn skills, quick working environment, team work. Benefits are offered, Time off. Work with great people, flexible schedule."
good,"Act as an intermediary between the kitchen and restaurant staff"
good,Cracker Barrel was my first serving job. It was very intimidating at first because I had no acknowledgment about food service. Their system taught me everything I needed to know about serving tables and made it very easy for me to adjust and get use to doing. As my first serving job I fairly enjoyed working for this company. Management was great. They were always very helpful and awesome leaders. The hardest part of my job was getting know everything about a restaurant and duties of a server. There were a lot of servers and I got along with everyone. The most enjoyable thing about working for Cracker Barrel is the atmosphere and simply working.
good,"Friendly Family environment, with plenty of work to keep you busy. My coworkers are wonderful to work with. The part I like the most is interacting with the costumers. I have learned how to manage multiple task better."
good,"With a restaurant job you should be sure to expect some very rude and demanding guests but the was Cracker Barrel handles it seams to be quite good and I only have 2 complaints about my time there. Overall I do think the experience working there is nice, and there are plenty of good people I have met while I was there but I have been a host here for nearly 2 years and I have been asking to be trained as a server for a year and because I was so proficient at my job they were reluctant to have me change. They are doing some training for my transfer now that we have taken on a lot of new hosts. Also, for a while there Cracker Barrel was low on hosts ans scheduled me a ton of hours. I was basically working full time while in school, which is fine for the first few weeks of the semester, but this was when I was approaching finals and this job did interfere with my ability to do my coarse work on time and well because I would come home so socially and physically tired I wouldn't feel very motivated to do much of anything, especially the 3 hours of accounting homework that I had due every other day. I had to cut down my availability drastically after that semester to be sure I wouldn't be put back in that situation again, though they still scheduled me sometimes outside of those availability times every once in a while. I just knew that it was probably going to work out like that. Now the was I described it may seem bitter to anyone reading, but I hope that it is understood that I still think it is a decent job. I love my coworkers and if out of 2 years of working there, I only have"
good,A typical day at work is 100 miles per hour from the moment I walk in the door till when I leave. I am being pulled in 100 different directions and by 100 people. I believe I have learned how to multi task and follow thorough with completing tasks. I have a fantastic relationship with my managment and we work together as a team. The hardest part of my job is 14 hour days and being over utulized in skill areas to perform the job of hourly employees. The most enjoyable part of my job is building relatinships and getting to know such a diverse group of people.
good,I really liked working at Cracker Barrel but it was really far for me to drive there and back and only making so much money and working so little hours I only made gas money to get there and back.
good,Working at Cracker Barrel was great they have a great home-like feel and everyone works as a team. Are guests are great and love our food. The hardest part of the job was the constant moving although it was a great work out.
good,Co workers are great always willing to help others getting to know some of the guest that come to see you and talk to you. The hardest part of this job is that you have to deal with some of the guest that are angry or not happy.
good,as long as you do your job everything goes well. since i work alone i dont know many of my co-workers. hardest part of my job is maintaning time mangament
good,It was a good team to work with management is amazing but not enough hours for hostess. health care not available til working their a year.
good,"its an easy first job, good for teens, nice customers, great food, pay is at a minimum, but overall its just ok"

good,I loved all the people that i worked with and the managers were great. Wish they would have had more consistent schedule cause then i probably would have never left.
good,"As my first job ever, I was hired as a seasonal position to pick up the slack for the holidays. The hours were extremely scarce, however my tasks for very time consuming. I had to work extremely fast and get a number time consuming tasks in about 2-3 hours. I literally worked 2-3 a hours week for 6 months. I was asked to stay on all year round, but I was ultimately fed up with the scarceness of hours and turned them down."
good,Working at Cracker Barrel was a good job I loved to make sure that the customers needs were meet to the best of my ability.

good,"A busy, bustling,  constant movement and activity filled my days at CB. I learned How to host, serve the public, cooking, washing dishes, and Prep. Management @ CB can be very competitive when it comes to times, temps, and sales of other stores. The hardest part of working @ CB was Showing up. The job itself was easy."
good,Working with people you enjoy being around makes your job easier.. Love taking care of the customers and meeting new people
good,A typical day at work as a server is filled with being very friendly to your customers. We take care of all the guests needs while they are in the restaurant.
good,"Go into work, count money for shift, read any messages, notes from management, any special sales. Co-workers were nice and fun people. There really was no hard part of the job. It was fun, busy, customers were great and the day went by fast."
good,My co-workers and our jokes is what I miss the most about working at Cracker Barrel. I had a great year and half there and miss it. I had to leave because of money issues but I would go back here. Management could be unfair at times but thats normal with the Restaurant business.
good,"-Work went fat as long as you were finding something to do. Trips were sometimes good most of the time okay. It was just the area I liked in because I was giving exceptional service"
good,Enjoyable place to work always busy taking care of guest. We were always trying to tell the guest about our products in the retail store which was an asset it would help you learn about the product. I enjoyed the discount we would get as a worker
good,"I loved going to work i loved the employees i worked and the management team was amazing. "
good,"I was a server and basically I worked hard to make every customer happy as well as please my managers. From rolling silverware to keeping drinks full, teamwork was the effort. I always made sure to have hot food served to each table and check back to be sure it was up to par. I closed many nights that I worked and was always in a fast pace environment. The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting the customers. I had a few regulars who loved to come in just to have me serve them. The hardest part was making time for a break to eat. It was always busy and hard for the managers to squeeze in breaks. I learned that great benefits are the result of working hard."
good,I waited tables. Co-workers and Mangament were very nice and made working for them enjoyable.
good,I liked this job. The food was good and the employees know how to work together because they were trained on a system the had teamwork from the time you walked in the door until it was time to go home. Easy balance between work and home when everyone worked together.

good,working part time job as a hostess cashier and SALES associate. I love the family environment and has a amazing training par experience levels in your career you can move up levels on star par on your uniform aprons.
good,"it’s not bad, sometimes it’s boring though. great people and i love the managers. it’s mostly old people that come in. sometimes you will have to clean off tables and you don’t make tips."
good,"Great place to work, if you want a lot of hours. They expect the managers to work 60 hour work weeks and still be happy. Work life balance is not important."
good,My job was to greet the guest when they Came in ask for there drink and food orders and the the get everything they needed before the meal came out so they can enjoy the meal right away with out it getting cold
good,It is a fun place to work. The only bad thing is that when business is slow the hours are not that good and the management is still kinda new and learning with the workers.
good,"The work environment was fast pace and stressful, the coworkers were extremely helpful and easy to work with on the job, and last but not least the pay was alright."

good,Cracker Barrel is very considerate of students and the busy lives that they may have. There were days when I came in late because of school activities and management was very understanding. As well as days when it was necessary to call off because of the work load. As long as you provide a considerate amount of time for the managers to cover your shift they are very lenient.
good,Its a great job the people i work with are great! I just am about to finish school and its is time for a change. i've worked there for 5 years now and i advanced further in the companies career. but its just not what i'm looking for.

good,Great people to work with and great management very good work environment everyone is friendly and works really hard the training is really good they make sure you know what your doing before letting you work and answer all questions
good,"As a hostess you meet amazing people, and you learn many things. Some of my managers were amazing while some were barely attentive to their employees. The only thing that was annoying were the waitresses/waiters who would complain about not getting enough tables but when they did would complain they have too much."
good,"I enjoyed working at Cracker Barrel. Even though I was a hostess, I helped servers and treated the guests to keep the flow of the dinning room steady."
good,A typical day in the dishroom sometimes you have your good days and your bad but you don't let that interfere with your work. I learned that some people you work with don't like that do their work so you have to step up yourself and do it. The work place is a good environment to work. To me personally the hardest part of the job was working with people that didn't like to work at all. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new pwople and getting to know them.
good,I love working at craxker barrel. Everybody is always very nice and helpful with any questions you have. Job training is thorough and I feel very confident with my current server skills.

good,It depends on the day and time you work. Sunday mornings are very busy and extremely fast paced for servers and cooks. Compared to that every other day seems easy and slow paced.
good,I really enjoyed working at Cracker Barrel. But I would like to do more than just be a server. I went above and beyond everyday and I deserved some come of incentive.
good,"There is a high turnover rate in employees,"
good,"I learned so much working for Cracker Barrel.  I am a penny pincher by nature, but they showed me how to pinch more.  I would never have left, but the job interfered with my personal life."

good,"Some days are busier than others, as with any restaurant.  I didn't really learn too much new information because I have worked in other restaurants.  Pretty much all of the managers are awesome.  The uniform is a bit strict.  The hardest part of the job is picking up the slack for those who choose not to show up for work.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people I work with."
good,Great working environment. I’m glad i decided to put in an application at Cracker Barrel. You can get great experience working here. It teaches you things and builds character.
good,"Always busy, many old folk, great food and friendly management. I learned how to coach others. Management is friendly. Working in a old country restaurant.

good,It a good place to work if all you need is part time. They are flexible hours and if you have another job they are good about working around it and or school.
good,"fun place to work. very fast paced environment. Have to work long hours to make any money, due to lack of alcoholic beverages and appetizers to boost your sales"
good,"work load is not to excessive. management is organized. pay is descent and you receive a .25 cent pay raise which adds up if you stay there long enough. I personally had an awesome manager in the las cruces, New Mexico store."

good,I worked in the retail store. I learned to be customer oriented and to be friendly and conscientious.  The management was fair and a good place to work.

good,Relaxed nice place to work you can trust and open up to coworkers and managers. More of a teamwork setting all duties are evenly distributed. Everyone works together to make sure the customer leaves happy. I learned to always put customers before even your employees. Example is if the customer needs a napkin while your getting the napkins and an employee asks for your help with something you take the napkins first then return to help your fellow employee.
good,"wonderful environment and work place"
good,"Cracker Barrel is very good as a restaurant. It is very fast paced, you have to do everything in a timely manner. It can be very stressful even for the staff that has been doing it for a long time. As a server there you have to, try to get order and drink as soon as the guest sit down, get drinks out in 30 seconds or less, deliver food as soon as it comes up, take to go orders on phone/ in store, pack up to go orders take to the guest when they arrive and help your team mates out plus clean/sidework."

From the friendly hosts that are there to greet guests with a smile every time.  To the quick and diligent servers, and the folks in retail.  Everyone works together to make sure the guests are comfortable and satisfied when they leave.  In the hosts position its their job to make sure the guests feel welcome, are seated as quickly as possible, and are happy with the service.  The managers are always moving from the kitchen to the dining room to the store, making sure all the employees are pleasant and the guests are pleased.  The country theme definitely attracts people from all lifestyles, languages, and customs.  The food, music, decorations, and even the people demonstrate the best of American society."
good,"Cracker Barrel is a great company to work for. I really enjoyed working there although it was very busy and stressful at times. Team work was very important and everyone seemed to come together and help each other out for the most part.

good,Great place to work but some management personnel don't care about their employees.  Was accused of taking tips off other tables just because I was new.

It's VERY fast paced and fun, I love everything about it, wish when I come in some of my team mates SPEAK !

good,"I really enjoyed working here. The atmosphere was great and family oriented. I was a server but also a jack of all trades, on any given day I may grill cook for a couple of hours, then I would start serving and help with maintenance and backup. Management was wonderful, although a little harsh, though I do feel it is for the best. My co-workers may be wonderful at sometimes and a little rude at other times due to the fact that they changed servers so often. The hardest part of the job was dealing with very rude customers, though I was quite efficient at it. The most enjoyable part of this job was the guest interaction and the management."
good,"Would come in and go straight to work on the floor.  Checking displays, greeting customers as they walked in the door, providing assistance as needed.  The ladies who worked there made it look so easy.  I  learned that there were schematics for the displays of products, so restocking was a little more difficult than I had realized.  Supportive Management."
good,"A typical day of work would be to go in and then clock in. And then I went straight to the window to see what food was up in the window. And then when I got tables I would go check to see if anyone was satted,and if they were then I would go up and greet them. I would say my name and say would you like to start off with your drinks and they tell me what they would like to eat and drink. So then I put it in on the micro right away so that they could get their food fast. And then when the food was done cooking I took the food out to them,and I made sure everything was correct on their tray. And when I was about to get off I had to clean my tables and also do my sidework."

good,"I have currently been a server for over 10 years and this was the first job that I had that was corporate and it took some getting used to. I was not used to having everything measured and timed working in mom and pop shops previously but was eager to learn, and as time went on I learned to grow with the company and staff."
good,"Cracker Barrel is an amazing company to work for to all those interested in working in the service industry. The management, work flow, and benefits are amazing."
good,"A typical day at work at this job was beginning your shift greeting customers that were shopping, asking if they needed help or straightening items up from a rush earlier during the day. I learned many things about how to place things according to a schematic, different items that we sold in the store that were things people loved from years ago. My co-workers were friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job as is any position involving customers was finding a way to satisfy unhappy customers. The most enjoyable part was getting to meet people from so many different areas, learning a lot about items that were sold in the store,  putting together displays and helping customers find the perfect gift for a friend."

Even with opposing shareholders, CBOCS has been able to move the company forward financially, while keeping a ""pleasing people"" mentality.  There is no doubt that this company will succeed with their simple definition of true hospitality.  As they approach the thousand unit mark, the only question will be... Where to buy the property.  Success is inevitable for those who prove they need it, otherwise, wanting is only wishing!"

Management was great, very fair and helping. My co-workers where fun and helping. The hardest part of my job was unloading the big truck full of the merchandise, it would be very hard at times. The most enjoyable part was getting to see the new merchandise first hand, meeting new people and customers, and helping customers and co-workers with anything they needed."
good,"a typical day at work starts with getting everything set up for all of our rush hour times. at cracker barrel you truly learn the absolute value of teamwork. our management team are in all areaas of the storea at all times to make sure every part of the engine is running smooth so that there is no reasin as to why a customer is unsatisfied. co- workers are graded on a par level scale, so there are some workers that are stronger than others.  the par level goes form 1-4 i am currently a par 4 in one area and a par 2 tranfering into 3 in another. the hardest part is we run out of something then we have to quickly recover as fast as possible to make up for our mistakes."

good,"The employees were great to work with, almost like a second family, with everyone getting along. Most of management staff very caring, but then they were let go when they showed that they cared.

good,"I roll flatware. Sometimes I bring ice tea spoons up to the galley where servers have easy access to them, as well as soup spoons. Also have loaded ice when I saw that it was depleted. The most enjoyable part of my job is carrying out the flat where I get to see all the customers. The hardest part is standing in one spot. So my solution to that is wearing support hose and bringing two small bath rugs to stand on. All the co-workers are nice and some are nicer than others.

I loved everything about the job and wish I did not have to relocate."
good,"A typical day normally began with clocking in, locating my station, finding out if I was to train a new employee that night or not.

good,My days went by quickly because there was a good flow of traffic throughout the restaurant and when there wasn’t anyone seated in my section I had plenty to do in the kitchen. I enjoyed this because it made the day go by faster and I was never bored.
good,Love working here. I work with retail side and love it. I really think this is the job where to more you put into it the more you get out of it.

good,A typical day at Cracker Barrel hosting I would come in make sure I had silverware and menus to be able to hand out make kids menus if there weren't any made. Make sure there was ice in the cooler and always be sure to greet the guests and give them friendly service. I really learned how to multitask between seating someone and going back into the kitchen to let a server know they were seated to grabbing more silverware if needed and collect menus to helping out in the gift shop by stocking or helping customers. Management was great Bill was always fair and made sure everyone was taken care of not just customers but employees as well. It's a comforting family setting. The hardest part of the job was keeping people pleased while waiting for tables during busy hours and tables were full. The most enjoyable part of the job was pleasing people weather it was seating someone at the table with the server they liked best or seating them in a different table they wanted but still having their favorite server to helping wrap a thoughtful gift for a loved one in the gift department.
good,Love You Cracker Barrel. Our locals are the best people. I wish there was more push from managers to advance and to give raises. People would stay if we had hope.

good,Cracker Barrel was my first job ever. Before I wasn’t a people’s person at all but being a server for the time I was there it has made me more of a people’s persons than I was before and I’m very thankful for that.
good,"The only problem with that place. you don't really have a chance to advance if you are not a native American. I can't answer why. I don't know. I am talking not on the behalf of the other stores, but about the one I was working for. The wage doesn't  increase accordingly to the cost of life. Good place to work for but there are things to fix."

good,"Good company to work for, but every big company has a few managers that don't do what they need to do unless their bosses tell them to. Good food and the kitchen and serving staff are awesome."
good,"I loved working at cracker barrel not only because I got paid well, but because at my first location everyone was so kind and cooperative, and I also met people from all across the world. It could get very stressful serving here because of how busy it would get but it was always worth it. After I switched locations, the employees and management team became very rude and unfair. I know that things are different at different locations but that's no excuse for the unkindliness that I received."
good,We we're in general pretty steady. Loved the customers and the other staff. Management were very caring to staff. When one employee is lagging behind the others step up to help if needed.

good,"Enjoyed working here a great deal, fun people great atmosphere and great food. Loved the old fashion look of the place and their gift shop was  absolutely wonderful with always changing themes."
good,"It was usually busy, and I made really good tips. I averaged about $800 the week of Thanksgiving, which is the busiest time but usually, I would make around $500 or so on a 35 hour work week."
good,I absolutely loved the team environment. Everyone on the night shift always worked together in an effort to have a smooth shift. I was a Red Apron and was given many opportunities to advance my leadership skills for which I am grateful. I had to move to a different state and there aren't any Cracker Barrels here yet otherwise I would have transferred. In this job the company provides you with all of the tools you need to become a successful server.

good,"Good job to work for if you are willing to work hard and play as a part in a great team. Like most places you have to be willing to always be working, it’s money based on your attitude and how hard you are gonna work each and everyday."
good,"Regular guests that come in and love the food and company as much as I do, make the job that more enjoyable.  I love the quality of food, the teamwork from employees."
good,"If you are hired into the crew, you are essentially part of the ever-growing family. Management has an open-door policy; if there are any issues regarding work or life, they will sit down and listen. The workplace culture is enjoyable. Everyone focuses on the job at hand, helping each other out whenever needed. The hardest part of the job is also the most enjoyable part of the job: the guests. You may get guests who have had a bad day, making providing a pleasurable experience difficult, while on the opposite side of the spectrum, you have guests who are there to enjoy the experience."
good,"The managers are extremely friendly. It feels like one large family. Hiring was extremely quick and effortless. Swapping positions in the store is very straightforward, such as moving to the kitchen."
good,It is like most chain restaurants. There is a lot to say about a company that makes it easy for you to transfer to another location rather than have to find a new job. There was also the chance to learn a new position as long as you met the requirements.

good,"• Take guests orders"
good,"For the 9 months I've worked for Cracker Barrel I can say that it's a great place to work. When backed up and not enough dishwashers are scheduled, managers find time to go in and help out anyway they can. The restaurant and the employees treat everyone like family."
good,I love my job there.The managers are great and will work with you to ensure you are successful in your role.Our managers are very understanding and will help you with anything they can to help you out
good,This is a great place to work. Reason I left was I was not getting enough hours. Plus the customer flow was slowing down. Which as a server made it cut into my income.

good,Good people and great opportunity sometimes it gets a little tough. The managers are always willing to help when u can’t figure things out and are always willing to work with scheduling
good,I was given specific directions on what to do and how to do each task. Schedules were fairly flexible and hours were never a problem. Boring work time and little breaks

Working here will teach you the basic skills that you will need whenever you decide to move on. You learn how to multi task and handle the ever increasing demands of the customers. You learn the order and management of you time and what it takes to get things done. With time you move to higher standings and are put in charge of others, over seeing their work and being in charge of checking them out before they clock out. Thus granting you some leadership skills as well."
good,"I wait on tables as the come in and wait for my turn in rotation for being sat.  I have learned how to be a team player, time management, and responsibility.  The management and the co-workers all try to help one another out as much as possible.  It is rewarding when a guest compliments me on how well I did and knowing they enjoyed their overall experience dining with me."
good,"Every day was a new experience. This appealed to me very much because I love learning new things regardless of how big or small they may seem. The atmosphere was that of friendship and teamwork. I thrive in these conditions as do most people I am sure. The management is supportive and would push you just outside of your comfort zone. This would enable us to grow and become more well rounded and confident employees. "
good,"I like working for Cracker Barrel.  Each employee I have met likes to get the job done but in a fun, respectful manner.  It has been a great experience and I am learning new things every day."
good,"waited on tables, did side work, kept customers happy. Hardest part of job was when it was very busy, trying to keep everyone happy. most enjoyable pt was making people happy."

good,"We don t have any coments about"
good,"While I love the job I do due to my customers, especially the regulars and I love the people I work with, the recently hired management staff has become overwhelming with their power trips. Many employees, including myself, are considering leaving solely based on how we are treated as employees by our supervisors."
good,This place was a great place to work. I really enjoyed the staff and the people there. The management worked with every need I had and even helped give me more hours when needed.
good,This job was by far the best job ive had. My coworkers were extremely welcoming and friendly. the entire staff was stellar. my job dishwashing was fairly easy also. the hardest part of the job was emptying the trash.

good,Cracker Barrel is overall a good company. The managers I served under were good at their jobs. Some of the other people hired were questionable. I enjoyed working at this company
good,"We focused a lot on hospitality first and to give our guests that ""home away from home"" feel. We were expected to treat our guests with the same courtesy we would have if they were a guest in our own homes. The management was great, they coached a lot on what needed to be improved on but also let us know when we were doing a great job. Another main focus in the restaurant was having a team player mentality. If you were not helping a guest then you were helping someone that was. It helped make our work environment less stressful and the shift run smoothly. The hardest part about the job i think was the sidework. There wasn't a lot of hard parts about working at Cracker Barrel, everyone worked together. The sidework was sometimes extensive but practical. I think the most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the same faces come into the restaurant. Some of the guests have been coming to the same Cracker Barrel for years, the hosts and staff know them by name and you build  an unique relationship with them."
good,Team work is a must for this place. Each of us are what make the shifts go smooth. Being able to work with others and communicate effectively are very important. My favorite part of the job is encountering regular guest who come in on a daily bases.

good,I worked at a lot of server jobs and Cracker barrel was the best so far. I loved everything about it and the managers were great. I was at cracker barrel for about 3 years and if I would have not moved I would still be working there.
good,"Very busy place, Learned to be fast paced but very careful, The management isn't all that great, Absolutely adored co-workers; we were a big family, Hardest part was when we got slammed and grill got behind and guest had to wait a while on their food, Enjoyable part of the job was satisfying my guests!"
good,When I started working at Cracker Barrel I was finishing up my senior year in high school. I didn't work there long because I had school programs I had to attend. And when I was finish with High school I started college a month later.

good,"the back of the house consist of dishwashing room, busser, prep cook, back up cook, and line cook. you have to par up in every area before moving on. the managers and other employees take time and show you how to do every area and teach you all the things you need to learn. I have learned how to desk with guest and different types of foods. there was not really a hard part of the job because everyone worked together as a team and got the job done. ."
good,"Very busy workplace, had to think on your feet and stay ahead of the cycle of service to provide a great employee and guest experience. "

good,"Been work for this company for four years now, its convenient, friendly, always busy.  Management are great people, work very well with other employees.  On big happy family"
good,"Never bored here, always moving to meet customers needs. Though they should really pay extra for servers to take togo orders and give them to customers as this takes time away from their own tables in the resturant."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company. A typical day would be serving guests, helping your teammates, and completing all your daily tasks. Management was great, co-workers were decent. The hardest part of the job would be enduring the not-so-pleasant guests, and the kitchen getting backed-up. The most enjoyable part of the job was the hours. My shift was perfect for my lifestyle."
good,"Great company to work for !"
good,I like working with Cracker Barrel. They have improved my interactions with other people and completely solved my shyness. I learned how to operate a cash register and about the company itself. My coworkers are all so friendly and just make working there that much better. The hardest part of the job was when there were no guests in the retail section of the store. The most enjoyable part was interacting with the guest and employees.
good,Working together to do the job. Helping all guest and each other. with great attitudes and smiles with can do moods.
good,you meet many different people here. its a great job. pay isn't the best as a server but you have to work at it

good,This position calls for an excellent display of customer service. Greeting the guests and assisting them throughout their visit in the restaurant/gift shop is a vital part of this job.
good,I like always being on the move and being able to meet new people. I love my schedule too.I have always got along with my co workers. The hardest part of the job is working for tips and never knowing what the next day would be like with money.

good,Front and back of house was enjoyable to work in. Enjoyed getting to know the customers and helping them have a pleasant experience.
good,"I go in early to settle down before I clock in.  Once clocked in I begin doing my job and communicate with management if I have any questions.  I really enjoy my job, but my hours go up and down because of how labor is running for the month or if they have include training hours in the labor schedule.  I need to work as close to 40 hrs a week or more.  I enjoy the people I work with.  They are friendly and easy to give out praise and compliments.  I was nominated and voted employee of the year 2013 by my fellow employees."
good,I enjoyed working at Cracker Barrel. I wish i still worked at Cracker Barrel.
good,"Serving is one of the most difficult jobs to do in that you have to be able to conceal things very well in front of customers, and treat them above and beyond maybe how they are treating you in any given circumstance. You can give 100%, and only receive 10% or less for your services. But there is always the occasional person who notes your value and hard work, and is willing to compensate you for it. This is a good, solid company to work for."
good,"fast pace working environment "
good,Loved this job! Enjoyed interacting with the guest as they were checking out and seeing a smile on their face and that their food was great always made a good day!
good,"50-56 hr work week. Great management development program that can genuinely lead to promotion. Fellow managers are all top in their field. Lots of responsibility, rewarding, challenging, demanding but lead to great sense of accomplishment. Great family food, made from scratch (homestyle), dining room atmosphere and all the lady's love the retail shop."
good,"Clocked in, stocked my station, cook to order. Plated it on correct plate. Handed it to the expo. Learned to pace my cooking, management were rude, didnt treat their employees with respect. Co- worker were helpful, worked as a team to stay ahead of the 14 min ticket time. The hardest thing to do is keeping with the ticket time, especially during breakfast rush. I love to cook though so that was the most enjoyable part of the job."

good,Basic server Job.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"A typical day is working fastly and efficently to get everyone waited on and treated equally. Making sure everyone is satisfied to the best of your ability. The management and co-workers are very cooperative as an employee, but also as a customer, they are very considerate and are willing to make sure everything is finished and make right. The hardest part about the job, I'd say would have to be to make sure that you are making sure you're not only helping yourself, but you're helping others also. Lending a hand to a struggling co-worker and go a long way. The most enjoyable part is when everyone can work together, doing their part at helping out and everything runs smoothly."
good,"Great flexibility in this job allows me to work as often as I need or want. A typical day on this job includes working with the public and working with fellow employees as a team. I enjoy this job because it allows me to work with a variety of people. The hardest part of this job is the attentiveness of waiting on people and not being able to make all of them happy. I have learned to have patience with management, coworkers, and costumers."
good,a great place to work i recieved life learning experiences with hand to hand communication and customer service.my co workers were excellent and also helpful when i first began
good,"Opening a new store was exciting! Everyone was upbeat and friendly and the customers were made to feel welcome. I learned a great deal from advancing from clerk to trainee from greeting guests to taking inventory. The hardest part of the job was during the Beanie Baby craze when we ran out of the stuffed animals and guests were angry. The job was very enjoyable, very positive. My manager was fantastic, but then she transferred to Florida."
good,The location I was at was phenomenal. Coworker's were like family and the guests were awesome for the most part. I hated having to leave. I liked the fact that they valued their employees and showed genuine care for everyone.

good,Work environment is fun with the changing seasons and holidays. Management helpful if questions and if backup was needed at the registers. Customers usually easy to get along with.
good,"Happy and fast paced work place. Learned how to manage the front dining room, and management is pretty good too. The culture is friendly but the hardest part is learning the menu. I love that I get to see my guests regularly and how much love I feel at work!"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.

The guests are a priority to leave completely satisfied, with the entire experience, from the gift shop to the dessert at the end of their meal."
good,"Sell, focus on all products, ask what the customer is looking for and find it. Customer service all the way. This was just a part-time job. Dress right, be enthusiastic and sell! Cashiering, keep the store neat and clean and love your customers"

good,I really liked working there it was a great experience for me. I learned alot working there. the manager was a great manager he answered all ur questions.
good,"They are very flexible hours and you do have to pick up shifts. You do have to work for your money, but if you put in the effort it is definitely worth it!"
good,The management is mostly willing to work with your schedule. Tips are almost always great if you give good service. You get to meet regulars and lots of people who enjoy good homestyle cooking.

good,Im a people person so working at Cracker barrel is the right job for me.  It's fun and you get to please people.  I've heard of incidences in the past where guest were dissatisfied and felt the company was racist.  My particular location is family oriented and I work with great managers.
good,I loved working at Cracker Barrel. It is very family-oriented. The staff spends a lot of time together and are very close. The longer you work there the more loyal of a customer base you will get and the tips get better especially on holidays! The work environment can get very hectic and stressful though. Also no tray jacks! If you tend to get stressed out and crack under pressure this place is not for you. If you can handle the heat it can be very rewarding.

good,"My likes outweigh the dislikes, greatly. It’s common to have at least one or two things you would change about where you work so I don’t view the company negatively. For the most part, I like how things are run, especially that it is one giant team effort. Something we say around here, “don’t window shop”, meaning run any and all food, not just your own. We all work together to make sure each guest has a perfect experience and I greatly respect that."
good,It has been an honor to work here but I do have a two-year-old and I don't make all the money I feel like I can because we have to share our hours with others also serving alone you don't make that much money

You have different people around all the time, you work with different staff/managers on different shifts, the guests are different, the days are different. We generally have a good time when we are at work. It's like one big family. You get to teach/coach employees on new company initiatives. You get to learn new things, from making biscuits, to solving technology issues."
good,Love my job could of been better for me if the managers handled their team leaders trainers better to much was going on in the kitchen my first week there unprofessional
good,Fun environment and work experience. Friendly co workers. Nice pace in training. Helpful with stressful situations( personal and work related). Just not enough hours for bills.
good,I feel at home everyone is always helpful and enjoy going to work. They gave me a chance to get into the culinary field even though I. have been out of culinary school for 8 years.
good,"Cracker Barrel is a very systematic place to work and doesn't really allow room for individual creative freedom. Everything is mapped out for you the day you get there. Which can be both a good and bad thing. It's good because anyone can do it, but bad because it is too monotonous, stressful and tiresome."
good,"I have work in retail and as a server, I have worked retail at this place for over two years and they have been nothing but amazing to me. These people are ones that will work with you and your schedule to make it easier for you work there and balance other things."

good,Cracker Barrel is a great job to begin with. They believe in hard work and enjoying the world around you. They appreciate/ recognize hard work with promotions and other responsibilities. Anyone that wants to learn and grow has countless opportunities to do so. It is a great place to learn the ropes of being an adult and practice the responsibility that comes along with it.
good,"Enjoyed the guest and management. Managers did what they could to give the employees opportunities to advance and have fun while working, and not making it a stressful work place."
good,"Many jobs today (particularly entry level) pay the same amount regardless of the effort you put in. Cracker Barrel for me was a great job because when I felt like really pushing myself and wanted to make extra money I could turn my hard work into extra pay. It was some of the most rewarding work I've ever done. Of course the job wasn't paradise but I was lucky and had some outstanding managers who helped smooth over any bumps in the road. Overall it's a great job for anyone with the drive and passion for ""pleasing people""."
good,I loved working there however I love to stay busy and when it was slow and the store is so small that there was a limited amount of things to do to keep busy.

good,"I loved the environment I worked in, the working was simple after you were trained. they was fair and you get a raise if you pass the computerized test. Working at cracker barrel was fun, the people there were nice. I loved helping costumers, the managers was nice."
good,"A typical day at work; I would be assigned to 5-10 tables, on average. I would make sure our guests had everything satisfactory to their needs. Also, I made sure the food was properly prepared and that they left with a smile. I learned many things from being quick on my feet, to comprehending others needs. The management at The Cracker Barrel kept the team members in line especially on Sundays during our Church Rush. The Cracker Barrel has just a southern "" at home "" feel. The hardest part of the job would have to include the memorization you have to pick up during work. For instance, many of times my pen would be out of ink or will not work and I will have to remember the guest's orders. My memorization was tested, however, it was fully satisfactory. The most enjoyable about being a server would have to be meeting a variety of people every day of work."
good,A typical day consisted of assesing the situation of the dishroom and finding an effective to get it under control. Learned how to work multiple areas at once in a way that things were done and clean. Management was very friendly and helpful. Treated the staff with respect. There wasnt a hard part of the job. Most part enjoyable for me was working by myself until it became to much to handle. Great place to work.
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel was fun, I learned how to use a dishwasher and also how to clean the right way. The managers there are cool and nice, working there you get free drinks on your break. They also provide employee appreciation."

good,Great place if you have server experience or you are just starting. People here are great and like family. Friendly environment. My get stressful at times.
good,"Began working as a Prep Cook, but had learned most back of the back-of-the-house positions within 2 years.  Very good computer-based and trainer-lead learning.  The PAR system helps you learn slowly and increases expected responsibilities while also giving raises to match.  Was making competitive wages (for a cook) by PAR 4.  There can be trouble getting hours, especially during winter, but the more positions you learn, the more opportunity is there.  I was asked to be a shift leader (foreman that gets paid $2 more an hour), but declined because I was moving to the job I went to college for.  Shift leaders usually move to management, which there are also excellent opportunities for.  Management did a good job working with employees, and very few were fired.  The job is stressful, but if you are smart you will move to areas that are less grunt-work and more planning/organizing/overseeing.  There are definite opportunities to do this, and you should take advantage of them."
good,"it was cool "
good,"I love this job and the atmosphere, there are some days that are exhausting and weigh on your nerves but over-all its a great place to work and you can transfer anywhere"
good,"Working here was really cool, the people I got to work with bring you in as family and are always willing to help. That automatically passes on to you when another new hire comes in. Its great working for them"
good,"cracker barrel offered paid vacation, all benefits, discount, awesome training program, and a fun environment.  it was my home away from home.  cracker barrel is a great place to work"
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"I worked as a cashier at Cracker Barrel for several years in college. The work is super easy (maybe slightly hectic on Sundays and some holidays), the hours are incredibly flexible, and the management is terrific. Obviously the management will vary by location, but I always felt Cracker Barrel was relatively selective in their managerial hires. I really want to emphasize just how flexible the hours are. The management is always willing to work out a schedule that suits employees' needs. There were even some employees that worked just one day a month (the minimum required to maintain employment status) so that they could continue to use their employee discounts. Perhaps the best aspect of the job was the restaurant itself. If you've never been to a Cracker Barrel before, the interiors are styled to resemble old-timey general stores. Think wood furnishings on wood floors with a big (functional) stone fireplace in the dining area. I always found this style made for an exceptionally comfortable work environment. Finally, I found the food here pretty tasty, which is nice because they do allow employees to order (discounted) food during breaks. "
good,I've been with the company 12 yrs. I moved and now not getting the hours I was as I came from a high volume store and now at a low volume store . But over all love the barrel it's become family and I'll forever be grateful for what the company has done for me
good,"I applied for a cashier position at Cracker Barrel, but was told that they didn't have an opening. So they offered me a Dishwasher job, and I took the opportunity. It's just very fast past for a first time job, and wasn't expecting to stay long."
good,One of my favorite places to work. Always happy to be there and enjoyed my job very much. Everyone worked together and were all very friendly. It was like a family.
good,I love the fast pace of the job and the opportunity to help others when they needed the help. Not only did i wash dishes i also bust tables when they needed a extra hand. So i enjoyed the chances i had to help around whenever i could.
good,"I loved working for Cracker Barrel it was fast and furious. Management, for the most part, was top notch. THe hardest part of the job was most days going non stop from the start of shift to finish."
good,"It's a fast paced job. I feel like I learn something new everyday. I love our management and how they allow flexibility and support. The hardest part would be maintaining stress free on our busiest days."
good,Cracker Barrel was the first job I have when I moved to Las Cruces from California.  I really enjoyed working with the management team.  Our focus was training and really making sure each guest left happy.
good,"The pay here is very good for servers atleast. It's the perfect work environment for any type of person to be in, it's a very warming place. However, the management here are very rude and disrespectful! The treat there employees very badly! If you can take that, then this would be great for you."
good,Not the right fit for me looking to expand my job opportunities. This was my first job and I loved it here til the management started to treat me awful.
good,Busy but relaxed. Great atmosphere and friendly place to work. Not enough hours or pay to make monthly bills and food. Management team is awesome. I enjoy working there but like I said not enough to live on and no Insurance. The guests are super nice and truly enjoy the retail store. I have become friends with many returning guests.
good,"Awesome leadership, family life balance,  hospitality first environment, very friendly external guests and internal seemingly everyone attends nice school"
good,The managers all ways had work for people that wanted to work. Definitely a place I'm going to miss working at. I'm looking forward to a new job opportunity to show off what I learned from Cracker Barrel.
good,Great place to work. Team members are together. Managers are great to work with and for. I've learned a great amount of people as well as coworkers to work with.
good,"I worked here for such a short period of time because my grandmother in TN passed away in October. I was the sole heir & I didn't know if I would have to spend time going between NC & TN in order to settle the estate, which took several months. I didn't think it would be fair to my management for me to ask for a lot of time off if it were needed to settle things, so I left so they could find someone who could be dedicatde to the hours they needed worked."
good,Loved working there never had a day where i said i wish i did'nt have to work today. It was nice knowing that I could have fun with the customers and employees and also do my job at the same time.
good,"great palce to work friendly people.great benefits and vacation pay, I would highly recommend cracker barrel as a place of employment to work at. just very high paced"
good,"Amazing place to work. Very face paced, excellent food and we treat our guests like family. They in turn treat us the same. Our managers care about their employees and are always willing to work with us if we have family problems, health issues, and such emergencies."
good,"everyone in the kitchen was like family at cracker barrel mostly everyone always asked each other how  there family doing (kids mom dad etc) the food was awesome so can you imagine the smell when your starting a shift in the morning plus the the store had that old country feel too it that just clamed your nervous. the hardest part of the day would be sundays were typically backed up  because alot of our customers come straight from church too eat a cracker barrel ."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.

good,"Easy job! Not a lot required. Show up, do your job, you're golden. Management is awesome. Only bad thing is that you get paid every 2 weeks and it's not very much."
good,"A great place to take on a leadership role, that will let you advance within the company. The management tries hard to work with each individual's schedule."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at my local Cracker Barrel. The work was fun and the people were great. Managers were nice. Would definitely recommend. Probably not for a career, not a lot of room for promotion. Takes a long time."
good,The managers are absolutely great and understanding. You're able to have a very flexible work schedule. It's fast paced but is very easy to learn. Overall it's a great place to work if you have little ones or need a second part time job.
good,was a great job but needed better management. i made great money and had great customer service but i moved and where i live now we dont have a cracker barrel
good,"When I worked here, I learned how to go up to people and talk. Mainly because it was my job. It was a really good place to learn how to restock items in the kitchen. Also how to put in orders and everything that goes into the systems."
good,"Cracker Barrel is awesome. Decent pay, great co-workers and management, good food, and it's what I love to do. Cook and prepare food. What more can I ask for? I love it here."
good,There are all kinds of jobs here not just wait staff or cooks. There is the whole store to stock and arrange. Interaction with Customers is encouraged.
good,This was my first serving job and my favorite so far! My general manager was the best man I have ever met. The environment was good and you feel independent there((:

good,You work alot. Early morning. Alot to do. So come to work awake.....alot of mulittaking......fun environment thought. .managers aren't the best. But good company
good,"Cracker Barrel offers a wonderful compensation package and training is extensive.  I enjoyed the ever changing product and the excitement of being able to be a merchandiser and making decisions to promote and drive sales.  The guests who enter our store are like family because of CB's mission to be a ""home away from home"".  Strangers feel like old friends.   You must be self driven and disciplined to accomplish initiatives and directives, time management is must.  Do not hesitate to challenge yourself.   The only downfall is not always being able to leave as scheduled, due to unexpected business increases, last minute directives, etc.  This is most common during holidays.  If you have a well trained staff and develop a team of leaders, your position can easily be a 45-50 hour work week."
good,"I love working there, right now I am not able to make a lot of money because people are not out eating, but other than that it is a great to work and I love being around the staff and the guests."
good,The managers promoted team work and constantly tried to help when help was needed. If there was a situation that was getting out of hand the manager was always there to help protect the employee while respecting the customer
good,I worked at cracker barrel for 6 month and enjoyed every day.it was so much fun to work with great people and management. they helped me and i helped them
good,"One of the most organized companies I have ever worked for, great training program, easy people to work with. My only downfall is in order to make good money you must work the busier shifts like Sunday so by the time you get home to your kids, you can barely stand up."
good,"My days started by checking any new emails for company/inventory updates. Quick check and organization of any displays set incorrectly. I would interact with customers waiting to dine, or just shopping, as much as possible. This store is always getting in new unique treasures and my product knowledge always helped the guest make comfortable decisions. I loved nothing more than taking down old displays and being able to create a new one. The hardest part of my job could sometimes be when i had free rein over handling a new display, but the challenge always made me feel that more accomplished when finished."
good,What a great culture this company has. It shows in the stores too. The regulars are great! Management are leaders and jump in and help where ever needed. They care about there employees and guest!! I love the food too!
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.

good,"Expect to see families and elderly throughout the day."
good,"CBOS is one of the finest places to work that I have ever encountered.  The Pleasing People mentality permeates the entire company as they demonstrate what true customer service and care means to their internal and external guests.  The training that I received was without a doubt the best training of my career.  No stone was left unturned with it's ongoing manager training.  If you have a long period of time to climb the ladder to success, I would highly recommend the climb.  If not, then I would recommend another avenue."
good,Great Team! Good Management! Good Food! And most of the time Good Money! Try to work mornings because you will make money.
good,"Great people to work with. Waiter/server that possessed excellent communication skills, strong customer service, and the ability to multi-task. Duties included suggestive selling, taking orders, serving food and drinks to guests, cleaning, and rolling silverware."

good,I absolutely LOVED my job on the farm and I miss it terribly. I loved working with animals all day and being outside no matter how cold or hot. I generally enjoyed it. It was hard labor that I loved it was always something different.
good,Cracker Barrel is a wonderful place to work with plenty of room for advancement. From the upper levels of management to the people in the dish room one could not ask for a better group of people to work with on a daily basis. It's much like having a very large extended family.
good,Being the one to set the mood of a guest as a host as they come into the door is a great responsibility. My goal is to give a warm welcome to  each and every guess with an inviting attitude as they walk in the door.
good,I was a server here and loved meeting new people everyday! The hardest part of the job was when food wasn't prepared correctly and clients got mad.
good,"I worked at Cracker Barrel Old Country Store for three years and eight months. This was my first job I have ever had. With the two locations I worked at, I made a close connection not only with the employees, but with the guests, as well. It was an amazing and touching experience to be able to work for this company."
good,"I loved working for this company.  It's a lot of hard work and very little recognition, but if you are a self starter and are motivated, then you'd like working here."
good,"I get to work approximately 4:45 a.m. While I wait for the opening manager, I try to organize myself for my day ahead."
good,Hanil was a very laid back job but they 12 hours a day for 6 days was something else. I'm not sure if they have changed that but it was good pay but no time to enjoy it.

good,"I love working at Cracker Barrel as a Hostess. I like all of my co-workers. The restaurant staff was very diverse every color, race, gender, age, and sexuality."
good,"My typical work day at Cracker Barrel would consist of working in the dish room Keeping the dishes to a minimum, and a clean workplace. I learned to change the water filter in the dishwasher. My co workers and I got along great whatever I didn't know they'd show me the ropes and we all respected each others thoughts and opinions.The hardest part of the job would be rush hour because you'd constantly have dishes and the environment was very fast paste if you didn't have certain dishes clean you'd hold up the process at other stations in the store. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the environment of happy customers it felt like one big happy family."
good,"Well i greet the guest ask them how many people are in your party and get a good amount of menus and take them to their seats."
good,Cracker Barrel was a fairly fun place to work. Especially because there is also a old country store just outside the restaurant for the guest to shop before or after their meals.
good,Ive learned a lot of self discipline and become a more level headed and hard working person since working with this company. Its taught me not only to have a tougher skin to different personality that you may face but how to keep up with a faced paced environment. I enjoy going to work everyday because I have formed friendships with those on my team. There are a lot of responsibilities that come with this job but when you learn how to handle those the pay out is well worth the hard work. I feel I am constantly learning in the company.

good,"Work take food and drinks. Made sure they had a great experience  ."
good,"I enjoyed working for Cracker Barrel. It was a great experience for me. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the lack of breaks. I am a smoker but i would have to go up to six hours with no smoke break. I do understand the need for a cook to be behind the grill at all times, but is it too much to ask a manager to stand in for five minutes?"
good,"I loved working at Cracker Barrel. My favorite part was the friendliness and closeness of the employees. The management was very kind and understanding. They made sure all the employees knew that they (managers) were there to help us (employees) in any way. I enjoyed the being able to cross train to different positions. I started as a server and when I resigned I was a server, prep cook, and retail associate. The hardest part of the job was leaving at the end of the day. The employees are a very close ""family"", we protect each other. To this day, I am still close friends with many of my coworkers."
good,"I spent most of my Adult life working for them. They take care of their people in every way, except quality of life. On average I worked 75 hours a week 17 Thanksgivings, and 15 Christmas eves. Some summers I would work 65 days in a row with an average 80 hour work week. They will pay you for your skills, support you, and have an amazing benefits package.

good,"Since I go to school and work i had the privledge of helping my company cut cost, do a job analysis, figure out why our turnover rate was a high and how to correct it now for the future. My Co-workers are pleasant to work around. I was given the chance to show off my leadership skills, I train new hires, I am able to inventory  and frozen load. I have been working on my management skills. I have been organizing day to day activites on job, giving direction and assistance to employees.

good,"I love working for Cracker Barrel, It's a great company. There are lots of opportunities to shine and move up in your position as well as cross training."
good,Cracker Barrel position helped me learn several job skills that I value to this day. My co-workers were awesome and are now life long friends. Hardest part of the job was the many interruptions in a days time. Most enjoyable was the teaching.
good,"On a typical busy Sunday, I was having a rough day and so was the managers. So, he decided that we would ""jog"" down the server line and act like we were high-five the servers. Even though no one else got what we were doing, it did lighten the atmosphere. It made the day go by much easier and faster."

Management for the most part were very understanding and helpful. My co-workers and I got along well. The hardest part of my job was dealing with people who tried to walk out without paying their bill because I had to then pay for their order. I enjoyed learning the regular customers and interacting with all the different employees and the advancement to becoming a trainer."
good,Its ok at times. Just like any other place you work some days are better than others. The managers are very helpful when you need them to be. The people are great !
good,A typical day being a Server would be being assigned a section at work. Make sure the section is cleaned and all condiments are filled. Give and provide great customer service to the guest. Do other duties assigned by management.
good,"works goes by smooth at certain hours,but when lunch rush and dinner rush hits becomes a bit complicated,but since we all work as a team we gwt thru the day and management always compliments us"

good,Loved working at cracker barrel.  You get to meet different people and they become your family away from home. Wish they had one here in Elizabeth city.
good,"A typical day at work consists of attending to the customers and their orders, and anything that they would like with their meals.

good,"It's a busy or slow pace depending on what day it is. The crew I worked with are very fun and great. The only hard thing about the job is if it's really busy that sometimes certain needs for a customer slips the mind, but it's an easy fix. I moved so I could go to college and I do miss working with my crew."
good,Good organization to work for. This is a very busy restaurant with plenty of opportunity to grow and be developed. On going training and courses to sharpen and motivate your progress are scheduled. So you are paid to learn. Employee retention is extreamly high.
good,"When I first started at Cracker Barrel my step mother actually had already been working there for about 2 years or some thing so it made me feel a little better because she was there to help me whenever I needed it and I didn’t feel dumb for asking. Work environment was great, the people were great, and the management were also very great."
good,To have been a server for the first time in my life i loved this job. Its just too bad i had to move because I would still have been there now to be honest
good,I would normally work retail. That was where I was mostly at when I worked there. It was a lot better than hosting because of the management that looked over you.
good,Being a waitress at Cracker Barrel was stressful at times and the restaurant was always very busy. I had anywhere from 2-5 tables to work for myself and made sure they were always taken care of. I took their orders and got their food out as quickly as possible. I also made sure they always had full cups and that they weren't waiting on me to bring them the check.
good,Its an okay job the bosses do think they can talk to you in anyway and change days and time u work any time that I don't like I need a new job! But you will find out even if they talk to ride to.you they will give u days off u ask for. They will show allr of caring for customer.

good,"Working at Cracker barrel was a great and enriching experience for me. Your management and coworkers worked with you to make the shift run as smoothly as possible. This job taught me how to multitask effectively and how to work in a group dynamic. It also provided the chance to learn how to deal with patrons, how to handle complaints and how to always make your guests experience into a positive one. It is, however, difficult getting used to working in such a fast paced environment. You're getting people in and out typically in 30-45 minutes. You are always on the move and that can be rough on you body and wear you out mentally. The overall best part of this job was the environment and the people. The environment behind the scenes was as relaxed as possible and the coworkers are positive and helpful."
good,"Enjoyable atmospher. Most management helpful and respectful. Attention to standard and ways to improve. The job helped me broaden my capabilities with varrying forms of maintnance. Due to physical dissability progression rather unexpectedly; i was no longer physically capable of performing neccesary duties within aloted time. The company was wondeful, however thy could not continue yo mploy me in any available position due to needing asistsnce with walkibg  wheelvhair is needed often."
good,You wanted to make your guest feel at home at all time's. In the winter have the fair place going and offer them some hot coco and let them enjoy there self.
good,The store is a great place to work. The Athens store is awesome. They all work as a team and all are very respectful. I feel we all work as a team and that is a great feeling! Love working there!!
good,This is a job where I can and do put my people skills to use everyday that I work. Many of the guests are from the local area but there are also many who are just traveling through.
good,It is a fast paced industry that can be very rewarding for the right applicant . There is huge potential to grow with the company. The salary s very competitive.
good,"I loved cracker Barrell . It was fast paced but the environment and atmosphere was incredible , unfortunately I let my bad attitude boss push me over the limit which made me walk out worst mistake I made job wise. That's the job I miss the most . I'd give anything to go back home."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Cracker Barrel is a great and warm workplace where they try their best to take care of their workers and costumers. I very much so appreciate the strictness they have on their way of rules. The structure of this workplace taught me how to be patient, willing, hard working and kind to costumers and in other places of costumer service."
good,it was a nice place to work the pay was good for the hours I got. everyone was super nice and it was an overall easy job to do. I cashed people out work with costumers and I cleaned the bathrooms.
good,"I was never a server before i started working there, but it’s a lot of fun! I enjoy it with little to no stress and it’s a face paced job so you usually always have something to do."
good,"Although it seems like a slow-paced place to work, it’s not. It can get busy, everyday, especially near dinner time but the tips and discounts make it worth it."
good,"working her makes me happy, it makes me want to come back the next day. it’s just not something i see myself with my personality doing every day. i love cracker barrel"
good,I love the atmosphere. The customers are amazing. My co-workers have been very helpful in training me. There is always something to do. I know that I can always ask questions if I'm not sure
good,"I really enjoyed working at Cracker Barrel for a year it usually takes me a while to get comfortable but it was like a family there. Management is very supportive if you need help with something they will assist you. Though I do feel for the hours I had worked I should have received free or discounted lunch. I started off only getting 10% until I parred up. Overall I learned a lot about customer service and how to deal with a diverse group of people. Also, I was a very sensitive person but dealing with customers made me acquire ""tough skin."""
good,"It's a fine place to work, good tips, regulars come there a lot so you may be requested a ton for tables that arent yours which may make co workers mad."
good,"I work in Retail. The manager is flexible about schedules and works with you when and if you need to take time off."
good,"It's easy to work here, but if you're easily overwhelmed, I do not recommend, seeing as it gets very busy especially on Saturday and Sunday morning and afternoons"
good,"The retail store at Cracker Barrel is a great place to work. Management tries to make every day enjoyable, and the employees are friendly and team-oriented. The pay is not great and the hours available can vary depending on how business is going. But as a part-time job, you can't do much better. Every employee gets the same discount on food and merchandise in the retail store. Raises are given as you advance in knowledge and skills, which are tested on a schedule. Management understands the importance of education and family, and they will work with you to keep your work and home life balanced."
good,"I did work a lot and being a server at cracker barrel, you have a lot of things going on at once. It can be stressful at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's a decent job with decent money if you know how to take care of customers in a quick but effective manner."
good,"Managers are usually good at their job. Out of our 6 or so managers everyone only dislikes one. I make 12 an hour expediting, but I worked here for over a year and a half before requesting this raise from our general manager. I was at 9.50, so a 2.50 raise is decent I suppose. I'm mostly a server though, don't make under 10 an hour in tips on slow nights. I can make up to 20-25 an hour on Friday, Saturday or Sunday. I'm a male with a beard and long hair kept in a bun, but like most serving jobs people tend to tip females more, keep that in mind."
good,"Cracker Barrel has been around for so many years, and it has never felt in jeopardy of going out of business. The guests keep coming for the good food and for the positive attitude the employees are expected to provide. Though some days are harder than other, some stores have better teams than others, the company at its heart cares for its employees. It provides a good work experience in an industry that so often can be challenging and unenjoyable at other restaurants."
good,"The managers are typically very nice and understanding, guests are usually the reason for bad environment due to it being early in the morning but overall great place"
good,I love the people i work with..i can change my availability how i want it when i request time off i can get it. My work I’m environment is fun but sometimes crazy depends on how busy we are.
good,"Highly recommend you learn, a lot and you get to advance if you want. What money you earn, is the money you keep. Just have to watch out for certain people they can be quite rude. I would say the hardest part is when you slip up, to try and get back on track. They have parties and it's a family-oriented type of vibe. I enjoyed it and the money a lot, but towards the end of my job we lost a manager and things just fell apart and I really started to become unhappy."
good,Crackel Barrel is a perfect place for me to begin serving and learning new positions. It is fast paced at times and hectic but the managers do a great job making everything run smoothly. Everyone is so nice and welcoming and have no problems helping new people when they need help.
good,"This was a very good place to work.,the foid was very goid..The tips were good..Alot of servers at one time..You very seldom got to take a break tho..The sidework took a long time to do ..But i love working with the public."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"I absolutely loved working as a server! Good environment for young (not necessarily) energetic individual! Great opportunity to work on interpersonal skills, improve work ethic, urgency with a purpose, balance, patience, ect."
good,"I enjoyed working at Cracker Barrel. The management was good, everyone got along, cheerful atmosphere, my only complaint is that I didn't get enough hours."
good,"I love working at Cracker Barrel. They are very flexible and willing to help out. I work a typical 6 to 7 hour shift and have a clear expectation of what I need to get done. The only downside I ever had would be management but they are typically nice, just over worked and stressed out, which stresses us out."
good,I love working here and I recommend it to everyone that has a good attitude and loves working with amazing people! Some shifts can be tough but don’t forget to never give up!
good,"No animosity among employees/peers, everyone is connected to the business -- it's truly like a family, they were very generous with the hours given, very strict yet open rules. The most enjoyable part for me was helping guests and enjoying a half off meal every shift!"
good,I worked here all throughout high school and most of my undergrad. It is a great atmosphere and there is room for flexibility.  It is a perfect job for a highschoolers because it pays more than a minimum wage job with tips. Servers do not split tips.
good,Great people to work with. I was able to advance very quickly more quickly than others. They treated us fair. And tried there best to accommodate us anyway that they could.
good,the managers and bosses are there 24/7 so no you cant eat on the floor but you do get a break and a 43 cent biscuit. the other servers are great its really a fun environment a kitchen full of fun and full of joy women to be around.
good,LOVE getting to know the regulars. The staff really does become like a family. Everyone relays on each other. Sundays are the busy days so it is nonstop.
good,Cracker Barrel is a good company to work for! There’s plenty of opportunities to advance in the company! I’ve been having difficulties being able to cross train to different positions and not enough hours as a host right now for me though.
good,I started working at Cracker Barrel as my second job. I absolutely loved it and I felt so welcome there. I made great relationships with the regular guests and even came in when I wasn’t scheduled just to eat with them. I was sad to leave this job when I moved from Ohio to Florida.
good,Working here has been amazing and I'm very thankful for the oppourtunity although I would've loved to be scheduled more regularly. It was typically a couple days here and there then a huge chunk of time off before i went back to work for teh next day or next week.
good,"I started in high school working at Cracker Barrel and as the years went by, I would transfer to different stations so that I could learn as much as I could from a very, high skilled industry that had numerous chances for advancement."
good,"You come in, set up for high volume period. Anticipate whats needed to cut down time for when you get cut of the floor. Multi task between serving guest, helping coworkers, keeping area clean. I've definitely learned how to address the public better, as well as how to efficiently multi task. Depending on the group you are working with, you can have a great day, or a struggled stressful day. I personally didn't get affected I believe. I ignored it and did what i needed to do.  The hardest part of the job would be hmmmm.. after 7 years, nothings hard anymore, but if i had to say when i first started, it was knowing the menu. However that takes time and repetition. And the trainers are suppose to be understanding to new servers learning so its not hard if you had an answer board right around the corner. The most enjoyable part was definitely getting a $100 tip or a $20. Also, working with a variety of people who strive for the same as you. I've met some great people at CB."
good,This was another great restaurant to work at. The managment was friendly but strict. Everyone's job was always getting done. We always had a great team mentally there. And I only left there because I obtained my nursing license.
good,"It has a lay back feel. Even at peck hours. Everyone love the fast pace. It goes really fast."
good,serving here gives great opportunity to gain experience in customer service as well as time management.  i’d say it is a good place  to learn how to be a server if you’ve never served before.
good,"Cracker Barrel was a great work environment,Management & my daily guest were the reason i went to work everyday,Very Welcoming ,and understanding, Pay was decent ,Tip outs at night,and nightly cleaning tasks before close was easily maintained."
good,Very fast paced . Extremely busy in the mornings. And on the weekend. Very great staff. And management. Very helpful and willing to go that extra mile for employees. Especially with good potential
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I love working at Cracker Barrel. Sometimes the work is hectic and stressful but nothing a person with good retail experience couldn't handle. Advancement is easy if you work hard for it.
good,Cracker Barrel provided a lot of energy in a family safe enviornment. Everyone worked together and there weren't many large internal issues. The ettiquete and dress code are both very strict.
good,Very busy fast paced place to work. Working in retail creating and maintaining displays. Help guest locate items within the store and gift wrapping. Great co-workers making it a pleasure to work.
good,"Cracker barrel has always made me feel at home, great coworkers and everyone got along very well, food is amazing and I would definitely work here again."
good,I love doing the dishes as if makes me feel good that dirty dishes are becoming clean again and working as a team with other employees. Great benifits and management was great.
good,"Extremely busy most of the time, Had a very large dining room. Servers were extremely good at their jobs and had to prove that everyday. Cooks were also very good and were always prompt"
good,"A typical day involves talking among employees and guests, side work, and silverware.  I learned a lot at Cracker Barrel.  They have a great training program.  Management was very judgmental at times.  Workplace culture was great.  I love pleasing people.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with management.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with both internal and external guests.  I absolutely love the ETC's."
good,"The staff and guest are very nice, everyone was so willing to help or tell you something new.The hardest part of my job was line control when we were really busy."
good,Coworkers make the job fun. Regular guests give you something to look forward to throughout the week. Building relationships with the management is easy and makes the environment around the workplace enjoyable.
good,"it was a good place to work, something that was new to me very different from retail store. management was great as were the guest. i disliked standing in one spot for long periods of time. love meeting new people"
good,"Management could do a little better with their paperwork. Other than that it's been a great working experience. It's also never borning, theirs always something to do."
good,Nice place to work. Friendly coworkers. Everyone was really nice when you had questions or needed help with a task. Managers were very forgiving when you screwed up.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working at Cracker Barrel. I  worked with great people, and had a great boss.I also enjoyed meeting guest from various places and assisting them as well. It was awesome to receive store discounts for special days as well! I worked as a Retail floor attendant, and began as a ""Rising Star"". Through learning about the business, and my job at Cracker Barrel, I was allowed to test, and upgrade in my pay. Passing each test resulted in me rising to a "" 4 Star"" status! I felt very accomplished.I worked in the ""gift shop"" there, and we sold everything from old fashion candy to stylish clothing. We also gift wrapped anything purchased there, and took special orders for customers too."
good,This is the only employer that I know that will work around your life needs versus you having to schedule your life around them.  They worked around my changing school schedule and another job.  Plus the managers are friendly and get to know you.
good,Many deaf there. That help communicate. Fun. Hard fast cook. Easy burn. careful pay attention. No distractions. Work fast. ready orders. ready food. People wait. Keep clean everything.
good,I love my coworkers but not the GM. He doesn't know how to talk to his employees.  I also have not seen him interact with our guests as he should. There are also too many minors working there and most of them do not do there job which puts strain on the employees that do their job.
good,"Going in to work is fun, I enjoy seeing the guest  & co-workers each day . There is always a goal to reach each day which can be competitive between employees to see who can reach it first."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Shifts were either easy or busy depending on day and business. Assisting other servers was key making sure food made it out in timely manner. Management at the time was great. Hardest part of the job was the closing duties. I really enjoyed the busy days very good money depending on the day.
good,"Cracker Barrel's vision is to be the best restaurant in America, and that is evident through the way they treat their guests and their employees."

good,"-Is usually sorta steady but nit so busy that it is overwhelming "
good,"Great management and Very diverse"
good,Cracker Barrel is a fun place to work very friendly mangagers and co workers but during peak hours it can become extremely crazy and must be able to multitask.
good,"Loved my job at Cracker Barrel,Management was great and the friends I made was great.You feel like part of a team not just a number.During the time I worked there my work partners became family.The only reason I left was because my vehicle would not make the trip anymore.I hope to go back one day.You were always allowed to discuss any problems you had at the monthly meetings.This is definitely a company that cares about its employees."
good,it's a great place to work at revenue is friendly very helpful as well. it s a relax yet productive work environment. The managers are very nice and super friendly and also very understanding and flexible. Its sometimes hard when it gets really busy and everyone is just busy as well.
good,"The retail manager is great to work for. She expects you to do your job, but is not afraid to get in there and work herself. The work is fast paced, but they definitely reward you with raises and advancement for good work. They also are willing to try and work with your life schedule more than other places I have been."
good,"awesome workplace, great and friendly co-workers. the hardest part of this job would have to be learning the menu and everything the goes with the meals, but it is time consuming and i am starting to get the hang of it!"
good,I loved working here it was fast pace and always busy doing something either with or with out customers. I was sad to have to leave after i had my first child. was a great experience working here.
good,"They are a very well organized company, the best I've ever been apart of. They make sure that they cover all basis in the training that is required for the job."
good,"It was a fun job to work at and very fast pace. When I worked there at the time, all my coworkers were sweet and always willing to help! My managers, if there was a problem, was very attentive and was willing to work with me if things became complicated with the scheduling."
good,"Cracker Barrel is a wonderful short term place to work. The employees there really treat you like family. Dealing with angry and inconsolable guests was the hardest and most frustrating part of the job. There is a real team oriented culture that can either be very enjoyable or stressful depending on the type of workers on the shift. I really have learned so many traits applicable to other jobs such as team building skills, stress management, multitasking, organizational skills, and people skills. The flexible scheduling is really the best pro. The management is really willing to work with everyone's schedule. There is opportunity for advancement. Breaks are very limited due to constant business. The environment can also be very hostile at times depending on how the shift is going and the manager on duty. As a server, we also held a lot of responsibilities such as bussing tables, taking care of tables, setting up and running food, making desserts at times, making salads at times, and sitting guests at times. Sometimes it can seem like your hard work is unappreciated, but some managers are very vocal about their appreciation."
good,Cracker barrel was very busy and always had something to do but when customers would want to be descrete at christmas for wrapping gifts for wife and lover they would pay you under table. Work environment was great. family oriented. Would not let you go outside to help carry take out orders for customers or on break.
good,"Very solid business and customer base. The store has high standards and does a great job of being consistent throughout their many locations. The food is genuinely made from scratch, quality products are used."
good,"Was a great place to work overall. Company is good at providing benifits, work schedule, advancement in the company ranks. Would work for company again if need be."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,This is a great . company one of the best training programs I ever seen. They take care of their team and have a lot of programs that can help you when you'
good,I love working at Cracker Barrel. My particular store in Buda has the greatest management. They really work with your schedule. The clientele usually consists of more elderly guests and they are usually very friendly. The job is easy to learn.
good,As a collage student they are very accommodating to classes and activities. I started at 8.35 and I don't get a lot of hours or any good benefits but it gets me what I need and I have insurance through my parents so it really just depends on what you need. I love working there though
good,I enjoyed working with others to achieve excellence. Management was easy to talk with. I appreciated the opportunities to learn different skills and improve on the ones I already had. The hardest part of the day was Sunday lunch hours.
good,"I absolutely loved working here. Unfortunately, it was only seasonal so I wasn't there long. A typical day consisted of greeting customers, demonstrating new products, stocking, wrapping gifts if needed, and cleaning the floor area. Management was very nice and very helpful. Coworkers were also very kind and eager to teach you if you needed it. The hardest part for me was convincing people to buy things, since I am not a very pushy person."
good,Great place to work not enough time in the day to get all the work done. Very busy but all managers have a certain area they are responsible for.
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel taught me how to work with different walks of life, service wise and professionally. I enjoyed the experience in customer service."
good,"Cracker barrel is a nice place to work but they r going out of business.. I wish they wasent"
good,"Very fast pace, working with a team of dish workers which makes the job easier.  The hardest part of the job is taking out the garbage."
good,"Great job that got me through college. Although the work got a little monotonous after 6 years, my manager was the best. I was in charge of receiving merchandise and keeping the retail store up to company standards in our store as well as others. I worked hand in hand with my boss and assisted her in whatever she needed."
good,"I love working for Cracker Barrel. Every day I walk in excited and ready to work, and my co-workers are actually referred to as my ""Barrel family"" because we are all so close."
good,"Advancement opportunities are aplenty, good people, and everyone there is extremely polite and helpful. The food is also delicious. I would recommend working here to anyone."
good,"I love watching the faces of the new hires as I conduct orientation. It's rewarding when I can tell they are excited about working for the company whether they will be in the retail store or start out washing dishes. "
good,The hardest part of being a Gift Shop Associate was to get enough sales for the store.  It was hard knowing how to approach each guest and even harder trying to second guess what each guest might enjoy purchasing.
good,I was not that experienced with cooking with large kettles. I have learned how they work and the proper way of using them.
good,"Management team is wonderful, I've grown very close to a lot of people here"
good,I genuinely enjoyed working as a retail associate at Cracker Barrel. I loved their products (and even got hired because I was having so much fun browsing) and the guests were all very pleasant people. I got along wonderfully with my coworkers and my manager. My manager (and the company itself) were very accommodating to my school and transportation schedules (I used public transportation to commute) and even let me come back after the summer without having lost any of my benefits. I became very good at displaying the features and benefits of our product and helping our guests find exactly what they needed.
good,"The managers would give me a job to do for the day, such as being the cashier, inventory, pricing, or greeting the guests. I would handle the money (cash, credit cards, and gift cards) from the guest for their purchases (restaurant, and/or gift shop). The management were very good at taking my requests into consideration (availability, requested time off) and were always easy to talk to. The hardest part of my job was the busy days during Cedar Point tourism, but all the people I got to meet and the regulars always taught me a lot when listening to their stories. The most enjoyable part of the job was my manager, and my coworkers that I still have friendships with and many great memories from working with them for quite some time."
good,"Very good environment to work in"
good,"Nice place to work, down home people to work with. Management can be iffy, and drama set to the maximum (though I've heard that about almost every restaurant). Management is always pushing for greatness and offering open positions for cross training or leading potential."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"everybody there gets along, they help if you need it. it can be a fast paced environment but when everyone comes together, it makes the flow easier. everyone is super friendly, even managers. they are there to help you with whatever you need. the hardest part about working here was the guests, some can be set in their ways but if you smile and attend to their needs it will be fine. i learned a lot about fast paced environments and how to handle the stress of it."
good,"I worked at Cracker Barrel as a server for almost 3 years. It was a wonderful place to work. My coworkers were always great. Their slogan is ""Pleasing People"" and I can assure you that they stand by that statement and, as a team, work towards improving guest satisfaction every day. They have a 4 star system for employees. You start out as a ""Rising Star"", and every few months you get an evaluation from management, and also have to pass a test in order to gain another star on your apron, shirt, etc. With each star comes a raise. After 4 stars, you continue to get regular raises. You can also apply to train new employees in your area of work. If you like to try new things, they have a ""cross-training"" option for employees where they will train you in other areas of the restaurant. Then you have multiple job titles and you are a much more valuable employee. They offer insurance for those working 30+ hours a week. Everyone, including servers, gets paid vacation, and paid holidays (holidays that the store will be closed). With every star you earn on your apron you earn an extra week of vacation up to 3 weeks. This is a great company to work for and I absolutely loved my job. Going to work everyday was fun and exciting!"
good,"Go with the flow environment, laid back but high speed and organized. Management was almost perfect and co-workers were the best. The most enjoyable part of the job was our little parties. The hardest part of the job, making sure we had enough silver ware wrapped up for all tables."
good,"The Cracker Barrel in Lenoir City is known by employees as one of the best. Everything is well-maintained, the staff is nice, and it's just generally a good place to work."
good,"I love the company, and the way that they run each store. I've worked at two different locations and they both were on the same page. They provided opportunities to advance and train other workers, and were very supportive in teaching employees the requirements of any new position that they wanted to cross train for."
good,I love my job here. I know that I can trust the managers there and they are very reliable and very hard working. My co-workers are amazing! Team work is always a plus but at Cracker Barrel the employees are always willing to help out in any way they can.
good,I taught children lesson plans and did activities went outside did crafts listened to music did groups and music groups read to them cooked and communicated to parents.
good,"Cracker barrel is a good place to work because you learn better people skills , and how to greet and talk to random people . everyday I would serve food and seat customers .The only think I didn't like was the holding the tray over people ."
good,We work together to make sure the restaurant runs as smooth as possible. We all get along so it makes the work place enjoyable.
good,setting myself and team members up for success. Management was  great. keeping a positive attitude so my team members would follow.  watching  a trainee succeed during a shift because of the knowledge and tools I have provided them with was the most rewarding part of my job. I learned great communication and relationship building skills while being a server trainer.
good,"A challenging and rewarding managerial position with over 100 employee's, proficient in assigned module's, (Labor, Food Supplie's and Maintenance) these were required field's to successfully manage a 3,000,000 $ store (annual). Required on average 60 hours a week and a degree of professionalism for the Guest. Selection and hiring of promising personnel to enhance success of the Cracker Barrel Vision for excellence."
good,This is a great place to get started in the work field. Perfect for High School and college students to earn extra money and still focus on their school.
good,A typical day of work consists of face to face interaction with customers. Cracker Barrel is a fast paced environment with tons to do. The hardest part of the job is to make sure that you are making all of your customers happy by staying consistent and on top of it. The most enjoyable part of being a server is seeing people walk out the door full and happy. Another thing that is enjoyable about my job is becoming so close with all of my co-workers and being able to work together as a team.
good,"Being my first job I didn't know what to think of what to expect, but the four years i spent there were the best days of my life. I would come into work and love to see the regular customers come in. I learned quite a bit from this job and I loved the management I got to work with and the friends i worked with. Everyday was the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,"On a typical day at work , there will always be a rush hour and no matter what mood you're in you have to be on top of the game. As a team in Cracker Barrel , you always stay busy and prepare for the rush hour. Also we love to please our guest , so by that being said we deliver friendly customer service and smile a lot  . I always think positive when I walk through Cracker Barrel's door. My guests are friendly and I wish them the best as always . I currently work at Cracker Barrel as a sever , I always serve like i would love to be served at a restaurant with my family. I am grateful for my job , but I have low hours , and extra days off . I'm 19 ,and I am looking for a second job to help me go to school next fall ."
good,"Cracker Barrel is a great place to work due to its great benefits, humble environment, and incredible customer base. The holiday hours are not ideal and there tends to be tension between the wait staff and the kitchen staff, but on good days it is a fantastic place to work."
good,"I worked part time at cracker barrel as a server while attending college and loved every minute of it! Great management, work atmosphere and pay."
good,"-Set and met all goals "

good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"This was my favorite job, really great place to work. This is a company where they are very willing to teach you other positions so you can get your hours. The hardest part of this job is actually dealing with some of the employees . The best part is the recognition you get from management"
good,possessed complete knowledge of the menu great place for a first job
good,"There are many programs set in place for advancement. It is very conservative though. No nail polish, hair color, certain types of make up. Does not foster creativity, it's all about the companies need to be uniform. I have learned how to interact well with customers from this job. There are very good managers, I never have a complaint about them, they are very helpful. My co-workers are great, there is little to no drama. The hardest part of the job is having to be so uniform. The best part of my job is helping customers have a great experience."
good,"A typical day consisted of greeting and serving guest, Cleaning and side work."
good,fun move on to better job. more money and security I love working with the public. co-workers are still my friends
good,I truly enjoyed working with the preschoolers on a daily basis. I love to encourage them and be their advocate.
good,"Serving guest, running food and prepping for the next shift."
good,You have a lot of room to grow in the company. I have grown alot since i have been working with them
good,"I love working there.  A typical day usually includes helping a guest with their needs, gift wrapping and restocking.  I love the environment in general.  The employees are great and we all act as a 'family'.  The managers are real easy going and make it fun to work with them.  Our guests that come in are family oriented as well and always have a story to tell, especially if they are traveling.  It is always neat to hear some of the stories.  The hardest part is to multi-task during our busiest times of year.  I love working there and would recommend anyone."
good,"I worked for the busiest Cracker Barrel store at the time. Was a wonderful team oriented job with plenty of advancement opportunities.  "
good,"Everyday is filled with the many new people the come in for our service, and our many employee's that help make that happen!."
good,What I learn from working at Cracker Barrel is how to deal with customers on a day to day bases. I learn how to make decision with the manager being there. I know to handle money using the basic math skills. I help and supervise others as a lead server. I clean and stock the shelves of the resturant. watch for inventory.
good,"A typical day at Cracker Barrel is never dull. There is always something that has to be done which makes for a fast paced environment, which I like. Management is always goal oriented and sometimes can be overwhelming towards their employees and can make for a hard working environment. The hardest part of the job is communication towards the managers. The easiest part of the job is communicating towards guests and their needs."
good,Typical days at work include greeting customers first and foremost. Then you maintain clean restrooms and a clean register space. You conduct over the phone food orders and retail orders just as you do at the register. You meet new people who are all ages and are fun to speak with. The hardest part of the job happens when you are having a busy night and the line begins to grow. The most enjoyable aspect is during breaks when you might get the chance to enjoy some good country cooking and a nice fresh soda.
good,I love the people I worked with there and the management.. They gave me overtime when I needed or wanted it. Its a great place to work
good,"fast paced, and challenging while gaining maintenance experience."
good,"A typical day at work is fun and exciting.  I love looking at the new decor we get in everyday.  I mainly love working with the customers because I love making people smile and our customers are, for the most part, very nice, happy people."
good,"The typical day at work was busy, but steady. Even on the slow days there was plenty of tasks to do to make time pass. Stocking, cleaning, reading up on sale changes so I was aware, were few of the many things one could do productively. I learned how to approach people with confidence, and friendliness with out seeming too forceful. The co-workers were very friendly and made for enjoyable shifts. The hardest part of the job for me honestly was display set up. It takes a lot of coordination because store sizes vary, so what is wanted may not work for our location, but so long as you could follow the plan well enough to make sure everything was displayed, then usually it was fine. The most enjoyable part for me was being the friendly face that all the guests saw. You never know what they are going through or what their day is like so being sure to always have a smile and be friendly was sure to make their day trail along better than had someone been rude."
good,"Days started early and could run late but were full of  new friends and high expectations.  Initially  the position utilized  basic retail merchandising 101 from selective product assortment to productivity per square foot.  I hired and trained a very dedicated staff of 15 that have remained close over the years. About 50% of the staff still remain with the company."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"I enjoy working here but would like to more hours."
good,"I enjoyed my 10+ years very much."
good,"I find that I am consistently busy, which I prefer. I learned that my skills in multi-tasking come in very handy. Management encourages each employee to strive to be the best they can be. All of my co-workers are fun, yet professional and we all work as a team. At times the job is difficult when we are extremely busy without enough staff which makes it hard to give great customer service. Having awesome co-workers makes each day enjoyable and the time seems to fly by."
good,This job helped me keep everything together. I Really like Working here.
good,"serve guests, make sure food went out hot and order was right. very good place to learn to serve guests and handle food. some management was not great, but had very good time at job"
good,"POSITIVES"
good,I enjoyed working at cracker barrel. I was there for almost 5 years. And I hated to leave. I had learned so much there it has stuck with me.
good,"I loved working for Cracker Barrel, the only reason I left was to spend more time with my family. You have to work 55+ hours a week. And you donot have a set schedule."
good,Meet and greet customers coming into resturant and store. Help customers find what they are looking for in store. suggest special items on sale for christmas. What I learned from Manager was be friendly and thank customer for coming to Cracker Barrel and help them find items in store. Enjoyed working with store staff as they all were very hekful when I needed help.Hardest part was you were standing all the time and moving around store and watching for customer to enter and when someone was leaving. We were suppose to grret customers coming in and thank customers as they were leaving. Most enjoyable was working with the public as I enjoyed that part of job. Meeting new people every day I worked.
good,"A typical day at Cracker Barrel consisted of anywhere of 12-18 servers at a time, weekends are very busy, i learned sense of urgency, and really being part of a team, managment was awesome, co-workers the best, my hardest part of the job would be keeping up with sidework while attending to my customers, but my most enjoyable part of the job was that everybody got along and we worked as a team"
good,I never went to work wishing I didn't have to be there. Everyone was nice and used positive reinforcement to help you be a better salesperson even if you are just cashiering.
good,Just your typical resturant job
good,•Greeted guests while entering to the premise.
good,busy work days. met some great people. Loved the experience.
good,The ability to serve and assist the constant flow of national and international travelers.
good,"Since I have been there I have moved around to three team so no day is the same. I am responsible for ensuring our 620 stores receive their retail items to sale. Allocation is based on current sales performance, store traffic and historical data. The job requires a person to multi task and remain organized"
good,"Your involved in the operation with hands on management. From producing food production charts, labor forecasting and budgeting. Guest satisfaction and cleanliness."
good,The managers I had were so helpful and instructive. The customers were usually great to wait on.
good,"From the first day I started, every person has been welcoming, from fellow co-workers to customers. The atmosphere is one where you arent stressed out and are able to enjoy yourself while working. The hardest part of the job is when we get a large volume of customers in the store/restaurant. With that, you learn to deal with it, and continue with your job. The best part of the job is seeing the familiar faces each week, and building a bond with them."
good,"I was the front end Host part time and a cook part time. I was promoted to a full time Assistant Food Production Manager in the kitchen and kept my part time position as a host. I loved every minute of my job. However, I had to quit and move to Missoula because my father was diagnosed with Liver Failer and I needed to help take care of him."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"This was one of my favorite jobs. Fun filled exciting place to work. They have a great mission statement ""Please People""."
good,"sense of security and value, not that much chances for advancements because of lot of outside hiring of manager position. They don't really focuss much into employee's growing from within"
good,It’s a very country place it’s fun to work at and most of the time it’s a very easy going day. You get to interact with food and shop all in the same day. The management is sometimes rough. Everyone does different things but you’ll catch on quick. It’s very easy and some people try to make it easy on you as well.
good,Go to work to sell sell sell and to enjoy good food. The management is tight and very supportive. You can actually make pretty decent money taking your time here.
good,Great place to work! Co workers and managers were wonderful. They expected a a lot when they trained employees which was great because we all were on the same page when working and knowing what to do with the customers.
good,"Lots of stress on servers, fast paced.  Friendly customers.  Nice merchandise and repeat customers come in just to shop.  Repeat customers love the food and service.    Excellent servers, they work very hard."

good,As an overnight maintenance cleaning was fun.Operating high power hose in kitchen to clean behind equipment and stoves.Cleaning filters above stoves was easier with the high power hose.
good,"The hardest part of my job is leaving everyday. The easiest part I would say is all of it. I love my job as a dishwasher, and the people I work with. Being a cook there, is a little easier when It comes to manual labor. But using your noggin a little more is required. Only thing I wish different about my job is we have two doors on the building."
good,"My First every job, I had so much fun and learning at this Job. I felt like I fit in and was a team member from the first day. The guest made it even better when they would come in shop."

good,I would recommend anybody to apply they are a awesome company and they care about their employees. flexible schedule and they care about their customers as well
good,It was a great place to work till they changed up management and changed alot of things. They suck now horribly. I went to another job that was the end of that

good,"I enjoyed the people in my work space, everyone has there own problems everyday.  I come in and keep my problems at home and try my best to make everyone around me happy and if I can't do that I try to make them smile.

good,A typical day at Cracker Barrel was also a great way to start off. I learned how to address serious problems. Management was also happy to see their employees and make sure they have a good shift. The work place was very country and relaxing. The hardest part was trying to make every guest happy due to guest wanting certain tables when other guest had the table. The most enjoyable part of working at Cracker Barrel was walking through the door and being greeted by the other employees.
good,"Working there was easy, especially if you have some experience with retail.  Don’t be afraid to ask question, even if it seems like a silly question. Better to do it correctly with the right information then to do it not knowing and it be wrong. It’s easy to move up, at least to gain stars on your apron."
good,I like working there. They are very flexible with my busy schedule. The management is nice to be around. The environment is nice to be around. The guests are very polite.
good,Cracker Barrel was by far the best job I've ever worked. The customers were like family. The co-workers helped when you were overwhelmed. I made a lot of tips there and I miss working there.

good,"Youll always stay busy at cracker barrel. great pay, and very southern. youre on your feet alot no matter what. lots of work but definitely not a hard job to do at all."
good,Working at Cracker Barrel was a great experience. The Scheduling just didnt fit with mine and it was sort of hectic. Overall the job was easy and kept a smile on my face to see the customers pleased.
good,"Really fun! They were really flexible with my hours because of school and softball, coworkers were very friendly. Overall a very nice place to work!!!"
good,"Crackerbarrel is hard work. You take orders and wait tables, only to solely rely on the tips that other people give you. The job and the people I work with/ waitress for are amazing, it’s just a lot of work for so little pay."
good,"I've been with this company for 2+ years and although it can be a very stressful place to work, the tight-knit staff community and tips are worth it. At my particular store I make very good money for the hours I work - ranging from 3-10 hour shifts. It's easy to get ""promoted"" (earn more stars), you get a great discount on food and retail items, and the staff environment is very team-player oriented. Everyone tries to help everyone out 24/7. I've had some tough experiences with this job, but the pros outweigh the cons for me. Lastly, management is extremely flexible with your schedule, requested days off, and will always welcome a request for more hours if you need the extra money."
good,I worked with good people good managers good food money is not bad you can get promoted within three months and a raise I worked with some good people meet nice customers
good,A typical work day I would go in sit before my shift and get ready. I would hit the grill line and start working cooking orders as they came in work was pretty steady

good,I have been working for this company for 7 years. They really care for their employees and are flexible. Definitely recommend this employer for anyone that is looking for a long time career or even a part time job.
good,"Cracker barrel is fast paced, you've got several different managers at any given time, they were very helpful about jumping in to help when need be. It's very hectic ."
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel is fun. We get our job done while having fun, we all help one another. It can get stressful at times but there is wonderful management and they usually help you out."
good,"Great place to work. Meet alot of different people.employees are team players. Managers actually step up and work.its very diverse. The food is great. We have many guests that return over and over. Alot of people like to rent the books on audio for car trips. We have alot of unique gifts. Something for everyone. We also sell nostalgic candy and soda, which is a favorite for many."
good,It a lot to learn and help out to do around the store. It a restaurant and a store it had retail in there also so a lot to move around and decorate and also got to help guest and cashier and fold and pick up stuff around the store
good,"Fun people to work with, if you like people; you'll really like working there. The guests and co-workers make it feel like it's NOT a job.  It really was a joy to work at Cracker Barrel."
good,"It is not as hard to keep a job there as it used to be. I worked at a few different stores and there should not have been differences.  However,  it was very different."
good,"Cracker Barrel is a good company that offers flexible hours, especially for students in school, and every time a star is added to your apron, you get a raise."
good,"Good place to work, need more hours. Management is on top of thier game. Train people very well. They need to give more hrs, other than that it is a excellent place to work."
good,Working at Cracker Barrel is wonderful except for management. They expect way too much out of the workers. People have been quitting because of how the management has been acting.
good,"All coworkers get along with each other at Cracker Barrel. Management is great, customers are usually kind and easy to talk to. However there will be days where some customers may be rude/disrespectful, but it's easy to handle. We handle busses well too, even when nearly 100 people come in."
good,"No matter where you go in the US, if it’s Cracker Barrel they seem to maintain that home friendly environment. It was something to enjoy even as an employee, and made me always feel at home and like I was hosting guest not clients."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Job has it pros and cons as every job does.  Management is very nice and makes it a great place to work.  Hours could be more but its a part time job.
good,"The job I was to do was clearly explained and I was trained for long enough for me to completely understand and get comfortable in doing the job. Managers were good letting me know if I needed to improve in any areas, without making me feel inferior as a worker. The hardest part of the job was moving some of the heavy equipment, but the best part was having the independence to complete the job based on self-belief of the best sequence to get a positive result."
good,"Although all cracker barrel retail managers were required to perform"
good,"Training is great. They provide you training through a computer for 3 days, then they put you with a server trainer for 3 shifts. The employees are all nice and helpful. The management is also very friendly and helpful. Definitely suggest this as a place to work as a waiter or waitress."
good,"As a food server I performed a variety of tasks, from preparing the food, stocking supplies, serving, charging people for their food, handling cash, credit cards, and a cash register, cleaning tables and counters, resetting tables, greeting customers and answering questions."
good,"A typical day at work was sometimes boring, but also sometimes stressful. I learned better customer service and leadership. The management was overall kind of disorganized, however, my manager was excellent. The workplace culture was upbeat and fun for the most part. The hardest part of the job was making sure duties were fulfilled while taking care of customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to see smiling faces every day."
good,"At least at my store, the managers really care about you and help you out. The retail team helps each other out tremendously every day and everyone is friendly. The guests are usually polite and nice as well, but of course there are exceptions as with anywhere you work. Not too stressful except on busy days like Sunday mornings when you can barely walk through the store since there are so many people. But it is also not too boring, there is always something to do. Raises happen every time you advance in the PAR system and can get added to your pay occasionally as you continue working there. Christmas bonus for PAR 4s include a $100 Cracker Barrel giftcard. 50 % off meals any day that you are working and 35% discount on to-go orders or items in the store. Great working culture and meetings with the team and managers are productive."
good,"I work at Store 77 in Lexington, Ky. My experience at Cracker Barrel has been overall great. The management team at my store is probably the closest thing to profection you will find at any company. This is the only job I have had that I feel that my voice matters even to those of higher authority than me. Although laid back and understanding, they still prioritize the company first. It is nice to feel like you work for a successful company and still feel like you matter to them as an employee. The amount of hours you’re given depends mostly on how much you are willing to work, and of course depending on how busy the restaurant is. Hourly positions are a little harder to get a 40 hour work week, but I oftentimes still get between 20-25 even during slower periods. When I was serving I easily worked 40 hour work weeks. Due to being part time I’m not sure about the benefits, but other employees of the company seem to be very satisfied with the benefits. Only downfall to this job honestly is the uniforms, which you are made aware of the standards during training. This comes with working at an old country store. It is safe to say the good of this job outweighs the bad. This job has become more of a family to me. I feel like I’m at home when I’m at work. Our store does a great job of providing not only a great guest experience, but a great experience for employees as well. The thought of ever having to leave this place truly makes me sad. You will work with a great group of people at Cracker Barrel."
good,Working at Cracker Barrel is fun and I enjoy assisting every customer I coe in contact with. The kids are the highlight of my shift and how they enjoy the toys on the toy wall
good,I personally enjoyed Cracker Barrel. I am very picky about food and I have NO complaints about the way Cracker Barrel prepared/stored their food. Would highly suggest eating there!
good,"It's truely a wonderful job. It has that 'at home with family's feel to it. Coworkers are great, customers are great. I don't have a single complaint about my time at Cracker Barrel."
good,"Operating the entire restaurant with the help of 2-3 managers and a staff of up to 40 employees per shift. Making sure my employees are working to beyond standards and making sure the food is great and the guest are having the best experience we can offer.  I learned so much from Cracker Barrel over the years. The concepts of this company are wonderful from how the consistency of our product from store to store and the overall guest experience is and how we monitor each and every aspects of these ideals. The knowledge Cracker Barrel offers as a concept is endless to me. The workplace culture is very strict and structured and I love it that way.  The hardest part of the job is the demand for long hours and weeks, it kept me away from my family and my children as they were at a young age while I was employed at Cracker Barrel.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the guest and driving a wonderful guest experience for them."
good,Working at crackel Barrell being a dishwasher is like herding cattle I can't stand it I do not like it and I will find another job I would not recommend it to anybody.
good,Best management training program in the industry. Self paced(If previous associate Management experience you can finish in 6 months to one year to reach GM opportunities).
good,"My first customer service position, and was well worth it. Cracker Barrel taught me how to work with people at high paced volumes. Perfect first job, as it teaches you how to work with public along with assisting your co workers."
good,"Cracker Barrel exceeded my expectations in far as culture and the quality of Managers. Each Manager works just as hard as co-workers and are promoted from within, which means they know how it is to start at an entry level positon. Our GM was also excellent at his job."
good,"I love my job at Cracker Barrel! The other employees are nice and helpful and will help you anytime you ask! Customers are somewhat rude and have no manners to the public eye but you can’t change anyone’s attitude or personality. The management is great, except for one particular manager who doesn’t really care to help and gets irritated when you make a mistake."
good,I loved working for this company. The energy and vibe was very youthful and cheerful as well as the managers always looked out for your best interest to grow in the company workplace and help you succeed.
good,Very nice place to work good managers and GM very quick interview process and always make sure there employees are taken care of. But very busy all the time.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Pleasant work environment, most associates are team players and happy to help customers and fellow employees, management communication is up to par, clean and fun place to work!!"
good,Cracker Barrel is a good place to work at . It’s just that if your a minor you can only work so many hours and you might not even work the days you signed up to work .
good,"As a server you have to deal with people. Not always nice people. Your fellow servers are a great bunch. I don't plan on leaving fully when I graduate just because the management and staff are some of the best people I have ever met. If you can multi-task and keep up, the money can be good."
good,They truly care about you as a person but have trouble remembering what you ask of them when scheduling you. Will schedule around someone else if you dont get along with them
good,A typical day at work is fast paced and very loud. I learned great people skills. Management will work with you to make sure your work experience there is a positive one. The hardest part would be were open 364 days of the year. The only day were closed is Christmas day. the most enjoyable part  is the friendships you'll have with co-workers and your regulars.
good,"I absolutely loved working for Cracker Barrel, I  knew some people who have been there for more than 10 years. My managers were nice and understanding under some circumstances. The hours were pretty great, especially around the holidays, I got over time very year. I made very good money working there, I loved how fast paced it was, most of the time the guests were very nice, the mangers helped out, co workers helped each other in a bind. Only bad thing was, you didnt get to leave at the time your schedule said."
good,"I loved working as a server here, everyone worked really well together on the floor. The guests we served were usually always a pleasure to take care of. I have nothing bad to say about this place."
good,"Had 5 managers, 2 shift leaders, 1 retail manager and an administrative assistant. Great team and great company to work for. GM's would go to corporate for two weeks every year to retrain and give feed back. Played golf with other managers while there. Great culture and company to work for."
good,I enjoyed my time working at Cracker Barrel. All of my front of house managers were great to work with and for. I loved the flexible scheduling they offered with my school schedule while i was attending.
good,I've been employed with the company for years. The staff are like family. The atmosphere is relaxing at times but if you've worked there for years the same routine can be one boring for some.
good,I really enjoyed serving meeting and taking care of others at a fast pace was what I really enjoyed. Everyone helped each other including management. We were a team and we all worked together and made it happen.
good,"A day as a host at cracker barrel"
good,"enjoy all the customers the kitchen team is awesome and the servers are great the team environment is the best yet"
good,Once you learn the work it becomes routine. If you are a person who loves what you do this is the place for you. Everyone is friendly and helpful. This place has less or no drama than the average restaurant kitchen.
good,Good company to work for. Really enjoy leadership and ability to handle multiple employees. Very flexible schedule but should provide health benefits to full time employees.
good,"A great place to work for family members"
good,It was so much fun working with these people. The college students there was so friendly. Mangers always willing to help by clearing tables and taking order.
good,I enjoyed working there through college. It was usually easy to get off for school related activities when necessary. It was a very active job that requires good social skills.
good,I loved working at Cracker Barrel. There was no set breaktime but everyone worled together to make sure that everyone got a chance to sit down and eat and smoke if they did.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"We all get along great for the most part.  When it gets tough and we ""bark and growl at each other like a pack of wolves"". See what I did there haha. We don't see eye to eye but at the end of the day we know we did what we had to get things running smoothly."
good,"The first thing you're going to hear is ""Welcome to Cracker Barrel!"" with the biggest smile. After a warm greeting you'll find yourself dazzled by all the nick-nack toys and trinkets. Everything is really a warm southern wonderful feeling."
good,"flexible hours, learn sale techniques, friendly place to work, management cares about your needs and time off if needed. fast pace environment always something to do."
good,cracker barrel was a great first job i was young so i could only work 4 hour shifts sometimes theyd let me clock out and come back to work a little later. the staff was always fun very interesting group of people. my managers were very nice they actually cared about their employees. while it was very fast paced i was always happy while working
good,"Professional atmosphere, fun place to work, friendly employees and management. Flexible hours, great customers. Great food, and products. Training is excellent. Great open door policy."
good,It is very good place to but it can get challenging at times.The people I we o etat k is very nice .and had very good time work it was my first job and I have learn alot
good,"work mates treat you like family, some management I feel is "" too comfortable"" and will treat you depending on their mood, flexible hours and great over all environment"
good,I worked at Cracker Barrel for 6 years and loved it mostly. It is a fast paced job with lots of employees. Management is quick to pitch in to offer assistance in times of rushes and try to be as accommodating as they can with staffing time off for 100+ employees. Would work there again!
good,Overall Cracker Barrel is a great place to work and be able to coach staff by having fun.  The culture is one of family oriented life.  Great bonuses.
good,It was my very first job so they were very patient with me as being a first time worker. They helped me with the development of customer service. Easy place to work at
good,This job really taught me about discipline and the importance of planning. A typical day at work involves following the set principles to ensure that every guest is pleased. It just so happens that the environment also provides the staff an enjoyable place to work. All parts of the kitchen get a long which is important to communicate efficiently.
good,This is one of the best companies I have ever worked for. They truly care about there employed and the believe that the guest experience should never exceed the employee experience.
good,"Everyday at work was a great day, I met new people and learn to be a better leader. I felt like I achieved something everyday at work and my coworkers and managers were proud of me for that. Everyone called me DeeDe and told me I was sweet and so caring."
good,"From Management down I was made welcome, fantastic place to work."
good,It was a fun place to work. I was working two jobs at the time so I didn’t get many hours at Cracker Barrel when I worked there. I didn’t get paid much being a hostess.
good,Crackel Barrel is a great job and place to work . Everyone there is nice . There’s a lot of smiling faces . They never show you bad vibes . As a hostess the pay was very goo . I made $9.75 an hour . I wish i never quitted .
good,Working for Cracker Barrel has been a life changing experience. It pushed me harder than anything else has. I am currently working there sporadically due to my role at Zaxby's. I would love to stay and work for Cracker Barrel however the current title I hold would be the highest and I wish for more responsibility.
good,"learned how to go to any measures to please people, loved all my managers, Team members were amazing I can actually say I made friends there, steady pace work environment"
good,"Very hectic and very busy you’d have to be on your toes at all times, managers are great but don’t like slackers, so don’t apply for this position if you can’t work your tail off."
good,Fast pace but gets the job done I love the work place just moved to Clarksdale and need another job for my responsibilities I have to take of but will recommend the job to anyone very flexible hours and will work around your schedule
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Most highly rated, reviewed, and evaluated Cracker Barrel in its respective region. Management ran a flawless operation, fellow servers were supportive and friendly, and everything ran like clockwork."
good,"A typical day consists of a number of duties from working at the register to organizing the retail floor, unloading the truck, organizing the back store room, greeting guests when they come and telling them good-bye when they leave, and helping guests."
good,fast paced environment friendly atmosphere.great management team most of the management. good team players amongst co workers. when you have a problem in scheduling managers try their best to accommodate you
good,"I really liked working for Cracker Barrel. It was a very good work environment and I really liked my co-workers and management. There was ample room for advancement. If you work hard, it is appreciated and rewarded."
good,"In all cracker barrel was a great place to work, my day consisted of cooking orders made to order as needed, cleaning and doing any prep work that was necessary. I learned how to to be very adequate and precise with how and what I cook, work in a team enviroment. The management team was very supportive and would jump right in to help if needed. And the enviroment was awesome to work in, I would definitely recommend cracker barrel as a great place to work."
good,"Amazing restaurant with good values. good first job for anyone who wants people skills, problem management skills or whoever wants to go into the Hospitality/Culinary field."
good,"While this was a fast paced environment, it paid well, and we got along like a family. Never a dull moment and many opportunities to advance or work in a different area"
good,Can be a little demanding but not too hard. Nice managers and got along with fellow Cracker Barrel coworkers. Hardest part was no breaks or sitting down for several hours.  Most enjoyable was discounts on food.
good,I enjoyed working with cracker barrell and the customers. I’ve  also enjoyed being taught protocol and cashier management. Stocking the shelves and wiping down pumps.
good,"Cracker Barrell was my place of employment for over 10 years.  I enjoyed working there and had great friends who worked with me.  Management was reasonable and helpful.  I would have stayed with them, except for the move to Pace required me to find work closer to my new house."
good,I highly recommend Cracker Barrel such a beautiful and nice place to work at. Sometimes it gets crazy but there’s always a good  amount of staff. Enjoy
good,"A typical day as a Cracker Barrel host consists of:  Setting up the floor plan as it may change, seating customers on rotation while communicating with the customers their needs as well,  I've learned team work and understanding how to meet servers and customers needs.  "
good,"Cracker Barrel was a nice and calm work place with with some upbringing challenges. My days as a dish washer where busy with little time to take a break. At first experience it a lot to take in with fast pace of cleaning the dishes that the staff and cooks need to provide them. It's a job experience  that teaches you how to manage your time, movement flow, thought process, and focus. It also help you to communicate with others and with the management. Its a working place that rewards hard workers on their job and skills on how to handle in any type of situation. Plus is a friendly environment for all the employees and customers alike."
good,Great place to work. Culture and environment excellent is great. The company is always looking to improve and provide excellent training and personal development
good,Over all good place to work. Many benefits. The only issue is the amount of side work required. I do understand that servers do not  tip out and that is the reason. Rolling less than 150 pieces of silverware would be nice.
good,"Cracker Barrel's mission is ""Pleasing People"" and I learned a great deal about how to achieve their goal. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with the guests and my co-workers."
good,The Barrel was a fun place to work at that taught me a lot about myself. My coworkers became like family and were very supportive about my deciding to switch jobs.  The management was very understandable and worked with life/work balancing.
good,"A typical day as a server is much different as a typical day as a host. The servers start off rolling silverware. Depending how much was used during the last shift, the amount of silverware can vary, however, it's no more than two tubs, which can hold around four rows of fourteen or fifty-six silverware total. If during the rolling process they get a table or have food that appears in the window, we take care of that first. As a server, you learn a multitude of skills such as greeting with a smile, being kind and polite, and most importantly trying to find a balance between tables. It's certainly hard when guests get impatient, but if you find the right rhythm, you can bounce out of any situation, even the hard ones. The management team has been very understanding especially if there are conflicts with your schedule. They do their best to try to fix it so there will be no complications in the future. As a host, you have less to worry about with guests, at least face to face. Most of the time, you're guiding them around the place trying to seat them in the right spot. The hardest part of the job, in my opinion, is trying to assist with cleaning the Water Closet as well as assist guests during a rush period. It can be quite frustrating when you have to clean the water closet as well as seat people to their proper tables."
good,The company always tries to improve itself. And it gives you a lot of opportunities to grow within the company and get raises. You can also work in different sections of the restaurant.
good,"Its a very good start off job for anyone looking for work. They pay good, the food is great, and they have awesome good service with excellent hospitality."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel has been fantastic for me, it is a very friendly atmosphere, everyone is very nice and always willing to help."
good,Love the people and the holidays is my favorite because of all the different unique items in the store. I always love the kids apparel and the clearance. They food is always good and home made like hour granny would made Sunday dinner after church.
good,This is a great place to work to get yourself back on the go! Plenty of work opportunities and positions of one doesn't quite peak your interest. Your job is always guaranteed here.
good,"I would come in on a morning and get the store ready..."
good,"Being a server here is probably one of the most fun jobs I've ever had. It wasn't like a typical serving job. while working here, you and the other servers become like a family, you depend on each other to make sure the guests are happy and to make sure everything flows well. Yeah there are bad days, that is any job, but the fun you will have here with both employees and guests more than makes up for it."
good,"Everyone there is very nice and easy to get along with, and everyone respects everyone else. Great as a first job, they have exceptional training and do a good job preparing you for working there as well as other places"
good,"Typical day at Cracker Barrel is going in, rolling silverware, serving guests, doing your side work and leaving. I learned that the better the server you are the more money you will make. The hardest part of the job was having rude guests. The most enjoyable part of the job was making new friends."
good,"great company, good benefits, treat their employees very well. Offer Insurance, opportunity for advancement, birthday and Christmas gifts, offer bonuses, healthy environment for employees. Training available and made to do by every employee. Management is trained well."
good,This company cracker barrel was a outstanding company to work for. They're always there for  you when you need help. The team is great as well everyone works together to make there moto come true which is pleasing people.
good,"LOVED working at Cracker Barrel! I started out as a full time server, and later cross-trained into working as a host, prep cook, cashier, and retail person. The people I worked with were awesome, and the management was really good at making each job fun by doing things like contests and giving out prizes. Like any job, you'll probably have to deal with a bad manager or two, but from my experience, upper management is pretty good about getting rid of managers who do not meet their standards. Great opportunities for advancement and raises! If you like talking to customers and you like to get to know your coworkers, I highly suggest working here! Best job I've had so far! I only left because I was working 2 jobs (about 50-60 hours a week) and going to school full time, so I had to drop something, and since my other job was in my field of study, I quit Cracker Barrel. Regretting that now."
good,Great Job if you want a part time job. Earn discounts and paid time off. Flexible schedule. Relaxed work environment. Great people to work with. More like family.
good,"Working at Cracker Barrel has helped me develop great skills, and employment team that's works as a family. The management team always works with your schedule and needs."
good,one of the best places i have ever worked it was an evironment where you are allowed to thrive at whatever you are doing. The work is fast paced but everything is planned out perfectly
good,"Cracker Barrel was my first serving job and I never expected to be sad to leave. On the contrary, it was so hard to say goodbye because of the wonderful people I worked with. Everyone was always so friendly, loving and encouraging."
good,"I loved working for this company. They provide so many opportunities for you to grow with the company and really make a life career with them. I also loved being cross trained throughout the restaurant, front of house as well as back of house."
good,"I loved working here, it was always something new each day. It was a friendly environment. The customers were always so kind and loving. It was like one big family. The only stressful time was around lunch or dinner when it was very crowded but it was worth it."
good,"Très bon restaurant , l'équipe est très sympa  et le management très bien"
good,"A typical day of work at Cracker Barrel consists of ensuring each guest is satisfied with their meal while providing knowledge of merchandise to be able to ad a little extra to their day. Also, ensuring each guest has paid and to conduct various monetary transaction fairly, effectively, and efficiently. All employees are almost like family and all get along with each other, which makes the workplace that much more fun to work in. The management are serious, but at the same time they undertaken employee needs and frequently ask about our lives and if we are ok. The hardest part of the job i would say is managing both the Retail Sales Floor while conducting monetary transactions. You cannot do both at the same time and potentially lose a guest sale if performing cash operations. The most Enjoyable part of the job is working with all kinds of people and ensuring the they co happy and leave happy without any problems."
good,"The company provides a lot for it's workers, and attempts to take care of them long-term.They have a really cool program; you can choose to donate a small part of your pay to a company fund used to help employees in need, for example those who have recently lost a loved one and need to pay bills temporarily, or people who lost their house in a fire."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Overall a wonderful place to work. I learned how to manage my time as well as my money. Made lots of friends. Learned a lot about life and how things work. would recommend working there to any of my friends or co-workers at other jobs. Very professional and laid back business.
good,All employees are friendly and work together as a team. When we are busy I am normally the one to jump in and help in any department I am trained in. I take pride in this company because they treat their employees with dignity and respect.
good,Good place to work and can get really good paid and advantages the longer you work there. It is stressful but that comes with the job but overall the environment is good.
good,Cracker Barrel is a wonderful restaurant and it does a fantastic job when training someone.  I really loved working there because we all worked together as a team.
good,Great job and great people to work around and it's really easy and everything runs smooth the only bad thing is getting a bunch of hours because they hire so many people all the time
good,If you love to eat there as a family then you'll love working there. Has great management and good quality staff. Always a clean and neat environment.
good,"A typical day at work consists of collecting the dirty dishes, putting them in the trays, pushing them through the industrial washing machine, filling the washing machine with more soap when needed, mopping the floors, taking out the trash, and at some times if you are needed, bussing tables.  (Cleaning dirty tables.)  I learned that time management is a well-needed skill for any job - especially this one.  Management treated me very well, and they were flexible with working hours.  Workplace culture is diverse, which is excellent.  You meet many new people and have the opportunity to make long-lasting friendships.  The hardest part of the job is making sure you have cleaned every single dish perfectly.  You must keep up with the fast-paced environment, especially around 5:00 in the evening.  The most enjoyable part of the job was again, meeting new people and creating new friendships.  After all, the dishwashers all work together as a team - so it's tough not to mingle!"
good,Fun place to work. Really enjoyed the managers and coworkers. Fast paced and lots of team work. Friendly customers all the time. Lots of regular customers
good,"A great team atmosphere with numerous opportunities to find whatever position worked best for you as a person. Managers were quite hands on and the staff was always willing to assist any other member of the crew without fail. The customers came to know you by name, as did you the customers and it made the experience of working there all the more rewarding."
good,"Great place for college students. Managers are amazing! Typical day at ""The Barrel"" is pleasing people and putting guests before tasks. Hardest part would be making ""every"" guests happy. Some people are just in a bad mood or just would rather not be spoken to. Most enjoyable part you meet a lot of people rather they are employees or guest coming in and out the store."
good,"It's a really great place to work, the people are awesome, but sometimes the managers have their own view of things. Like one will want us to set up a Withdrawl, and another doesn't want us to. So it gets very frustrating."
good,"I veorked there for 10 yrs. Loved the guest, employees the money. I couldn't be happier. We get a manager that weeded out the long term employees & brought his own in. He wanted pretty, skinny, tight pants, & flirty"
good,"great teamwork and multitasking skills"
good,"What I like about my job is dealing with our guests, anticipating their needs and solving problems. Good training and management. Flexible schedules, workplace culture, team work."
good,"Excellent management, great guests both internal and external. Great people to work with all-around, i'd definitely recommend any position with Cracker Barrel Old Country Store. Their commitment to Please People is clearly visible and their commitment to quality service is astounding. I would highly recommend Cracker Barrel Old Country Store both as a workplace and as a dining establishment that stays true to its country fresh roots while providing excellent service."
good,"The only problem I have with Cracker Barrel would be the lack of hours for students, such as myself, during slow season. The management, environment, and employees are absolutely amazing and I couldn't ask for better people to work with. I learned a lot about how to diffuse harsh situations between guests and staff, and how to do my best to meet the guests needs and expectations."
good,Cracker Barrel has been a wonderful experience. I've learned the importance of organization and how to adapt in work situations. The best thing about my job is connecting with regulars and building relationships with the community.
good,Each customer that comes in can surprise you with funny things. It is a very family orientated place that like to make each guest feel at home no matter how far away they are from home.
good,"I enjoyed working there.. the training program was great, and the environment was amazing.. the managers were always doing whatever they could to help their employees during their shifts.. they don't care to get in the action with everyone else and do whatever is necessary to make the shifts as easy and smooth for everyone as possible.. the pay was great and the servers made very good money"
good,i love the job and the people i worked with. i also love working around with people and the guest. the workplace is great place to work. and to have a family dinner.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Such a great first job to have and very fun. Management is very lenient with availability. A great experience in the work place and just the overall restaurant as a guest.
good,It's a great family oriented place! The food and managers are outstanding. They always make sure that you feel comfortable with your schedules and your co-workers.
good,Stayed for over 10 years. Enjoyed working for the company. Life changes is the only reason I had to let it go or I'd still be there. My husband past away and needed to take time to be with our 4 year old son at the time. I am rehireable with them. Worked in more than one store also.
good,"Cracker Barrel is, hands down, one of the best companies I've ever worked for. The management is great! Same for the pay and benefits. The only down side to this specific location is the lack of nesassary cooks meaning that the few cooks we do have are forced to work endless hours with close to no chance for time off even in time of medical emergencies."
good,Cracker Barrel is a very established company. Great benefits and compensation. Very professional and standards are high. Established and systems are great!
good,"Over the five years that I have worked for Cracker Barrel, I have learned many ways of handling customer service complaints and issues.  I have learned a lot from the management staff and other employees on how to communicate effectively with others."
good,Cracker Barrel was my first job outside of my prior experience from family business I loved the enviorment it was welcoming and always a special feeling to the restaurant it self I enjoyed workin in such a fun enviorment.

good,I loved working there and appreciate how the management treated their employees. I would have stayed if I made more money and if I worked full time.
good,"co-workers were friendly, the best parts were the customers and making them happy! hardest part was the long hours, I learned how to open the  grill line and close it for the night"
good,I've worked here for almost 7 years. It has been a very good job and has been able to keep my bills and life balanced. I have gotten many of my friends on at Cracker Barrel who are now Managers with the company.
good,"I gave the Benefits section 3 stars because I was still on my parent's insurance at this point so don't know what the benefits were. Other than that, I loved working for Cracker Barrel. The management was awesome and was willing to work with your schedule if you were in school."
good,"Managers are friendly, and extremely caring about your personal needs. Family can work together, and they have a plan where if someone in your family dies, or is stuck in a hurricane or tornado, or something tragic happens, they help with payment."
good,"As soon As you walk through the door your dressed and ready for work with a smile on your face. Stand the the podium, smile on your face and greet guest and seat them, while informing them of the feature of the day and to whom their server would be. the management was awesome and co workers were cool. then again their were like 10 of us pregnant at the time so we were all ""emotional roller-coasters"" but all management, co-workers and higher office management made the employees feel just as welcomed as our guests. the hardest part of being a hostess is trying to please every large party ground that came in and the most enjoyable part of my job was working the weekends and always having other hostesses to talk to and having such an amazing Management team."
good,i am a server and cook. i work with an awesome group of people all from different backgrounds. the management staff is amazing and very helpful. this job has taught me the importance of being diverse on all sides of the business and how each person is connected to the next.
good,I enjoy working at Cracker Barrel during the summer and during the breaks in the school year. They pay excellent and the people there are so genuine and kind. I do enjoy their food as well. I think that the most enjoyable part of my job is getting to work with others that are hard working as well.
good,I really love my job. The only thing that becomes annoying is the lack of initiative seen in some newer employees. I love getting to know the customers and we have some of the sweetest regulars around.
good,I've been here since 2012 and I truly enjoy being a server.  I enjoy the different ages and cultures that I come across on a daily basis. I have met some very unique customers and have made some very good  friends.

good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Great teamwork. Greating everyone. Assisting shopping needs and providing wonderful experience. Pricing and doing displays. Gift wrapping. Getting to be creative and knowledgeable about everything.
good,A typical day was non-stop and I learned to cook varieties of meals at the same time. Management was professional and co-workers were great team players. The hardest part was not having enough cooks on the line and the most enjoyable part was knowing that I did my job and made many people happy.
good,A typical day at work is great.  We have are a team and we have great managers.  The most enjoyable part of my job is greeting and assisting the customers on a daily basis.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of my being paired with an elementary student and he / she and I would find a quiet place to work together individually. We would converse shortly about how their day had gone so far before we would begin our educational activities and exercises for the day. My job was to listen to the student read and aid them in making corrections; to go over spelling words and aid the students in learning how to incorporate their words into full and complete sentences with correct punctuation and grammar; to play educational games that encouraged the student to apply their reading and writing and spelling skills in order to complete the game and to win a treat or a prize upon completion. "
good,I like cracker barerel its just some times it would be nice if they can routate peopl on the weekend I dont want to have t work every weekend especially sundays.

I have learned the value of pleasing people and love working to ensure guests have phenomenal customer service. I love the challenge of working in a fast paced environment and have thoroughly enjoyed my tenure with Cracker Barrel."
good,They sold me on the culture of the company.  Getting it to be a real life thing is something that the whole management team needs to work on.
good,"On a normal day we were well caught up and the work seemed to fly by, I learned how to work as a team and that every job is important in every work place."
good,A typical day at cracker barrel involves a whole bunch of laughs and many smiles. I would work there my whole life if the money was better. I have a second family there. When I go to work it feels like im somewhere with my friends because I have so much fun.
good,"In retail, it is pretty nice. We all get along well and work together to ensure the guest have the best experience possible. I have learned break away statements and how to better engage with the guest. Management at Cracker Barrel is very fair and consistent. They work with you to the best of their ability. The hardest part of the job is that we do not receive enough hours to live off of. They most enjoyable part of my job is that in retail we are able to really have genuine conversations with the guests and are able to have fun."
good,I really enjoyed meeting all the different people that came to dine. I loved working with my co-workers. It always seemed like one big happy family.
good,"What I like most about working at Cracker Barrel is helping customers find what they want or need. Whether they are shopping for a baby shower or wedding present, I can usually find what they are looking for and then take it a set further and wrap the gift for them and help them find the perfect card to go with it. I take pride in my work and that is what shows where ever you work. My co-workers and I work well as a team to make our customers happy and introduce them to new merchandise almost every month. I love talking with customers and finding out where they are from and where they are going. I have customers that have come in from England and France, that just love shopping in a Cracker Barrel because of the unique items that we carry. The retail manager is always there to help run the floor or help with the cash line. She is great at working a flexible schedule too."
good,"A typical work day consisted of stocking and preparing for shift rush and making sure that every guests needs were taken care of, even if you were not their server. I learned how to have exceptional communication skills with the face to face interaction with each individual guest. I would acknowledge children, before parents and treat them as if they were young adults just like their parents. I did not have management experience here and enjoyed it. My co-workers were very team oriented and communication skills were a must in the fast paced rushes we all faced. The hardest part of the job was being able to break my own barrier of the face to face interaction, but once it was broke I was more comfortable talking to the public than I have ever been."
good,"I loved my job at Cracker Barrel because we were one big family. There was drama, but there was love and respect as well. The job was one I could look forward to actually going to."
good,"Go to work..make really great money have a great night with everyone,have a great visit with guests."
good,"I worked at Cracker Barrel for five years, as a hostess, waitress, prep cook, and ""red apron"" trainer. It is hands down the most enjoyable job I've ever had. You'll meet people from all over the country, and all over the world, since it's very popular with travelers. You'll get the opportunity to cross train into multiple positions, which provides great experience, and moving up to management is not the impossible dream."
good,"A typical day at work is making sure your guests are attended to and taken care of during your whole shift. Also, we make sure our table sections are clean and the whole restaurant is taken care of. What I learn on a daily basis is how to become a better server. The management is great when you need someone to talk to or if you are in need of help with something. The hardest part of my job is making sure the correct food is on the tray before entering the dinning room to the correct table. Most of the time, either they receive the wrong plate of food or they are missing something from their plate. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with others and satisfying my guest's needs."
good,The joy of working for Cracker Barrel provided an opportunity on a daily basis to WOW the guests with outstanding service and ensure their absolute satisfaction not just for that visit but to encourage future visits as repeat guests.

good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,At Cinemark I would serve customers their concessions in a timely fashion. I have learned how to work in a fast paced environment and also to work quite efficiently with a team of people. The management was excellent and were very helpful when needed and also firm when it came to enforcing company policy or reprimanding employees. My co-workers were an excellent bunch of people. They were always very friendly and very helpful. The hardest part of the job was the time crunch when it was really but it became more manageable with experience. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with such an amazing group of people.
good,"i was a cashier so i welcomed guest to the restaurant. answered any questions they may have had. also if they had trouble finding an item i would call a fellow employee from retail who wasn't busy and let them know of the item the customer is having trouble finding and they would then lead the guest to where the item was. the restaurant was right next to a major high was the most enjoyable parts of this job was getting to meet so many different people from different places. I also loved watching the children and there parents looking through the store and hearing the parents tell the kids about all the things we had there be it candy or memorabilia or toys and how certain candy's that were there were the same candy's they had eaten when they were little or how those were the kinds of toys they played with when they were little, or pointing out different things that where hanging around the store and telling them that they used the washing board to do their laundry when they were growing up and that they didn't have washing machines back then or they were really expensive and their parents couldn't afford them. pointing out the old fashioned bikes and how those were what the bikes looked like when they were the same age as their kids. then seeing the kids awestruck at there parents. one little boy who was about 7 said something that made me smile. he looked at his mom and dad after they showed him toys they played with when they were little. i remember her turned and looked up at both his parents with a confused look on his face and said ""you were as little as me before? His"

good,"I walk into work with a positive attitude! I know with a negative attitude I won't make any money or provide the best customer service possible. I treat every customer with a smile and friendly attitude, treating them all equally. I learn not to get discouraged when I don't receive the tip I was expecting after giving the best service I could have. Sometimes a kind word may mean more than any amount of money. My management at Cracker Barrel was great. Managers there didn't think they were too good to take a guest something or do anything that the co-workers did. They were also very understanding and flexible with the schedule as much as possible. I became really good friends with my co-workers, which always makes the job easier as well. We always demonstrated teamwork. The hardest part of my job was working and going to college, but thankfully my managers were helpful when making schedules. I didn't always love going to work of course but for the most part I enjoyed interacting with guests and my co-workers."

I learned so much about customer satisfaction, and making sure that the guests kept coming back. The managers were fantastic, always making sure that the employees and guests were taken care of. The co workers I had were extremely helpful because there was times when I struggled with a transcation and they stepped right in to help me without any issue. The most stressful part of the job was when a bus would come in and all of a sudden the store and resturant were filled with 50-80 people. The best part of my job was the guests that I got to serve and work with every day. They had a positive attitude and that lead me to feel more at ease with them.

good,It’s was a very good job I just had to much going on with transportation.and I also wanted a more well paid job. I also had to get a job more closer to my home.
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"Wonderful job with plenty of money to be made. Fast paced and easy to catch on. Management does change somewhat frequently, but overall I have enjoyed my time."
good,"Honestly I'd rather anybody trying to apply find out themselves, but then this wouldn't be a review. So, you are expected to work MOST to ALL holidays, Thanksgiving is the most difficult unless prepped properly for. Christmas and New Year's are interesting times too. Each day of the week has its own special to serve Lunch and Dinner. Except Tuesday, that is all Meatloaf. "
good,"Employees and the management at Cracker Barrel made it comfortable to go to work, building relationships with others became effortless due to the kindness of others."
good,I had a great time working at Cracker Barrel for almost 2 years. The environment was great and was happy that I picked Cracker Barrel as my first job. Everyone was so nice and they were always happy to see me. The Managers loved me and were always happy when I walked through the door.
good,Servers get pretty good tips. Management is very involved and makes competitions throughout the week to keep employees motivated. There are also plenty of opportunities to move up within the company if you so wish.
good,its a fun enjoyable place to work for and a great place to work for and has great  and i truly   working for them and want mind working for them again
good,"My managers are always willing to work with my schedule so I can work the maximum hours possible. Staff is really friendly, personable, and helpful. They are always changing and putting new policies in place to make sure food safety is put first."
good,"I worked at CB for eight months. I only left to focus on school. The pay was great and there was always the opportunity for a raise/promotion. The hardest part of the job was getting shifts covered. We were a bit understaffed and I worked the closing shifts, so no one ever wanted to cover for me. It made getting sick a bit stressful. It was still a very enjoyable job though. The managers are all great and understanding. If you start out in one position (i.e. waitressing), there is always the chance to cross-train to another position (i.e. hosting)."
good,"Cracker Barrel is a very fun place to work, everyone is always nice and the actual work that needs to be one is usually simple. There are always opportunity to advance and even cross train into different sections of the store."
good,Cracker Barrel has a great environment. They were very welcoming and a great place to make amazing tips and experience every type of culture! Some drama was in the environment.
good,"Enjoyed the people, guest and other employees at Cracker Barrel. Tips were descent and management was a great team to work with when I was there. Would suggest to anyone!"
good,Son buenos companeros uno aprende mucho con ellos y son razonables en cuanto al idioma porque yo nose ablar ingles y ellos me permitoeron usar el celular para el traductor
good,"A great place to start but not a career. Decent on the job training, friendly managers and other staff members. Your day and pay depends on your willingness to work and your attitude."
good,I loved working here. Everyone for the most part was friendly and helpful. the was a great schedule and the pay was just as good. The managers really care about you.
good,A typical day would be taking orders of customers and serving the food to the customers. I learned great social skills and how to work under pressure. The management was great. The culture wasn't limited.
good,"I love Cracker Barrel to be completely honest. We have good food, and the other servers are welcoming. It’s a good home style environment. They strive to make every guest feel welcome."
good,"The work had a typical ebb and flow to it that you learned over time, ie: when the lunch and dinner rush typically started and ended, what days were the busiest (Sundays there were notoriously busy around lunch and dinner times, usually with a lull in the middle, which gave a nice opportunity to catch your breath).  Could definitely get stressful at times, but it's not a hard job to learn, so once you know what needs done and you're willing to just put your head down and go for it, even busy days aren't too rough.  "
good,When you first start it’ll be a good environment but once you’re in there for a good amount of time it drains you. Needs more work but not enough love for workers
good,cracker barrel is the bees knees if you know what you are doing and you stay on your Ps and Qs idk what else to write but hey a job is a job so you gotta get paid doing something productive in life
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I enjoy seeing all the new stock for each display. Helping customers and finding what they are looking for and seeing them filled with joy made me happy. I am forever grateful for the confidence I have gained while working at Cracker Barrel.
good,Its a little old fashioned considering the genre of people the service industry tends to attract but they manage to pull it off well! all around fun place to work
good,I really need this job cause I really never worked at a place of business before so I'm really trying to work on that so that i can be come better at it.
good,"Maintain regular and consistent attendance and punctuality, with or without reasonable accommodation"
good,I enjoyed my stay at this place of business and accredit them to giving me a chance as a server. The work place is fast past and energetic and most of the workers are hard working and amicable. Most of the managers as well are hard working and understanding with the exception of a few who do suffer from inferiority complexes and require your bent ear for their own personal confessional. But that happens everywhere and all in all I would say it was one of the best places I ever had the pleasure of working for.
good,"I really like working here, it's like home. It does get stressful at times but what workplace doesn't? Managment can be great, depending on who becomes your general manager."
good,I worked at the store in Va. about 5 years ago for 3 years. I understand they have changed some of the job descriptions at the restaurants which makes it more stressfull on the employees now. They have merged the restaurant with retail by crossing training employees. They lost quite a few of the older employees when they did this.
good,My experience as a busser/dishwasher at Cracker Barrel was very positive.  They were very flexible with my hours to fit into my school schedule and my fellow employees were all happy to be there which was a very welcome change of pace from my previous maintenance position at a gas station.
good,"I loved working at Cracker Barrel. My coworkers were like my family, and the clientele was very pleasant. I would recommend it to anyone who likes working in a busy and friendly environment"
good,Lots of room to advance and improve on your skills. The company really cares for their employees and I wouldn't work at any other restuaraunt honestly.
good,I loved my job at cracker barren. The people were so nice and the company is designed to help you grow. If I could go back I would.  This is the true definition of a home away from home
good,The company provides good benefits and it works around your schedules for school even if you are still in highschool. They are very considerate for minors and school. They have great first service and work as a team to benefit everyone.
good,"It was just overall fun. all the employees were nice to each other and the management was understanding of employee needs while still making sure that things were getting done. and safely. when i worked there, there was a legitimate effort to keep the place clean. And for a line cook the pay was reasonable and merit based. advancement and growth in the company was encouraged and expected."
good,Been working for Cracker Barrel for over 10 years I love the company is a very good company to work for very flexible with your hours team is wonderful .0
good,Cracker Barrel is a strong and enjoyable company with great profit. I know that if they do or build a location near me I would definitely reapply with this company for long term growth.
good,"This job is a balance of good structure and pleasing people thru interaction.The typical day is spent coaching, hands on and table touching and the atmosphere is conducive to strong management."
good,I love working for them. management is wonderful and works with you. the only down fall of cracker barrel is lack of the hours needed. other than that coworkers are great. training could be a little better as well.
good,"I enjoyed working here and getting to meet tons of different people each day I worked. The location of this company was off from the highway, so it got travelers day by day and hearing the stories they had to share was amazing and it made the workplace just so much more enjoyable to be at."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"I'd come into smiling faces. Everyone else seemed to enjoy being there as well. I met many co workers I could relate to during and outside of work. The best part of being there is probably the people you would be able to work with. The hardest part of the job was when our day was done, restocking and cleaning takes a lot of work but, it's worth it!"
good,I loved working here because it's was a very home away from home experience from the guests to the co workers to the manager every one was great and made coming to work fun
good,"Training new hires, management team was great, learned alot about HR, createing a great training team in all areas of the restaurant and retail store to obtain more knowledgable and tenured employees."
good,"I have been with Cracker Barrel Old Country Store for almost four years. I started as a hostess, then moved to serving and retail associate last May (2017). My typical shifts are during the evening, where we tend to pick up pace for a few hours, and then it is basic cleaning procedures for about an hour or so before the shift ends. I have learned how to communicate with guests using their terms but translating the words into an actual meal or request. Most of the employees are friendly and willing to help a team member out whenever need-be. I do not believe there is a hard part to the job, mainly because it follows the Golden Rule (treat others as you would like to be treated). Menu knowledge can be difficult at first. The most enjoyable part, however, is having guests come back and become regulars for a specific person. It is incredibly rewarding to have guests only want to be served by a specific person."
good,Great Place to work and awesome people. I have worked with Cracker Barrel through a temp agency doing temp jobs and look forward to going to work every morning which is important to me. Every one is so nice and helpful.
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with as well as the guests I served.  Things flowed well during my shifts and I made good money there.  They had plenty of management there and they were great about always making sure we were ok and the guests.
good,"overall working for cracker  barrel helped me learn so much in most areas that i needed to advance in other areas, it was my first job and i loved it."
good,It was a fun place to work at. The people I worked with I thought you great to be around and very positive. So sad I had to end my time with them. But I had to move on to something else.
good,"The management was outstanding , a co-workers husband died while I was working there and all the supervisors took her food , and also money I am pretty sure . They care a lot about the Cracker Barrel employees and it was heart warming to know that I worked for such a great branch . The hardest part of the job was not knowing how much you would bring home each night , some nights I would make pretty good tips ... others not so much and it was very tough with having a small child to take care of and to be a young single mother ."
good,"Fun place to work got to meet new friends and make money at the same time "
good,"From the time I worked at Cracker Barrel I learned alot about the company, how to be more open to the customers. The workplace of Cracker Barrel was always neat and friendly."
good,"Taking guest names, Seating guest, sweep, clean tables off, helping servers to keep guest happy, getting drinks, menus, answering questions,lighting candles"
good,"Walking into work every day, I am always greeted with a smile. My co-workers are productive and hardworking. The shifts are between 6-8 hours, plus side-work and silverware rolling. The management is very good at maintaining a productive kitchen and staying positive."
good,"A typical day at worked included running food and serving guests. However, we all had a fun time doing this. Everyone at the workplace got along well and we all worked well together as a team."
good,"I truly loved my job at Cracker Barrel. Management was fair and willing to work around family events, requested time off, and just generally caring for their staff. The pay was satisfactory but not quite enough to raise a family."
good,Ensured accurate order and production. Customer awareness and remaining friendly. Great place for coworkers to share in one work related goals. Overall great environment to work.
good,"I love working for Cracker Barrel.  The hardest part is making a decision to leave somewhere I enjoy working at.  The decision I'm making is to protect my future with such a great company that I may need later in life in a better state.  All Cracker Barrels are not ran the same, some regions better than others, so I will not let this experience affect the way I feel about the company."
good,"They have benefits, and they care. The manager is very understanding and coworkers are like family. They expect you to work and be on your best behavior. They also will like you to handle things as an adult"
good,"I am a recently new retail employee and I truly enjoy my job! I have an awesome manager with an exuberant smile that I feel truly cares for all of  the employees at my location not just her retail staff. The coworkers I have meet are a pleasure to work with we keep each other upbeat, have a fun working environment and keep that same flow going with our guests! The pay could be better, but an employee has the ability to get four increases in a year based on their individual merits and great opportunities for career advancement!"
good,Even tho it was crazy on weekends. I enjoyed it there. The management was great and I have respect for all of them.i enjoyed the time I was there but unfortunately had to relocate to a different city
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,Cracker Barrel is a very friendly environment. I became very close to employees. Everyone is very funny and friendly. The job can be very stressful and everyone is required to work Thanksgiving and Christmas.
good,"I loved working here, it challenged me to work better than I thought possible. It was quiet stressful at times, but well worth it. I received my first raise within a month, and it turns into sever months, then years, etc. I had amazing managers, cool coworkers and even better customers. The start pay is pretty low, especially for how fast paced Cracker Barrel always is and how much work is done. But it builds character, and there is opportunity for a lot of extra hours."
good,A typical day serving is nothing short of eventful! I have learned more about how to deal with the public and make people enjoy their time eating than with this job. My management team was spectacular! They were easy to talk to and very understanding people. Work place culture was always upbeat and fun! The hardest part of my job is people but it is also the most enjoyable part. People propose a challenge that is rewarding and prompts social growth.
good,I loved working at Cracker Barrel. Everyone was nice. The food was good. The job wasn't hard. Good discounts were given to employees. Overall my favorite place I have worked.
good,"Very friendly! Makes you feel like you're at home, good food and very professional.. You also learn more stuff, good pay and nice guests. And you can do a lot of different things there."
good,"The management was phenomenal. They really cared about you as a person, your life, as well as making sure you did your job right. There was a time for joking and a time for business and the two were balanced very well. "
good,"Great partnership with other managers, team leading with great crew members. A place to really develop leadship in and out. I have grown so much from Cracker Barrel from a team member to a outstanding business leader."
good,One of the best companies that I have ever worked for. The atmosphere is great to work in. There is flexible scheduling and excellent pay and benefits. Great place overall.
good,Working at Cracker Barrel was a very enjoyable working experience and all of the co-workers were very helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with the customers.
good,"i loved doing hostess work it was cool talking with guest while waiting for a table to become available, i learned theres always other ways to do what u need to get done in the time u need it done. everyone loves to eat here on thanksgiving!! that was the busiest day i had worked in my time working there. before i left i was fixing to be trained to serve."
good,Best place I ever worked. Flexible hours great pay and fun peolle. I regret leaving this place. I would recommend this to anyone interested on applying
good,Work was everything you could want out of a first job the management did their job making sure others were on point with being a people pleaser. I loved it and the people starting off seasonal was the perfect amount of hours and an experience i'l never forget.
good,"- great place to work at if you enjoy people"
good,"This was a very hard job, physically, for me.  I was able though in the 12 years that I was there to work myself up from a server to an associate manager.  I think this company is great for someone looking to advance themselves and put the work in required to make it happen."
good,Good people hard. Working people just not enough money for me in this job everybody nice really good food this job would. Be good for a teenager
good,"good people to work with,great place to work,good magement,great bosses. Fun place to work.good environment,great food,great server,nice and clean kitchen area"
good,"In a typical work day, I come in contact with many guests. Many guests are regular, meaning they come in often enough to be on a first name basis. I have learned many unique facts about each guest, and in doing so I can create a better experience for them while they dine and shop. My managers are wonderful to be around, where we work together to make the guests' experience the best they have ever had in a restaurant. My co-workers and I are incredibly close, where we help each other with many tasks, such as I have taken drink orders for a server, and in return, the server has cleaned off high chairs for me. The hardest part of the job is quoting estimate times on waits, where most of the time I can quote accurately, but there are times where guests tend to sit longer than usual, creating a bottle-neck in waits. The most enjoyable part of my job would be my regular guests. I look forward to my guests, especially the ones that I have built a relationship with."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"I enjoyed working here for the most part. Great management, good people, fun environment. There wasn't really anything I didn't dislike other than that after a while doing nothing but dishes got boring."
good,"Such a great company to work for and be apart of."
good,"Fast-paced environment with committed team members and guests. Enjoyable, up-beat work environment. Advancement opportunities at every level. Job security in a well-established company. Personal and professional development."
good,I enjoy working here because the staff get along very well the managers treat us well. we work but make it fun making the day go by smoother. Mostly everyone there is genuinely kind and caring
good,"Typically worked during the busier shifts with upbeat employees. Able to make a positive impact on customers. Enjoyed the hands-on interaction with customers, employees, and management."
good,"It was a hard job, but most waitressing is. If you worked hard, you got good tips. Coworkers were nice, management was fair, but the hourly pay wasn't always enough to pay the bills. The hardest part and the most enjoyable part were probably the customers."
good,I prepare food follow all safety and sanitation policies assist co-worker in the kitchen. Cracker Barrel is a family and a nice place to eat at when you good service and get a home cook meal just the way you like it for right price.
good,Sales and Services  I enjoyed the people from all over the world ... I enjoyed the ladies I worked with but I really wanted to get more into the health field.
good,great place to work. always exciting doing new things. I enjoyed seeing all the new items that we sold in the retail store. I very much enjoyed setting up displays and working with a great bunch of people
good,I have worked at cracker barrel for 6 years. Great place to work with even better money making potential. We have a great team that and the managers are awesome. My only concern would be that the management team is not always on one accord.
good,Love this job.  People have worked there for 15 and 17 years.... Which says a lot.  The only drawback is that I can only get 30 hours per week and most of the time I only get 25 or 26.
good,Great learning experience taught me a great deal of responsibilty. my manager was very hands on and helped with any question or conceren i had. the enviroment is very comfortable and welcoming for customers and workers. It was my first job and i enjoyed it
good,After training you find yourself with friendly smiles and great managers. After 30 days you will have a small raise! The growth in pay is a great reason to apply or stay at Cracker Barrel.
good,I love my co-workers here and managers. I would love to stay there just aren't enough hours available for all the employees they have hired.
good,"Although the pay was not great, the benefits and work environment were worth it to me at the time. I worked at Cracker Barrel for two years. One year in Bloomington, IN, one year in Ocala, FL. I was hired as a cashier, transferred to Ocala as a cashier, but was soon offered a position in retail. Shortly after, I was promoted to Merchandise Handler. Management was always wonderful. Advancement opportunities were available. Raises were regular. Everyone is treated fairly. Reviews are given regularly. Employees are recognized for their strengths, but were given goals and areas to improve, as well. I can honestly say I had fun working there and miss it! If it wasn't for the pay, I might still be there today! I made lifelong friends working at CB. The hardest part of the job might have been suggestively selling retail items, but it was REALLY easy!! I loved creating, straightening, and stocking displays, organizing the stock room, wrapping presents, and helping the cashiers. The longer you've been there, the more benefits you get! When I was there, you had to work a minimum of 24 hours a week to get their very reasonably priced health insurance, too!"
good,"cracker barrel is pretty friendly the people try their hardest at the work they do such an positive enviorement, it gets hard sometimes and itll get frustrating but im happy to make to make money and i never wanted to give little effort."
good,"I have been in the restaurant business long enough to know what to expect.  Cracker Barrel is a fair company; has strict guidelines for employees and pays very well."
good,good work at steady pace finish on time team work very  friendly lifting very heavy barrels getting my job completed I want to take on a new challenge do something different this is a good company to work for I was very dependable I didn't take any time off from work I take proud into my work and do a good job
good,"The title says it all. This is a very good place to work, and I definitely like it. It has good managers, very nice pay, and very good benefits."
good,"As a server there is no such thing as a typical day at work,everyday brings something new. Our mangers instruct us how to deal with each and every situation the best way possible to ensure that we keep our guests happy at all times. We have a great group of people working together, everyone helps each other and is there for each other. Cracker Barrel is big on team work and it shows, there is almost never a time that help is not there when you need it. One of the hardest things about being a server is having to keep your guests happy when thing aren't going their way and most of the time there are things going on that we don't know about or have no control over, but we still do the best we can. We give them what they ask for, we give them a warm smile, and show them that we do care that they are unhappy and we will do all that we can to fix that. What I enjoy most about working at Cracker Barrel are the people that I work with and the goals and values of the company. When things get hard during our peak hours, everyone is running around trying to get what they need for their tables, but if help is needed anyone will stop what they are doing to help a fellow coworker."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,I love working at Cracker Barrel. The customers and management are the best. The food is great and they have flexible hours
good,"The management team was wonderful. My co workers were fun. The money was okay (could have been better), but all in all cracker barrel is a great place to work. The general manager is a very caring person who looks out for his employees and  is consistent among all workers.. He even said that he would rehire me if I ever decided to go back."
good,Cracker Barrel is a family friendly company and works hard to make customers and associates happy.  They are well structured and organized down to the green beans.
good,The only problem that I had with working there is that I only go 8 hours a week. I could not afford to stay there. I love the company. I love everything that they stand for.
good,"I came here for a part time job after the loss of my husband. The schedule is perfect for me. My manager is excellent and the retail shop is run very well. My Co workers are very helpful. I could have had more training in the physical aspects of the job, but that's pretty common in retail. I hope to be here for a long time."
good,Greet all guests and provide great customer service. I learned a lot about being part of a team and all of my co workers were great. Overall a great place to work.
good,"A typical day at Cracker Barrel consisted of greeting and seating guests, interacting with customers and co workers, training new hostess and helping servers and management maintain an organized and clean dinning room."
good,I love getting to interact with my guest and love having regulars.
good,"The things I learned were to put others need first aside from myself."
good,I loved working here even though it was for a short amount of time. I quit because I was living in Orange at the time and the pay was not working out with the drive from Orange to Beaumont everyday.
good,"Typical day at work would be so much fun! My shifts were usually night shifts and weekends. Cracker barrel is a very busy place so you get to meet lots of people from all over the world. My team was a great one, and we saw ourselves as family! I loved this job and my management team. They were understanding of my schedule and what hours i needed. The best part about working for this company was that i made life long friends, and i have a place to call home if i ever needed to go back."
good,"•	Accomplish restaurant human resource objectives by recruiting, selecting, orienting, training, scheduling, coaching, counseling, and disciplining employees; communicating job expectations; monitoring, appraising, and reviewing job contributions; enforcing policies and procedures for 145+ employees."
good,All of the employee's were helpful and fun to work with. Pleasing the guest on how well I served them and kept them satisfied.
good,"I go in, I start setting up for my shift & make sure there is enough tea made & coffee and make sure my tables are cleaned. I learn how to be a better server each day I work. The management is awesome, they are there when you need them & is willing to accommodate to the guests needs. Co-workers are great, love the team work we have when working together. The hardest part is knowing if your guest is having an amazing experience or not. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people & having the guests leave very happy with their experience at Cracker Barrel."
good,"Wonderful place to work, and you get to meet great people everyday."
good,People just are not tippers these days that's all that is bad.
good,"I loved this job! Fast paced, I stayed busy at all times, never a dull or boring moment. Every day was consistent, but with just enough change to keep me on my toes and paying attention at all times. I prepared and cooked (according to management) approximately 3/4 of the food served, and also managed the bread most days. I learned more and more about food preparation, safety, and different tips and tricks to make things cook faster and/or better. There are set recipes to be followed for everything, and the day's duties were prepared by management before I came in, ready for me to start right away. My managers were great- they stay involved, ensuring proper communication among all employees, and helping wherever needed. Everyone I worked with was great and worked hard, also helping wherever needed. The whole restaurant is like a home, it's employees family. Overall a great team that works together to achieve the same goal- making and keeping guests satisfied. The hardest part of the job was remembering the different special dishes for different days. The most enjoyable part of the job was cooking all day."
good,"Cracker Barrel is just not a job. It is a place to learn and to make friends. Their standards are very high."
good,"It is a wonderful and fulfilling place if you are willing to work for it.  It's very hard work, its very demanding....but once you get a routine, its easy.  A manager MUST have a grasp on how sales can effect EVERYTHING, b/c it does.  Its a lot of employees to direct at any given time and it will take any green manager a few months to understand the Whole Picture."
good,It was a great place to work! Getting to know the guests who come and making sure they have the best experience they can possibly have!
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.
good,"everyone showed pride in his or her work, everyone helped each other"
good,"I have been working here for 3 weeks as a hostess and have already got a 3 dollar raise. It was a merit raise by the district manager because he seen how hard I worked. It pays to work hard, literally! After 30 days you get your first raise by ""parring"" up. In my case, my second raise. :) and 3 more raises afterwards. And you can receive merit raises on top of that!"
good,As someone right out of highschool I loved this job! The pay was based on how well I did my job since it was pretty much just tips. Hard labor and on your feet all day but it taught me a lot about being a hard worker and keeping a smile on my face.
good,"Always busy never slow time due to flow of guests entering restaurant. Learned many new technics, enjoyed learning from training team upon Cracker Barrel opening. Co-workers some worked well together some refused to and were fired by management. Was forced to leave due to manager at time."
good,"Cracker Barrel is more like a family than a business. They take care of there employees. There are bad apples in every bunch, but overall this is a great job, especially for students."
good,Awesome place to work for. The management when i was working there was great as was my fellow coworkers.
good,"I learned the importance of hard-working, all of the co-workers were funny, cool and nice."
good,"All the coworkers are great and its a great place to work."
good,"I actually enjoyed all my jobs over the years in Michigan and Naples. I have only had good experiences and a challenge doing the variety of things I have done and accomplished so far in my life, I am always open to start a new position and do new things.I have a good work record and hardly missed a day unless I was really sick which was not often.I learned alot over the years dealing with different management requirements,all types of co-workers some that worked hard and others that hardly worked at all but those kind of workers are weeded out right away by management.The hardest part of any job is living up to managements expectations and having a goal and exceeding it and I was one of the best at sales at almost all my jobs and received gifts at some jobs and raises at others. The thing I loved most about all my jobs was setting a goal and achieving it, and also I enjoyed the people and customer service."
good,"The store can be very busy at times, while very quiet at others with little to no guests. Co-workers are all friendly and the management is very understanding although they an be rude at times. The company seems to be much more compassionate about family issues and will help if you or your family needs it. Treating all guest equally and fair is very much stressed. The value of our guest is also stressed and expected to be upheld. The hardest part of the job is finding things to do during our slow hours and having too much to do during our hours of high capacity. The enjoyable part of this job is getting to know the guest and being apart of the Cracker Barrel family"
good,The staff and coworkers all work together as team.  It is a very enjoyable work enviroment
good,"A typical day at work consisted of collecting payments and taking the initiative to help other areas of the restaurant when needed. Management was always easy to approach with any concerns, and they were prompt to correct any negative action. My co-workers were fun and friendly, but always on task. The hardest part of the job was keeping track of many things at once, but I also found it to be the most enjoyable part. I always felt very accomplished when my co-workers and I would make it through a busy time of day without any problems."
good,The company really was a good one to work for. The co-workers were more like family. The hardest part of the job was keeping up when were extremely busy during the holiday seasons.
good,"Come in to work everyone greets you with a smile and a ""Hello"". Learned how to do dishes and do them quickly. Had great co workers. They really made it fun to be working. The most enjoyable thing at this job I would have to say is the friends I have made."
good,Everyone was so professional about their position and loved the way everything was easily learned.
good,I loved serving at Cracker Barrel . My co workers made it a great friendly place to work regardless of hard times like not getting food out opn time for whatever reason the managers still managed to keep the team together and we enjoyed laughter. it was AWESOME. A typical day would start off slow not too many customers then in 2 hours we would be swamped taking orders getting food out on time making sure the order is correct and the guest are satisfied and comfortable as they eat.
good,"Cracker Barrel definitely knows how to keep employees happy, and happy employees mean happier customers. You are treated as a member of the family from the first day. As you progress through the ranking system, you are given raises and a new apron, giving you incentive to work hard and dedicate yourself to the company. I learned how to manage a lot of the incoming food into the store, as well as analyzing plan-o-grams in order to shift displays in the way that the corporate office wanted. The hardest part of the job was trying to balance very time consuming classes on top of a 30+ hours/week schedule; however, as difficult as it was, I enjoyed every minute of it. It is a great company to work for, and I was very happy there."
good,"A typical day at Cracker Barrel Old Country Store is always full with smiles and happy customers. We do our best to make sure that our guests are comfortable, and overall satisfied with our efforts to put them first. As hostess, my job is to greet the customer, script our ""feature of the day"" (exp. Turkey n’ Dressing) one of my favorites, and sit our guests in a timely manner. Our managers are always aware of what is going around them. There is constant communication between hostess, managers, waitresses, waiters, and most importantly kitchen. Personally the most difficult part of this job, are the hours, but it is like everything; You get used to it eventually. The most enjoyable, and fulfilling part of the job would be that you actually are a part of a team, and you make your guests happy along the way."
good,"High valume resturant, went smoothly with a great team, Treating every guest with great customer service and identifying guest needs. Management was just like most places promoting hourly goals and guest first. It was definitly a challenge insuring that guest get exactly what they are expecting when their food comes, you can't please everyone but you can surely accomidate them in any way that will make a guest happier, if they are unhappy. It is always a great experiance when you have a guest compliment you for your hard work and great service, which usually reminds you of why you enjoy having the job working with the public and customer service."
good,Its a nice place to work shifts are short. Customers are nice. There is a lot of teamwork that fosters a fun work environment.Management treats employees fair and honest.

good,"Great place to work. Very fast paced. The typical day would be a lot of business coming in and out of the restaurant. I would wait on many different people. I would serve, prep, and run food throughout the shift. The people I work with are friendly and my GM is great to work for."
good,"It was an excellent place to work. Seeing all the families come in to have country home cooked food was so amazing. Everyday sitting people and making sure they have a wonderful experience was priceless. The management was fantastic and they expressed the importance of making guest happy by team work, friendly smiles, and a clean environment."
good,It was great to be a server. Every day it was something new and I was able to meet many interesting people. I learned to be organized so that I could accurately place orders and make customers happy. I also learned how to train other people in what it meant to Cracker Barrel to be customer oriented. The hardest part of the job was keeping up when it was really busy and we were understaffed. But the benefits out weighed that and I was able to work with really great people.
good,"This company is ALL about pleasing people. Not only their customers, but their employees as well. The company provides continuing education to allow their employees to advance within the company. Always flexible with scheduling for students and single parents"

good,They treat everybody equally and a great place to work and I love everything that I do at my job and they are always using team work to get any job done if it's a difficult task
good,Serving customers and learning from every experience to integrate what I learned into the next family or person I serve. The goal is to gain repeat business and increase revenue. The management continuously offers a fun fast place to work. The biggest challenge is when we run out of food or inventory to serve our customers because their experience is less than what is desired.

I better personal skills and guest hospitality. The management was constantly changing yet I never found a problem with any of my managers. There was a new server fairly consistently. The hardest part of the job was being hungry all the time due to looking at delicious food all day. I enjoyed dealing with multiple people on a personal level while making money."

Half of the time the food is great and half is not.  Breakfast is always an issue.  The eggs are usually undercooked and runny or over cooked.  The bacon is usually way undercooked even though I ask for crispy. Then when I send it back, it comes back hard as a rock.  Be careful when ordering bacon and eggs.  Lunch and dinner are usually fine.  Just sometimes the sides are cold.  It's unfortunate because I like the food, I just know that I will have to complain about something."

good,Great company as long as you do your job there are no issues! you got in and there are side work that each person is assigned and other than that you do your job help everyone!

good,"Any restaurant business is going to be busy! What's special about Cracker Barrel is the fact that your coworkers and superiors genuinely care about you and are willing to help when needed. I felt like I gained a second family while working there. Unfortunately due to certain circumstances, my employment ended very quickly."
good,"Be prepared to be on your feet! The customer is always right, so if you are an individual who likes to please people, this is the right job for you. You will make long-lasting friendships with coworkers."
good,"At the Cracker Barrel, I worked the overnight shift. The store and restaurant was closed and open an hour before my shift would end. During the week (Sun-Thurs), I was generally alone, but on the weekends, two of us work together because there was much more that needed to be done."
good,I definely recommendation Cracker Barrel as a job to anyone who is willing to work and likes fast paced environment. If your friendly and light on your feet you will make excellent money.

good,I loved an miss my job it was great good people customers were great i liked waitressing better then dishwasher but it wasnt bad i loved the managers an everyone there
good,"A typical day at Cracker barrel would be when arriving make sure that everything is stocked and prepared for the day. Once the day is started make sure that to greet everyone that walks in the doors, when on the floor make sure that you help customers with their shopping needs making sure to ask if needing assistance or having any questions. I learned while working at Cracker Barrel that every person that walks in should be treated with incredible customer service, your not there just to wait on them and walk around but engage with the customer about how their meal was or compliment on their outfit it is all about the Customer Experience, management while working at Cracker Barrel in Madisonville Ky, I don't believe you could ask for a better management team. With Cracker Barrel there never seemed to be an issue with culture everyone is treated with the same respect. The hardest part of the job is if you do not have time management skills that could be the hardest part of the job, or if it is a slower day within the store finding what all can be done. The most enjoyable is getting to speak and talk to the customers getting to know them and asking how their overall experience was. My favorite part of my job that I miss the most is getting to see the customers and getting to speak with them and catch up with them if it has been a while since I had last seen them."
good,Working at cracker barrel as my first serving job was very stressful but once I got into the beat of things it smoothed out a lot after I learned the ropes!
good,Very fun place to work. Being open from 6 to 10 or 11 definitely allows for more flexibility in scheduling. Overall great place to start a career and great place to make a career out of.
good,"Cracker Barrel was my first serving job and I'm very grateful for the organized training the corporation provides. After training, managers keep employees on-track as well as cooperating with and taking care of employees, and I really saw how a server is important to making a restaurant work well. Big culture of teamwork and responsibility. My full-time coworkers received health benefits and paid vacation, and I worked with people who had been promoted or planned to seek promotions to training coordinator, manager, or corporate positions. Excellent company. However, I worked at a regional store that trains beginning managers from the tri-state area, and they were almost invariably rude. Tips were always cashed out at the end of the shift and on Sunday mornings I would always leave with a wad of cash."

good,"My typical day starts by organizing my work area in preparation for our rush hour (usually 10 AM and 12 PM). I have learned how to have patience and deal with guests that don't appreciate what you're doing for them. The management is great, and there is great diversification culture-wise. The hardest part of the job is dealing with guests who give you a hard time because you tell them there is a wait. The most enjoyable part of the job would be interacting with guests who truly appreciate what you do for them."

good,"I loved working here a lot but had to leave for school. Everyone who worked there was friendly and supportive. Everyone worked together to make it a great experience. As a host I got a little overwhelmed sometimes though, because of the fast paced environment. Since it is a big-chain restaurant it is pretty popular, therefore very busy most of the time."

good,I have been working for less than an a year as an host and I think it is an outstanding job. I have had no trouble with my managers or any other employees. If you try to do what your managers tell you to do you should have no problem I would highly recommend Cracker Barrel. If you host make sure you seat in rotation and you should have no problem with the servers.
good,"Very strict about organizing and cleaning. Takes consideration of a employees work ethic, makes the most out of the timing in it's work hours, and very clean environmentally."
good,"I just stared employment at Cracker Barrel and everything is what I thought it would be. There is room for growth and if you plan to move up, it is possible. It is a team oriented restaurant, where everyone helps one another. The managers are hands on and if you need help they are there to help you. They offer 401k after 90 days, which is great because most restaurants that I have previously worked for didn't except for one. Overall, so far so good!"

good,"Very fast paced work environment.  As a server you need to be able to keep up, learn the menu and multitask.  Very fair pay and awesome management. Awesome advancement opportunities, but there is somewhat of a cap on how much you can really bring in as far as tips.  People are typically there to eat fairly quick and don't usually spend enough or tip enough to make it the best paying serving job.  Tips ranged from 40-120 for 4-6 hour shifts."

good,I have to clean the place and help out with dishes when needed. The pay is good and fair but I have debts that need to be paid. It is nice place if you want to be a manager in this place. they have much to offer and are very employee centered. Cleaning is a full time job that needs to be done every day and the employees there are nice and work at different paces but the business dictates the work day. when busy they are all running around to give great customer service experience to the customers. If you like to work and keep busy then  this a job for you.

In the three years that i've worked there, I learned public speaking skills, time management skills, and i also found my passion. I have a passion for people. I love the fact that i have the ability to help someone with the knowledge that i currently have. Just being a blessing to someone made me feel even better about myself."
good,"Great Company To work for!  The company encourages growth.  Although it was a great company to work for, you need to be very hands on as a manager.  The company does encourage vacation and time off."

I liked the fact that every day when I went into work I knew what to expect."

good,"A typical day at work was to clock in and go to the grill line. See what needed to be stocked and if there were any orders that needed cooked. The hardest thing about the job was the menu. It was a challenge, and it was also the most enjoyable part of the job. Management was skilled and understood. They always encouraged my skill expansion. I learned how to cook a higher volume."
good,All of the employees and managers were nice and helped each other. The work environment was happy and fun even during stressful time periods. Overall a great place to work.
good,"It's a great place to work. The team is professional, but caring. As long as you do your best to achieve guest satisfaction and keep a professional attitude with coworkers job security is a given. The work is routine most of the time, but can be demanding.
